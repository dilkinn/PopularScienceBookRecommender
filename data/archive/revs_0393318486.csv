0,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3593962-kalliope,4,"This morning while swimming I thought of this book. And I thought also of a conversation I had recently with a friend. We were talking about human consciousness.Swimming is a perfect thing to do when thinking about consciousness. While sliding along the water we are deprived of many things, in particular of the full powers of our senses. There is very little to hear; smellandtaste are also kept at bay; what we can look at is reduced to a wall and a straight line on the floor of the pool; and the pleasant and refreshing water assuages our touch. So, even if we stop being ourselves since we are not in our natural medium, we can however only be ourselves. Consciousness runs galore.I actually read this book a while ago, and I did so also some time after I interrupted my studies in neurobiology. I had to stop because of personal reasons. But I remember two things clearly about this book.The first is that It was an excellent summary of what was known about the brain when the book was published, and which I had been studying in more detailed textbooks. Alas, I have not kept with further advances, but my guess is that it is still a very relevant read today.The study is very well structured as a survey of the various considerations on how the mind works, and it is written in a very engaging style. It is also engaging because it addresses our immediate and commonsensical concerns about how our mind works. Why we forget, how do we recognize faces, what falling in love may entail, what it is to laugh.. etc.The best part was the chapter on vision, may be because to me that is one of the most magical powers of our brain. How it can process what our light detecting organs perceive, and create vision in its rear part is a phenomenon that defies our senses.Pinker does not deal with language in this book because he devoted another book, The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Languagewhich I have not read yet. He designed them to complement each other.The second thing I remember is the conclusion. After examining scientifically the various abilities of the brain, Pinker finally gets to the idea of Consciousness, the most perplexing aspect of the brain. But then he gives up and admits that our human capacities are unable to understand how consciousness has come to be, nor what it is. He proposes that probably only an entity with higher abilities than those of our brain would be able to look down upon human Consciousness and understand what it is (does he mean a god, or a machine, or martians?).Of course, so far he is completely right. No one has, as yet, been able to explain Consciousness satisfactorily, and it has been approached from a myriad of fields. Is Consciousness created or has it evolved?. Is it only in our bodies, and therefore mortal, or can it transmigrate?. What is it anyway? So, the missing star is not because of what Pinker has written in this book but for its title. He does not really explain, fully, what he promises: how our mind works. In any case, I am going swimming tomorrow again, and my Consciousness is delighted with the idea, even if it does not know what it-self is."
1,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5130906-mikael-lind,2,"The book does not lack good qualities, but I generally dislike the technique of argumentation that is too often characterized by poor proof backed by a certain arrogance towards alternative explanations. The chapter on the sexes is particularly shoddily presented. The ""proof"" that Pinker refers to when trying to back his claims that (simply put) evolution and innateness alone explain the differences between the sexes when it comes to attitudes to sex (the male hunter/gatherer has logically a greater chance of spreading his genes since he doesn't have to carry the baby for nine months, and so on) is based on polls filled out by university students. That these students are also caught up in a social reality doesn't seem to have crossed Pinker's mind.Good scholars know where to draw the boundaries between science and speculation. Chomsky has said that one can learn more about human nature from reading a novel than from scientific psychology. In other words, he knows that his scientific field is limited to a certain aspect of human nature and language, and thus doesn't try to explain more than can be deducted by reasoning from the facts presented. (One can have opinions as to how successful Chomskyan linguistic science actually is, but that's another matter.) Certainly, Pinker is allowed to speculate, as is any scientist. The problem is that Pinker's speculations are sometimes presented as truths. Therefore, this book does, despite some interesting facts being presented in it, leave me with a bitter taste in my mouth."
2,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,1,"I started this, listened to 3.5 hours of the audiobook’s total of 26 and simply couldn’t imagine continuing. The first chapter (2.5 hours), which the author calls an “opening brief”, can in simple terms be seen as an introduction. This introduction was not concise; it was rambling and consisted of mundane generalizations. It did not clarify how the book would be organized nor in precise terms what the author wished to show. Nothing enticed me to continue. To better understand the field of cognitive science I am looking for a book based on solid scientific backing, not one based on speculation. I want at least a modicum of solid proof for what is being claimed, and I found not one smidgeon of that here. There was an excessive amount of criticism of other scientists’ views while at the same time the author’s own views were not made clear. I disliked the manner in which the author gave an enormous number of examples which supposedly were meant to prove the generalizations made. Many examples proved nothing. They referred to movie figures, characters in fiction, objects we use in our daily life and further generalizations about human behavior. The list of examples drowned out the statement that was to be proven. Even in the first introductory chapter there were statements made the validity of which can be debated. We are told that humans today no longer worry about robots / computer programs being made that function better than man. That is not true! In the news recently was a debate about the inequitable use of artificial intelligence programs. So I finished the unwieldy, long-winded, empty first introductory chapter and moved on to the second. Before quitting the book I wanted to check if perhaps the style of writing altered. It did not. The narration by Mel Foster started off too fast, but I got used to it. At one point I set the speed down to 75%, and that was too slow! Sentences become distorted. In a book such as this a listener needs time to consider what is being said so they can themselves evaluate what they are being told. The rambling, chatty writing style, the multitude of generalizations and the lack of both conclusive evidence and scientific backing are not what I am looking for. If I do not want to read a book, this says clearly that I did not like that which I read. I am giving this one star."
3,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a truly comprehensive treatment of the human mind. Pinker delves deeply into the reasons why the mind has evolved to make decisions in the way it does. There is very little discussion about the biology of the brain; the book points out that a good understanding of the origins of human behavior requires descriptions at a higher level--at the level of the mind, and how it evolved through natural selection. Pinker shows how natural selection has worked its way into every nook and cranny of the mind ... absolutely fascinating. Every chapter goes into great detail about how our belief system developed, our vision, our reasoning abilities, our family structures, and our emotions. Pinker describes how our minds are similar to computers and neural networks, and how they are different. I've read other books by Pinker, and they are all great. Highly recommended to every human with a mind!"
4,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1447864-joshua-nomen-mutatio,5,"I think this a great way of addressing a widespread misunderstanding about genetics, biological evolution and human thought & behavior.Slight background story: I was having a discussion with a guy on goodreads.com within his comments on his review of Why I Am Not A Muslim and eventually it came to this:Myself: ""It’s a categorical mistake to think this about biological evolution. To put it bluntly: our genes are selfish, but we are not (not necessarily, unconditionally so at least).""Him: ""One last question, so how are we different than our genes?""And my reply and the whole point of this post:This may sound mean, but it’s simple. You are not a gene, nor am I. We’re animals, unique and beautiful and ugly and all qualities in between, both as a species and as individuals.Here’s an explanation though:""But almost everyone misunderstands this theory. Contrary to popular belief, the gene-centered theory of evolution does not imply that the point of all human striving is to spread our genes. With the exception of the fertility doctor who artificially inseminated patients with his own semen, the donor to the sperm bank for Nobel Prize winners, and other kooks, no human being (or animal) strives to spread his or her genes. Dawkins explained the theory in a book called The Selfish Gene, and the metaphor was chosen carefully. People don’t selfishly spread their genes, genes selfishly spread themselves. They do it by the way they build our brains. By making us enjoy life, health, sex, friends, and children, the gene buys a lottery ticket for representation in the next generation, with odds that were favorable in the environment in which we evolved. Our goals are subgoals of the ultimate goal of the genes, replicating themselves. But the two are different. As far as we are concerned, our goals, conscious or unconscious, are not about genes at all, but about health and lovers and children and friends.""That seems to be enough to get the point across, but I think this is such a good point that I’ll type the next paragraph up as well:""The confusion between our goals and genes’ goals has spawned one muddle after another. A reviewer of a book about the evolution of sexuality protests that human adultery, unlike the animal equivalent, cannot be a strategy to spread genes because adulteres take steps to prevent pregancy. But whose strategy are we talking about? Sexual desire is not people’s strategy to progagate their genes. It’s people’s strategy to attain the pleasures of sex, and the pleasures of sex are the genes strategy to propagate themselves. If the genes don’t get propagated, it’s because we are smarter than they are. A book on the emotional life of animals complains that if altruism according to biologists is just helping kin or exchanging favors, both of which serve the interests of one’s genes, it would not really be altruism after all, but some kind of hypocrisy. This too is a mix up. Just as blueprints don’t necessarily specify blue buildings, selfish genes don’t necessarily specify selfish organisms. As we shall see, sometimes the most selfish thing a gene can do is build a selfless brain. Genes are a play with in a play, not the interior monologue of the players.""-Steven Pinker, How The Mind Works, pp. 43-44Also, for anyone interested in listening to the audiobook version:http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list...The reader sounds like one of those prototypical 1950's or 60's educational film narrators. It works pretty well."
5,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4350004-josh-hamacher,3,"I finally finished this book. It took me far longer than I care to admit to do so. On at least one occasion I lost interest and put it down for several weeks before coming back to it.I have a hard time putting my finger on exactly why this was the case. It's not that it's bad - in fact, parts of it are absolutely fascinating. It's certainly not the writing; Pinker is quite good (despite a tendency to repeat himself frequently).I think it boiled down to two things for me, with both of them being closely related (and maybe even the same):1. Organization. This is a 565-page book with only eight chapters. Each chapter is almost a short book on its own, divided into many sections. While a common theme ties together each chapter the sections are often quite divergent. It was hard to maintain momentum when moving from one section to another that seemed only tangentially related.2. Breadth. The subject is the human mind, providing practically infinite material. I think for anyone there would be parts that are interesting and parts that aren't.Having said that, I still recommend this book."
6,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13162061-amirography,5,"This book was an amazing read!I cannot get around the fact that it was written by one person, let alone one person with a lot of other books on the same topic, and yet more provocative each time. I loved the detailed and comprehensive outlook on each subject matter.It is not a textbook, It is a long essay that gives you a rational, up-to-date, coherent, general yet accurate, A frame for thinking about mind, cognition, and emotions, and also changes our day-to-day worldview about people in general.""The only complaint I have is that this book could have used more hierarchical structure."
7,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,5,"This is a very readable and influential synthesis of the cognitive science view of the mind with that of evolutionary psychology. The overall thrust is that the mind is a neural computer closely governed by feelings and desires that were shaped by natural selection for their adaptive value in the hunter-gatherer lifestyle of our ancestors. The book is lively, with lots of down to earth examples. He holds your hand when wading through many technical subjects, faces disputes in a non-dogmatic way, and addresses political spins on scientific matters in a forthright way.The heft and scope of the volume is daunting. Yet it is written to be accessible to the general reader as well as scholars. As the emphasis is on synthesis and not a unifying novel theory of mind dependent on the cohesion of all its parts, I feel that the average reader could benefit from reading only the chapters of interest to them. There are sections on visual perception, neural network modeling, passionate emotions, social behaviors, and cultural innovations. As with Wilson’s “Sociobiology”, many readers will be interested in what he has to say about biological roots of human violence, sexual behavior, family values, and the arts. This includes accounts of adaptive values for lying, self delusion, war, mass murder, rape, pornography, parent-child and sibling conflict, altruism, love, marriage, and friendship. Particularly fascinating is his coverage of the cross-cultural phenomenon of people going “amok” and tie-in with the “doomsday machine” theory of passionate emotions, the adaptive value of which lies in their service as “guarantors of threats and promises”. He makes a good argument that thinking conforms to a kind of language, or mentalese, with categorical, syntactical, and generative properties aligned with Chomsky’s conceptions. He places a big emphasis on the role of beliefs and desires in his perspective on the core properties of human intellect. He doesn’t hold out much hope in the explanatory potential of neuroscience, considering models at that level an inadequate reductionism: ""Even if neuroscientists someday decode the entire wiring diagram of the brain, human behavior makes the most sense when it was explained in terms of beliefs and desires, not in terms of volts and grams. Physics provides no insight into the machinations of a crafty lawyer, and even fails to enlighten us about many simpler acts of living things."" I agree that explanations at the level physics will not help understand the mind, but I feel hopeful that neuroscience can make much progress in merging biological and psychological models. As this book was written in 2007, it misses the neurological synthesis of the computational and emotional aspects of the mind achieved by Damasio in his 2009 book and the decade of great ferment in cognitive neuroscience due to studies using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging.No matter how much it looks like he is on the pathway to biological determinism for so many “bad” human behaviors, he takes great pains to dissociate our inherited mental equipment from our systems of moral responsibility and vision of equal rights: ""To understand is not to forgive"". For example, understanding a human tendency to revile other cultures does not excuse the Holocaust. Biological determinism for even liberal values can be misguided, e.g. “The argument against persecuting gay people must be made not in terms of the gay gene or the gay brain but in terms of people’s right to engage in private consensual acts without discrimination or harassment.” In the case of the male tendency to mate with any women they can, even to the point of rape, rather than agreeing with one of his students that the key conclusion is that “Men are slime!”, he feels they still should be swayed by morality: “If … men are especially tempted to commit certain crimes against women, the implication is that deterrents should be surer and more severe, not that the crimes are somehow less odious.” Pinker further argues that environmental determinism is just as unfruitful. He feels feminists’ stance against discrimination and oppression of women can do without the position that their origin lies in brainwashing of children and youth by media, pornography, and child rearing and educational practices.A refreshing aspect of Pinker’s book is that he makes very little claim to explaining free will and sentience. He also places a lot of advanced cultural accomplishments of humans, such as art, humor, and religion in a category of having no likely evolutionary adaptive value. He suspects that these capacities are “along for the ride” and that “human brains evolved by one set of laws, those of natural selection and genetics, and now interact with one another according to another set of laws, those of cognitive and social psychology, human ecology, and history”."

Here is an example of a typical quotation from this book that i could only follow if i were drunk: ""The cobalt 60 nucleus is said to spin counterclockwise if you look down on its north pole, but that description by itself is circular because 'north pole' is simply what we call the end of the axis from which a rotation looks counterclockwise."" This is in the middle of a discussion, in which he puts down Richard Feynman, and concludes ""God is not ambidextrous after all."" I feel that Pinker presents his material in an annoyingly obtuse way and may be drinking when he writes. LOL"

10,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4361083-erwin,4,"Very interesting. 20-30 years from now, I think most people will understand that there's nothing ""magical"" about the ""mind"", the ""soul"", religion, art, men, women, or any of the other sacred cows that continue to hold back humans from understanding themselves.How the Mind Works was published back in 1997, but I didn't encounter any of the points that Pinker made in High School or Collage, up until 2000. Pinker focuses on a ""computational theory of mind"", saying that the mind is a complex parallel information processing system.Of course Pinker doesn't have the ""final word"" on How the Mind Works, but he provides more evidence, more insight, and more rationality than the ""romantics"" and their leaders Freud Sigmund 1856-1939 Sigmund and Carl Jung.Pinker continues on many of the themes here in The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature.Unfortunately for Americans, Political Correctness seems to be a barrier to accurately seeing human nature, as human nature necessarily is different for different groups of people, particularly for men and women.My favorite anecdote is about the ""Coolidge effect"": … an old joke about Calvin Coolidge when he was President … The President and Mrs. Coolidge were being shown [separately] around an experimental government farm. When [Mrs. Coolidge] came to the chicken yard she noticed that a rooster was mating very frequently. She asked the attendant how often that happened and was told, “Dozens of times each day.” Mrs. Coolidge said, “Tell that to the President when he comes by.” Upon being told, President asked, “Same hen every time?” The reply was, “Oh, no, Mr. President, a different hen every time.” President: “Tell that to Mrs. Coolidge.”Pinker explains the mind by ""reverse-engineering"" it—figuring out what natural selection designed it to accomplish in the environment in which we evolved. The mind, he writes, is a system of ""organs of computation"" that allowed our ancestors to understand and outsmart objects, animals, plants, and each other.How the Mind Works explains many of the imponderables of everyday life. Why does a face look more attractive with makeup? How do ""Magic-Eye"" 3-D stereograms work? Why do we feel that a run of heads makes the coin more likely to land tails? Why is the thought of eating worms disgusting? Why do men challenge each other to duels and murder their ex-wives? Why are children bratty? Why do fools fall in love? Why are we soothed by paintings and music? And why do puzzles like the self, free will, and consciousness leave us dizzy?This arguments in the book are as bold as its title. Pinker rehabilitates unfashionable ideas, such as that the mind is a computer and that human nature was shaped by natural selection. And he challenges fashionable ones, such as that passionate emotions are irrational, that parents socialize their children, that creativity springs from the unconscious, that nature is good and modern society corrupting, and that art and religion are expressions of our higher spiritual yearnings.

Why has the mind evolved to make decisions in the way it does? why do we really laugh at a joke? Why does a face look more attractive with makeup? Why does our brain drive us to enjoy sex? Why is the thought of eating worms disgusting? Why do paintings and music alleviate the hunger and thurst of mind? Why did we invent religion, music and art? How did these items adapt in the long run if it serves to nothing from an evolutionary perspective? ... ... ...The book covers the computational theory of mind (mind is the computational product of the brain) and evolutionary psychology. There is a very little discussion about the biology of the brain but it still ponders over human natures to explain them from the biological adaptations and  the by-product of evolution  perspectives. The book was published over 20 years ago but Pinker is an engaging writer. So, at least the connecting experience with a first-rate mind might not be frustrating :)"
12,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/965367-dawn,1,"Let's be honest. I will probably never pick up this book to finish it. I began reading this because of my book club. But, I didn't think I would finish it to begin with, and due to many circumstances, the book club will not be meeting for this book. So, I have decided to put it down as one of those books I'll never finish.I didn't like most of what I read, not due to the subject/topic, but due to the way Pinker writes. His droning on on tangents and his shoving his philosophy, which is oh so right BTW [she said dripping with sarcasm:] was too much for me. I had a hard time staying interested, which was a shame, because most sections began with promise. But Pinker would, more often than not, find a way to make the topic at hand induce heavy eyelids (or eye rolling, depending).I wanted this book to be good and thought it would be interesting, being a Bachelor of Psychology graduate myself, but no such luck. Maybe in many years, when I have more time on my hands, or less sense, I will try picking this book up again."
13,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/873838-rita-t,4,"I read all bio-determinist arguments, no matter how sound their science, as a mandate to return to the 50's - those halcyon days when men schnoockered their secretaries while women bought canned foods and tended the young. Nonetheless, I loved this book. The early chapters, especially on the computational theory of mind, are incredible. Pinker is just unbelievably detailed and the linguistic spin he brings to the discussion of cognitive development is a great dimension. The later chapters are more of the men-like-variety-women-like-providers stuff that one usually hears but nuanced and entertaining nonetheless. I enjoyed this book a lot. "

Pinker starts out by claiming that he will explain the origins of human emotions, aesthetics, and belief in the context of the latest findings of evolutionary and psychological research. He does not really succeed in doing so. It is a succession of moderately interesting research reports, linked together with a glue of neat one-liners (mostly other people's), but without really coming to a killer conclusion and indeed occasionally resorting to sheer polemic (eg on gender). The section on neural networks is particularly dull, especially as Pinker admits that living brains don't actually function that way. [return][return]I found precisely two points of interest in the book, both pretty tangential to the main thrust of the argument. First, of interest only to those who also know her, is that an old family friend is mentioned in passing on the development of children's minds. Second, of more general interest, is the observation that all cultures tend to design ornamental gardens with unconscious reference to the primeval African savannah - lawns and flowerbeds interrupted by carefully placed features. Rather a pleasing thought! This observation is not Pinker's own, but he does give pretty full citations for it which the interested reader can follow up.[return][return]I hear that Pinker's other books are better, so shall continue to look out for them though without particular enthusiasm."""
15,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1360306-joshua-stein,5,"Pinker's treatise on the naturalist mind looks like a science textbook, but the combination of computer programming and physiology laid on top of sociological metaphors and applicable understandings makes it a fantastic read. His ability to diffuse archaic arguments about the nature of the mind without appearing argumentative is what defines him as a great academic, and his ability to explain things to individuals with only a high school education (like me) is what defines him as a great writer.The assaults on the superstitions of Freud are particularly interesting, and his breaking down of the purely linguistic issue of Searle's ""Chinese Box"" problem leads you to come to the same conclusion that Pinker does as Pinker is unfolding the problem.Anyone who likes to study the nature of mind, who enjoys reading authors ranging from Dennett to Proust will like this book, and those who like to discuss the topics will find themselves better informed and far more capable of explaining things with Pinker's metaphors."

He also makes a misstatement about free will.""Sentience is not a combination of brain events or computational states.""""Free will is not a causal chain of events and states by definition.""This is frustrating because I feel like he ran a 3 minute mile but stopped just shy of the finish line!He's wrong on both counts.

21,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42189561-abu-hayat-khan,5,"there is two contending interpretation exists among academia on Darwinian Evolution: Gradualism vs Punctuated Equilibrium. they strikingly disagree on the question of “how a phenotypic trait evolves”. in gradualism (Richard Dawkins and others), any phenotype must have an Adaptive value (here the definition of ""adaptation"" is very strict, it means reproductive advantage only) i.e. a trait that increases the chance for more living offspring evolves slowly through selection pressure. on the other hand, proponent of punctuated equilibrium (Steven J Gould and other) don’t accept the idea of “adaptation”, rather they theorized something called“Exaptation”, which says that a trait may arise through natural selection for one purpose but later organism may find another way to use it which doesn’t give any survival value (i.e. doesn’t provide reproductive advantage). such traits or phenotypes are called evolutionary byproduct. Mr. Gould’s called them “Spandrel”. Spandrels of San Marco are famous for their beautiful art, but originally these spandrels were structural components of the basilica which later turned into artistic masterpieces. Unlike slow Adaptation, Exaptation happens in punctuated manner, i.e. out of sudden in the geological timescale. Epigenetics is considered to be one of the mechanisms for such punctuated evolution (please see, ""Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst"" by Robert M. Sapolsky).if we consider human mind as a phenotype that comes from an organ called the brain, and if the brain is an evolved organ through natural selection, which interpretation should we take to explain human mind? is mind adaptive? a trait that helps multiplying offspring? Or is mind exaptative, i.e. an evolutionary byproduct?in his influential book ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"", Daniel Kahneman demonstrated that human mind is by default irrational, rational thinking is a very expensive process hence turned off most of the time. instead, our brain uses shortcuts, know as heuristics or biases to solve any given situation. this line of research and academic findings tipped the view of human mind toward exaptationism. i.e. prominent view is that human mind is an evolutionary byproduct which explains why it is such irrational. in this view, it is considered that human mind was evolved to survive in predator-prey paradigm in which rational thinking would result in predation and death. our concept of art, music, language, etc is simply a byproduct of a formal survival machine called the brain. now enters Steven Pinker. Mr. Pinker argued that mind is an adaptive phenotype. so the only way to understand it is through evolutionary history not by chaos theory or reductionist physical approach. which implies that the irrational throughs are not useless at all. rather our cognition biases and irrationalities are very important to increase the change of our reproductive success. and that is exactly how human mind should work.I consider Steven Pinker and Gerard Diamond as the best two scientific writer of our time. other writers like Yuval Noah Harari, Richard Dawkins etc are popular but not even close to these two giants. in this book, Mr. Pinker destroyed exaptationism, though not without criticism. some of his descriptions just flown over my head, nonetheless, this book turns out to be the most informative book on evolution I've ever read."
22,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583387-nebuchadnezzar,3,"The title of the book should have read ""How the Mind Works (According to Steven Pinker)."" The picture he paints is not wrong, per se, but vastly overestimates the power of current cognitive modeling.There is quite a bit of good material here reviewing computational theory of mind, modularity, evolutionary psychology, and related material in cognitive science written in Pinker's usual conversational style. However, I have to hop off the bandwagon at the halfway point on this one. Sure, computational theory of mind has produced a lot of fruitful research. The mind is, to some degree, modular. The brain, like all our other organs, is shaped by evolution. My main problem is in his jump from the modularity at ""low-level"" cognition (e.g., basic sensory input, certain parts of language) posited by Jerry A. Fodor to ""massive modularity."" There are some functions that are very localized in the brain that fit with modularity, but we would expect the brain to look very different if massive modularity were true. The brain is actually very plastic with many higher-order functions that aren't strictly localized. The same thing goes for his evolutionary explanations. I will happily agree that many cognitive systems and functions are adaptive -- having eyes and a visual system is obviously beneficial! When it comes to more complex social behaviors, we're in far more speculative territory.As an introduction to cognitive science, it does present the material in an accessible way. However, it will be difficult to for the layperson to pick apart where Pinker's description is backed by solid evidence and where it lapses into questionable claims and rank speculation. There's a bit of fluff, too, especially near the end when it begins to cross over into the more overt political rambling characteristic of The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature.Fodor's The Mind Doesn't Work That Way: The Scope and Limits of Computational Psychology (http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Abstracts/Fodo...) makes for a decent corrective, though I have problems with it as well. I'm in total agreement on one point with Fodor, though: When it comes to cognitive science, we're just getting started."

24,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/772528-ben,4,"A very good book, albeit not the quickest read ever.I’ve read a few popular science books and have been disappointed when they seem to rely more on anecdote than science -- ok, fine, what I really mean is I can’t stand Malcolm Gladwell. How the Mind Works certainly feels much more solidly founded in science while still maintaining the how-science-fits-into-real-life perspective of a popular science book.It’s not a perfect book. Given the enormous breadth of the topic that Pinker is attempting to cover, it’s forgivable, but still the book does drift occasionally into generalizations that seem more a subjective (though plausible) opinion than convincing fact. Given the great complexity he describes in the lower-level workings of the human brain, I felt surprised at how often he seemed to be over-simplifying higher-level human psychology; at the the same time, of course, I did realize he couldn’t preface every sentence with, “As a generalization that obviously does’t account for all specific details, ...” All in all, it was quite a good, convincing book that felt comfortingly more bound to science than some others I’ve read."
25,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2459318-deniz-cem-nduygu,5,"So many great paragraphs that they make up for a few places where he gets lazy and spells out conventions. As the number of notes I took goes, this book is a winner; in addition to all its original content, it has the best summaries I've encountered of many complex ideas/theories. He is remarkably devastating against standart social sciences and postmodernist thinking. The book may get a little monotone in the technical chapters, but it's a must-read for anyone interested in psychology, evolution, nature-nurture debates, or mundane questions like ""Why do men and women want different things?"". (No, the differences are not ""socially constructed"".)I just wish he was more open to the meme theory; then he could be perfect."
26,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6888635-ryan,4,"In order to understand ourselves and others in a meaningful and accurate way, we need to be informed on how the human mind works. Steven Pinker lucidly explains what we can know about how the mind works and why it happens to work the way it does. The explanations he presents are supported by fascinating experiments and observations from the fields of psychology, neuroscience, biology and anthropology.Reading this book requires a fair bit of grinding, but I think that some people who persist will find it deeply rewarding and satisfying. The paradigm presented in this book is interesting."
27,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,5,"The best science writers have an understanding of the subject on which they write that is both deep and broad along with the ability to express these ideas in a way which is both clear and connects it with ideas and experiences that resonate with the general reader. Pinker is, along with Brian Greene and Sean Carroll in physics and Steve Jones and Richard Dawkins in biology, amongst the very finest of these. "
28,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david,3,"It's been years since I've read this, so I don't reliably remember all the arguments in Pinker's book. I remember finding it very interesting at the time, but since then, I've become a lot more skeptical about evolutionary psychology.I'm not actually sure that I read the whole thing, considering I can't remember much of it..."
29,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11132464-t,4,"Excellent! Had to stick with it but was really rewarding. Pinker is one of the brightest science writers, on par with Dawkins. I hope to read more books on evolutionary psychology, but for now this the clear leader on that subject."
30,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3593962-kalliope,4,"This morning while swimming I thought of this book. And I thought also of a conversation I had recently with a friend. We were talking about human consciousness.Swimming is a perfect thing to do when thinking about consciousness. While sliding along the water we are deprived of many things, in particular of the full powers of our senses. There is very little to hear; smellandtaste are also kept at bay; what we can look at is reduced to a wall and a straight line on the floor of the pool; and the pleasant and refreshing water assuages our touch. So, even if we stop being ourselves since we are not in our natural medium, we can however only be ourselves. Consciousness runs galore.I actually read this book a while ago, and I did so also some time after I interrupted my studies in neurobiology. I had to stop because of personal reasons. But I remember two things clearly about this book.The first is that It was an excellent summary of what was known about the brain when the book was published, and which I had been studying in more detailed textbooks. Alas, I have not kept with further advances, but my guess is that it is still a very relevant read today.The study is very well structured as a survey of the various considerations on how the mind works, and it is written in a very engaging style. It is also engaging because it addresses our immediate and commonsensical concerns about how our mind works. Why we forget, how do we recognize faces, what falling in love may entail, what it is to laugh.. etc.The best part was the chapter on vision, may be because to me that is one of the most magical powers of our brain. How it can process what our light detecting organs perceive, and create vision in its rear part is a phenomenon that defies our senses.Pinker does not deal with language in this book because he devoted another book, The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Languagewhich I have not read yet. He designed them to complement each other.The second thing I remember is the conclusion. After examining scientifically the various abilities of the brain, Pinker finally gets to the idea of Consciousness, the most perplexing aspect of the brain. But then he gives up and admits that our human capacities are unable to understand how consciousness has come to be, nor what it is. He proposes that probably only an entity with higher abilities than those of our brain would be able to look down upon human Consciousness and understand what it is (does he mean a god, or a machine, or martians?).Of course, so far he is completely right. No one has, as yet, been able to explain Consciousness satisfactorily, and it has been approached from a myriad of fields. Is Consciousness created or has it evolved?. Is it only in our bodies, and therefore mortal, or can it transmigrate?. What is it anyway? So, the missing star is not because of what Pinker has written in this book but for its title. He does not really explain, fully, what he promises: how our mind works. In any case, I am going swimming tomorrow again, and my Consciousness is delighted with the idea, even if it does not know what it-self is."
31,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5130906-mikael-lind,2,"The book does not lack good qualities, but I generally dislike the technique of argumentation that is too often characterized by poor proof backed by a certain arrogance towards alternative explanations. The chapter on the sexes is particularly shoddily presented. The ""proof"" that Pinker refers to when trying to back his claims that (simply put) evolution and innateness alone explain the differences between the sexes when it comes to attitudes to sex (the male hunter/gatherer has logically a greater chance of spreading his genes since he doesn't have to carry the baby for nine months, and so on) is based on polls filled out by university students. That these students are also caught up in a social reality doesn't seem to have crossed Pinker's mind.Good scholars know where to draw the boundaries between science and speculation. Chomsky has said that one can learn more about human nature from reading a novel than from scientific psychology. In other words, he knows that his scientific field is limited to a certain aspect of human nature and language, and thus doesn't try to explain more than can be deducted by reasoning from the facts presented. (One can have opinions as to how successful Chomskyan linguistic science actually is, but that's another matter.) Certainly, Pinker is allowed to speculate, as is any scientist. The problem is that Pinker's speculations are sometimes presented as truths. Therefore, this book does, despite some interesting facts being presented in it, leave me with a bitter taste in my mouth."
32,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,1,"I started this, listened to 3.5 hours of the audiobook’s total of 26 and simply couldn’t imagine continuing. The first chapter (2.5 hours), which the author calls an “opening brief”, can in simple terms be seen as an introduction. This introduction was not concise; it was rambling and consisted of mundane generalizations. It did not clarify how the book would be organized nor in precise terms what the author wished to show. Nothing enticed me to continue. To better understand the field of cognitive science I am looking for a book based on solid scientific backing, not one based on speculation. I want at least a modicum of solid proof for what is being claimed, and I found not one smidgeon of that here. There was an excessive amount of criticism of other scientists’ views while at the same time the author’s own views were not made clear. I disliked the manner in which the author gave an enormous number of examples which supposedly were meant to prove the generalizations made. Many examples proved nothing. They referred to movie figures, characters in fiction, objects we use in our daily life and further generalizations about human behavior. The list of examples drowned out the statement that was to be proven. Even in the first introductory chapter there were statements made the validity of which can be debated. We are told that humans today no longer worry about robots / computer programs being made that function better than man. That is not true! In the news recently was a debate about the inequitable use of artificial intelligence programs. So I finished the unwieldy, long-winded, empty first introductory chapter and moved on to the second. Before quitting the book I wanted to check if perhaps the style of writing altered. It did not. The narration by Mel Foster started off too fast, but I got used to it. At one point I set the speed down to 75%, and that was too slow! Sentences become distorted. In a book such as this a listener needs time to consider what is being said so they can themselves evaluate what they are being told. The rambling, chatty writing style, the multitude of generalizations and the lack of both conclusive evidence and scientific backing are not what I am looking for. If I do not want to read a book, this says clearly that I did not like that which I read. I am giving this one star."
33,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a truly comprehensive treatment of the human mind. Pinker delves deeply into the reasons why the mind has evolved to make decisions in the way it does. There is very little discussion about the biology of the brain; the book points out that a good understanding of the origins of human behavior requires descriptions at a higher level--at the level of the mind, and how it evolved through natural selection. Pinker shows how natural selection has worked its way into every nook and cranny of the mind ... absolutely fascinating. Every chapter goes into great detail about how our belief system developed, our vision, our reasoning abilities, our family structures, and our emotions. Pinker describes how our minds are similar to computers and neural networks, and how they are different. I've read other books by Pinker, and they are all great. Highly recommended to every human with a mind!"
34,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1447864-joshua-nomen-mutatio,5,"I think this a great way of addressing a widespread misunderstanding about genetics, biological evolution and human thought & behavior.Slight background story: I was having a discussion with a guy on goodreads.com within his comments on his review of Why I Am Not A Muslim and eventually it came to this:Myself: ""It’s a categorical mistake to think this about biological evolution. To put it bluntly: our genes are selfish, but we are not (not necessarily, unconditionally so at least).""Him: ""One last question, so how are we different than our genes?""And my reply and the whole point of this post:This may sound mean, but it’s simple. You are not a gene, nor am I. We’re animals, unique and beautiful and ugly and all qualities in between, both as a species and as individuals.Here’s an explanation though:""But almost everyone misunderstands this theory. Contrary to popular belief, the gene-centered theory of evolution does not imply that the point of all human striving is to spread our genes. With the exception of the fertility doctor who artificially inseminated patients with his own semen, the donor to the sperm bank for Nobel Prize winners, and other kooks, no human being (or animal) strives to spread his or her genes. Dawkins explained the theory in a book called The Selfish Gene, and the metaphor was chosen carefully. People don’t selfishly spread their genes, genes selfishly spread themselves. They do it by the way they build our brains. By making us enjoy life, health, sex, friends, and children, the gene buys a lottery ticket for representation in the next generation, with odds that were favorable in the environment in which we evolved. Our goals are subgoals of the ultimate goal of the genes, replicating themselves. But the two are different. As far as we are concerned, our goals, conscious or unconscious, are not about genes at all, but about health and lovers and children and friends.""That seems to be enough to get the point across, but I think this is such a good point that I’ll type the next paragraph up as well:""The confusion between our goals and genes’ goals has spawned one muddle after another. A reviewer of a book about the evolution of sexuality protests that human adultery, unlike the animal equivalent, cannot be a strategy to spread genes because adulteres take steps to prevent pregancy. But whose strategy are we talking about? Sexual desire is not people’s strategy to progagate their genes. It’s people’s strategy to attain the pleasures of sex, and the pleasures of sex are the genes strategy to propagate themselves. If the genes don’t get propagated, it’s because we are smarter than they are. A book on the emotional life of animals complains that if altruism according to biologists is just helping kin or exchanging favors, both of which serve the interests of one’s genes, it would not really be altruism after all, but some kind of hypocrisy. This too is a mix up. Just as blueprints don’t necessarily specify blue buildings, selfish genes don’t necessarily specify selfish organisms. As we shall see, sometimes the most selfish thing a gene can do is build a selfless brain. Genes are a play with in a play, not the interior monologue of the players.""-Steven Pinker, How The Mind Works, pp. 43-44Also, for anyone interested in listening to the audiobook version:http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list...The reader sounds like one of those prototypical 1950's or 60's educational film narrators. It works pretty well."
35,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4350004-josh-hamacher,3,"I finally finished this book. It took me far longer than I care to admit to do so. On at least one occasion I lost interest and put it down for several weeks before coming back to it.I have a hard time putting my finger on exactly why this was the case. It's not that it's bad - in fact, parts of it are absolutely fascinating. It's certainly not the writing; Pinker is quite good (despite a tendency to repeat himself frequently).I think it boiled down to two things for me, with both of them being closely related (and maybe even the same):1. Organization. This is a 565-page book with only eight chapters. Each chapter is almost a short book on its own, divided into many sections. While a common theme ties together each chapter the sections are often quite divergent. It was hard to maintain momentum when moving from one section to another that seemed only tangentially related.2. Breadth. The subject is the human mind, providing practically infinite material. I think for anyone there would be parts that are interesting and parts that aren't.Having said that, I still recommend this book."
36,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13162061-amirography,5,"This book was an amazing read!I cannot get around the fact that it was written by one person, let alone one person with a lot of other books on the same topic, and yet more provocative each time. I loved the detailed and comprehensive outlook on each subject matter.It is not a textbook, It is a long essay that gives you a rational, up-to-date, coherent, general yet accurate, A frame for thinking about mind, cognition, and emotions, and also changes our day-to-day worldview about people in general.""The only complaint I have is that this book could have used more hierarchical structure."
37,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,5,"This is a very readable and influential synthesis of the cognitive science view of the mind with that of evolutionary psychology. The overall thrust is that the mind is a neural computer closely governed by feelings and desires that were shaped by natural selection for their adaptive value in the hunter-gatherer lifestyle of our ancestors. The book is lively, with lots of down to earth examples. He holds your hand when wading through many technical subjects, faces disputes in a non-dogmatic way, and addresses political spins on scientific matters in a forthright way.The heft and scope of the volume is daunting. Yet it is written to be accessible to the general reader as well as scholars. As the emphasis is on synthesis and not a unifying novel theory of mind dependent on the cohesion of all its parts, I feel that the average reader could benefit from reading only the chapters of interest to them. There are sections on visual perception, neural network modeling, passionate emotions, social behaviors, and cultural innovations. As with Wilson’s “Sociobiology”, many readers will be interested in what he has to say about biological roots of human violence, sexual behavior, family values, and the arts. This includes accounts of adaptive values for lying, self delusion, war, mass murder, rape, pornography, parent-child and sibling conflict, altruism, love, marriage, and friendship. Particularly fascinating is his coverage of the cross-cultural phenomenon of people going “amok” and tie-in with the “doomsday machine” theory of passionate emotions, the adaptive value of which lies in their service as “guarantors of threats and promises”. He makes a good argument that thinking conforms to a kind of language, or mentalese, with categorical, syntactical, and generative properties aligned with Chomsky’s conceptions. He places a big emphasis on the role of beliefs and desires in his perspective on the core properties of human intellect. He doesn’t hold out much hope in the explanatory potential of neuroscience, considering models at that level an inadequate reductionism: ""Even if neuroscientists someday decode the entire wiring diagram of the brain, human behavior makes the most sense when it was explained in terms of beliefs and desires, not in terms of volts and grams. Physics provides no insight into the machinations of a crafty lawyer, and even fails to enlighten us about many simpler acts of living things."" I agree that explanations at the level physics will not help understand the mind, but I feel hopeful that neuroscience can make much progress in merging biological and psychological models. As this book was written in 2007, it misses the neurological synthesis of the computational and emotional aspects of the mind achieved by Damasio in his 2009 book and the decade of great ferment in cognitive neuroscience due to studies using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging.No matter how much it looks like he is on the pathway to biological determinism for so many “bad” human behaviors, he takes great pains to dissociate our inherited mental equipment from our systems of moral responsibility and vision of equal rights: ""To understand is not to forgive"". For example, understanding a human tendency to revile other cultures does not excuse the Holocaust. Biological determinism for even liberal values can be misguided, e.g. “The argument against persecuting gay people must be made not in terms of the gay gene or the gay brain but in terms of people’s right to engage in private consensual acts without discrimination or harassment.” In the case of the male tendency to mate with any women they can, even to the point of rape, rather than agreeing with one of his students that the key conclusion is that “Men are slime!”, he feels they still should be swayed by morality: “If … men are especially tempted to commit certain crimes against women, the implication is that deterrents should be surer and more severe, not that the crimes are somehow less odious.” Pinker further argues that environmental determinism is just as unfruitful. He feels feminists’ stance against discrimination and oppression of women can do without the position that their origin lies in brainwashing of children and youth by media, pornography, and child rearing and educational practices.A refreshing aspect of Pinker’s book is that he makes very little claim to explaining free will and sentience. He also places a lot of advanced cultural accomplishments of humans, such as art, humor, and religion in a category of having no likely evolutionary adaptive value. He suspects that these capacities are “along for the ride” and that “human brains evolved by one set of laws, those of natural selection and genetics, and now interact with one another according to another set of laws, those of cognitive and social psychology, human ecology, and history”."
38,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3680560-brad-acker,2,"This book frequently gets rave reviews. Whenever i sit down to read Pinker, i wish i were drinking again. Here is an example of a typical quotation from this book that i could only follow if i were drunk: ""The cobalt 60 nucleus is said to spin counterclockwise if you look down on its north pole, but that description by itself is circular because 'north pole' is simply what we call the end of the axis from which a rotation looks counterclockwise."" This is in the middle of a discussion, in which he puts down Richard Feynman, and concludes ""God is not ambidextrous after all."" I feel that Pinker presents his material in an annoyingly obtuse way and may be drinking when he writes. LOL"

Pinker focuses on a ""computational theory of mind"", saying that the mind is a complex parallel information processing system.Of course Pinker doesn't have the ""final word"" on How the Mind Works, but he provides more evidence, more insight, and more rationality than the ""romantics"" and their leaders Freud Sigmund 1856-1939 Sigmund and Carl Jung.Pinker continues on many of the themes here in The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature.Unfortunately for Americans, Political Correctness seems to be a barrier to accurately seeing human nature, as human nature necessarily is different for different groups of people, particularly for men and women.My favorite anecdote is about the ""Coolidge effect"": … an old joke about Calvin Coolidge when he was President … The President and Mrs. Coolidge were being shown [separately] around an experimental government farm. When [Mrs. Coolidge] came to the chicken yard she noticed that a rooster was mating very frequently. She asked the attendant how often that happened and was told, “Dozens of times each day.” Mrs. Coolidge said, “Tell that to the President when he comes by.” Upon being told, President asked, “Same hen every time?” The reply was, “Oh, no, Mr. President, a different hen every time.” President: “Tell that to Mrs. Coolidge.”Pinker explains the mind by ""reverse-engineering"" it—figuring out what natural selection designed it to accomplish in the environment in which we evolved. The mind, he writes, is a system of ""organs of computation"" that allowed our ancestors to understand and outsmart objects, animals, plants, and each other.How the Mind Works explains many of the imponderables of everyday life. Why does a face look more attractive with makeup? How do ""Magic-Eye"" 3-D stereograms work? Why do we feel that a run of heads makes the coin more likely to land tails? Why is the thought of eating worms disgusting? Why do men challenge each other to duels and murder their ex-wives? Why are children bratty? Why do fools fall in love? Why are we soothed by paintings and music? And why do puzzles like the self, free will, and consciousness leave us dizzy?This arguments in the book are as bold as its title. Pinker rehabilitates unfashionable ideas, such as that the mind is a computer and that human nature was shaped by natural selection. And he challenges fashionable ones, such as that passionate emotions are irrational, that parents socialize their children, that creativity springs from the unconscious, that nature is good and modern society corrupting, and that art and religion are expressions of our higher spiritual yearnings.

Why is the thought of eating worms disgusting? Why do paintings and music alleviate the hunger and thurst of mind? Why did we invent religion, music and art? How did these items adapt in the long run if it serves to nothing from an evolutionary perspective? ... ... ...The book covers the computational theory of mind (mind is the computational product of the brain) and evolutionary psychology. There is a very little discussion about the biology of the brain but it still ponders over human natures to explain them from the biological adaptations and  the by-product of evolution  perspectives. The book was published over 20 years ago but Pinker is an engaging writer. So, at least the connecting experience with a first-rate mind might not be frustrating :)"
42,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/965367-dawn,1,"Let's be honest. I will probably never pick up this book to finish it. I began reading this because of my book club. But, I didn't think I would finish it to begin with, and due to many circumstances, the book club will not be meeting for this book. So, I have decided to put it down as one of those books I'll never finish.I didn't like most of what I read, not due to the subject/topic, but due to the way Pinker writes. His droning on on tangents and his shoving his philosophy, which is oh so right BTW [she said dripping with sarcasm:] was too much for me. I had a hard time staying interested, which was a shame, because most sections began with promise. But Pinker would, more often than not, find a way to make the topic at hand induce heavy eyelids (or eye rolling, depending).I wanted this book to be good and thought it would be interesting, being a Bachelor of Psychology graduate myself, but no such luck. Maybe in many years, when I have more time on my hands, or less sense, I will try picking this book up again."

Nonetheless, I loved this book. The early chapters, especially on the computational theory of mind, are incredible. Pinker is just unbelievably detailed and the linguistic spin he brings to the discussion of cognitive development is a great dimension. The later chapters are more of the men-like-variety-women-like-providers stuff that one usually hears but nuanced and entertaining nonetheless. I enjoyed this book a lot. "

Pinker starts out by claiming that he will explain the origins of human emotions, aesthetics, and belief in the context of the latest findings of evolutionary and psychological research. He does not really succeed in doing so. It is a succession of moderately interesting research reports, linked together with a glue of neat one-liners (mostly other people's), but without really coming to a killer conclusion and indeed occasionally resorting to sheer polemic (eg on gender). The section on neural networks is particularly dull, especially as Pinker admits that living brains don't actually function that way. [return][return]I found precisely two points of interest in the book, both pretty tangential to the main thrust of the argument. First, of interest only to those who also know her, is that an old family friend is mentioned in passing on the development of children's minds. Second, of more general interest, is the observation that all cultures tend to design ornamental gardens with unconscious reference to the primeval African savannah - lawns and flowerbeds interrupted by carefully placed features. Rather a pleasing thought! This observation is not Pinker's own, but he does give pretty full citations for it which the interested reader can follow up.[return][return]I hear that Pinker's other books are better, so shall continue to look out for them though without particular enthusiasm."""
45,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1360306-joshua-stein,5,"Pinker's treatise on the naturalist mind looks like a science textbook, but the combination of computer programming and physiology laid on top of sociological metaphors and applicable understandings makes it a fantastic read. His ability to diffuse archaic arguments about the nature of the mind without appearing argumentative is what defines him as a great academic, and his ability to explain things to individuals with only a high school education (like me) is what defines him as a great writer.The assaults on the superstitions of Freud are particularly interesting, and his breaking down of the purely linguistic issue of Searle's ""Chinese Box"" problem leads you to come to the same conclusion that Pinker does as Pinker is unfolding the problem.Anyone who likes to study the nature of mind, who enjoys reading authors ranging from Dennett to Proust will like this book, and those who like to discuss the topics will find themselves better informed and far more capable of explaining things with Pinker's metaphors."
46,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,5,"This book covers the computational theory of mind and evolutionary psychology. The former asserts that the mind is the computational product of the brain. The later examines how many aspects of human nature can be explained as biological adaptations. Both are crucial to understanding how the mind works. Both are explained in exquisite depth (read: this is a very long book).Pinker gets one thing wrong at the end when he asserts what's known as the the ""hard problem of consciousness"" which his refers to as sentience. He also makes a misstatement about free will.""Sentience is not a combination of brain events or computational states.""""Free will is not a causal chain of events and states by definition.""This is frustrating because I feel like he ran a 3 minute mile but stopped just shy of the finish line!He's wrong on both counts.

The most surprising thing is that cognitive psychology is limited to perception and the imagery debate; no discussion of memory, very limited discussion of reasoning, not to mention planning or motor planning. For today's standards, it's outdated by David Buss's text on evolutionary psychology."

Great read for anyone interested in the cross-over between biology and psychology. "
51,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42189561-abu-hayat-khan,5,"there is two contending interpretation exists among academia on Darwinian Evolution: Gradualism vs Punctuated Equilibrium. they strikingly disagree on the question of “how a phenotypic trait evolves”. in gradualism (Richard Dawkins and others), any phenotype must have an Adaptive value (here the definition of ""adaptation"" is very strict, it means reproductive advantage only) i.e. a trait that increases the chance for more living offspring evolves slowly through selection pressure. on the other hand, proponent of punctuated equilibrium (Steven J Gould and other) don’t accept the idea of “adaptation”, rather they theorized something called“Exaptation”, which says that a trait may arise through natural selection for one purpose but later organism may find another way to use it which doesn’t give any survival value (i.e. doesn’t provide reproductive advantage). such traits or phenotypes are called evolutionary byproduct. Mr. Gould’s called them “Spandrel”. Spandrels of San Marco are famous for their beautiful art, but originally these spandrels were structural components of the basilica which later turned into artistic masterpieces. Unlike slow Adaptation, Exaptation happens in punctuated manner, i.e. out of sudden in the geological timescale. Epigenetics is considered to be one of the mechanisms for such punctuated evolution (please see, ""Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst"" by Robert M. Sapolsky).if we consider human mind as a phenotype that comes from an organ called the brain, and if the brain is an evolved organ through natural selection, which interpretation should we take to explain human mind? is mind adaptive? a trait that helps multiplying offspring? Or is mind exaptative, i.e. an evolutionary byproduct?in his influential book ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"", Daniel Kahneman demonstrated that human mind is by default irrational, rational thinking is a very expensive process hence turned off most of the time. instead, our brain uses shortcuts, know as heuristics or biases to solve any given situation. this line of research and academic findings tipped the view of human mind toward exaptationism. i.e. prominent view is that human mind is an evolutionary byproduct which explains why it is such irrational. in this view, it is considered that human mind was evolved to survive in predator-prey paradigm in which rational thinking would result in predation and death. our concept of art, music, language, etc is simply a byproduct of a formal survival machine called the brain. now enters Steven Pinker. Mr. Pinker argued that mind is an adaptive phenotype. so the only way to understand it is through evolutionary history not by chaos theory or reductionist physical approach. which implies that the irrational throughs are not useless at all. rather our cognition biases and irrationalities are very important to increase the change of our reproductive success. and that is exactly how human mind should work.I consider Steven Pinker and Gerard Diamond as the best two scientific writer of our time. other writers like Yuval Noah Harari, Richard Dawkins etc are popular but not even close to these two giants. in this book, Mr. Pinker destroyed exaptationism, though not without criticism. some of his descriptions just flown over my head, nonetheless, this book turns out to be the most informative book on evolution I've ever read."
52,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583387-nebuchadnezzar,3,"The title of the book should have read ""How the Mind Works (According to Steven Pinker)."" The picture he paints is not wrong, per se, but vastly overestimates the power of current cognitive modeling.There is quite a bit of good material here reviewing computational theory of mind, modularity, evolutionary psychology, and related material in cognitive science written in Pinker's usual conversational style. However, I have to hop off the bandwagon at the halfway point on this one. Sure, computational theory of mind has produced a lot of fruitful research. The mind is, to some degree, modular. The brain, like all our other organs, is shaped by evolution. My main problem is in his jump from the modularity at ""low-level"" cognition (e.g., basic sensory input, certain parts of language) posited by Jerry A. Fodor to ""massive modularity."" There are some functions that are very localized in the brain that fit with modularity, but we would expect the brain to look very different if massive modularity were true. The brain is actually very plastic with many higher-order functions that aren't strictly localized. The same thing goes for his evolutionary explanations. I will happily agree that many cognitive systems and functions are adaptive -- having eyes and a visual system is obviously beneficial! When it comes to more complex social behaviors, we're in far more speculative territory.As an introduction to cognitive science, it does present the material in an accessible way. However, it will be difficult to for the layperson to pick apart where Pinker's description is backed by solid evidence and where it lapses into questionable claims and rank speculation. There's a bit of fluff, too, especially near the end when it begins to cross over into the more overt political rambling characteristic of The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature.Fodor's The Mind Doesn't Work That Way: The Scope and Limits of Computational Psychology (http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Abstracts/Fodo...) makes for a decent corrective, though I have problems with it as well. I'm in total agreement on one point with Fodor, though: When it comes to cognitive science, we're just getting started."

54,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/772528-ben,4,"A very good book, albeit not the quickest read ever.I’ve read a few popular science books and have been disappointed when they seem to rely more on anecdote than science -- ok, fine, what I really mean is I can’t stand Malcolm Gladwell. How the Mind Works certainly feels much more solidly founded in science while still maintaining the how-science-fits-into-real-life perspective of a popular science book.It’s not a perfect book. Given the enormous breadth of the topic that Pinker is attempting to cover, it’s forgivable, but still the book does drift occasionally into generalizations that seem more a subjective (though plausible) opinion than convincing fact. Given the great complexity he describes in the lower-level workings of the human brain, I felt surprised at how often he seemed to be over-simplifying higher-level human psychology; at the the same time, of course, I did realize he couldn’t preface every sentence with, “As a generalization that obviously does’t account for all specific details, ...” All in all, it was quite a good, convincing book that felt comfortingly more bound to science than some others I’ve read."
55,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2459318-deniz-cem-nduygu,5,"So many great paragraphs that they make up for a few places where he gets lazy and spells out conventions. As the number of notes I took goes, this book is a winner; in addition to all its original content, it has the best summaries I've encountered of many complex ideas/theories. He is remarkably devastating against standart social sciences and postmodernist thinking. The book may get a little monotone in the technical chapters, but it's a must-read for anyone interested in psychology, evolution, nature-nurture debates, or mundane questions like ""Why do men and women want different things?"". (No, the differences are not ""socially constructed"".)I just wish he was more open to the meme theory; then he could be perfect."

Steven Pinker lucidly explains what we can know about how the mind works and why it happens to work the way it does. The explanations he presents are supported by fascinating experiments and observations from the fields of psychology, neuroscience, biology and anthropology.Reading this book requires a fair bit of grinding, but I think that some people who persist will find it deeply rewarding and satisfying. The paradigm presented in this book is interesting."
57,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,5,"The best science writers have an understanding of the subject on which they write that is both deep and broad along with the ability to express these ideas in a way which is both clear and connects it with ideas and experiences that resonate with the general reader.

60,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3593962-kalliope,4,"This morning while swimming I thought of this book. And I thought also of a conversation I had recently with a friend. We were talking about human consciousness.Swimming is a perfect thing to do when thinking about consciousness. While sliding along the water we are deprived of many things, in particular of the full powers of our senses. There is very little to hear; smellandtaste are also kept at bay; what we can look at is reduced to a wall and a straight line on the floor of the pool; and the pleasant and refreshing water assuages our touch. So, even if we stop being ourselves since we are not in our natural medium, we can however only be ourselves. Consciousness runs galore.I actually read this book a while ago, and I did so also some time after I interrupted my studies in neurobiology. I had to stop because of personal reasons. But I remember two things clearly about this book.The first is that It was an excellent summary of what was known about the brain when the book was published, and which I had been studying in more detailed textbooks. Alas, I have not kept with further advances, but my guess is that it is still a very relevant read today.The study is very well structured as a survey of the various considerations on how the mind works, and it is written in a very engaging style. It is also engaging because it addresses our immediate and commonsensical concerns about how our mind works. Why we forget, how do we recognize faces, what falling in love may entail, what it is to laugh.. etc.The best part was the chapter on vision, may be because to me that is one of the most magical powers of our brain. How it can process what our light detecting organs perceive, and create vision in its rear part is a phenomenon that defies our senses.Pinker does not deal with language in this book because he devoted another book, The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Languagewhich I have not read yet. He designed them to complement each other.The second thing I remember is the conclusion. After examining scientifically the various abilities of the brain, Pinker finally gets to the idea of Consciousness, the most perplexing aspect of the brain. But then he gives up and admits that our human capacities are unable to understand how consciousness has come to be, nor what it is. He proposes that probably only an entity with higher abilities than those of our brain would be able to look down upon human Consciousness and understand what it is (does he mean a god, or a machine, or martians?).Of course, so far he is completely right. No one has, as yet, been able to explain Consciousness satisfactorily, and it has been approached from a myriad of fields. Is Consciousness created or has it evolved?. Is it only in our bodies, and therefore mortal, or can it transmigrate?. What is it anyway? So, the missing star is not because of what Pinker has written in this book but for its title. He does not really explain, fully, what he promises: how our mind works. In any case, I am going swimming tomorrow again, and my Consciousness is delighted with the idea, even if it does not know what it-self is."
61,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5130906-mikael-lind,2,"The book does not lack good qualities, but I generally dislike the technique of argumentation that is too often characterized by poor proof backed by a certain arrogance towards alternative explanations. The chapter on the sexes is particularly shoddily presented. The ""proof"" that Pinker refers to when trying to back his claims that (simply put) evolution and innateness alone explain the differences between the sexes when it comes to attitudes to sex (the male hunter/gatherer has logically a greater chance of spreading his genes since he doesn't have to carry the baby for nine months, and so on) is based on polls filled out by university students. That these students are also caught up in a social reality doesn't seem to have crossed Pinker's mind.Good scholars know where to draw the boundaries between science and speculation. Chomsky has said that one can learn more about human nature from reading a novel than from scientific psychology. In other words, he knows that his scientific field is limited to a certain aspect of human nature and language, and thus doesn't try to explain more than can be deducted by reasoning from the facts presented. (One can have opinions as to how successful Chomskyan linguistic science actually is, but that's another matter.) Certainly, Pinker is allowed to speculate, as is any scientist. The problem is that Pinker's speculations are sometimes presented as truths. Therefore, this book does, despite some interesting facts being presented in it, leave me with a bitter taste in my mouth."
62,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,1,"I started this, listened to 3.5 hours of the audiobook’s total of 26 and simply couldn’t imagine continuing. The first chapter (2.5 hours), which the author calls an “opening brief”, can in simple terms be seen as an introduction. This introduction was not concise; it was rambling and consisted of mundane generalizations. It did not clarify how the book would be organized nor in precise terms what the author wished to show. Nothing enticed me to continue. To better understand the field of cognitive science I am looking for a book based on solid scientific backing, not one based on speculation. I want at least a modicum of solid proof for what is being claimed, and I found not one smidgeon of that here. There was an excessive amount of criticism of other scientists’ views while at the same time the author’s own views were not made clear. I disliked the manner in which the author gave an enormous number of examples which supposedly were meant to prove the generalizations made. Many examples proved nothing. They referred to movie figures, characters in fiction, objects we use in our daily life and further generalizations about human behavior. The list of examples drowned out the statement that was to be proven. Even in the first introductory chapter there were statements made the validity of which can be debated. We are told that humans today no longer worry about robots / computer programs being made that function better than man. That is not true! In the news recently was a debate about the inequitable use of artificial intelligence programs. So I finished the unwieldy, long-winded, empty first introductory chapter and moved on to the second. Before quitting the book I wanted to check if perhaps the style of writing altered. It did not. The narration by Mel Foster started off too fast, but I got used to it. At one point I set the speed down to 75%, and that was too slow! Sentences become distorted. In a book such as this a listener needs time to consider what is being said so they can themselves evaluate what they are being told. The rambling, chatty writing style, the multitude of generalizations and the lack of both conclusive evidence and scientific backing are not what I am looking for. If I do not want to read a book, this says clearly that I did not like that which I read. I am giving this one star."
63,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a truly comprehensive treatment of the human mind. Pinker delves deeply into the reasons why the mind has evolved to make decisions in the way it does. There is very little discussion about the biology of the brain; the book points out that a good understanding of the origins of human behavior requires descriptions at a higher level--at the level of the mind, and how it evolved through natural selection. Pinker shows how natural selection has worked its way into every nook and cranny of the mind ... absolutely fascinating. Every chapter goes into great detail about how our belief system developed, our vision, our reasoning abilities, our family structures, and our emotions. Pinker describes how our minds are similar to computers and neural networks, and how they are different. I've read other books by Pinker, and they are all great. Highly recommended to every human with a mind!"
64,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1447864-joshua-nomen-mutatio,5,"I think this a great way of addressing a widespread misunderstanding about genetics, biological evolution and human thought & behavior.Slight background story: I was having a discussion with a guy on goodreads.com within his comments on his review of Why I Am Not A Muslim and eventually it came to this:Myself: ""It’s a categorical mistake to think this about biological evolution. To put it bluntly: our genes are selfish, but we are not (not necessarily, unconditionally so at least).""Him: ""One last question, so how are we different than our genes?""And my reply and the whole point of this post:This may sound mean, but it’s simple. You are not a gene, nor am I. We’re animals, unique and beautiful and ugly and all qualities in between, both as a species and as individuals.Here’s an explanation though:""But almost everyone misunderstands this theory. Contrary to popular belief, the gene-centered theory of evolution does not imply that the point of all human striving is to spread our genes. With the exception of the fertility doctor who artificially inseminated patients with his own semen, the donor to the sperm bank for Nobel Prize winners, and other kooks, no human being (or animal) strives to spread his or her genes. Dawkins explained the theory in a book called The Selfish Gene, and the metaphor was chosen carefully. People don’t selfishly spread their genes, genes selfishly spread themselves. They do it by the way they build our brains. By making us enjoy life, health, sex, friends, and children, the gene buys a lottery ticket for representation in the next generation, with odds that were favorable in the environment in which we evolved. Our goals are subgoals of the ultimate goal of the genes, replicating themselves. But the two are different. As far as we are concerned, our goals, conscious or unconscious, are not about genes at all, but about health and lovers and children and friends.""That seems to be enough to get the point across, but I think this is such a good point that I’ll type the next paragraph up as well:""The confusion between our goals and genes’ goals has spawned one muddle after another. A reviewer of a book about the evolution of sexuality protests that human adultery, unlike the animal equivalent, cannot be a strategy to spread genes because adulteres take steps to prevent pregancy. But whose strategy are we talking about? Sexual desire is not people’s strategy to progagate their genes. It’s people’s strategy to attain the pleasures of sex, and the pleasures of sex are the genes strategy to propagate themselves. If the genes don’t get propagated, it’s because we are smarter than they are. A book on the emotional life of animals complains that if altruism according to biologists is just helping kin or exchanging favors, both of which serve the interests of one’s genes, it would not really be altruism after all, but some kind of hypocrisy. This too is a mix up. Just as blueprints don’t necessarily specify blue buildings, selfish genes don’t necessarily specify selfish organisms. As we shall see, sometimes the most selfish thing a gene can do is build a selfless brain. Genes are a play with in a play, not the interior monologue of the players.""-Steven Pinker, How The Mind Works, pp. 43-44Also, for anyone interested in listening to the audiobook version:http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list...The reader sounds like one of those prototypical 1950's or 60's educational film narrators.

65,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4350004-josh-hamacher,3,"I finally finished this book. It took me far longer than I care to admit to do so. On at least one occasion I lost interest and put it down for several weeks before coming back to it.I have a hard time putting my finger on exactly why this was the case. It's not that it's bad - in fact, parts of it are absolutely fascinating. It's certainly not the writing; Pinker is quite good (despite a tendency to repeat himself frequently).I think it boiled down to two things for me, with both of them being closely related (and maybe even the same):1. Organization. This is a 565-page book with only eight chapters. Each chapter is almost a short book on its own, divided into many sections. While a common theme ties together each chapter the sections are often quite divergent. It was hard to maintain momentum when moving from one section to another that seemed only tangentially related.2. Breadth. The subject is the human mind, providing practically infinite material. I think for anyone there would be parts that are interesting and parts that aren't.Having said that, I still recommend this book."
66,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13162061-amirography,5,"This book was an amazing read!I cannot get around the fact that it was written by one person, let alone one person with a lot of other books on the same topic, and yet more provocative each time. I loved the detailed and comprehensive outlook on each subject matter.It is not a textbook, It is a long essay that gives you a rational, up-to-date, coherent, general yet accurate, A frame for thinking about mind, cognition, and emotions, and also changes our day-to-day worldview about people in general.""The only complaint I have is that this book could have used more hierarchical structure."
67,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,5,"This is a very readable and influential synthesis of the cognitive science view of the mind with that of evolutionary psychology. The overall thrust is that the mind is a neural computer closely governed by feelings and desires that were shaped by natural selection for their adaptive value in the hunter-gatherer lifestyle of our ancestors. The book is lively, with lots of down to earth examples. He holds your hand when wading through many technical subjects, faces disputes in a non-dogmatic way, and addresses political spins on scientific matters in a forthright way.The heft and scope of the volume is daunting. Yet it is written to be accessible to the general reader as well as scholars. As the emphasis is on synthesis and not a unifying novel theory of mind dependent on the cohesion of all its parts, I feel that the average reader could benefit from reading only the chapters of interest to them. There are sections on visual perception, neural network modeling, passionate emotions, social behaviors, and cultural innovations. As with Wilson’s “Sociobiology”, many readers will be interested in what he has to say about biological roots of human violence, sexual behavior, family values, and the arts. This includes accounts of adaptive values for lying, self delusion, war, mass murder, rape, pornography, parent-child and sibling conflict, altruism, love, marriage, and friendship. Particularly fascinating is his coverage of the cross-cultural phenomenon of people going “amok” and tie-in with the “doomsday machine” theory of passionate emotions, the adaptive value of which lies in their service as “guarantors of threats and promises”. He makes a good argument that thinking conforms to a kind of language, or mentalese, with categorical, syntactical, and generative properties aligned with Chomsky’s conceptions. He places a big emphasis on the role of beliefs and desires in his perspective on the core properties of human intellect. He doesn’t hold out much hope in the explanatory potential of neuroscience, considering models at that level an inadequate reductionism: ""Even if neuroscientists someday decode the entire wiring diagram of the brain, human behavior makes the most sense when it was explained in terms of beliefs and desires, not in terms of volts and grams. Physics provides no insight into the machinations of a crafty lawyer, and even fails to enlighten us about many simpler acts of living things."" I agree that explanations at the level physics will not help understand the mind, but I feel hopeful that neuroscience can make much progress in merging biological and psychological models. As this book was written in 2007, it misses the neurological synthesis of the computational and emotional aspects of the mind achieved by Damasio in his 2009 book and the decade of great ferment in cognitive neuroscience due to studies using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging.No matter how much it looks like he is on the pathway to biological determinism for so many “bad” human behaviors, he takes great pains to dissociate our inherited mental equipment from our systems of moral responsibility and vision of equal rights: ""To understand is not to forgive"". For example, understanding a human tendency to revile other cultures does not excuse the Holocaust. Biological determinism for even liberal values can be misguided, e.g. “The argument against persecuting gay people must be made not in terms of the gay gene or the gay brain but in terms of people’s right to engage in private consensual acts without discrimination or harassment.” In the case of the male tendency to mate with any women they can, even to the point of rape, rather than agreeing with one of his students that the key conclusion is that “Men are slime!”, he feels they still should be swayed by morality: “If … men are especially tempted to commit certain crimes against women, the implication is that deterrents should be surer and more severe, not that the crimes are somehow less odious.” Pinker further argues that environmental determinism is just as unfruitful. He feels feminists’ stance against discrimination and oppression of women can do without the position that their origin lies in brainwashing of children and youth by media, pornography, and child rearing and educational practices.A refreshing aspect of Pinker’s book is that he makes very little claim to explaining free will and sentience. He also places a lot of advanced cultural accomplishments of humans, such as art, humor, and religion in a category of having no likely evolutionary adaptive value. He suspects that these capacities are “along for the ride” and that “human brains evolved by one set of laws, those of natural selection and genetics, and now interact with one another according to another set of laws, those of cognitive and social psychology, human ecology, and history”."

Here is an example of a typical quotation from this book that i could only follow if i were drunk: ""The cobalt 60 nucleus is said to spin counterclockwise if you look down on its north pole, but that description by itself is circular because 'north pole' is simply what we call the end of the axis from which a rotation looks counterclockwise."" This is in the middle of a discussion, in which he puts down Richard Feynman, and concludes ""God is not ambidextrous after all.""

Pinker focuses on a ""computational theory of mind"", saying that the mind is a complex parallel information processing system.Of course Pinker doesn't have the ""final word"" on How the Mind Works, but he provides more evidence, more insight, and more rationality than the ""romantics"" and their leaders Freud Sigmund 1856-1939 Sigmund and Carl Jung.Pinker continues on many of the themes here in The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature.Unfortunately for Americans, Political Correctness seems to be a barrier to accurately seeing human nature, as human nature necessarily is different for different groups of people, particularly for men and women.My favorite anecdote is about the ""Coolidge effect"": … an old joke about Calvin Coolidge when he was President … The President and Mrs. Coolidge were being shown [separately] around an experimental government farm. When [Mrs. Coolidge] came to the chicken yard she noticed that a rooster was mating very frequently. She asked the attendant how often that happened and was told, “Dozens of times each day.” Mrs. Coolidge said, “Tell that to the President when he comes by.” Upon being told, President asked, “Same hen every time?” The reply was, “Oh, no, Mr. President, a different hen every time.” President: “Tell that to Mrs. Coolidge.”Pinker explains the mind by ""reverse-engineering"" it—figuring out what natural selection designed it to accomplish in the environment in which we evolved. The mind, he writes, is a system of ""organs of computation"" that allowed our ancestors to understand and outsmart objects, animals, plants, and each other.How the Mind Works explains many of the imponderables of everyday life. Why does a face look more attractive with makeup? How do ""Magic-Eye"" 3-D stereograms work? Why do we feel that a run of heads makes the coin more likely to land tails? Why is the thought of eating worms disgusting? Why do men challenge each other to duels and murder their ex-wives? Why are children bratty? Why do fools fall in love? Why are we soothed by paintings and music? And why do puzzles like the self, free will, and consciousness leave us dizzy?This arguments in the book are as bold as its title. Pinker rehabilitates unfashionable ideas, such as that the mind is a computer and that human nature was shaped by natural selection. And he challenges fashionable ones, such as that passionate emotions are irrational, that parents socialize their children, that creativity springs from the unconscious, that nature is good and modern society corrupting, and that art and religion are expressions of our higher spiritual yearnings.

Why has the mind evolved to make decisions in the way it does? why do we really laugh at a joke? Why does a face look more attractive with makeup? Why does our brain drive us to enjoy sex? Why is the thought of eating worms disgusting? Why do paintings and music alleviate the hunger and thurst of mind? Why did we invent religion, music and art? How did these items adapt in the long run if it serves to nothing from an evolutionary perspective? ... ... ...The book covers the computational theory of mind (mind is the computational product of the brain) and evolutionary psychology. There is a very little discussion about the biology of the brain but it still ponders over human natures to explain them from the biological adaptations and  the by-product of evolution  perspectives. The book was published over 20 years ago but Pinker is an engaging writer. So, at least the connecting experience with a first-rate mind might not be frustrating :)"
72,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/965367-dawn,1,"Let's be honest. I will probably never pick up this book to finish it. I began reading this because of my book club. But, I didn't think I would finish it to begin with, and due to many circumstances, the book club will not be meeting for this book. So, I have decided to put it down as one of those books I'll never finish.I didn't like most of what I read, not due to the subject/topic, but due to the way Pinker writes. His droning on on tangents and his shoving his philosophy, which is oh so right BTW [she said dripping with sarcasm:] was too much for me. I had a hard time staying interested, which was a shame, because most sections began with promise. But Pinker would, more often than not, find a way to make the topic at hand induce heavy eyelids (or eye rolling, depending).I wanted this book to be good and thought it would be interesting, being a Bachelor of Psychology graduate myself, but no such luck. Maybe in many years, when I have more time on my hands, or less sense, I will try picking this book up again."

Nonetheless, I loved this book. The early chapters, especially on the computational theory of mind, are incredible. Pinker is just unbelievably detailed and the linguistic spin he brings to the discussion of cognitive development is a great dimension. The later chapters are more of the men-like-variety-women-like-providers stuff that one usually hears but nuanced and entertaining nonetheless. I enjoyed this book a lot. "

Pinker starts out by claiming that he will explain the origins of human emotions, aesthetics, and belief in the context of the latest findings of evolutionary and psychological research. He does not really succeed in doing so. It is a succession of moderately interesting research reports, linked together with a glue of neat one-liners (mostly other people's), but without really coming to a killer conclusion and indeed occasionally resorting to sheer polemic (eg on gender). The section on neural networks is particularly dull, especially as Pinker admits that living brains don't actually function that way. [return][return]I found precisely two points of interest in the book, both pretty tangential to the main thrust of the argument. First, of interest only to those who also know her, is that an old family friend is mentioned in passing on the development of children's minds. Second, of more general interest, is the observation that all cultures tend to design ornamental gardens with unconscious reference to the primeval African savannah - lawns and flowerbeds interrupted by carefully placed features. Rather a pleasing thought! This observation is not Pinker's own, but he does give pretty full citations for it which the interested reader can follow up.[return][return]I hear that Pinker's other books are better, so shall continue to look out for them though without particular enthusiasm."""
75,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1360306-joshua-stein,5,"Pinker's treatise on the naturalist mind looks like a science textbook, but the combination of computer programming and physiology laid on top of sociological metaphors and applicable understandings makes it a fantastic read. His ability to diffuse archaic arguments about the nature of the mind without appearing argumentative is what defines him as a great academic, and his ability to explain things to individuals with only a high school education (like me) is what defines him as a great writer.The assaults on the superstitions of Freud are particularly interesting, and his breaking down of the purely linguistic issue of Searle's ""Chinese Box"" problem leads you to come to the same conclusion that Pinker does as Pinker is unfolding the problem.Anyone who likes to study the nature of mind, who enjoys reading authors ranging from Dennett to Proust will like this book, and those who like to discuss the topics will find themselves better informed and far more capable of explaining things with Pinker's metaphors."

The former asserts that the mind is the computational product of the brain. The later examines how many aspects of human nature can be explained as biological adaptations. Both are crucial to understanding how the mind works. Both are explained in exquisite depth (read: this is a very long book).Pinker gets one thing wrong at the end when he asserts what's known as the the ""hard problem of consciousness"" which his refers to as sentience. He also makes a misstatement about free will.""Sentience is not a combination of brain events or computational states.""""Free will is not a causal chain of events and states by definition.""This is frustrating because I feel like he ran a 3 minute mile but stopped just shy of the finish line!He's wrong on both counts.

81,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42189561-abu-hayat-khan,5,"there is two contending interpretation exists among academia on Darwinian Evolution: Gradualism vs Punctuated Equilibrium. they strikingly disagree on the question of “how a phenotypic trait evolves”. in gradualism (Richard Dawkins and others), any phenotype must have an Adaptive value (here the definition of ""adaptation"" is very strict, it means reproductive advantage only) i.e. a trait that increases the chance for more living offspring evolves slowly through selection pressure. on the other hand, proponent of punctuated equilibrium (Steven J Gould and other) don’t accept the idea of “adaptation”, rather they theorized something called“Exaptation”, which says that a trait may arise through natural selection for one purpose but later organism may find another way to use it which doesn’t give any survival value (i.e. doesn’t provide reproductive advantage). such traits or phenotypes are called evolutionary byproduct. Mr. Gould’s called them “Spandrel”. Spandrels of San Marco are famous for their beautiful art, but originally these spandrels were structural components of the basilica which later turned into artistic masterpieces. Unlike slow Adaptation, Exaptation happens in punctuated manner, i.e. out of sudden in the geological timescale. Epigenetics is considered to be one of the mechanisms for such punctuated evolution (please see, ""Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst"" by Robert M. Sapolsky).if we consider human mind as a phenotype that comes from an organ called the brain, and if the brain is an evolved organ through natural selection, which interpretation should we take to explain human mind? is mind adaptive? a trait that helps multiplying offspring? Or is mind exaptative, i.e. an evolutionary byproduct?in his influential book ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"", Daniel Kahneman demonstrated that human mind is by default irrational, rational thinking is a very expensive process hence turned off most of the time. instead, our brain uses shortcuts, know as heuristics or biases to solve any given situation. this line of research and academic findings tipped the view of human mind toward exaptationism. i.e. prominent view is that human mind is an evolutionary byproduct which explains why it is such irrational. in this view, it is considered that human mind was evolved to survive in predator-prey paradigm in which rational thinking would result in predation and death. our concept of art, music, language, etc is simply a byproduct of a formal survival machine called the brain. now enters Steven Pinker. Mr. Pinker argued that mind is an adaptive phenotype. so the only way to understand it is through evolutionary history not by chaos theory or reductionist physical approach. which implies that the irrational throughs are not useless at all. rather our cognition biases and irrationalities are very important to increase the change of our reproductive success. and that is exactly how human mind should work.I consider Steven Pinker and Gerard Diamond as the best two scientific writer of our time. other writers like Yuval Noah Harari, Richard Dawkins etc are popular but not even close to these two giants. in this book, Mr. Pinker destroyed exaptationism, though not without criticism. some of his descriptions just flown over my head, nonetheless, this book turns out to be the most informative book on evolution I've ever read."
82,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3583387-nebuchadnezzar,3,"The title of the book should have read ""How the Mind Works (According to Steven Pinker)."" The picture he paints is not wrong, per se, but vastly overestimates the power of current cognitive modeling.There is quite a bit of good material here reviewing computational theory of mind, modularity, evolutionary psychology, and related material in cognitive science written in Pinker's usual conversational style. However, I have to hop off the bandwagon at the halfway point on this one. Sure, computational theory of mind has produced a lot of fruitful research. The mind is, to some degree, modular. The brain, like all our other organs, is shaped by evolution. My main problem is in his jump from the modularity at ""low-level"" cognition (e.g., basic sensory input, certain parts of language) posited by Jerry A. Fodor to ""massive modularity."" There are some functions that are very localized in the brain that fit with modularity, but we would expect the brain to look very different if massive modularity were true. The brain is actually very plastic with many higher-order functions that aren't strictly localized. The same thing goes for his evolutionary explanations. I will happily agree that many cognitive systems and functions are adaptive -- having eyes and a visual system is obviously beneficial! When it comes to more complex social behaviors, we're in far more speculative territory.As an introduction to cognitive science, it does present the material in an accessible way. However, it will be difficult to for the layperson to pick apart where Pinker's description is backed by solid evidence and where it lapses into questionable claims and rank speculation. There's a bit of fluff, too, especially near the end when it begins to cross over into the more overt political rambling characteristic of The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature.Fodor's The Mind Doesn't Work That Way: The Scope and Limits of Computational Psychology (http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Abstracts/Fodo...) makes for a decent corrective, though I have problems with it as well. I'm in total agreement on one point with Fodor, though: When it comes to cognitive science, we're just getting started."

84,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/772528-ben,4,"A very good book, albeit not the quickest read ever.I’ve read a few popular science books and have been disappointed when they seem to rely more on anecdote than science -- ok, fine, what I really mean is I can’t stand Malcolm Gladwell. How the Mind Works certainly feels much more solidly founded in science while still maintaining the how-science-fits-into-real-life perspective of a popular science book.It’s not a perfect book. Given the enormous breadth of the topic that Pinker is attempting to cover, it’s forgivable, but still the book does drift occasionally into generalizations that seem more a subjective (though plausible) opinion than convincing fact. Given the great complexity he describes in the lower-level workings of the human brain, I felt surprised at how often he seemed to be over-simplifying higher-level human psychology; at the the same time, of course, I did realize he couldn’t preface every sentence with, “As a generalization that obviously does’t account for all specific details, ...” All in all, it was quite a good, convincing book that felt comfortingly more bound to science than some others I’ve read."
85,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2459318-deniz-cem-nduygu,5,"So many great paragraphs that they make up for a few places where he gets lazy and spells out conventions. As the number of notes I took goes, this book is a winner; in addition to all its original content, it has the best summaries I've encountered of many complex ideas/theories. He is remarkably devastating against standart social sciences and postmodernist thinking. The book may get a little monotone in the technical chapters, but it's a must-read for anyone interested in psychology, evolution, nature-nurture debates, or mundane questions like ""Why do men and women want different things?"". (No, the differences are not ""socially constructed"".)I just wish he was more open to the meme theory; then he could be perfect."
86,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6888635-ryan,4,"In order to understand ourselves and others in a meaningful and accurate way, we need to be informed on how the human mind works. Steven Pinker lucidly explains what we can know about how the mind works and why it happens to work the way it does. The explanations he presents are supported by fascinating experiments and observations from the fields of psychology, neuroscience, biology and anthropology.Reading this book requires a fair bit of grinding, but I think that some people who persist will find it deeply rewarding and satisfying. The paradigm presented in this book is interesting."
87,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4107783-paul-perry,5,"The best science writers have an understanding of the subject on which they write that is both deep and broad along with the ability to express these ideas in a way which is both clear and connects it with ideas and experiences that resonate with the general reader.

90,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12063010-rebee,1,This book is out of date. I chose not to waste any more time listening to it when I realized it was written in the mid 1990's. 
91,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7626390,3,"This was a good book overall, but it did not live up to my expectations, especially in the last few sections, which I felt were more like filler material; which is not to say that they were of little interest in and of themselves. I understand his need to make an argumentation in favor of evolutionary psychology, considering the current political climate and the constant denial of the existence of ""human nature"" on the extreme left, but I think it simply did not belong in this book.Apart from the section where the author detailed the human sense of vision, and how the brain processes visual information to build a 3D image of the environment (with all kinds of tricks and assumptions to solve problems that are technically unsolvable), in addition to the introduction of the Computational Theory of Mind, there was little talk of ""how the mind works"" actually. We learn more in this book about how the human brain might have evolved, and the environmental pressures to which it might have been subjected during that process, as well as the consequences of this evolution on human traits and behavior, than about the modules and processes within the brain that convert sensory data to meaningful information, actions, and qualia.There are whole sections dedicated to conflict between individuals, groups, sexes, parents and children, and how this might have directed our evolution, but little in the way of an explanation of what the brain is doing as it processes data about one's social standing, social relationships, etc, to generate emotions, actions, reactions and conscious decisions.The earlier sections about the modular and hierarchical nature of brain structures, and the combinatorial nature of its processes, were interesting as a refresher, but by no means offered any new ideas to me personally. The introduction and argumentation for CTM on the other hand left a greater impact on my intellect, and I'm enthused to learn more about it.Perhaps Pinker's relative failure in this book (compared to ""The Language Instinct"") is due to his attempt to tackle subjects outside of his area of expertise.That being said, it was still a enjoyable read, and was by no means devoid of good insights."
92,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2233542-mike,5,"It's hard to absorb and review a book this big. I think of it as something like a one semester college course. Some parts are very difficult and I can't say I understood them all, and others are just fun. But it's not really ""How the Mind Works"" in the sense I was looking for. I was hoping to learn how all those neurons, glia, synaps and axons work together to make thoughts and actions happen. That's not this book. This book is more about how natural selection (Pinker uses the word ""adaptation"" a lot) and the Computational Theory of the Mind result in the capabilities that our brains have, like vision, other senses, and solving problems. Much of the book is thought exercises (however clever) to suss out how a particular brain capability could have resulted in greater reproductive success. Along the way, you get a heavy dose of how amazing the mind is given the difficulty of the problems it can solve almost instantly. The penultimate chapter is all about sex and relationships (and decidedly un-PC), which is fun to read, but really strays from ""How the Mind Works"". In the last chapter, Pinker tackles, probably as well as anybody, the problems of mental activities that don't seem to have any evolutionary purpose, such as art, music and religion. Lastly, he discusses consciousness, somewhat unsuccessfully in my opinion, but who has ever tackled that one successfully?This book reminded me a lot of Jarad Diamond's writings, particularly ""The World Until Yesterday"". Like Pinker, Diamond believes *almost* all behavior and customs must serve some evolutionary purpose, i.e. increase the reproductive success of the practitioners. I can't blame these guys, after all, there is no other coherent scientific theory, but to be truthful, ""How the Mind Works"" sometimes made me doubt that the theory of evolution explains everything.I would love for Pinker to update this book. Written 20 years ago, I think he greatly underestimates the eventual capabilities of computers. While I agree that the mind is unlike any current computer, advances in AI, such as language recognition and visual interpretation might steer his thoughts in a different way."
93,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97471543-alessandro,5,"I prefer to hear the bad news before the good, so let’s begin with the negative feedback:Through the whole book, Pinker often engages with a certain subject by stating the inaccurateness by thinkers that are not mentioned. For example (p.509): ”Many intellectuals believe that primitive warfare is rare, mild and ritualized, or at least was so until the noble savages we're contaminated by contact with the Westerners. But this is romantic nonsense.” This argument is repeatedly used in the book as a way to introduce the various subjects. I would agree that we should directly mention other thinkers’ faults, instead of fabricating something less ”hurtful”. Secondly, Pinker often falls in his own traps. In one of his later books, The Sense of Style (2014), he introduced the book by stating one of the primary reasons for bad writing; the Curse of Knowledge. This cognitive bias refers to the phenomena that the knowledge that we have gathered becomes obvious: you forget the time you weren’t yet aware of that particular information, so you rest on the assumption that others presumably know it as well. In non-fiction books, we see this bias when the authors don’t explain concepts that are self-explanatory to them. You just can’t always predict what kind of readers will read your book. Just like (barely) every author of non-fiction books, Pinker also makes use of this bias. As a psychology student myself it’s less difficult (but I have to admit, I don’t know everything), but my dad who works in insurance had a hard time reading a few pages. As you can see, I gave this book five stars. So it can’t be all bad. Firstly, most of the (psychological) knowledge is still very relevant in today's psychological (and more importantly, political) environment, even though it’s at least 20 years old. Whether you like it or not, Pinker deserves credit for this. Many of the ‘assumptions’ that reviewers mention, about are equally as valuable after two decades. Some of these assumptions can’t be classified as assumptions anymore. The now politically incorrect value that some of the paragraphs hold (mostly in the chapter: Family Values) are very effective in debates that for example show the (biological/psychological/reproductive/etc.) differences between men and women. Lastly, as I’ve stated, I study psychology. This book was a great way to go over the different subjects and building on existing knowledge. The subjects can often be perceived as dull and technical. But Pinker does a great job by adding humor and information of different academic fields to make these subjects easily consumed. Incorporating various disciplines does not only tells you something about the interests of the author but also about (in this case) psychology itself: that psychology is not only composed of psychology. When Pinker writes about an economic concept, to me, it feels as like he is really interested in the whole discipline. This makes me want to read more different books on different subjects to increase my field of interest. The ’power’ to make you want to read more books is (for me) probably the most valuable feature of a book. Have a great new year’s eve! "
94,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98058161-daniel-solomon,5,"This may be the best books summarising the interaction of neural networks/neuroscience, psychology, biology and sociology that forms modern cognitive science for the non expert. In part, that's because there aren't that many books trying to do that.The key ideas are the computional theory of the mind/mind=brain as a computational system using inputs from reality and mental models and languages to generate mental representations/pictures that guide our answers and choices (but quite different in several ways from a digital computer), and natural selection/evolution generating a species/humans that specialise in survival due to superior cognitive abilities. There's also an introduction to neural networks as how the brain implements the mind, a decent discussion about consciousness, emotions, bounded rationality and cognitive biases, but those discussions are relatively short and the topics better covered in other later books (e.g Kahneman's Thinking Fast Thinking Slow for cognitive biases, Dahaene's Consciousness and the brain etc...).Much has been made about the power of artificial neural networks to learn and even outperform humans in some restricted domains, and the computational theory of mind and its focus on innate knowledge has been dismissed by some of the researchers involved. But behind the scenes many of those successes rely on good data that is similar to providing the networks to strongly informative Bayesian priors and state of the art AI is putting more emphasis on organising neural network learning via good models and the equivalent of innate knowledge or prior probabilities. The basic idea of a computational system processing inputs into various propositions/representations implemented by (deep) neural networks remains a decent synthesis, though the last 20 years (this book is from 1998) have seen big improvements in both neural networks and more structural models such Bayesian networks."

Nowadays we know how the brain works, we know how the parts are connected and what they produce in our bodies but we still know nothing of how the human mind works. What parts of the brain makes us be aware of the world and ourselves? are we really aware of ourselves? do other animals with similar brains have different type of awareness? why does our brain makes us enjoy sex? how come we invented music, art or religion if it serves to nothing from an evolutionary perspective? or perhaps it does serve to something? why did evolution gave way to love, hate, embarrassment, sarcasm? what do these types of feelings really do behind the curtains of our awareness of them ? why do we really laugh at a joke?.... These and more are questions answered in this book and I'm so excited that we can now talk about all this thanks to the evolution of artificial intelligence and the ""computational theory of mind""."

Even romantic love!! :)However, there was a point ~60,000 years ago when evolution (a very slow process that works over millions of years) became secondary in shaping the human mind who started to discover itself and the world around it. We were the first species to have such advanced mental faculties that moved on from solving survival problems to ask fundamental questions about the meaning of the world itself. The problem is our brain is not biologically built to answer these questions and therefore we probably need a different mind or type of mind (an AI maybe?) to attempt such answers."

My thesis is going to be something about music as language, so I was particularly interested in reading Pinker's ""The Language Instinct."" I stumbled upon HTMW before purchasing a copy of TLI, so I read HTMW first. It proved to be a valuable basis for understanding Pinker. I think Pinker might be surprised to hear that Scripture does not conflict with many of his beliefs (Scripture and science work well together - but that's another discussion). Here's an interesting issue: Pinker believes emotions to be adaptive (they were developed for survival and replication of the organism). He asserts that music is strictly a device for communicating emotions. He believes music is not adaptive (music does not aid in survival or replication of an organism). Does anyone see the problem here?"
98,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91751604-roy,4,"According to Dr. Pinker, the mind's functioning can be explained by the computational theory of mind, that is, the theory that the human mind is the product of complex neuronal activity shaped over thousands of generations through natural selection. This theory posits that the mind is comprised of specific problem solving modules each designed to tackle problems of survival. The book could have been titled the evolutionary theory of mind since much of it is focused on natural selection and the propagation of genes as an explanation for how human mental modules came to exist. It is an entertaining attempt to explain many facets of human behavior, but I think the book could have been half as long. Of particular interest is the final chapter in which he attempts to shed light on the arts, music, humor, religion, and philosophy. These areas of life he argues have little adaptive or survival value and he attempts to use the theory to understand why human beings hold these things in such high esteem. Finally, he presents the idea that perhaps the human brain did not evolve the capacity to solve the deepest mysteries of human existence."

I felt the first half of the book was a drag. There were a lot of places where analogies or explanations about computations the brain does were augmented with cultural references which I didn't care about or didn't understand. I thought that it muddied the point that was attempted to being made and didn't help me understand the overall structure of the chapter.The second half was an easier read since there isn't much of the computation explanation going on but, is still riddled with cultural references."

Other chapters, not so much; low-level vision science is woefully boring (that’s a personal preference though) and using evolutionary theory still remains a “grand theory of everything” that can be used as a post-hoc explanation of some but not all interpersonal phenomena."
101,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/251567-karen-ng,3,This book is a little harder to comprehend than other Pinker books... I will not recommend it as a neuroscience primer. Incognito by David Eagleman is so much better.

103,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/218323-becky,4,"Very interesting, well-written, and comprehensive. I appreciated the overview of both computational and evolutionary psychology in one tome of a book; computational psychology is pretty much awesome, and though I must confess that I skipped some of the technical examples in an effort to prevent my brain from breaking, Pinker's writing was for the most part clear and explanatory. I learned a lot!I would be interested to find out whether any of the specific evolutionary theories have become passe over the last ten years, since a great deal of new research must have come out since then. A second edition would be great if necessary.I still have reservations about the conclusion of the book. Basically, Pinker says that the computational view of the mind means that consciousness - the ability of the mind to actually experience stimulus and thought, like the taste of a strawberry or the redness of red - has no apparent function. People could go through the complex computational steps of mental activity without experiencing any of it. There is no way to prove that the person sitting next to you is not a ""philosophical zombie,"" who acts like they think and feel but is really just a mechanical thing.Not only does this mean I have no solid proof that all of you aren't just automatons, but no can explain why we experience things to begin with! Very perverse philosophers have attempted to argue that experience is an illusion, but of course this makes very little sense. Pinker is forced to conclude that our brains are just not smart enough to solve a peculiar problem like the nature of consciousness and self, along with some other potential philosophical problems like the possibility of absolute morality or the ability of language to refer to real things (don't understand the problem with this last one myself.)I'm not saying that I can prove Pinker is absolutely wrong in this conclusion, but it is deeply unsatisfying. Our minds are, apparently, the product of a lawful universe. Logic is able to tackle, if not solve, every other problem with which we have been presented, from pulsars to microorganisms. The only exception is strange, peripheral problem of where the universe came from to begin with. Why should our minds be another such exception? If we can't explain our minds as a logical evolutionary adaptation, doesn't that call into question evolutionary psychology as a theory? How could human awareness not be the product of evolution (the ultimate logical process)?Pinker tries to compare our failure to understand the mind to an autistic person's failure to understand the existence of other minds or a dog's colorblindness. But the problem with an autistic person, as I understand it, is not that they can't have the existence of other minds explained to them, but that they don't intuitively act as if they exist. Similarly, if the dog were more intelligent, they could obviously believe in and understand what color is, they just can't imagine what it is to see it. If we were blind to the nature of how sentience interacts with the rest of the universe, we should not realize that we have this blindness until it is explained to us. As it is, we are aware of a blindness and can't think of how to see what we know we know must be out there to be seen.Finally, if Pinker is right that science has failed us regarding the problem of human consciousness, it's rather questionable for him to argue that religious or mystical explanations are out of the question, because if that were so, it wouldn't be an unsolvable problem after all. Either the logical forces of the universe to which we are all accustomed are responsible for consciousness, or Something Else is. Pinker is right; it would be presumptuous and unscientific to call the Something Else God or Divine Energies or what have you. But we cannot discount these hypotheses outright, and the notion that our consciousnesses apparently work apart from the causation that is evolution at least means that the universe is a much stranger place than we have been led to believe. Really I would rather believe that my mind is the result of scientifically knowable causes, I like science, but if I am to believe Pinker, then another, very weird solution is out there.Very interesting read, but the ultimate difficulties brought up by the theories are much more frustrating than the elegant solutions they provide! Mostly I just don't like giving up on a scientific solution to a problem; it seems wrong."
104,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21015158-sam-caldwell,4,"I was surprised at just how comprehensive and compelling the two theories presented in the book are:1) the mind is an information processor, i.e. computer2) many characteristics of the mind can be explained in terms of the selective pressures on humans living as tribes of hunter/gatherers.Some bits that stand out are viewing emotions as facilitators of cooperation, in that they offer difficult-to-spoof insights to someone's state of mind. They also implement a doomsday-device-like deterrent; an infuriated person acts in a way that seems clearly not in their rational self-interest. The (credible) possibility of such a rage acts as a deterrent to those who might consider exploiting the subject.One thing I didn't like is the author's tendency to take potshots at different groups."

106,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,3,"To a large extent the answer to the books title is that we have learnt a lot but still have a long way to go! The first part of the book digs into the 'mechanics' of the brain and the mind that 'inhabits' it. Discussion of he phenomenon of concsiousness is undertaken early on and given a naturalistic solution later in the book, although it is not a very satisfying one. While I enjoyed he attempt to identify the mechanics of concsiousness, the 'answer' seemed to rely more on philosophy and a natural selection - based hypothesis about how it might work. Other chapters in the early part of the book were also concerned with mind mechanics, and the discussion of how we see and the way the mind gets involved is excellent, if mind bogglingly complex. In the latter part of the book, as refered to earlier, the flavour relies less on measured infofomation abou the brain, instead inferring what goes on through pschology studies interpreted with a natural selection lens. The arguments made are soundly reasoned and reveal uncomfortable truths for many idealist viewpoints on 'human nature' in both left and right camps. It certainly presents an alternative perspective that deeerves a more prominent place in public discussion, although it carries the risk of misinterpretation and abuse, and the message that ethics lies in a different sphere would need o be given equally clear emphasis. however, regarding the scientific underpinnings of the conclusions, these sections seemed lacking, - the argument seems to be ""because of our primitive survival and reproduction needs, our emotions are tuned to follow these basic intincts"". Connection with how this connects with the mind and how competing instincts are resolved was given little attention. The final chapter attemptsto explain the religious instinct and felt particularly ad hoc. Much of what I've wrtten is critical - the book was challengin and thought provoking. It is certainly worth a read although it is reatively long and requires some perserverance. There are a few other books around which may add to some of this (i is relatively old now - 10 years or so) and certainly makes GEB more concrete and as a reslut is prbably a good place to start for modern unerstanding of the brain."
107,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14237878-david-metting,5,"I'll admit it, the title drew me to this book, and, having finished reading the entire book, I can say it's pretty apt! I'm a liberal arts major who never even took Psych 101 and this tome did a great job filling me in about the different modes of the human mind. This book by turns fascinated me, astonished me, and caused me to marvel, all great things. Having a book kindle one's curiosity is always splendid, especially when the objects of that curiosity are the myriad amazing things our body does each moment of each day but whose wonder we become desensitized to. In HTMW we learn that ""The mind is not the brain, but what the brain does...The brain's special status comes from a special thing the brain does which makes us see, think, feel, choose and act. That special thing is information processing, or computation"" (24). Pinker bases his book on two scientific theories: the Computational Theory of Mind and Evolution through Natural Selection. Basically, he argues that the mind is an adaptation that evolved to help humans outwit the environment, animals, objects, and human beings. In the opening chapters he explains these theories, and then for the rest of the book applies them to several of the mind's many modules, such as: the visual system, ideas, personal emotions, social emotions, and philosophy, religion, art, and music (""Auditory cheesecake""). I learned a ridiculous amount from this book and often felt ecstatic reading it. His arguments are very convincing and copiously documented. And his prose is very rich and memorable. I re-read many sections in sheer delight and things stuck with me due to the engaging way he wrote them. I plan to re-read portions of this book for a long while to come. The chapter on personal emotions, ""Hotheads,"" was a highlight for me, looking at why we feel at all, where different feelings come from in our evolutionary past, and what emotions are and are for. He discusses all kinds of feelings such as anger, happiness, grief, and disgust. It's a fantastic chapter!Overall, this book enhanced my worldview through a detailed look at the human mind's inner workings and boosted my curiosity, both invaluable assets! I am looking forward to reading more of Mr. Pinker's works."
108,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1571969-billie-pritchett,4,"Steven Pinker's How the Mind Works is a long book and a Book about Everything. Although the title suggests it's a popular psychology book, the discoveries of psychology and especially psychology understood as evolutionary psychology are used to explain all aspects of human life. Most of the first part of the book is not technical but might be boring to its readers. For example, there's a long explanation about how vision works that was a complete snooze-fest. From about halfway on in the book, I think the readers would be interested. There, Pinker writes about how evolutionary psychology helps explain societies, and, later, our leisurely appreciation of beauty and excellence like that expressed in art or music.Part of what the book is driving at, although it is not expressed explicitly until a later work, The Blank Slate, is that the human mind is richly endowed with these innate faculties for understanding ourselves and the world but they are, by design, limited in the ways that they allow us to interpret the information we receive from the senses. Even our faculties for scientific discovery seem to have an upper limit on them. He proposes near the end of the book philosophical questions such as ""How can free will exist in a deterministic world?"" might be a mystery for our species because our brains weren't designed to handle that kind of question. The characters in the book Flatland are two-dimensional shapes who live in a two-dimensional world. Any person would be free to leave the world they live in called Flatland if only they left through the third dimension. But the people in flatland are only familiar with two dimensions: forward/backward and left/right. Their minds can ask the question but they could never understand what it would mean to move in a third dimension (up/down). Because of the human mind, we're in a similar position. No reason to be pessimistic, though: The human mind is awfully rich as it is."
109,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46497366-isabella-victoria,5,"How the mind works is a very interesting and eye opening book, What I liked about the book was that it talks about our biology, what is inside of us like our genes from our past ancestors and how that affects many generations in the lifestyle and decisions that they make. It also throws out there crazy concepts or that at least seem unordinary in our society such as raping individuals in our genes. What I also liked about the book was that it presented factual evidence on most of the topics discussed in the book. I also liked that it talked about evolution because that is one of my favorite topics to discuss and learn more information about because it astounds me how we can come from the forms that we come from and how we adapted to our environment and what we were exposed to. The thing that I didn't like about the book was that it came out bias in some aspect of the book just off the wording they were using, it seemed one sided at times and I like more when its holistic and you look at all the different aspects and keep your opinions to yourself that others may be sensitive to in a way. I learned a lot from the book such as the mind is so complex it holds within it what your ancestors may have embedded in your brain and what knowledge and information you have obtained through the years. Learn to understand the scientific side of life. Yes I would recommend this book to others because it gave me an array of information in just this 500 page book that I might have never learned in school because our system is censored at time and they don't like to discuss a lot of different challenging topics."
110,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3286533-jurij-fedorov,5,"Steven Pinker is a world famous liberal evolutionary psychologist. As most intellectually focused psychologists I try to read everything he writes. It's the basic psychology science presented in a simple but intellectual way.Pro:This is a huge book. It really goes into a lot of psychology topics and most of them are well illustrated. It's one of those books that is a bit hard to get into and read, but you want to read it again because there are so many good nuggets here. I feel like I may have missed a few great points.Con:If you have read a few evolutionary psychology books this will feel very familiar in many chapters. I was zoning out quite often as I he kept presenting topics I already had read about like mating, men, women and basic psychology. This also means that it's a great intro book into psychology. I will for sure recommend it to people getting into the field.Another thing is that it's a bit old. He is often talking about blank slate thinking and how it's bunk science, but old psychology is often more blank slate than current psychology. Since the 90's we have had a lot of gene and heritability studies that showed that most of the factors we thought were mostly environment are actually mostly genetic. Politics, personality, parenting, intelligence. We have had a lot of great studies on the heritability of these traits and they really ought to be included in such a book. It does feel a bit environment focused and it's predictable for a book this old. But it's not the end of the road for psychology knowledge anyhow and you ought to continue reading up on it. For anyone reading up on modern psychology this is it, but presented from a slight liberal view point which probably makes it a great intro book for people who are left of center and have a hard time getting into the hard science.It's a typical Pinker book. If you like his writing it's a must read for you."
111,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,4,"'How the Mind Works' is an ambitious book. Pinker addresses an insane medley of topics: if it pertains to the mind in any way whatsoever, it's fair game. This variety of topics discussed is the books greatest strength, but also it primary weakness.Firstly, the bad: this book isn't clearly connected by an overarching thesis. I suppose everything has to do with 'the mind' - though this is debatable, as there are long stretches where you'll be prone to forget this book is supposed to be about 'how the mind works'. If each of the 8 chapters (some of which span upwards of a 100 pages) had been published as a self-contained book, no one would have been the wiser. In this sense, some cohesion would have been nice. The material is presented in a somewhat haphazard manner.Now then, onto the good: the material presented is totally awesome. Pinker is a terrific writer, and just about everything covered in 'How the Mind Works' was intensely interesting. And cover a lot he does: you'll read about your brain's insane ability to make sense of visual input; about the importance of 'irrational' emotions (and why they're not so irrational after all); and about the evolutionary underpinning of sexuality, to name a few topics of interest. I didn't agree with everything said, and some of his opinions, presented as fact, are decidedly controversial. But most importantly, all of the topics were interesting, and his conclusions are almost always well supported. 'How the Mind Works' was never boring, and that's high praise for a book of this scope.Should you read this book? Maybe. It's pretty ambitious, and unless you're fairly stoked about the material, you might be better of finding something more focused and concise. But if you're willing to take the plunge, you're in for a treat - How the Mind Works is an intellectual tour de force."

This quote has chased me around my high school years like a leopard hounding after its prey. Ever since my youth, I have noticed my skepticism on the human capsule. I often wondered if rigorous science labs brought up such an idea as the human mind. Although, childhood beliefs kept my thoughts grounded to an absolute that a grater power was the innovator. How The Mind Works was food for my thoughts. Steven pinker did not answer all of my unending questions but did satisfy some of my mysteries. He starts off by stating about the importance of the cognitive niche. He also states how vision is one of the many factors that have allowed our minds to go to such far extents. I do agree with him in this. Vision has allowed us to make buildings as high as mountains, paintings that capture feelings, and better yet help us find a mate. In the book he explains illusions and different visionary test to see how our mind correlates to our brain and mind. The human mind has been a topic of discussion for over many centuries and I believe Steven Pinker simplified the structure of it in a way that's both enjoyable and informative. Although Pinker had such a great way of easing us into the wonders of the mind, he worked too much on certain topics such as individuality. He did not believe that culture, race, etc.... plays a part in our molding decisions throughout our lives. Those who wonder off into the next levels of the mind's philosophy should read this book. I highly recommend to any who is skeptical about how everything comes together. In the way that this book has helped many readers, it has also helped me add to my knowledge of the mind and the little details that come together to make it up."
113,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3239706-gordon,3,"A daunting book for the casual reader. I found most of the chapters individually readable, interesting, often controversial. But, there were few transitions from one theme to another, which I found distracting. Steven Pinker's overall thesis is that the mind is a neural-based computer that reflects the results of evolutionary psychology - meaning that the basis of much of what we do and why we do it has its roots in our historical hunter-gather origins and how we have evolved (through adaptive, natural selection) since. Pinker does not present a unifying theory of the mind, but does present interesting examples of many aspects of human behavior that he aptly explains according to his evolutionary gene-based model. I found much of what he said logical and believable, although some of the sections were less convincing than others. He spends an inordinate amount of pages on explaining gender, and by extension societal, behavior, which I found more entertaining than completely solid. The most controversial claims that Pinker makes have to do with his thoughts on the arts and religion. Pinker states that the arts have no intrinsic evolutionary value, but are outcomes of our desire for pleasure. Similarly he concludes that religion does not contribute to explaining how our brain has evolved and argues strongly against ""creationism"" and the value of religion in general. I'll conclude by sharing a quote from Pinker's book that sums up his thesis “human brains evolved by one set of laws, those of natural selection and genetics, and now interact with one another according to another set of laws, those of cognitive and social psychology, human ecology, and history”."
114,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23344184-sudnya,4,"Note that this book was written in the nineties before reading the book or this review.This book raised more questions than answers for me but that is not necessarily a bad thing.Pinker covers a wide range of topics from biological, anthropological to social constructs that have shaped our human mind and behavior. I found the chapter about the place of humor in evolution fascinating (maybe cause I have never read about it before). This book also clarified the notion of Richard Dawkin's 'selfish gene' in a broader context than just biological/evolutionary i.e. it is not animals that are selfish due to their selfish genes rather that their brains and behaviors are designed by the influence of the selfish genes. At times they will, in fact, make sacrifices which might seem altruistic from a societal perspective.Overall this huge book was quite difficult to digest and should be paced to read and ponder upon. It won't answer your questions but will provide a good framework to explore the questions whose answers you seek.The reason I knocked off a star was because I felt like it ended a bit abruptly when it was time to discuss human consciousness. It is a tall order to expect the author to provide answers but I wish he spent more time talking about it."
115,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49863781-steve,4,"Written by one of the world's foremost cognitive scientists, it's an eight-chapter deep dive on the human mind and how it functions. Starts with the physiological properties of the brain and its components - how language is processed, how physical environments are understood - and slowly transitions to the more abstract notion of the mind, including human behavior and evolutionary theories about how we got to be the way we are. I'm reasonably interested in psychology and social studies and evolutionary biology, and as such, I found the second half a lot more page-turning than the first - especially since Pinker uses all kinds of unfortunately dated computer analogies early on that were surely more apt back in 1997 than they are today. (An updated version of this book might be able to milk a lot more out of ""computational algorithm"" metaphors, particularly given the huge advancements made in artificial intelligence and machine learning over the last two decades.) Still a fascinating read with plenty to offer, and if you ever get a chance, check out some of Pinker's lectures and debates on YouTube. The guy's pretty good at what he does!"
116,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2815504-isaac-kerson,1,"This book has been made mostly completely obsolete by the field of epigenetics. The type of genetic (over) determinism espoused here was always questionable -- the author tries to explain 90% of human behavior through the narrow lense of the ""selfish gene"" -- but, epigenetics has shown that environmental factors can cause the body to put certain genetic expressions on hold for generations. The idea of genetic determinism if not flatout wrong, is at the very least deeply flawed. This is too bad because the book starts (Chapters 1 & 2) with an interesting and still-relevant discussion of modular brain functions, before it spins off into fantastic, disproven speculations which to a large extent are only tangentially related to ""How the Mind Works"". Your average Wikipedia page is better sourced than the last 5 chapters of this book. Not worth your time. Instead read: How Emotions are Made, The Ego Tunnel, or The Epigenetics Revolution"

The first section of the book, which analyzes how the brain is like a computer, is a bit of a slog. In some ways it was the most interesting for me, however, since everything he dealt with was new and cutting edge. If you get through that part the rest is a real page turner. For about a month this book turned me into a Steven Pinker quote machine (""Emotions are just a doomsday device!"", ""Marriage is just mate-socialsm!"") This, of course, makes you either highly fascinating, or the most annoying person on Earth, depending on who you talk to. Either way, I highly recommend this book.

It builds mental models and frameworks with strong explanatory power for understanding the human mind. This book impacts the way you view your own behaviour and the behaviour of others by exposing you to a deeper evolution-based grounding to the very complex topic of the human mind.It is a big book containing just 8 chapters approaching 80-100 pages each . The conclusions arrived at bring insight and enlightenment and are well worth the journey - but be warned - many of these conclusions are preceded by the slow and careful development of ideas, which on occasion can be painstakingly dreary to the reader with non-specialist expertise in this topic (e.g. me). However, the journey (even the dreary bits) is worth it - this book can open your mind - there is much to be gained in reading it."

I enjoyed mostly the chapter that mentioned how we would convince aliens that we are intelligent beings if they were to arrive. How they would differentiate us from cats and dogs and animals. It also answers questions about why robots cannot be created and I recommend it because it asks some questions that I have not really thought about before and it was very interesting to view the perspective of Steven Pinker since it very much is not similar to mine."

121,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7626390,3,"This was a good book overall, but it did not live up to my expectations, especially in the last few sections, which I felt were more like filler material; which is not to say that they were of little interest in and of themselves. I understand his need to make an argumentation in favor of evolutionary psychology, considering the current political climate and the constant denial of the existence of ""human nature"" on the extreme left, but I think it simply did not belong in this book.Apart from the section where the author detailed the human sense of vision, and how the brain processes visual information to build a 3D image of the environment (with all kinds of tricks and assumptions to solve problems that are technically unsolvable), in addition to the introduction of the Computational Theory of Mind, there was little talk of ""how the mind works"" actually. We learn more in this book about how the human brain might have evolved, and the environmental pressures to which it might have been subjected during that process, as well as the consequences of this evolution on human traits and behavior, than about the modules and processes within the brain that convert sensory data to meaningful information, actions, and qualia.There are whole sections dedicated to conflict between individuals, groups, sexes, parents and children, and how this might have directed our evolution, but little in the way of an explanation of what the brain is doing as it processes data about one's social standing, social relationships, etc, to generate emotions, actions, reactions and conscious decisions.The earlier sections about the modular and hierarchical nature of brain structures, and the combinatorial nature of its processes, were interesting as a refresher, but by no means offered any new ideas to me personally. The introduction and argumentation for CTM on the other hand left a greater impact on my intellect, and I'm enthused to learn more about it.Perhaps Pinker's relative failure in this book (compared to ""The Language Instinct"") is due to his attempt to tackle subjects outside of his area of expertise.That being said, it was still a enjoyable read, and was by no means devoid of good insights."
122,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2233542-mike,5,"It's hard to absorb and review a book this big. I think of it as something like a one semester college course. Some parts are very difficult and I can't say I understood them all, and others are just fun. But it's not really ""How the Mind Works"" in the sense I was looking for. I was hoping to learn how all those neurons, glia, synaps and axons work together to make thoughts and actions happen. That's not this book. This book is more about how natural selection (Pinker uses the word ""adaptation"" a lot) and the Computational Theory of the Mind result in the capabilities that our brains have, like vision, other senses, and solving problems. Much of the book is thought exercises (however clever) to suss out how a particular brain capability could have resulted in greater reproductive success. Along the way, you get a heavy dose of how amazing the mind is given the difficulty of the problems it can solve almost instantly. The penultimate chapter is all about sex and relationships (and decidedly un-PC), which is fun to read, but really strays from ""How the Mind Works"". In the last chapter, Pinker tackles, probably as well as anybody, the problems of mental activities that don't seem to have any evolutionary purpose, such as art, music and religion. Lastly, he discusses consciousness, somewhat unsuccessfully in my opinion, but who has ever tackled that one successfully?This book reminded me a lot of Jarad Diamond's writings, particularly ""The World Until Yesterday"". Like Pinker, Diamond believes *almost* all behavior and customs must serve some evolutionary purpose, i.e. increase the reproductive success of the practitioners. I can't blame these guys, after all, there is no other coherent scientific theory, but to be truthful, ""How the Mind Works"" sometimes made me doubt that the theory of evolution explains everything.I would love for Pinker to update this book. Written 20 years ago, I think he greatly underestimates the eventual capabilities of computers. While I agree that the mind is unlike any current computer, advances in AI, such as language recognition and visual interpretation might steer his thoughts in a different way."
123,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97471543-alessandro,5,"I prefer to hear the bad news before the good, so let’s begin with the negative feedback:Through the whole book, Pinker often engages with a certain subject by stating the inaccurateness by thinkers that are not mentioned. For example (p.509): ”Many intellectuals believe that primitive warfare is rare, mild and ritualized, or at least was so until the noble savages we're contaminated by contact with the Westerners. But this is romantic nonsense.” This argument is repeatedly used in the book as a way to introduce the various subjects. I would agree that we should directly mention other thinkers’ faults, instead of fabricating something less ”hurtful”. Secondly, Pinker often falls in his own traps. In one of his later books, The Sense of Style (2014), he introduced the book by stating one of the primary reasons for bad writing; the Curse of Knowledge. This cognitive bias refers to the phenomena that the knowledge that we have gathered becomes obvious: you forget the time you weren’t yet aware of that particular information, so you rest on the assumption that others presumably know it as well. In non-fiction books, we see this bias when the authors don’t explain concepts that are self-explanatory to them. You just can’t always predict what kind of readers will read your book. Just like (barely) every author of non-fiction books, Pinker also makes use of this bias. As a psychology student myself it’s less difficult (but I have to admit, I don’t know everything), but my dad who works in insurance had a hard time reading a few pages. As you can see, I gave this book five stars. So it can’t be all bad. Firstly, most of the (psychological) knowledge is still very relevant in today's psychological (and more importantly, political) environment, even though it’s at least 20 years old. Whether you like it or not, Pinker deserves credit for this. Many of the ‘assumptions’ that reviewers mention, about are equally as valuable after two decades. Some of these assumptions can’t be classified as assumptions anymore. The now politically incorrect value that some of the paragraphs hold (mostly in the chapter: Family Values) are very effective in debates that for example show the (biological/psychological/reproductive/etc.) differences between men and women. Lastly, as I’ve stated, I study psychology. This book was a great way to go over the different subjects and building on existing knowledge. The subjects can often be perceived as dull and technical. But Pinker does a great job by adding humor and information of different academic fields to make these subjects easily consumed. Incorporating various disciplines does not only tells you something about the interests of the author but also about (in this case) psychology itself: that psychology is not only composed of psychology. When Pinker writes about an economic concept, to me, it feels as like he is really interested in the whole discipline. This makes me want to read more different books on different subjects to increase my field of interest. The ’power’ to make you want to read more books is (for me) probably the most valuable feature of a book. Have a great new year’s eve! "
124,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98058161-daniel-solomon,5,"This may be the best books summarising the interaction of neural networks/neuroscience, psychology, biology and sociology that forms modern cognitive science for the non expert. In part, that's because there aren't that many books trying to do that.The key ideas are the computional theory of the mind/mind=brain as a computational system using inputs from reality and mental models and languages to generate mental representations/pictures that guide our answers and choices (but quite different in several ways from a digital computer), and natural selection/evolution generating a species/humans that specialise in survival due to superior cognitive abilities. There's also an introduction to neural networks as how the brain implements the mind, a decent discussion about consciousness, emotions, bounded rationality and cognitive biases, but those discussions are relatively short and the topics better covered in other later books (e.g Kahneman's Thinking Fast Thinking Slow for cognitive biases, Dahaene's Consciousness and the brain etc...).Much has been made about the power of artificial neural networks to learn and even outperform humans in some restricted domains, and the computational theory of mind and its focus on innate knowledge has been dismissed by some of the researchers involved. But behind the scenes many of those successes rely on good data that is similar to providing the networks to strongly informative Bayesian priors and state of the art AI is putting more emphasis on organising neural network learning via good models and the equivalent of innate knowledge or prior probabilities. The basic idea of a computational system processing inputs into various propositions/representations implemented by (deep) neural networks remains a decent synthesis, though the last 20 years (this book is from 1998) have seen big improvements in both neural networks and more structural models such Bayesian networks."

Nowadays we know how the brain works, we know how the parts are connected and what they produce in our bodies but we still know nothing of how the human mind works. What parts of the brain makes us be aware of the world and ourselves? are we really aware of ourselves? do other animals with similar brains have different type of awareness? why does our brain makes us enjoy sex? how come we invented music, art or religion if it serves to nothing from an evolutionary perspective? or perhaps it does serve to something? why did evolution gave way to love, hate, embarrassment, sarcasm? what do these types of feelings really do behind the curtains of our awareness of them ? why do we really laugh at a joke?.... These and more are questions answered in this book and I'm so excited that we can now talk about all this thanks to the evolution of artificial intelligence and the ""computational theory of mind""."
126,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7807167-ayman,5,"This book explains how the human brain feels and thinks from an evolutionary biology stand point. How we see, smell, hear, perceive, abstract and memorize has all been shaped by tangible survival needs of our ancestors. However, the surprising and interesting part of the book is about how our emotions and social skills were also a product of evolution. Even romantic love!! :)However, there was a point ~60,000 years ago when evolution (a very slow process that works over millions of years) became secondary in shaping the human mind who started to discover itself and the world around it. We were the first species to have such advanced mental faculties that moved on from solving survival problems to ask fundamental questions about the meaning of the world itself. The problem is our brain is not biologically built to answer these questions and therefore we probably need a different mind or type of mind (an AI maybe?) to attempt such answers."
127,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52456731-lynn-derks,5,"As of this post, I am pursuing an M.A. in music and worship. My thesis is going to be something about music as language, so I was particularly interested in reading Pinker's ""The Language Instinct."" I stumbled upon HTMW before purchasing a copy of TLI, so I read HTMW first. It proved to be a valuable basis for understanding Pinker. I think Pinker might be surprised to hear that Scripture does not conflict with many of his beliefs (Scripture and science work well together - but that's another discussion). Here's an interesting issue: Pinker believes emotions to be adaptive (they were developed for survival and replication of the organism). He asserts that music is strictly a device for communicating emotions. He believes music is not adaptive (music does not aid in survival or replication of an organism). Does anyone see the problem here?"
128,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91751604-roy,4,"According to Dr. Pinker, the mind's functioning can be explained by the computational theory of mind, that is, the theory that the human mind is the product of complex neuronal activity shaped over thousands of generations through natural selection. This theory posits that the mind is comprised of specific problem solving modules each designed to tackle problems of survival. The book could have been titled the evolutionary theory of mind since much of it is focused on natural selection and the propagation of genes as an explanation for how human mental modules came to exist. It is an entertaining attempt to explain many facets of human behavior, but I think the book could have been half as long. Of particular interest is the final chapter in which he attempts to shed light on the arts, music, humor, religion, and philosophy. These areas of life he argues have little adaptive or survival value and he attempts to use the theory to understand why human beings hold these things in such high esteem. Finally, he presents the idea that perhaps the human brain did not evolve the capacity to solve the deepest mysteries of human existence."

I felt the first half of the book was a drag. There were a lot of places where analogies or explanations about computations the brain does were augmented with cultural references which I didn't care about or didn't understand. I thought that it muddied the point that was attempted to being made and didn't help me understand the overall structure of the chapter.The second half was an easier read since there isn't much of the computation explanation going on but, is still riddled with cultural references."

Other chapters, not so much; low-level vision science is woefully boring (that’s a personal preference though) and using evolutionary theory still remains a “grand theory of everything” that can be used as a post-hoc explanation of some but not all interpersonal phenomena."
131,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/251567-karen-ng,3,This book is a little harder to comprehend than other Pinker books... I will not recommend it as a neuroscience primer. Incognito by David Eagleman is so much better.

133,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/218323-becky,4,"Very interesting, well-written, and comprehensive. I appreciated the overview of both computational and evolutionary psychology in one tome of a book; computational psychology is pretty much awesome, and though I must confess that I skipped some of the technical examples in an effort to prevent my brain from breaking, Pinker's writing was for the most part clear and explanatory. I learned a lot!I would be interested to find out whether any of the specific evolutionary theories have become passe over the last ten years, since a great deal of new research must have come out since then. A second edition would be great if necessary.I still have reservations about the conclusion of the book. Basically, Pinker says that the computational view of the mind means that consciousness - the ability of the mind to actually experience stimulus and thought, like the taste of a strawberry or the redness of red - has no apparent function. People could go through the complex computational steps of mental activity without experiencing any of it. There is no way to prove that the person sitting next to you is not a ""philosophical zombie,"" who acts like they think and feel but is really just a mechanical thing.Not only does this mean I have no solid proof that all of you aren't just automatons, but no can explain why we experience things to begin with! Very perverse philosophers have attempted to argue that experience is an illusion, but of course this makes very little sense. Pinker is forced to conclude that our brains are just not smart enough to solve a peculiar problem like the nature of consciousness and self, along with some other potential philosophical problems like the possibility of absolute morality or the ability of language to refer to real things (don't understand the problem with this last one myself.)I'm not saying that I can prove Pinker is absolutely wrong in this conclusion, but it is deeply unsatisfying. Our minds are, apparently, the product of a lawful universe. Logic is able to tackle, if not solve, every other problem with which we have been presented, from pulsars to microorganisms. The only exception is strange, peripheral problem of where the universe came from to begin with. Why should our minds be another such exception? If we can't explain our minds as a logical evolutionary adaptation, doesn't that call into question evolutionary psychology as a theory? How could human awareness not be the product of evolution (the ultimate logical process)?Pinker tries to compare our failure to understand the mind to an autistic person's failure to understand the existence of other minds or a dog's colorblindness. But the problem with an autistic person, as I understand it, is not that they can't have the existence of other minds explained to them, but that they don't intuitively act as if they exist. Similarly, if the dog were more intelligent, they could obviously believe in and understand what color is, they just can't imagine what it is to see it. If we were blind to the nature of how sentience interacts with the rest of the universe, we should not realize that we have this blindness until it is explained to us. As it is, we are aware of a blindness and can't think of how to see what we know we know must be out there to be seen.Finally, if Pinker is right that science has failed us regarding the problem of human consciousness, it's rather questionable for him to argue that religious or mystical explanations are out of the question, because if that were so, it wouldn't be an unsolvable problem after all. Either the logical forces of the universe to which we are all accustomed are responsible for consciousness, or Something Else is. Pinker is right; it would be presumptuous and unscientific to call the Something Else God or Divine Energies or what have you. But we cannot discount these hypotheses outright, and the notion that our consciousnesses apparently work apart from the causation that is evolution at least means that the universe is a much stranger place than we have been led to believe. Really I would rather believe that my mind is the result of scientifically knowable causes, I like science, but if I am to believe Pinker, then another, very weird solution is out there.Very interesting read, but the ultimate difficulties brought up by the theories are much more frustrating than the elegant solutions they provide! Mostly I just don't like giving up on a scientific solution to a problem; it seems wrong."
134,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21015158-sam-caldwell,4,"I was surprised at just how comprehensive and compelling the two theories presented in the book are:1) the mind is an information processor, i.e. computer2) many characteristics of the mind can be explained in terms of the selective pressures on humans living as tribes of hunter/gatherers.Some bits that stand out are viewing emotions as facilitators of cooperation, in that they offer difficult-to-spoof insights to someone's state of mind. They also implement a doomsday-device-like deterrent; an infuriated person acts in a way that seems clearly not in their rational self-interest. The (credible) possibility of such a rage acts as a deterrent to those who might consider exploiting the subject.One thing I didn't like is the author's tendency to take potshots at different groups."

136,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,3,"To a large extent the answer to the books title is that we have learnt a lot but still have a long way to go! The first part of the book digs into the 'mechanics' of the brain and the mind that 'inhabits' it. Discussion of he phenomenon of concsiousness is undertaken early on and given a naturalistic solution later in the book, although it is not a very satisfying one. While I enjoyed he attempt to identify the mechanics of concsiousness, the 'answer' seemed to rely more on philosophy and a natural selection - based hypothesis about how it might work. Other chapters in the early part of the book were also concerned with mind mechanics, and the discussion of how we see and the way the mind gets involved is excellent, if mind bogglingly complex. In the latter part of the book, as refered to earlier, the flavour relies less on measured infofomation abou the brain, instead inferring what goes on through pschology studies interpreted with a natural selection lens. The arguments made are soundly reasoned and reveal uncomfortable truths for many idealist viewpoints on 'human nature' in both left and right camps. It certainly presents an alternative perspective that deeerves a more prominent place in public discussion, although it carries the risk of misinterpretation and abuse, and the message that ethics lies in a different sphere would need o be given equally clear emphasis. however, regarding the scientific underpinnings of the conclusions, these sections seemed lacking, - the argument seems to be ""because of our primitive survival and reproduction needs, our emotions are tuned to follow these basic intincts"". Connection with how this connects with the mind and how competing instincts are resolved was given little attention. The final chapter attemptsto explain the religious instinct and felt particularly ad hoc. Much of what I've wrtten is critical - the book was challengin and thought provoking. It is certainly worth a read although it is reatively long and requires some perserverance. There are a few other books around which may add to some of this (i is relatively old now - 10 years or so) and certainly makes GEB more concrete and as a reslut is prbably a good place to start for modern unerstanding of the brain."

I'm a liberal arts major who never even took Psych 101 and this tome did a great job filling me in about the different modes of the human mind. This book by turns fascinated me, astonished me, and caused me to marvel, all great things. Having a book kindle one's curiosity is always splendid, especially when the objects of that curiosity are the myriad amazing things our body does each moment of each day but whose wonder we become desensitized to. In HTMW we learn that ""The mind is not the brain, but what the brain does...The brain's special status comes from a special thing the brain does which makes us see, think, feel, choose and act. That special thing is information processing, or computation"" (24). Pinker bases his book on two scientific theories: the Computational Theory of Mind and Evolution through Natural Selection. Basically, he argues that the mind is an adaptation that evolved to help humans outwit the environment, animals, objects, and human beings. In the opening chapters he explains these theories, and then for the rest of the book applies them to several of the mind's many modules, such as: the visual system, ideas, personal emotions, social emotions, and philosophy, religion, art, and music (""Auditory cheesecake""). I learned a ridiculous amount from this book and often felt ecstatic reading it. His arguments are very convincing and copiously documented. And his prose is very rich and memorable. I re-read many sections in sheer delight and things stuck with me due to the engaging way he wrote them. I plan to re-read portions of this book for a long while to come. The chapter on personal emotions, ""Hotheads,"" was a highlight for me, looking at why we feel at all, where different feelings come from in our evolutionary past, and what emotions are and are for. He discusses all kinds of feelings such as anger, happiness, grief, and disgust. It's a fantastic chapter!Overall, this book enhanced my worldview through a detailed look at the human mind's inner workings and boosted my curiosity, both invaluable assets! I am looking forward to reading more of Mr. Pinker's works."
138,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1571969-billie-pritchett,4,"Steven Pinker's How the Mind Works is a long book and a Book about Everything. Although the title suggests it's a popular psychology book, the discoveries of psychology and especially psychology understood as evolutionary psychology are used to explain all aspects of human life. Most of the first part of the book is not technical but might be boring to its readers. For example, there's a long explanation about how vision works that was a complete snooze-fest. From about halfway on in the book, I think the readers would be interested. There, Pinker writes about how evolutionary psychology helps explain societies, and, later, our leisurely appreciation of beauty and excellence like that expressed in art or music.Part of what the book is driving at, although it is not expressed explicitly until a later work, The Blank Slate, is that the human mind is richly endowed with these innate faculties for understanding ourselves and the world but they are, by design, limited in the ways that they allow us to interpret the information we receive from the senses. Even our faculties for scientific discovery seem to have an upper limit on them. He proposes near the end of the book philosophical questions such as ""How can free will exist in a deterministic world?"" might be a mystery for our species because our brains weren't designed to handle that kind of question. The characters in the book Flatland are two-dimensional shapes who live in a two-dimensional world. Any person would be free to leave the world they live in called Flatland if only they left through the third dimension. But the people in flatland are only familiar with two dimensions: forward/backward and left/right. Their minds can ask the question but they could never understand what it would mean to move in a third dimension (up/down). Because of the human mind, we're in a similar position. No reason to be pessimistic, though: The human mind is awfully rich as it is."

It also throws out there crazy concepts or that at least seem unordinary in our society such as raping individuals in our genes. What I also liked about the book was that it presented factual evidence on most of the topics discussed in the book. I also liked that it talked about evolution because that is one of my favorite topics to discuss and learn more information about because it astounds me how we can come from the forms that we come from and how we adapted to our environment and what we were exposed to. The thing that I didn't like about the book was that it came out bias in some aspect of the book just off the wording they were using, it seemed one sided at times and I like more when its holistic and you look at all the different aspects and keep your opinions to yourself that others may be sensitive to in a way. I learned a lot from the book such as the mind is so complex it holds within it what your ancestors may have embedded in your brain and what knowledge and information you have obtained through the years. Learn to understand the scientific side of life. Yes I would recommend this book to others because it gave me an array of information in just this 500 page book that I might have never learned in school because our system is censored at time and they don't like to discuss a lot of different challenging topics."

As most intellectually focused psychologists I try to read everything he writes. It's the basic psychology science presented in a simple but intellectual way.Pro:This is a huge book. It really goes into a lot of psychology topics and most of them are well illustrated. It's one of those books that is a bit hard to get into and read, but you want to read it again because there are so many good nuggets here. I feel like I may have missed a few great points.Con:If you have read a few evolutionary psychology books this will feel very familiar in many chapters. I was zoning out quite often as I he kept presenting topics I already had read about like mating, men, women and basic psychology. This also means that it's a great intro book into psychology. I will for sure recommend it to people getting into the field.Another thing is that it's a bit old. He is often talking about blank slate thinking and how it's bunk science, but old psychology is often more blank slate than current psychology. Since the 90's we have had a lot of gene and heritability studies that showed that most of the factors we thought were mostly environment are actually mostly genetic. Politics, personality, parenting, intelligence. We have had a lot of great studies on the heritability of these traits and they really ought to be included in such a book. It does feel a bit environment focused and it's predictable for a book this old. But it's not the end of the road for psychology knowledge anyhow and you ought to continue reading up on it. For anyone reading up on modern psychology this is it, but presented from a slight liberal view point which probably makes it a great intro book for people who are left of center and have a hard time getting into the hard science.It's a typical Pinker book.

Pinker addresses an insane medley of topics: if it pertains to the mind in any way whatsoever, it's fair game. This variety of topics discussed is the books greatest strength, but also it primary weakness.Firstly, the bad: this book isn't clearly connected by an overarching thesis. I suppose everything has to do with 'the mind' - though this is debatable, as there are long stretches where you'll be prone to forget this book is supposed to be about 'how the mind works'. If each of the 8 chapters (some of which span upwards of a 100 pages) had been published as a self-contained book, no one would have been the wiser. In this sense, some cohesion would have been nice. The material is presented in a somewhat haphazard manner.Now then, onto the good: the material presented is totally awesome. Pinker is a terrific writer, and just about everything covered in 'How the Mind Works' was intensely interesting. And cover a lot he does: you'll read about your brain's insane ability to make sense of visual input; about the importance of 'irrational' emotions (and why they're not so irrational after all); and about the evolutionary underpinning of sexuality, to name a few topics of interest. I didn't agree with everything said, and some of his opinions, presented as fact, are decidedly controversial. But most importantly, all of the topics were interesting, and his conclusions are almost always well supported. 'How the Mind Works' was never boring, and that's high praise for a book of this scope.Should you read this book? Maybe. It's pretty ambitious, and unless you're fairly stoked about the material, you might be better of finding something more focused and concise. But if you're willing to take the plunge, you're in for a treat - How the Mind Works is an intellectual tour de force."

This quote has chased me around my high school years like a leopard hounding after its prey. Ever since my youth, I have noticed my skepticism on the human capsule. I often wondered if rigorous science labs brought up such an idea as the human mind. Although, childhood beliefs kept my thoughts grounded to an absolute that a grater power was the innovator. How The Mind Works was food for my thoughts. Steven pinker did not answer all of my unending questions but did satisfy some of my mysteries. He starts off by stating about the importance of the cognitive niche. He also states how vision is one of the many factors that have allowed our minds to go to such far extents. I do agree with him in this. Vision has allowed us to make buildings as high as mountains, paintings that capture feelings, and better yet help us find a mate. In the book he explains illusions and different visionary test to see how our mind correlates to our brain and mind. The human mind has been a topic of discussion for over many centuries and I believe Steven Pinker simplified the structure of it in a way that's both enjoyable and informative. Although Pinker had such a great way of easing us into the wonders of the mind, he worked too much on certain topics such as individuality. He did not believe that culture, race, etc.... plays a part in our molding decisions throughout our lives. Those who wonder off into the next levels of the mind's philosophy should read this book. I highly recommend to any who is skeptical about how everything comes together. In the way that this book has helped many readers, it has also helped me add to my knowledge of the mind and the little details that come together to make it up."

But, there were few transitions from one theme to another, which I found distracting. Steven Pinker's overall thesis is that the mind is a neural-based computer that reflects the results of evolutionary psychology - meaning that the basis of much of what we do and why we do it has its roots in our historical hunter-gather origins and how we have evolved (through adaptive, natural selection) since. Pinker does not present a unifying theory of the mind, but does present interesting examples of many aspects of human behavior that he aptly explains according to his evolutionary gene-based model. I found much of what he said logical and believable, although some of the sections were less convincing than others. He spends an inordinate amount of pages on explaining gender, and by extension societal, behavior, which I found more entertaining than completely solid. The most controversial claims that Pinker makes have to do with his thoughts on the arts and religion. Pinker states that the arts have no intrinsic evolutionary value, but are outcomes of our desire for pleasure. Similarly he concludes that religion does not contribute to explaining how our brain has evolved and argues strongly against ""creationism"" and the value of religion in general. I'll conclude by sharing a quote from Pinker's book that sums up his thesis “human brains evolved by one set of laws, those of natural selection and genetics, and now interact with one another according to another set of laws, those of cognitive and social psychology, human ecology, and history”."

I found the chapter about the place of humor in evolution fascinating (maybe cause I have never read about it before). This book also clarified the notion of Richard Dawkin's 'selfish gene' in a broader context than just biological/evolutionary i.e. it is not animals that are selfish due to their selfish genes rather that their brains and behaviors are designed by the influence of the selfish genes. At times they will, in fact, make sacrifices which might seem altruistic from a societal perspective.Overall this huge book was quite difficult to digest and should be paced to read and ponder upon. It won't answer your questions but will provide a good framework to explore the questions whose answers you seek.The reason I knocked off a star was because I felt like it ended a bit abruptly when it was time to discuss human consciousness. It is a tall order to expect the author to provide answers but I wish he spent more time talking about it."
145,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49863781-steve,4,"Written by one of the world's foremost cognitive scientists, it's an eight-chapter deep dive on the human mind and how it functions. Starts with the physiological properties of the brain and its components - how language is processed, how physical environments are understood - and slowly transitions to the more abstract notion of the mind, including human behavior and evolutionary theories about how we got to be the way we are. I'm reasonably interested in psychology and social studies and evolutionary biology, and as such, I found the second half a lot more page-turning than the first - especially since Pinker uses all kinds of unfortunately dated computer analogies early on that were surely more apt back in 1997 than they are today. (An updated version of this book might be able to milk a lot more out of ""computational algorithm"" metaphors, particularly given the huge advancements made in artificial intelligence and machine learning over the last two decades.) Still a fascinating read with plenty to offer, and if you ever get a chance, check out some of Pinker's lectures and debates on YouTube. The guy's pretty good at what he does!"
146,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2815504-isaac-kerson,1,"This book has been made mostly completely obsolete by the field of epigenetics. The type of genetic (over) determinism espoused here was always questionable -- the author tries to explain 90% of human behavior through the narrow lense of the ""selfish gene"" -- but, epigenetics has shown that environmental factors can cause the body to put certain genetic expressions on hold for generations. The idea of genetic determinism if not flatout wrong, is at the very least deeply flawed. This is too bad because the book starts (Chapters 1 & 2) with an interesting and still-relevant discussion of modular brain functions, before it spins off into fantastic, disproven speculations which to a large extent are only tangentially related to ""How the Mind Works"". Your average Wikipedia page is better sourced than the last 5 chapters of this book. Not worth your time. Instead read: How Emotions are Made, The Ego Tunnel, or The Epigenetics Revolution"

I've been a fan of Steven Pinker's since the ""The Blank Slate"", and he does an amazing job of distilling complicated technical subjects in a way that is easily digestible and interesting to a layperson like myself. The first section of the book, which analyzes how the brain is like a computer, is a bit of a slog. In some ways it was the most interesting for me, however, since everything he dealt with was new and cutting edge. If you get through that part the rest is a real page turner. For about a month this book turned me into a Steven Pinker quote machine (""Emotions are just a doomsday device!"", ""Marriage is just mate-socialsm!"") This, of course, makes you either highly fascinating, or the most annoying person on Earth, depending on who you talk to. Either way, I highly recommend this book. It really makes you step back and reconsider our your outdated beliefs about how people think."

It builds mental models and frameworks with strong explanatory power for understanding the human mind. This book impacts the way you view your own behaviour and the behaviour of others by exposing you to a deeper evolution-based grounding to the very complex topic of the human mind.It is a big book containing just 8 chapters approaching 80-100 pages each . The conclusions arrived at bring insight and enlightenment and are well worth the journey - but be warned - many of these conclusions are preceded by the slow and careful development of ideas, which on occasion can be painstakingly dreary to the reader with non-specialist expertise in this topic (e.g. me). However, the journey (even the dreary bits) is worth it - this book can open your mind - there is much to be gained in reading it."

I recommend this also for people who are curious about why things are the way they are. This answers questions about why certain people think about certain things. I enjoyed mostly the chapter that mentioned how we would convince aliens that we are intelligent beings if they were to arrive. How they would differentiate us from cats and dogs and animals. It also answers questions about why robots cannot be created and I recommend it because it asks some questions that I have not really thought about before and it was very interesting to view the perspective of Steven Pinker since it very much is not similar to mine."
150,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12063010-rebee,1,This book is out of date. I chose not to waste any more time listening to it when I realized it was written in the mid 1990's. 
151,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7626390,3,"This was a good book overall, but it did not live up to my expectations, especially in the last few sections, which I felt were more like filler material; which is not to say that they were of little interest in and of themselves. I understand his need to make an argumentation in favor of evolutionary psychology, considering the current political climate and the constant denial of the existence of ""human nature"" on the extreme left, but I think it simply did not belong in this book.Apart from the section where the author detailed the human sense of vision, and how the brain processes visual information to build a 3D image of the environment (with all kinds of tricks and assumptions to solve problems that are technically unsolvable), in addition to the introduction of the Computational Theory of Mind, there was little talk of ""how the mind works"" actually. We learn more in this book about how the human brain might have evolved, and the environmental pressures to which it might have been subjected during that process, as well as the consequences of this evolution on human traits and behavior, than about the modules and processes within the brain that convert sensory data to meaningful information, actions, and qualia.There are whole sections dedicated to conflict between individuals, groups, sexes, parents and children, and how this might have directed our evolution, but little in the way of an explanation of what the brain is doing as it processes data about one's social standing, social relationships, etc, to generate emotions, actions, reactions and conscious decisions.The earlier sections about the modular and hierarchical nature of brain structures, and the combinatorial nature of its processes, were interesting as a refresher, but by no means offered any new ideas to me personally. The introduction and argumentation for CTM on the other hand left a greater impact on my intellect, and I'm enthused to learn more about it.Perhaps Pinker's relative failure in this book (compared to ""The Language Instinct"") is due to his attempt to tackle subjects outside of his area of expertise.That being said, it was still a enjoyable read, and was by no means devoid of good insights."
152,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2233542-mike,5,"It's hard to absorb and review a book this big. I think of it as something like a one semester college course. Some parts are very difficult and I can't say I understood them all, and others are just fun. But it's not really ""How the Mind Works"" in the sense I was looking for. I was hoping to learn how all those neurons, glia, synaps and axons work together to make thoughts and actions happen. That's not this book. This book is more about how natural selection (Pinker uses the word ""adaptation"" a lot) and the Computational Theory of the Mind result in the capabilities that our brains have, like vision, other senses, and solving problems. Much of the book is thought exercises (however clever) to suss out how a particular brain capability could have resulted in greater reproductive success. Along the way, you get a heavy dose of how amazing the mind is given the difficulty of the problems it can solve almost instantly. The penultimate chapter is all about sex and relationships (and decidedly un-PC), which is fun to read, but really strays from ""How the Mind Works"". In the last chapter, Pinker tackles, probably as well as anybody, the problems of mental activities that don't seem to have any evolutionary purpose, such as art, music and religion. Lastly, he discusses consciousness, somewhat unsuccessfully in my opinion, but who has ever tackled that one successfully?This book reminded me a lot of Jarad Diamond's writings, particularly ""The World Until Yesterday"". Like Pinker, Diamond believes *almost* all behavior and customs must serve some evolutionary purpose, i.e. increase the reproductive success of the practitioners. I can't blame these guys, after all, there is no other coherent scientific theory, but to be truthful, ""How the Mind Works"" sometimes made me doubt that the theory of evolution explains everything.I would love for Pinker to update this book. Written 20 years ago, I think he greatly underestimates the eventual capabilities of computers. While I agree that the mind is unlike any current computer, advances in AI, such as language recognition and visual interpretation might steer his thoughts in a different way."
153,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97471543-alessandro,5,"I prefer to hear the bad news before the good, so let’s begin with the negative feedback:Through the whole book, Pinker often engages with a certain subject by stating the inaccurateness by thinkers that are not mentioned. For example (p.509): ”Many intellectuals believe that primitive warfare is rare, mild and ritualized, or at least was so until the noble savages we're contaminated by contact with the Westerners. But this is romantic nonsense.” This argument is repeatedly used in the book as a way to introduce the various subjects. I would agree that we should directly mention other thinkers’ faults, instead of fabricating something less ”hurtful”. Secondly, Pinker often falls in his own traps. In one of his later books, The Sense of Style (2014), he introduced the book by stating one of the primary reasons for bad writing; the Curse of Knowledge. This cognitive bias refers to the phenomena that the knowledge that we have gathered becomes obvious: you forget the time you weren’t yet aware of that particular information, so you rest on the assumption that others presumably know it as well. In non-fiction books, we see this bias when the authors don’t explain concepts that are self-explanatory to them. You just can’t always predict what kind of readers will read your book. Just like (barely) every author of non-fiction books, Pinker also makes use of this bias. As a psychology student myself it’s less difficult (but I have to admit, I don’t know everything), but my dad who works in insurance had a hard time reading a few pages. As you can see, I gave this book five stars. So it can’t be all bad. Firstly, most of the (psychological) knowledge is still very relevant in today's psychological (and more importantly, political) environment, even though it’s at least 20 years old. Whether you like it or not, Pinker deserves credit for this. Many of the ‘assumptions’ that reviewers mention, about are equally as valuable after two decades. Some of these assumptions can’t be classified as assumptions anymore. The now politically incorrect value that some of the paragraphs hold (mostly in the chapter: Family Values) are very effective in debates that for example show the (biological/psychological/reproductive/etc.) differences between men and women. Lastly, as I’ve stated, I study psychology. This book was a great way to go over the different subjects and building on existing knowledge. The subjects can often be perceived as dull and technical. But Pinker does a great job by adding humor and information of different academic fields to make these subjects easily consumed. Incorporating various disciplines does not only tells you something about the interests of the author but also about (in this case) psychology itself: that psychology is not only composed of psychology. When Pinker writes about an economic concept, to me, it feels as like he is really interested in the whole discipline. This makes me want to read more different books on different subjects to increase my field of interest. The ’power’ to make you want to read more books is (for me) probably the most valuable feature of a book. Have a great new year’s eve! "
154,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98058161-daniel-solomon,5,"This may be the best books summarising the interaction of neural networks/neuroscience, psychology, biology and sociology that forms modern cognitive science for the non expert. In part, that's because there aren't that many books trying to do that.The key ideas are the computional theory of the mind/mind=brain as a computational system using inputs from reality and mental models and languages to generate mental representations/pictures that guide our answers and choices (but quite different in several ways from a digital computer), and natural selection/evolution generating a species/humans that specialise in survival due to superior cognitive abilities. There's also an introduction to neural networks as how the brain implements the mind, a decent discussion about consciousness, emotions, bounded rationality and cognitive biases, but those discussions are relatively short and the topics better covered in other later books (e.g Kahneman's Thinking Fast Thinking Slow for cognitive biases, Dahaene's Consciousness and the brain etc...).Much has been made about the power of artificial neural networks to learn and even outperform humans in some restricted domains, and the computational theory of mind and its focus on innate knowledge has been dismissed by some of the researchers involved. But behind the scenes many of those successes rely on good data that is similar to providing the networks to strongly informative Bayesian priors and state of the art AI is putting more emphasis on organising neural network learning via good models and the equivalent of innate knowledge or prior probabilities. The basic idea of a computational system processing inputs into various propositions/representations implemented by (deep) neural networks remains a decent synthesis, though the last 20 years (this book is from 1998) have seen big improvements in both neural networks and more structural models such Bayesian networks."

Nowadays we know how the brain works, we know how the parts are connected and what they produce in our bodies but we still know nothing of how the human mind works. What parts of the brain makes us be aware of the world and ourselves? are we really aware of ourselves? do other animals with similar brains have different type of awareness? why does our brain makes us enjoy sex? how come we invented music, art or religion if it serves to nothing from an evolutionary perspective? or perhaps it does serve to something? why did evolution gave way to love, hate, embarrassment, sarcasm? what do these types of feelings really do behind the curtains of our awareness of them ? why do we really laugh at a joke?.... These and more are questions answered in this book and I'm so excited that we can now talk about all this thanks to the evolution of artificial intelligence and the ""computational theory of mind""."
156,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7807167-ayman,5,"This book explains how the human brain feels and thinks from an evolutionary biology stand point. How we see, smell, hear, perceive, abstract and memorize has all been shaped by tangible survival needs of our ancestors. However, the surprising and interesting part of the book is about how our emotions and social skills were also a product of evolution. Even romantic love!! :)However, there was a point ~60,000 years ago when evolution (a very slow process that works over millions of years) became secondary in shaping the human mind who started to discover itself and the world around it. We were the first species to have such advanced mental faculties that moved on from solving survival problems to ask fundamental questions about the meaning of the world itself. The problem is our brain is not biologically built to answer these questions and therefore we probably need a different mind or type of mind (an AI maybe?) to attempt such answers."
157,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52456731-lynn-derks,5,"As of this post, I am pursuing an M.A. in music and worship. My thesis is going to be something about music as language, so I was particularly interested in reading Pinker's ""The Language Instinct."" I stumbled upon HTMW before purchasing a copy of TLI, so I read HTMW first. It proved to be a valuable basis for understanding Pinker. I think Pinker might be surprised to hear that Scripture does not conflict with many of his beliefs (Scripture and science work well together - but that's another discussion). Here's an interesting issue: Pinker believes emotions to be adaptive (they were developed for survival and replication of the organism). He asserts that music is strictly a device for communicating emotions. He believes music is not adaptive (music does not aid in survival or replication of an organism). Does anyone see the problem here?"
158,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91751604-roy,4,"According to Dr. Pinker, the mind's functioning can be explained by the computational theory of mind, that is, the theory that the human mind is the product of complex neuronal activity shaped over thousands of generations through natural selection. This theory posits that the mind is comprised of specific problem solving modules each designed to tackle problems of survival. The book could have been titled the evolutionary theory of mind since much of it is focused on natural selection and the propagation of genes as an explanation for how human mental modules came to exist. It is an entertaining attempt to explain many facets of human behavior, but I think the book could have been half as long. Of particular interest is the final chapter in which he attempts to shed light on the arts, music, humor, religion, and philosophy. These areas of life he argues have little adaptive or survival value and he attempts to use the theory to understand why human beings hold these things in such high esteem. Finally, he presents the idea that perhaps the human brain did not evolve the capacity to solve the deepest mysteries of human existence."

I felt the first half of the book was a drag. There were a lot of places where analogies or explanations about computations the brain does were augmented with cultural references which I didn't care about or didn't understand. I thought that it muddied the point that was attempted to being made and didn't help me understand the overall structure of the chapter.The second half was an easier read since there isn't much of the computation explanation going on but, is still riddled with cultural references."

163,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/218323-becky,4,"Very interesting, well-written, and comprehensive. I appreciated the overview of both computational and evolutionary psychology in one tome of a book; computational psychology is pretty much awesome, and though I must confess that I skipped some of the technical examples in an effort to prevent my brain from breaking, Pinker's writing was for the most part clear and explanatory. I learned a lot!I would be interested to find out whether any of the specific evolutionary theories have become passe over the last ten years, since a great deal of new research must have come out since then. A second edition would be great if necessary.I still have reservations about the conclusion of the book. Basically, Pinker says that the computational view of the mind means that consciousness - the ability of the mind to actually experience stimulus and thought, like the taste of a strawberry or the redness of red - has no apparent function. People could go through the complex computational steps of mental activity without experiencing any of it. There is no way to prove that the person sitting next to you is not a ""philosophical zombie,"" who acts like they think and feel but is really just a mechanical thing.Not only does this mean I have no solid proof that all of you aren't just automatons, but no can explain why we experience things to begin with! Very perverse philosophers have attempted to argue that experience is an illusion, but of course this makes very little sense. Pinker is forced to conclude that our brains are just not smart enough to solve a peculiar problem like the nature of consciousness and self, along with some other potential philosophical problems like the possibility of absolute morality or the ability of language to refer to real things (don't understand the problem with this last one myself.)I'm not saying that I can prove Pinker is absolutely wrong in this conclusion, but it is deeply unsatisfying. Our minds are, apparently, the product of a lawful universe. Logic is able to tackle, if not solve, every other problem with which we have been presented, from pulsars to microorganisms. The only exception is strange, peripheral problem of where the universe came from to begin with. Why should our minds be another such exception? If we can't explain our minds as a logical evolutionary adaptation, doesn't that call into question evolutionary psychology as a theory? How could human awareness not be the product of evolution (the ultimate logical process)?Pinker tries to compare our failure to understand the mind to an autistic person's failure to understand the existence of other minds or a dog's colorblindness. But the problem with an autistic person, as I understand it, is not that they can't have the existence of other minds explained to them, but that they don't intuitively act as if they exist. Similarly, if the dog were more intelligent, they could obviously believe in and understand what color is, they just can't imagine what it is to see it. If we were blind to the nature of how sentience interacts with the rest of the universe, we should not realize that we have this blindness until it is explained to us. As it is, we are aware of a blindness and can't think of how to see what we know we know must be out there to be seen.Finally, if Pinker is right that science has failed us regarding the problem of human consciousness, it's rather questionable for him to argue that religious or mystical explanations are out of the question, because if that were so, it wouldn't be an unsolvable problem after all. Either the logical forces of the universe to which we are all accustomed are responsible for consciousness, or Something Else is. Pinker is right; it would be presumptuous and unscientific to call the Something Else God or Divine Energies or what have you. But we cannot discount these hypotheses outright, and the notion that our consciousnesses apparently work apart from the causation that is evolution at least means that the universe is a much stranger place than we have been led to believe. Really I would rather believe that my mind is the result of scientifically knowable causes, I like science, but if I am to believe Pinker, then another, very weird solution is out there.Very interesting read, but the ultimate difficulties brought up by the theories are much more frustrating than the elegant solutions they provide! Mostly I just don't like giving up on a scientific solution to a problem; it seems wrong."
164,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21015158-sam-caldwell,4,"I was surprised at just how comprehensive and compelling the two theories presented in the book are:1) the mind is an information processor, i.e. computer2) many characteristics of the mind can be explained in terms of the selective pressures on humans living as tribes of hunter/gatherers.Some bits that stand out are viewing emotions as facilitators of cooperation, in that they offer difficult-to-spoof insights to someone's state of mind. They also implement a doomsday-device-like deterrent; an infuriated person acts in a way that seems clearly not in their rational self-interest. The (credible) possibility of such a rage acts as a deterrent to those who might consider exploiting the subject.One thing I didn't like is the author's tendency to take potshots at different groups."

The first part of the book digs into the 'mechanics' of the brain and the mind that 'inhabits' it. Discussion of he phenomenon of concsiousness is undertaken early on and given a naturalistic solution later in the book, although it is not a very satisfying one. While I enjoyed he attempt to identify the mechanics of concsiousness, the 'answer' seemed to rely more on philosophy and a natural selection - based hypothesis about how it might work. Other chapters in the early part of the book were also concerned with mind mechanics, and the discussion of how we see and the way the mind gets involved is excellent, if mind bogglingly complex. In the latter part of the book, as refered to earlier, the flavour relies less on measured infofomation abou the brain, instead inferring what goes on through pschology studies interpreted with a natural selection lens. The arguments made are soundly reasoned and reveal uncomfortable truths for many idealist viewpoints on 'human nature' in both left and right camps. It certainly presents an alternative perspective that deeerves a more prominent place in public discussion, although it carries the risk of misinterpretation and abuse, and the message that ethics lies in a different sphere would need o be given equally clear emphasis. however, regarding the scientific underpinnings of the conclusions, these sections seemed lacking, - the argument seems to be ""because of our primitive survival and reproduction needs, our emotions are tuned to follow these basic intincts"". Connection with how this connects with the mind and how competing instincts are resolved was given little attention. The final chapter attemptsto explain the religious instinct and felt particularly ad hoc. Much of what I've wrtten is critical - the book was challengin and thought provoking. It is certainly worth a read although it is reatively long and requires some perserverance. There are a few other books around which may add to some of this (i is relatively old now - 10 years or so) and certainly makes GEB more concrete and as a reslut is prbably a good place to start for modern unerstanding of the brain."

I'm a liberal arts major who never even took Psych 101 and this tome did a great job filling me in about the different modes of the human mind. This book by turns fascinated me, astonished me, and caused me to marvel, all great things. Having a book kindle one's curiosity is always splendid, especially when the objects of that curiosity are the myriad amazing things our body does each moment of each day but whose wonder we become desensitized to. In HTMW we learn that ""The mind is not the brain, but what the brain does...The brain's special status comes from a special thing the brain does which makes us see, think, feel, choose and act. That special thing is information processing, or computation"" (24). Pinker bases his book on two scientific theories: the Computational Theory of Mind and Evolution through Natural Selection. Basically, he argues that the mind is an adaptation that evolved to help humans outwit the environment, animals, objects, and human beings. In the opening chapters he explains these theories, and then for the rest of the book applies them to several of the mind's many modules, such as: the visual system, ideas, personal emotions, social emotions, and philosophy, religion, art, and music (""Auditory cheesecake""). I learned a ridiculous amount from this book and often felt ecstatic reading it. His arguments are very convincing and copiously documented. And his prose is very rich and memorable. I re-read many sections in sheer delight and things stuck with me due to the engaging way he wrote them. I plan to re-read portions of this book for a long while to come. The chapter on personal emotions, ""Hotheads,"" was a highlight for me, looking at why we feel at all, where different feelings come from in our evolutionary past, and what emotions are and are for. He discusses all kinds of feelings such as anger, happiness, grief, and disgust. It's a fantastic chapter!Overall, this book enhanced my worldview through a detailed look at the human mind's inner workings and boosted my curiosity, both invaluable assets! I am looking forward to reading more of Mr. Pinker's works."
168,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1571969-billie-pritchett,4,"Steven Pinker's How the Mind Works is a long book and a Book about Everything. Although the title suggests it's a popular psychology book, the discoveries of psychology and especially psychology understood as evolutionary psychology are used to explain all aspects of human life. Most of the first part of the book is not technical but might be boring to its readers. For example, there's a long explanation about how vision works that was a complete snooze-fest. From about halfway on in the book, I think the readers would be interested. There, Pinker writes about how evolutionary psychology helps explain societies, and, later, our leisurely appreciation of beauty and excellence like that expressed in art or music.Part of what the book is driving at, although it is not expressed explicitly until a later work, The Blank Slate, is that the human mind is richly endowed with these innate faculties for understanding ourselves and the world but they are, by design, limited in the ways that they allow us to interpret the information we receive from the senses. Even our faculties for scientific discovery seem to have an upper limit on them. He proposes near the end of the book philosophical questions such as ""How can free will exist in a deterministic world?"" might be a mystery for our species because our brains weren't designed to handle that kind of question. The characters in the book Flatland are two-dimensional shapes who live in a two-dimensional world. Any person would be free to leave the world they live in called Flatland if only they left through the third dimension. But the people in flatland are only familiar with two dimensions: forward/backward and left/right. Their minds can ask the question but they could never understand what it would mean to move in a third dimension (up/down). Because of the human mind, we're in a similar position. No reason to be pessimistic, though: The human mind is awfully rich as it is."

It also throws out there crazy concepts or that at least seem unordinary in our society such as raping individuals in our genes. What I also liked about the book was that it presented factual evidence on most of the topics discussed in the book. I also liked that it talked about evolution because that is one of my favorite topics to discuss and learn more information about because it astounds me how we can come from the forms that we come from and how we adapted to our environment and what we were exposed to. The thing that I didn't like about the book was that it came out bias in some aspect of the book just off the wording they were using, it seemed one sided at times and I like more when its holistic and you look at all the different aspects and keep your opinions to yourself that others may be sensitive to in a way. I learned a lot from the book such as the mind is so complex it holds within it what your ancestors may have embedded in your brain and what knowledge and information you have obtained through the years. Learn to understand the scientific side of life. Yes I would recommend this book to others because it gave me an array of information in just this 500 page book that I might have never learned in school because our system is censored at time and they don't like to discuss a lot of different challenging topics."
170,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3286533-jurij-fedorov,5,"Steven Pinker is a world famous liberal evolutionary psychologist. As most intellectually focused psychologists I try to read everything he writes. It's the basic psychology science presented in a simple but intellectual way.Pro:This is a huge book. It really goes into a lot of psychology topics and most of them are well illustrated. It's one of those books that is a bit hard to get into and read, but you want to read it again because there are so many good nuggets here. I feel like I may have missed a few great points.Con:If you have read a few evolutionary psychology books this will feel very familiar in many chapters. I was zoning out quite often as I he kept presenting topics I already had read about like mating, men, women and basic psychology. This also means that it's a great intro book into psychology. I will for sure recommend it to people getting into the field.Another thing is that it's a bit old. He is often talking about blank slate thinking and how it's bunk science, but old psychology is often more blank slate than current psychology. Since the 90's we have had a lot of gene and heritability studies that showed that most of the factors we thought were mostly environment are actually mostly genetic. Politics, personality, parenting, intelligence. We have had a lot of great studies on the heritability of these traits and they really ought to be included in such a book. It does feel a bit environment focused and it's predictable for a book this old. But it's not the end of the road for psychology knowledge anyhow and you ought to continue reading up on it. For anyone reading up on modern psychology this is it, but presented from a slight liberal view point which probably makes it a great intro book for people who are left of center and have a hard time getting into the hard science.It's a typical Pinker book. If you like his writing it's a must read for you."
171,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,4,"'How the Mind Works' is an ambitious book. Pinker addresses an insane medley of topics: if it pertains to the mind in any way whatsoever, it's fair game. This variety of topics discussed is the books greatest strength, but also it primary weakness.Firstly, the bad: this book isn't clearly connected by an overarching thesis. I suppose everything has to do with 'the mind' - though this is debatable, as there are long stretches where you'll be prone to forget this book is supposed to be about 'how the mind works'. If each of the 8 chapters (some of which span upwards of a 100 pages) had been published as a self-contained book, no one would have been the wiser. In this sense, some cohesion would have been nice. The material is presented in a somewhat haphazard manner.Now then, onto the good: the material presented is totally awesome. Pinker is a terrific writer, and just about everything covered in 'How the Mind Works' was intensely interesting. And cover a lot he does: you'll read about your brain's insane ability to make sense of visual input; about the importance of 'irrational' emotions (and why they're not so irrational after all); and about the evolutionary underpinning of sexuality, to name a few topics of interest. I didn't agree with everything said, and some of his opinions, presented as fact, are decidedly controversial. But most importantly, all of the topics were interesting, and his conclusions are almost always well supported. 'How the Mind Works' was never boring, and that's high praise for a book of this scope.Should you read this book? Maybe. It's pretty ambitious, and unless you're fairly stoked about the material, you might be better of finding something more focused and concise. But if you're willing to take the plunge, you're in for a treat - How the Mind Works is an intellectual tour de force."

This quote has chased me around my high school years like a leopard hounding after its prey. Ever since my youth, I have noticed my skepticism on the human capsule. I often wondered if rigorous science labs brought up such an idea as the human mind. Although, childhood beliefs kept my thoughts grounded to an absolute that a grater power was the innovator. How The Mind Works was food for my thoughts. Steven pinker did not answer all of my unending questions but did satisfy some of my mysteries. He starts off by stating about the importance of the cognitive niche. He also states how vision is one of the many factors that have allowed our minds to go to such far extents. I do agree with him in this. Vision has allowed us to make buildings as high as mountains, paintings that capture feelings, and better yet help us find a mate. In the book he explains illusions and different visionary test to see how our mind correlates to our brain and mind. The human mind has been a topic of discussion for over many centuries and I believe Steven Pinker simplified the structure of it in a way that's both enjoyable and informative. Although Pinker had such a great way of easing us into the wonders of the mind, he worked too much on certain topics such as individuality. He did not believe that culture, race, etc.... plays a part in our molding decisions throughout our lives. Those who wonder off into the next levels of the mind's philosophy should read this book. I highly recommend to any who is skeptical about how everything comes together. In the way that this book has helped many readers, it has also helped me add to my knowledge of the mind and the little details that come together to make it up."
173,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3239706-gordon,3,"A daunting book for the casual reader. I found most of the chapters individually readable, interesting, often controversial. But, there were few transitions from one theme to another, which I found distracting. Steven Pinker's overall thesis is that the mind is a neural-based computer that reflects the results of evolutionary psychology - meaning that the basis of much of what we do and why we do it has its roots in our historical hunter-gather origins and how we have evolved (through adaptive, natural selection) since. Pinker does not present a unifying theory of the mind, but does present interesting examples of many aspects of human behavior that he aptly explains according to his evolutionary gene-based model. I found much of what he said logical and believable, although some of the sections were less convincing than others. He spends an inordinate amount of pages on explaining gender, and by extension societal, behavior, which I found more entertaining than completely solid. The most controversial claims that Pinker makes have to do with his thoughts on the arts and religion. Pinker states that the arts have no intrinsic evolutionary value, but are outcomes of our desire for pleasure. Similarly he concludes that religion does not contribute to explaining how our brain has evolved and argues strongly against ""creationism"" and the value of religion in general. I'll conclude by sharing a quote from Pinker's book that sums up his thesis “human brains evolved by one set of laws, those of natural selection and genetics, and now interact with one another according to another set of laws, those of cognitive and social psychology, human ecology, and history”."
174,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23344184-sudnya,4,"Note that this book was written in the nineties before reading the book or this review.This book raised more questions than answers for me but that is not necessarily a bad thing.Pinker covers a wide range of topics from biological, anthropological to social constructs that have shaped our human mind and behavior. I found the chapter about the place of humor in evolution fascinating (maybe cause I have never read about it before). This book also clarified the notion of Richard Dawkin's 'selfish gene' in a broader context than just biological/evolutionary i.e. it is not animals that are selfish due to their selfish genes rather that their brains and behaviors are designed by the influence of the selfish genes. At times they will, in fact, make sacrifices which might seem altruistic from a societal perspective.Overall this huge book was quite difficult to digest and should be paced to read and ponder upon. It won't answer your questions but will provide a good framework to explore the questions whose answers you seek.The reason I knocked off a star was because I felt like it ended a bit abruptly when it was time to discuss human consciousness. It is a tall order to expect the author to provide answers but I wish he spent more time talking about it."
175,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49863781-steve,4,"Written by one of the world's foremost cognitive scientists, it's an eight-chapter deep dive on the human mind and how it functions. Starts with the physiological properties of the brain and its components - how language is processed, how physical environments are understood - and slowly transitions to the more abstract notion of the mind, including human behavior and evolutionary theories about how we got to be the way we are. I'm reasonably interested in psychology and social studies and evolutionary biology, and as such, I found the second half a lot more page-turning than the first - especially since Pinker uses all kinds of unfortunately dated computer analogies early on that were surely more apt back in 1997 than they are today. (An updated version of this book might be able to milk a lot more out of ""computational algorithm"" metaphors, particularly given the huge advancements made in artificial intelligence and machine learning over the last two decades.) Still a fascinating read with plenty to offer, and if you ever get a chance, check out some of Pinker's lectures and debates on YouTube. The guy's pretty good at what he does!"
176,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2815504-isaac-kerson,1,"This book has been made mostly completely obsolete by the field of epigenetics. The type of genetic (over) determinism espoused here was always questionable -- the author tries to explain 90% of human behavior through the narrow lense of the ""selfish gene"" -- but, epigenetics has shown that environmental factors can cause the body to put certain genetic expressions on hold for generations. The idea of genetic determinism if not flatout wrong, is at the very least deeply flawed. This is too bad because the book starts (Chapters 1 & 2) with an interesting and still-relevant discussion of modular brain functions, before it spins off into fantastic, disproven speculations which to a large extent are only tangentially related to ""How the Mind Works"". Your average Wikipedia page is better sourced than the last 5 chapters of this book. Not worth your time. Instead read: How Emotions are Made, The Ego Tunnel, or The Epigenetics Revolution"
177,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/399523-mike,5,"This is really a great book. I've been a fan of Steven Pinker's since the ""The Blank Slate"", and he does an amazing job of distilling complicated technical subjects in a way that is easily digestible and interesting to a layperson like myself. The first section of the book, which analyzes how the brain is like a computer, is a bit of a slog. In some ways it was the most interesting for me, however, since everything he dealt with was new and cutting edge. If you get through that part the rest is a real page turner. For about a month this book turned me into a Steven Pinker quote machine (""Emotions are just a doomsday device!"", ""Marriage is just mate-socialsm!"") This, of course, makes you either highly fascinating, or the most annoying person on Earth, depending on who you talk to. Either way, I highly recommend this book. It really makes you step back and reconsider our your outdated beliefs about how people think."

It builds mental models and frameworks with strong explanatory power for understanding the human mind. This book impacts the way you view your own behaviour and the behaviour of others by exposing you to a deeper evolution-based grounding to the very complex topic of the human mind.It is a big book containing just 8 chapters approaching 80-100 pages each . The conclusions arrived at bring insight and enlightenment and are well worth the journey - but be warned - many of these conclusions are preceded by the slow and careful development of ideas, which on occasion can be painstakingly dreary to the reader with non-specialist expertise in this topic (e.g. me). However, the journey (even the dreary bits) is worth it - this book can open your mind - there is much to be gained in reading it."

I recommend this also for people who are curious about why things are the way they are. This answers questions about why certain people think about certain things. I enjoyed mostly the chapter that mentioned how we would convince aliens that we are intelligent beings if they were to arrive. How they would differentiate us from cats and dogs and animals. It also answers questions about why robots cannot be created and I recommend it because it asks some questions that I have not really thought about before and it was very interesting to view the perspective of Steven Pinker since it very much is not similar to mine."
180,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12063010-rebee,1,This book is out of date. I chose not to waste any more time listening to it when I realized it was written in the mid 1990's. 
181,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7626390,3,"This was a good book overall, but it did not live up to my expectations, especially in the last few sections, which I felt were more like filler material; which is not to say that they were of little interest in and of themselves. I understand his need to make an argumentation in favor of evolutionary psychology, considering the current political climate and the constant denial of the existence of ""human nature"" on the extreme left, but I think it simply did not belong in this book.Apart from the section where the author detailed the human sense of vision, and how the brain processes visual information to build a 3D image of the environment (with all kinds of tricks and assumptions to solve problems that are technically unsolvable), in addition to the introduction of the Computational Theory of Mind, there was little talk of ""how the mind works"" actually. We learn more in this book about how the human brain might have evolved, and the environmental pressures to which it might have been subjected during that process, as well as the consequences of this evolution on human traits and behavior, than about the modules and processes within the brain that convert sensory data to meaningful information, actions, and qualia.There are whole sections dedicated to conflict between individuals, groups, sexes, parents and children, and how this might have directed our evolution, but little in the way of an explanation of what the brain is doing as it processes data about one's social standing, social relationships, etc, to generate emotions, actions, reactions and conscious decisions.The earlier sections about the modular and hierarchical nature of brain structures, and the combinatorial nature of its processes, were interesting as a refresher, but by no means offered any new ideas to me personally. The introduction and argumentation for CTM on the other hand left a greater impact on my intellect, and I'm enthused to learn more about it.Perhaps Pinker's relative failure in this book (compared to ""The Language Instinct"") is due to his attempt to tackle subjects outside of his area of expertise.That being said, it was still a enjoyable read, and was by no means devoid of good insights."
182,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2233542-mike,5,"It's hard to absorb and review a book this big. I think of it as something like a one semester college course. Some parts are very difficult and I can't say I understood them all, and others are just fun. But it's not really ""How the Mind Works"" in the sense I was looking for. I was hoping to learn how all those neurons, glia, synaps and axons work together to make thoughts and actions happen. That's not this book. This book is more about how natural selection (Pinker uses the word ""adaptation"" a lot) and the Computational Theory of the Mind result in the capabilities that our brains have, like vision, other senses, and solving problems. Much of the book is thought exercises (however clever) to suss out how a particular brain capability could have resulted in greater reproductive success. Along the way, you get a heavy dose of how amazing the mind is given the difficulty of the problems it can solve almost instantly. The penultimate chapter is all about sex and relationships (and decidedly un-PC), which is fun to read, but really strays from ""How the Mind Works"". In the last chapter, Pinker tackles, probably as well as anybody, the problems of mental activities that don't seem to have any evolutionary purpose, such as art, music and religion. Lastly, he discusses consciousness, somewhat unsuccessfully in my opinion, but who has ever tackled that one successfully?This book reminded me a lot of Jarad Diamond's writings, particularly ""The World Until Yesterday"". Like Pinker, Diamond believes *almost* all behavior and customs must serve some evolutionary purpose, i.e. increase the reproductive success of the practitioners. I can't blame these guys, after all, there is no other coherent scientific theory, but to be truthful, ""How the Mind Works"" sometimes made me doubt that the theory of evolution explains everything.I would love for Pinker to update this book. Written 20 years ago, I think he greatly underestimates the eventual capabilities of computers. While I agree that the mind is unlike any current computer, advances in AI, such as language recognition and visual interpretation might steer his thoughts in a different way."
183,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97471543-alessandro,5,"I prefer to hear the bad news before the good, so let’s begin with the negative feedback:Through the whole book, Pinker often engages with a certain subject by stating the inaccurateness by thinkers that are not mentioned. For example (p.509): ”Many intellectuals believe that primitive warfare is rare, mild and ritualized, or at least was so until the noble savages we're contaminated by contact with the Westerners. But this is romantic nonsense.” This argument is repeatedly used in the book as a way to introduce the various subjects. I would agree that we should directly mention other thinkers’ faults, instead of fabricating something less ”hurtful”. Secondly, Pinker often falls in his own traps. In one of his later books, The Sense of Style (2014), he introduced the book by stating one of the primary reasons for bad writing; the Curse of Knowledge. This cognitive bias refers to the phenomena that the knowledge that we have gathered becomes obvious: you forget the time you weren’t yet aware of that particular information, so you rest on the assumption that others presumably know it as well. In non-fiction books, we see this bias when the authors don’t explain concepts that are self-explanatory to them. You just can’t always predict what kind of readers will read your book. Just like (barely) every author of non-fiction books, Pinker also makes use of this bias. As a psychology student myself it’s less difficult (but I have to admit, I don’t know everything), but my dad who works in insurance had a hard time reading a few pages. As you can see, I gave this book five stars. So it can’t be all bad. Firstly, most of the (psychological) knowledge is still very relevant in today's psychological (and more importantly, political) environment, even though it’s at least 20 years old. Whether you like it or not, Pinker deserves credit for this. Many of the ‘assumptions’ that reviewers mention, about are equally as valuable after two decades. Some of these assumptions can’t be classified as assumptions anymore. The now politically incorrect value that some of the paragraphs hold (mostly in the chapter: Family Values) are very effective in debates that for example show the (biological/psychological/reproductive/etc.) differences between men and women. Lastly, as I’ve stated, I study psychology. This book was a great way to go over the different subjects and building on existing knowledge. The subjects can often be perceived as dull and technical. But Pinker does a great job by adding humor and information of different academic fields to make these subjects easily consumed. Incorporating various disciplines does not only tells you something about the interests of the author but also about (in this case) psychology itself: that psychology is not only composed of psychology. When Pinker writes about an economic concept, to me, it feels as like he is really interested in the whole discipline. This makes me want to read more different books on different subjects to increase my field of interest. The ’power’ to make you want to read more books is (for me) probably the most valuable feature of a book. Have a great new year’s eve! "
184,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98058161-daniel-solomon,5,"This may be the best books summarising the interaction of neural networks/neuroscience, psychology, biology and sociology that forms modern cognitive science for the non expert. In part, that's because there aren't that many books trying to do that.The key ideas are the computional theory of the mind/mind=brain as a computational system using inputs from reality and mental models and languages to generate mental representations/pictures that guide our answers and choices (but quite different in several ways from a digital computer), and natural selection/evolution generating a species/humans that specialise in survival due to superior cognitive abilities. There's also an introduction to neural networks as how the brain implements the mind, a decent discussion about consciousness, emotions, bounded rationality and cognitive biases, but those discussions are relatively short and the topics better covered in other later books (e.g Kahneman's Thinking Fast Thinking Slow for cognitive biases, Dahaene's Consciousness and the brain etc...).Much has been made about the power of artificial neural networks to learn and even outperform humans in some restricted domains, and the computational theory of mind and its focus on innate knowledge has been dismissed by some of the researchers involved. But behind the scenes many of those successes rely on good data that is similar to providing the networks to strongly informative Bayesian priors and state of the art AI is putting more emphasis on organising neural network learning via good models and the equivalent of innate knowledge or prior probabilities. The basic idea of a computational system processing inputs into various propositions/representations implemented by (deep) neural networks remains a decent synthesis, though the last 20 years (this book is from 1998) have seen big improvements in both neural networks and more structural models such Bayesian networks."

Nowadays we know how the brain works, we know how the parts are connected and what they produce in our bodies but we still know nothing of how the human mind works. What parts of the brain makes us be aware of the world and ourselves? are we really aware of ourselves? do other animals with similar brains have different type of awareness? why does our brain makes us enjoy sex? how come we invented music, art or religion if it serves to nothing from an evolutionary perspective? or perhaps it does serve to something? why did evolution gave way to love, hate, embarrassment, sarcasm? what do these types of feelings really do behind the curtains of our awareness of them ? why do we really laugh at a joke?.... These and more are questions answered in this book and I'm so excited that we can now talk about all this thanks to the evolution of artificial intelligence and the ""computational theory of mind""."
186,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7807167-ayman,5,"This book explains how the human brain feels and thinks from an evolutionary biology stand point. How we see, smell, hear, perceive, abstract and memorize has all been shaped by tangible survival needs of our ancestors. However, the surprising and interesting part of the book is about how our emotions and social skills were also a product of evolution. Even romantic love!! :)However, there was a point ~60,000 years ago when evolution (a very slow process that works over millions of years) became secondary in shaping the human mind who started to discover itself and the world around it. We were the first species to have such advanced mental faculties that moved on from solving survival problems to ask fundamental questions about the meaning of the world itself. The problem is our brain is not biologically built to answer these questions and therefore we probably need a different mind or type of mind (an AI maybe?) to attempt such answers."
187,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52456731-lynn-derks,5,"As of this post, I am pursuing an M.A. in music and worship. My thesis is going to be something about music as language, so I was particularly interested in reading Pinker's ""The Language Instinct."" I stumbled upon HTMW before purchasing a copy of TLI, so I read HTMW first. It proved to be a valuable basis for understanding Pinker. I think Pinker might be surprised to hear that Scripture does not conflict with many of his beliefs (Scripture and science work well together - but that's another discussion). Here's an interesting issue: Pinker believes emotions to be adaptive (they were developed for survival and replication of the organism). He asserts that music is strictly a device for communicating emotions. He believes music is not adaptive (music does not aid in survival or replication of an organism). Does anyone see the problem here?"
188,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91751604-roy,4,"According to Dr. Pinker, the mind's functioning can be explained by the computational theory of mind, that is, the theory that the human mind is the product of complex neuronal activity shaped over thousands of generations through natural selection. This theory posits that the mind is comprised of specific problem solving modules each designed to tackle problems of survival. The book could have been titled the evolutionary theory of mind since much of it is focused on natural selection and the propagation of genes as an explanation for how human mental modules came to exist. It is an entertaining attempt to explain many facets of human behavior, but I think the book could have been half as long. Of particular interest is the final chapter in which he attempts to shed light on the arts, music, humor, religion, and philosophy. These areas of life he argues have little adaptive or survival value and he attempts to use the theory to understand why human beings hold these things in such high esteem. Finally, he presents the idea that perhaps the human brain did not evolve the capacity to solve the deepest mysteries of human existence."

I felt the first half of the book was a drag. There were a lot of places where analogies or explanations about computations the brain does were augmented with cultural references which I didn't care about or didn't understand. I thought that it muddied the point that was attempted to being made and didn't help me understand the overall structure of the chapter.The second half was an easier read since there isn't much of the computation explanation going on but, is still riddled with cultural references."

193,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/218323-becky,4,"Very interesting, well-written, and comprehensive. I appreciated the overview of both computational and evolutionary psychology in one tome of a book; computational psychology is pretty much awesome, and though I must confess that I skipped some of the technical examples in an effort to prevent my brain from breaking, Pinker's writing was for the most part clear and explanatory. I learned a lot!I would be interested to find out whether any of the specific evolutionary theories have become passe over the last ten years, since a great deal of new research must have come out since then. A second edition would be great if necessary.I still have reservations about the conclusion of the book. Basically, Pinker says that the computational view of the mind means that consciousness - the ability of the mind to actually experience stimulus and thought, like the taste of a strawberry or the redness of red - has no apparent function. People could go through the complex computational steps of mental activity without experiencing any of it. There is no way to prove that the person sitting next to you is not a ""philosophical zombie,"" who acts like they think and feel but is really just a mechanical thing.Not only does this mean I have no solid proof that all of you aren't just automatons, but no can explain why we experience things to begin with! Very perverse philosophers have attempted to argue that experience is an illusion, but of course this makes very little sense. Pinker is forced to conclude that our brains are just not smart enough to solve a peculiar problem like the nature of consciousness and self, along with some other potential philosophical problems like the possibility of absolute morality or the ability of language to refer to real things (don't understand the problem with this last one myself.)I'm not saying that I can prove Pinker is absolutely wrong in this conclusion, but it is deeply unsatisfying. Our minds are, apparently, the product of a lawful universe. Logic is able to tackle, if not solve, every other problem with which we have been presented, from pulsars to microorganisms. The only exception is strange, peripheral problem of where the universe came from to begin with. Why should our minds be another such exception? If we can't explain our minds as a logical evolutionary adaptation, doesn't that call into question evolutionary psychology as a theory? How could human awareness not be the product of evolution (the ultimate logical process)?Pinker tries to compare our failure to understand the mind to an autistic person's failure to understand the existence of other minds or a dog's colorblindness. But the problem with an autistic person, as I understand it, is not that they can't have the existence of other minds explained to them, but that they don't intuitively act as if they exist. Similarly, if the dog were more intelligent, they could obviously believe in and understand what color is, they just can't imagine what it is to see it. If we were blind to the nature of how sentience interacts with the rest of the universe, we should not realize that we have this blindness until it is explained to us. As it is, we are aware of a blindness and can't think of how to see what we know we know must be out there to be seen.Finally, if Pinker is right that science has failed us regarding the problem of human consciousness, it's rather questionable for him to argue that religious or mystical explanations are out of the question, because if that were so, it wouldn't be an unsolvable problem after all. Either the logical forces of the universe to which we are all accustomed are responsible for consciousness, or Something Else is. Pinker is right; it would be presumptuous and unscientific to call the Something Else God or Divine Energies or what have you. But we cannot discount these hypotheses outright, and the notion that our consciousnesses apparently work apart from the causation that is evolution at least means that the universe is a much stranger place than we have been led to believe. Really I would rather believe that my mind is the result of scientifically knowable causes, I like science, but if I am to believe Pinker, then another, very weird solution is out there.Very interesting read, but the ultimate difficulties brought up by the theories are much more frustrating than the elegant solutions they provide! Mostly I just don't like giving up on a scientific solution to a problem; it seems wrong."

They also implement a doomsday-device-like deterrent; an infuriated person acts in a way that seems clearly not in their rational self-interest. The (credible) possibility of such a rage acts as a deterrent to those who might consider exploiting the subject.One thing I didn't like is the author's tendency to take potshots at different groups."

196,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,3,"To a large extent the answer to the books title is that we have learnt a lot but still have a long way to go! The first part of the book digs into the 'mechanics' of the brain and the mind that 'inhabits' it. Discussion of he phenomenon of concsiousness is undertaken early on and given a naturalistic solution later in the book, although it is not a very satisfying one. While I enjoyed he attempt to identify the mechanics of concsiousness, the 'answer' seemed to rely more on philosophy and a natural selection - based hypothesis about how it might work. Other chapters in the early part of the book were also concerned with mind mechanics, and the discussion of how we see and the way the mind gets involved is excellent, if mind bogglingly complex. In the latter part of the book, as refered to earlier, the flavour relies less on measured infofomation abou the brain, instead inferring what goes on through pschology studies interpreted with a natural selection lens. The arguments made are soundly reasoned and reveal uncomfortable truths for many idealist viewpoints on 'human nature' in both left and right camps. It certainly presents an alternative perspective that deeerves a more prominent place in public discussion, although it carries the risk of misinterpretation and abuse, and the message that ethics lies in a different sphere would need o be given equally clear emphasis. however, regarding the scientific underpinnings of the conclusions, these sections seemed lacking, - the argument seems to be ""because of our primitive survival and reproduction needs, our emotions are tuned to follow these basic intincts"". Connection with how this connects with the mind and how competing instincts are resolved was given little attention. The final chapter attemptsto explain the religious instinct and felt particularly ad hoc. Much of what I've wrtten is critical - the book was challengin and thought provoking. It is certainly worth a read although it is reatively long and requires some perserverance. There are a few other books around which may add to some of this (i is relatively old now - 10 years or so) and certainly makes GEB more concrete and as a reslut is prbably a good place to start for modern unerstanding of the brain."

I'm a liberal arts major who never even took Psych 101 and this tome did a great job filling me in about the different modes of the human mind. This book by turns fascinated me, astonished me, and caused me to marvel, all great things. Having a book kindle one's curiosity is always splendid, especially when the objects of that curiosity are the myriad amazing things our body does each moment of each day but whose wonder we become desensitized to. In HTMW we learn that ""The mind is not the brain, but what the brain does...The brain's special status comes from a special thing the brain does which makes us see, think, feel, choose and act. That special thing is information processing, or computation"" (24). Pinker bases his book on two scientific theories: the Computational Theory of Mind and Evolution through Natural Selection. Basically, he argues that the mind is an adaptation that evolved to help humans outwit the environment, animals, objects, and human beings. In the opening chapters he explains these theories, and then for the rest of the book applies them to several of the mind's many modules, such as: the visual system, ideas, personal emotions, social emotions, and philosophy, religion, art, and music (""Auditory cheesecake""). I learned a ridiculous amount from this book and often felt ecstatic reading it. His arguments are very convincing and copiously documented. And his prose is very rich and memorable. I re-read many sections in sheer delight and things stuck with me due to the engaging way he wrote them. I plan to re-read portions of this book for a long while to come. The chapter on personal emotions, ""Hotheads,"" was a highlight for me, looking at why we feel at all, where different feelings come from in our evolutionary past, and what emotions are and are for. He discusses all kinds of feelings such as anger, happiness, grief, and disgust. It's a fantastic chapter!Overall, this book enhanced my worldview through a detailed look at the human mind's inner workings and boosted my curiosity, both invaluable assets! I am looking forward to reading more of Mr. Pinker's works."
198,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1571969-billie-pritchett,4,"Steven Pinker's How the Mind Works is a long book and a Book about Everything. Although the title suggests it's a popular psychology book, the discoveries of psychology and especially psychology understood as evolutionary psychology are used to explain all aspects of human life. Most of the first part of the book is not technical but might be boring to its readers. For example, there's a long explanation about how vision works that was a complete snooze-fest. From about halfway on in the book, I think the readers would be interested. There, Pinker writes about how evolutionary psychology helps explain societies, and, later, our leisurely appreciation of beauty and excellence like that expressed in art or music.Part of what the book is driving at, although it is not expressed explicitly until a later work, The Blank Slate, is that the human mind is richly endowed with these innate faculties for understanding ourselves and the world but they are, by design, limited in the ways that they allow us to interpret the information we receive from the senses. Even our faculties for scientific discovery seem to have an upper limit on them. He proposes near the end of the book philosophical questions such as ""How can free will exist in a deterministic world?"" might be a mystery for our species because our brains weren't designed to handle that kind of question. The characters in the book Flatland are two-dimensional shapes who live in a two-dimensional world. Any person would be free to leave the world they live in called Flatland if only they left through the third dimension. But the people in flatland are only familiar with two dimensions: forward/backward and left/right. Their minds can ask the question but they could never understand what it would mean to move in a third dimension (up/down). Because of the human mind, we're in a similar position. No reason to be pessimistic, though: The human mind is awfully rich as it is."
199,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46497366-isabella-victoria,5,"How the mind works is a very interesting and eye opening book, What I liked about the book was that it talks about our biology, what is inside of us like our genes from our past ancestors and how that affects many generations in the lifestyle and decisions that they make. It also throws out there crazy concepts or that at least seem unordinary in our society such as raping individuals in our genes. What I also liked about the book was that it presented factual evidence on most of the topics discussed in the book. I also liked that it talked about evolution because that is one of my favorite topics to discuss and learn more information about because it astounds me how we can come from the forms that we come from and how we adapted to our environment and what we were exposed to. The thing that I didn't like about the book was that it came out bias in some aspect of the book just off the wording they were using, it seemed one sided at times and I like more when its holistic and you look at all the different aspects and keep your opinions to yourself that others may be sensitive to in a way. I learned a lot from the book such as the mind is so complex it holds within it what your ancestors may have embedded in your brain and what knowledge and information you have obtained through the years. Learn to understand the scientific side of life. Yes I would recommend this book to others because it gave me an array of information in just this 500 page book that I might have never learned in school because our system is censored at time and they don't like to discuss a lot of different challenging topics."

As most intellectually focused psychologists I try to read everything he writes. It's the basic psychology science presented in a simple but intellectual way.Pro:This is a huge book. It really goes into a lot of psychology topics and most of them are well illustrated. It's one of those books that is a bit hard to get into and read, but you want to read it again because there are so many good nuggets here. I feel like I may have missed a few great points.Con:If you have read a few evolutionary psychology books this will feel very familiar in many chapters. I was zoning out quite often as I he kept presenting topics I already had read about like mating, men, women and basic psychology. This also means that it's a great intro book into psychology. I will for sure recommend it to people getting into the field.Another thing is that it's a bit old. He is often talking about blank slate thinking and how it's bunk science, but old psychology is often more blank slate than current psychology. Since the 90's we have had a lot of gene and heritability studies that showed that most of the factors we thought were mostly environment are actually mostly genetic. Politics, personality, parenting, intelligence. We have had a lot of great studies on the heritability of these traits and they really ought to be included in such a book. It does feel a bit environment focused and it's predictable for a book this old. But it's not the end of the road for psychology knowledge anyhow and you ought to continue reading up on it. For anyone reading up on modern psychology this is it, but presented from a slight liberal view point which probably makes it a great intro book for people who are left of center and have a hard time getting into the hard science.It's a typical Pinker book. If you like his writing it's a must read for you."
201,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,4,"'How the Mind Works' is an ambitious book. Pinker addresses an insane medley of topics: if it pertains to the mind in any way whatsoever, it's fair game. This variety of topics discussed is the books greatest strength, but also it primary weakness.Firstly, the bad: this book isn't clearly connected by an overarching thesis. I suppose everything has to do with 'the mind' - though this is debatable, as there are long stretches where you'll be prone to forget this book is supposed to be about 'how the mind works'. If each of the 8 chapters (some of which span upwards of a 100 pages) had been published as a self-contained book, no one would have been the wiser. In this sense, some cohesion would have been nice. The material is presented in a somewhat haphazard manner.Now then, onto the good: the material presented is totally awesome. Pinker is a terrific writer, and just about everything covered in 'How the Mind Works' was intensely interesting. And cover a lot he does: you'll read about your brain's insane ability to make sense of visual input; about the importance of 'irrational' emotions (and why they're not so irrational after all); and about the evolutionary underpinning of sexuality, to name a few topics of interest. I didn't agree with everything said, and some of his opinions, presented as fact, are decidedly controversial. But most importantly, all of the topics were interesting, and his conclusions are almost always well supported. 'How the Mind Works' was never boring, and that's high praise for a book of this scope.Should you read this book? Maybe. It's pretty ambitious, and unless you're fairly stoked about the material, you might be better of finding something more focused and concise. But if you're willing to take the plunge, you're in for a treat - How the Mind Works is an intellectual tour de force."
202,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20023237-melissa-hurtado,5,"Book ReviewPeriod 2Melissa HurtadoA Level Psych They say the mind is a beautiful paradox because it uses itself to understand itself. This quote has chased me around my high school years like a leopard hounding after its prey. Ever since my youth, I have noticed my skepticism on the human capsule. I often wondered if rigorous science labs brought up such an idea as the human mind. Although, childhood beliefs kept my thoughts grounded to an absolute that a grater power was the innovator. How The Mind Works was food for my thoughts. Steven pinker did not answer all of my unending questions but did satisfy some of my mysteries. He starts off by stating about the importance of the cognitive niche. He also states how vision is one of the many factors that have allowed our minds to go to such far extents. I do agree with him in this. Vision has allowed us to make buildings as high as mountains, paintings that capture feelings, and better yet help us find a mate. In the book he explains illusions and different visionary test to see how our mind correlates to our brain and mind. The human mind has been a topic of discussion for over many centuries and I believe Steven Pinker simplified the structure of it in a way that's both enjoyable and informative. Although Pinker had such a great way of easing us into the wonders of the mind, he worked too much on certain topics such as individuality. He did not believe that culture, race, etc.... plays a part in our molding decisions throughout our lives. Those who wonder off into the next levels of the mind's philosophy should read this book. I highly recommend to any who is skeptical about how everything comes together. In the way that this book has helped many readers, it has also helped me add to my knowledge of the mind and the little details that come together to make it up."
203,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3239706-gordon,3,"A daunting book for the casual reader. I found most of the chapters individually readable, interesting, often controversial. But, there were few transitions from one theme to another, which I found distracting. Steven Pinker's overall thesis is that the mind is a neural-based computer that reflects the results of evolutionary psychology - meaning that the basis of much of what we do and why we do it has its roots in our historical hunter-gather origins and how we have evolved (through adaptive, natural selection) since. Pinker does not present a unifying theory of the mind, but does present interesting examples of many aspects of human behavior that he aptly explains according to his evolutionary gene-based model. I found much of what he said logical and believable, although some of the sections were less convincing than others. He spends an inordinate amount of pages on explaining gender, and by extension societal, behavior, which I found more entertaining than completely solid. The most controversial claims that Pinker makes have to do with his thoughts on the arts and religion. Pinker states that the arts have no intrinsic evolutionary value, but are outcomes of our desire for pleasure. Similarly he concludes that religion does not contribute to explaining how our brain has evolved and argues strongly against ""creationism"" and the value of religion in general. I'll conclude by sharing a quote from Pinker's book that sums up his thesis “human brains evolved by one set of laws, those of natural selection and genetics, and now interact with one another according to another set of laws, those of cognitive and social psychology, human ecology, and history”."
204,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23344184-sudnya,4,"Note that this book was written in the nineties before reading the book or this review.This book raised more questions than answers for me but that is not necessarily a bad thing.Pinker covers a wide range of topics from biological, anthropological to social constructs that have shaped our human mind and behavior. I found the chapter about the place of humor in evolution fascinating (maybe cause I have never read about it before). This book also clarified the notion of Richard Dawkin's 'selfish gene' in a broader context than just biological/evolutionary i.e. it is not animals that are selfish due to their selfish genes rather that their brains and behaviors are designed by the influence of the selfish genes. At times they will, in fact, make sacrifices which might seem altruistic from a societal perspective.Overall this huge book was quite difficult to digest and should be paced to read and ponder upon. It won't answer your questions but will provide a good framework to explore the questions whose answers you seek.The reason I knocked off a star was because I felt like it ended a bit abruptly when it was time to discuss human consciousness. It is a tall order to expect the author to provide answers but I wish he spent more time talking about it."
205,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49863781-steve,4,"Written by one of the world's foremost cognitive scientists, it's an eight-chapter deep dive on the human mind and how it functions. Starts with the physiological properties of the brain and its components - how language is processed, how physical environments are understood - and slowly transitions to the more abstract notion of the mind, including human behavior and evolutionary theories about how we got to be the way we are. I'm reasonably interested in psychology and social studies and evolutionary biology, and as such, I found the second half a lot more page-turning than the first - especially since Pinker uses all kinds of unfortunately dated computer analogies early on that were surely more apt back in 1997 than they are today. (An updated version of this book might be able to milk a lot more out of ""computational algorithm"" metaphors, particularly given the huge advancements made in artificial intelligence and machine learning over the last two decades.) Still a fascinating read with plenty to offer, and if you ever get a chance, check out some of Pinker's lectures and debates on YouTube. The guy's pretty good at what he does!"
206,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2815504-isaac-kerson,1,"This book has been made mostly completely obsolete by the field of epigenetics. The type of genetic (over) determinism espoused here was always questionable -- the author tries to explain 90% of human behavior through the narrow lense of the ""selfish gene"" -- but, epigenetics has shown that environmental factors can cause the body to put certain genetic expressions on hold for generations. The idea of genetic determinism if not flatout wrong, is at the very least deeply flawed. This is too bad because the book starts (Chapters 1 & 2) with an interesting and still-relevant discussion of modular brain functions, before it spins off into fantastic, disproven speculations which to a large extent are only tangentially related to ""How the Mind Works"". Your average Wikipedia page is better sourced than the last 5 chapters of this book. Not worth your time. Instead read: How Emotions are Made, The Ego Tunnel, or The Epigenetics Revolution"

I've been a fan of Steven Pinker's since the ""The Blank Slate"", and he does an amazing job of distilling complicated technical subjects in a way that is easily digestible and interesting to a layperson like myself. The first section of the book, which analyzes how the brain is like a computer, is a bit of a slog. In some ways it was the most interesting for me, however, since everything he dealt with was new and cutting edge. If you get through that part the rest is a real page turner. For about a month this book turned me into a Steven Pinker quote machine (""Emotions are just a doomsday device!"", ""Marriage is just mate-socialsm!"") This, of course, makes you either highly fascinating, or the most annoying person on Earth, depending on who you talk to. Either way, I highly recommend this book. It really makes you step back and reconsider our your outdated beliefs about how people think."

It builds mental models and frameworks with strong explanatory power for understanding the human mind. This book impacts the way you view your own behaviour and the behaviour of others by exposing you to a deeper evolution-based grounding to the very complex topic of the human mind.It is a big book containing just 8 chapters approaching 80-100 pages each . The conclusions arrived at bring insight and enlightenment and are well worth the journey - but be warned - many of these conclusions are preceded by the slow and careful development of ideas, which on occasion can be painstakingly dreary to the reader with non-specialist expertise in this topic (e.g. me). However, the journey (even the dreary bits) is worth it - this book can open your mind - there is much to be gained in reading it."

I recommend this also for people who are curious about why things are the way they are. This answers questions about why certain people think about certain things. I enjoyed mostly the chapter that mentioned how we would convince aliens that we are intelligent beings if they were to arrive. How they would differentiate us from cats and dogs and animals. It also answers questions about why robots cannot be created and I recommend it because it asks some questions that I have not really thought about before and it was very interesting to view the perspective of Steven Pinker since it very much is not similar to mine."

211,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7626390,3,"This was a good book overall, but it did not live up to my expectations, especially in the last few sections, which I felt were more like filler material; which is not to say that they were of little interest in and of themselves. I understand his need to make an argumentation in favor of evolutionary psychology, considering the current political climate and the constant denial of the existence of ""human nature"" on the extreme left, but I think it simply did not belong in this book.Apart from the section where the author detailed the human sense of vision, and how the brain processes visual information to build a 3D image of the environment (with all kinds of tricks and assumptions to solve problems that are technically unsolvable), in addition to the introduction of the Computational Theory of Mind, there was little talk of ""how the mind works"" actually. We learn more in this book about how the human brain might have evolved, and the environmental pressures to which it might have been subjected during that process, as well as the consequences of this evolution on human traits and behavior, than about the modules and processes within the brain that convert sensory data to meaningful information, actions, and qualia.There are whole sections dedicated to conflict between individuals, groups, sexes, parents and children, and how this might have directed our evolution, but little in the way of an explanation of what the brain is doing as it processes data about one's social standing, social relationships, etc, to generate emotions, actions, reactions and conscious decisions.The earlier sections about the modular and hierarchical nature of brain structures, and the combinatorial nature of its processes, were interesting as a refresher, but by no means offered any new ideas to me personally. The introduction and argumentation for CTM on the other hand left a greater impact on my intellect, and I'm enthused to learn more about it.Perhaps Pinker's relative failure in this book (compared to ""The Language Instinct"") is due to his attempt to tackle subjects outside of his area of expertise.That being said, it was still a enjoyable read, and was by no means devoid of good insights."
212,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2233542-mike,5,"It's hard to absorb and review a book this big. I think of it as something like a one semester college course. Some parts are very difficult and I can't say I understood them all, and others are just fun. But it's not really ""How the Mind Works"" in the sense I was looking for. I was hoping to learn how all those neurons, glia, synaps and axons work together to make thoughts and actions happen. That's not this book. This book is more about how natural selection (Pinker uses the word ""adaptation"" a lot) and the Computational Theory of the Mind result in the capabilities that our brains have, like vision, other senses, and solving problems. Much of the book is thought exercises (however clever) to suss out how a particular brain capability could have resulted in greater reproductive success. Along the way, you get a heavy dose of how amazing the mind is given the difficulty of the problems it can solve almost instantly. The penultimate chapter is all about sex and relationships (and decidedly un-PC), which is fun to read, but really strays from ""How the Mind Works"". In the last chapter, Pinker tackles, probably as well as anybody, the problems of mental activities that don't seem to have any evolutionary purpose, such as art, music and religion. Lastly, he discusses consciousness, somewhat unsuccessfully in my opinion, but who has ever tackled that one successfully?This book reminded me a lot of Jarad Diamond's writings, particularly ""The World Until Yesterday"". Like Pinker, Diamond believes *almost* all behavior and customs must serve some evolutionary purpose, i.e. increase the reproductive success of the practitioners. I can't blame these guys, after all, there is no other coherent scientific theory, but to be truthful, ""How the Mind Works"" sometimes made me doubt that the theory of evolution explains everything.I would love for Pinker to update this book. Written 20 years ago, I think he greatly underestimates the eventual capabilities of computers. While I agree that the mind is unlike any current computer, advances in AI, such as language recognition and visual interpretation might steer his thoughts in a different way."
213,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97471543-alessandro,5,"I prefer to hear the bad news before the good, so let’s begin with the negative feedback:Through the whole book, Pinker often engages with a certain subject by stating the inaccurateness by thinkers that are not mentioned. For example (p.509): ”Many intellectuals believe that primitive warfare is rare, mild and ritualized, or at least was so until the noble savages we're contaminated by contact with the Westerners. But this is romantic nonsense.” This argument is repeatedly used in the book as a way to introduce the various subjects. I would agree that we should directly mention other thinkers’ faults, instead of fabricating something less ”hurtful”. Secondly, Pinker often falls in his own traps. In one of his later books, The Sense of Style (2014), he introduced the book by stating one of the primary reasons for bad writing; the Curse of Knowledge. This cognitive bias refers to the phenomena that the knowledge that we have gathered becomes obvious: you forget the time you weren’t yet aware of that particular information, so you rest on the assumption that others presumably know it as well. In non-fiction books, we see this bias when the authors don’t explain concepts that are self-explanatory to them. You just can’t always predict what kind of readers will read your book. Just like (barely) every author of non-fiction books, Pinker also makes use of this bias. As a psychology student myself it’s less difficult (but I have to admit, I don’t know everything), but my dad who works in insurance had a hard time reading a few pages. As you can see, I gave this book five stars. So it can’t be all bad. Firstly, most of the (psychological) knowledge is still very relevant in today's psychological (and more importantly, political) environment, even though it’s at least 20 years old. Whether you like it or not, Pinker deserves credit for this. Many of the ‘assumptions’ that reviewers mention, about are equally as valuable after two decades. Some of these assumptions can’t be classified as assumptions anymore. The now politically incorrect value that some of the paragraphs hold (mostly in the chapter: Family Values) are very effective in debates that for example show the (biological/psychological/reproductive/etc.) differences between men and women. Lastly, as I’ve stated, I study psychology. This book was a great way to go over the different subjects and building on existing knowledge. The subjects can often be perceived as dull and technical. But Pinker does a great job by adding humor and information of different academic fields to make these subjects easily consumed. Incorporating various disciplines does not only tells you something about the interests of the author but also about (in this case) psychology itself: that psychology is not only composed of psychology. When Pinker writes about an economic concept, to me, it feels as like he is really interested in the whole discipline. This makes me want to read more different books on different subjects to increase my field of interest. The ’power’ to make you want to read more books is (for me) probably the most valuable feature of a book. Have a great new year’s eve! "
214,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98058161-daniel-solomon,5,"This may be the best books summarising the interaction of neural networks/neuroscience, psychology, biology and sociology that forms modern cognitive science for the non expert. In part, that's because there aren't that many books trying to do that.The key ideas are the computional theory of the mind/mind=brain as a computational system using inputs from reality and mental models and languages to generate mental representations/pictures that guide our answers and choices (but quite different in several ways from a digital computer), and natural selection/evolution generating a species/humans that specialise in survival due to superior cognitive abilities. There's also an introduction to neural networks as how the brain implements the mind, a decent discussion about consciousness, emotions, bounded rationality and cognitive biases, but those discussions are relatively short and the topics better covered in other later books (e.g Kahneman's Thinking Fast Thinking Slow for cognitive biases, Dahaene's Consciousness and the brain etc...).Much has been made about the power of artificial neural networks to learn and even outperform humans in some restricted domains, and the computational theory of mind and its focus on innate knowledge has been dismissed by some of the researchers involved. But behind the scenes many of those successes rely on good data that is similar to providing the networks to strongly informative Bayesian priors and state of the art AI is putting more emphasis on organising neural network learning via good models and the equivalent of innate knowledge or prior probabilities. The basic idea of a computational system processing inputs into various propositions/representations implemented by (deep) neural networks remains a decent synthesis, though the last 20 years (this book is from 1998) have seen big improvements in both neural networks and more structural models such Bayesian networks."

Nowadays we know how the brain works, we know how the parts are connected and what they produce in our bodies but we still know nothing of how the human mind works. What parts of the brain makes us be aware of the world and ourselves? are we really aware of ourselves? do other animals with similar brains have different type of awareness? why does our brain makes us enjoy sex? how come we invented music, art or religion if it serves to nothing from an evolutionary perspective? or perhaps it does serve to something? why did evolution gave way to love, hate, embarrassment, sarcasm? what do these types of feelings really do behind the curtains of our awareness of them ? why do we really laugh at a joke?.... These and more are questions answered in this book and I'm so excited that we can now talk about all this thanks to the evolution of artificial intelligence and the ""computational theory of mind""."
216,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7807167-ayman,5,"This book explains how the human brain feels and thinks from an evolutionary biology stand point. How we see, smell, hear, perceive, abstract and memorize has all been shaped by tangible survival needs of our ancestors. However, the surprising and interesting part of the book is about how our emotions and social skills were also a product of evolution. Even romantic love!! :)However, there was a point ~60,000 years ago when evolution (a very slow process that works over millions of years) became secondary in shaping the human mind who started to discover itself and the world around it. We were the first species to have such advanced mental faculties that moved on from solving survival problems to ask fundamental questions about the meaning of the world itself. The problem is our brain is not biologically built to answer these questions and therefore we probably need a different mind or type of mind (an AI maybe?) to attempt such answers."
217,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52456731-lynn-derks,5,"As of this post, I am pursuing an M.A. in music and worship. My thesis is going to be something about music as language, so I was particularly interested in reading Pinker's ""The Language Instinct."" I stumbled upon HTMW before purchasing a copy of TLI, so I read HTMW first. It proved to be a valuable basis for understanding Pinker. I think Pinker might be surprised to hear that Scripture does not conflict with many of his beliefs (Scripture and science work well together - but that's another discussion). Here's an interesting issue: Pinker believes emotions to be adaptive (they were developed for survival and replication of the organism). He asserts that music is strictly a device for communicating emotions. He believes music is not adaptive (music does not aid in survival or replication of an organism). Does anyone see the problem here?"
218,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91751604-roy,4,"According to Dr. Pinker, the mind's functioning can be explained by the computational theory of mind, that is, the theory that the human mind is the product of complex neuronal activity shaped over thousands of generations through natural selection. This theory posits that the mind is comprised of specific problem solving modules each designed to tackle problems of survival. The book could have been titled the evolutionary theory of mind since much of it is focused on natural selection and the propagation of genes as an explanation for how human mental modules came to exist. It is an entertaining attempt to explain many facets of human behavior, but I think the book could have been half as long. Of particular interest is the final chapter in which he attempts to shed light on the arts, music, humor, religion, and philosophy. These areas of life he argues have little adaptive or survival value and he attempts to use the theory to understand why human beings hold these things in such high esteem. Finally, he presents the idea that perhaps the human brain did not evolve the capacity to solve the deepest mysteries of human existence."

I felt the first half of the book was a drag. There were a lot of places where analogies or explanations about computations the brain does were augmented with cultural references which I didn't care about or didn't understand. I thought that it muddied the point that was attempted to being made and didn't help me understand the overall structure of the chapter.The second half was an easier read since there isn't much of the computation explanation going on but, is still riddled with cultural references."

Other chapters, not so much; low-level vision science is woefully boring (that’s a personal preference though) and using evolutionary theory still remains a “grand theory of everything” that can be used as a post-hoc explanation of some but not all interpersonal phenomena."

223,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/218323-becky,4,"Very interesting, well-written, and comprehensive. I appreciated the overview of both computational and evolutionary psychology in one tome of a book; computational psychology is pretty much awesome, and though I must confess that I skipped some of the technical examples in an effort to prevent my brain from breaking, Pinker's writing was for the most part clear and explanatory. I learned a lot!I would be interested to find out whether any of the specific evolutionary theories have become passe over the last ten years, since a great deal of new research must have come out since then. A second edition would be great if necessary.I still have reservations about the conclusion of the book. Basically, Pinker says that the computational view of the mind means that consciousness - the ability of the mind to actually experience stimulus and thought, like the taste of a strawberry or the redness of red - has no apparent function. People could go through the complex computational steps of mental activity without experiencing any of it. There is no way to prove that the person sitting next to you is not a ""philosophical zombie,"" who acts like they think and feel but is really just a mechanical thing.Not only does this mean I have no solid proof that all of you aren't just automatons, but no can explain why we experience things to begin with! Very perverse philosophers have attempted to argue that experience is an illusion, but of course this makes very little sense. Pinker is forced to conclude that our brains are just not smart enough to solve a peculiar problem like the nature of consciousness and self, along with some other potential philosophical problems like the possibility of absolute morality or the ability of language to refer to real things (don't understand the problem with this last one myself.)I'm not saying that I can prove Pinker is absolutely wrong in this conclusion, but it is deeply unsatisfying. Our minds are, apparently, the product of a lawful universe. Logic is able to tackle, if not solve, every other problem with which we have been presented, from pulsars to microorganisms. The only exception is strange, peripheral problem of where the universe came from to begin with. Why should our minds be another such exception? If we can't explain our minds as a logical evolutionary adaptation, doesn't that call into question evolutionary psychology as a theory? How could human awareness not be the product of evolution (the ultimate logical process)?Pinker tries to compare our failure to understand the mind to an autistic person's failure to understand the existence of other minds or a dog's colorblindness. But the problem with an autistic person, as I understand it, is not that they can't have the existence of other minds explained to them, but that they don't intuitively act as if they exist. Similarly, if the dog were more intelligent, they could obviously believe in and understand what color is, they just can't imagine what it is to see it. If we were blind to the nature of how sentience interacts with the rest of the universe, we should not realize that we have this blindness until it is explained to us. As it is, we are aware of a blindness and can't think of how to see what we know we know must be out there to be seen.Finally, if Pinker is right that science has failed us regarding the problem of human consciousness, it's rather questionable for him to argue that religious or mystical explanations are out of the question, because if that were so, it wouldn't be an unsolvable problem after all. Either the logical forces of the universe to which we are all accustomed are responsible for consciousness, or Something Else is. Pinker is right; it would be presumptuous and unscientific to call the Something Else God or Divine Energies or what have you. But we cannot discount these hypotheses outright, and the notion that our consciousnesses apparently work apart from the causation that is evolution at least means that the universe is a much stranger place than we have been led to believe. Really I would rather believe that my mind is the result of scientifically knowable causes, I like science, but if I am to believe Pinker, then another, very weird solution is out there.Very interesting read, but the ultimate difficulties brought up by the theories are much more frustrating than the elegant solutions they provide! Mostly I just don't like giving up on a scientific solution to a problem; it seems wrong."
224,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21015158-sam-caldwell,4,"I was surprised at just how comprehensive and compelling the two theories presented in the book are:1) the mind is an information processor, i.e. computer2) many characteristics of the mind can be explained in terms of the selective pressures on humans living as tribes of hunter/gatherers.Some bits that stand out are viewing emotions as facilitators of cooperation, in that they offer difficult-to-spoof insights to someone's state of mind. They also implement a doomsday-device-like deterrent; an infuriated person acts in a way that seems clearly not in their rational self-interest. The (credible) possibility of such a rage acts as a deterrent to those who might consider exploiting the subject.One thing I didn't like is the author's tendency to take potshots at different groups."

226,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,3,"To a large extent the answer to the books title is that we have learnt a lot but still have a long way to go! The first part of the book digs into the 'mechanics' of the brain and the mind that 'inhabits' it. Discussion of he phenomenon of concsiousness is undertaken early on and given a naturalistic solution later in the book, although it is not a very satisfying one. While I enjoyed he attempt to identify the mechanics of concsiousness, the 'answer' seemed to rely more on philosophy and a natural selection - based hypothesis about how it might work. Other chapters in the early part of the book were also concerned with mind mechanics, and the discussion of how we see and the way the mind gets involved is excellent, if mind bogglingly complex. In the latter part of the book, as refered to earlier, the flavour relies less on measured infofomation abou the brain, instead inferring what goes on through pschology studies interpreted with a natural selection lens. The arguments made are soundly reasoned and reveal uncomfortable truths for many idealist viewpoints on 'human nature' in both left and right camps. It certainly presents an alternative perspective that deeerves a more prominent place in public discussion, although it carries the risk of misinterpretation and abuse, and the message that ethics lies in a different sphere would need o be given equally clear emphasis. however, regarding the scientific underpinnings of the conclusions, these sections seemed lacking, - the argument seems to be ""because of our primitive survival and reproduction needs, our emotions are tuned to follow these basic intincts"". Connection with how this connects with the mind and how competing instincts are resolved was given little attention. The final chapter attemptsto explain the religious instinct and felt particularly ad hoc. Much of what I've wrtten is critical - the book was challengin and thought provoking. It is certainly worth a read although it is reatively long and requires some perserverance. There are a few other books around which may add to some of this (i is relatively old now - 10 years or so) and certainly makes GEB more concrete and as a reslut is prbably a good place to start for modern unerstanding of the brain."

I'm a liberal arts major who never even took Psych 101 and this tome did a great job filling me in about the different modes of the human mind. This book by turns fascinated me, astonished me, and caused me to marvel, all great things. Having a book kindle one's curiosity is always splendid, especially when the objects of that curiosity are the myriad amazing things our body does each moment of each day but whose wonder we become desensitized to. In HTMW we learn that ""The mind is not the brain, but what the brain does...The brain's special status comes from a special thing the brain does which makes us see, think, feel, choose and act. That special thing is information processing, or computation"" (24). Pinker bases his book on two scientific theories: the Computational Theory of Mind and Evolution through Natural Selection. Basically, he argues that the mind is an adaptation that evolved to help humans outwit the environment, animals, objects, and human beings. In the opening chapters he explains these theories, and then for the rest of the book applies them to several of the mind's many modules, such as: the visual system, ideas, personal emotions, social emotions, and philosophy, religion, art, and music (""Auditory cheesecake""). I learned a ridiculous amount from this book and often felt ecstatic reading it. His arguments are very convincing and copiously documented. And his prose is very rich and memorable. I re-read many sections in sheer delight and things stuck with me due to the engaging way he wrote them. I plan to re-read portions of this book for a long while to come. The chapter on personal emotions, ""Hotheads,"" was a highlight for me, looking at why we feel at all, where different feelings come from in our evolutionary past, and what emotions are and are for. He discusses all kinds of feelings such as anger, happiness, grief, and disgust. It's a fantastic chapter!Overall, this book enhanced my worldview through a detailed look at the human mind's inner workings and boosted my curiosity, both invaluable assets! I am looking forward to reading more of Mr. Pinker's works."
228,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1571969-billie-pritchett,4,"Steven Pinker's How the Mind Works is a long book and a Book about Everything. Although the title suggests it's a popular psychology book, the discoveries of psychology and especially psychology understood as evolutionary psychology are used to explain all aspects of human life. Most of the first part of the book is not technical but might be boring to its readers. For example, there's a long explanation about how vision works that was a complete snooze-fest. From about halfway on in the book, I think the readers would be interested. There, Pinker writes about how evolutionary psychology helps explain societies, and, later, our leisurely appreciation of beauty and excellence like that expressed in art or music.Part of what the book is driving at, although it is not expressed explicitly until a later work, The Blank Slate, is that the human mind is richly endowed with these innate faculties for understanding ourselves and the world but they are, by design, limited in the ways that they allow us to interpret the information we receive from the senses. Even our faculties for scientific discovery seem to have an upper limit on them. He proposes near the end of the book philosophical questions such as ""How can free will exist in a deterministic world?"" might be a mystery for our species because our brains weren't designed to handle that kind of question. The characters in the book Flatland are two-dimensional shapes who live in a two-dimensional world. Any person would be free to leave the world they live in called Flatland if only they left through the third dimension. But the people in flatland are only familiar with two dimensions: forward/backward and left/right. Their minds can ask the question but they could never understand what it would mean to move in a third dimension (up/down). Because of the human mind, we're in a similar position. No reason to be pessimistic, though: The human mind is awfully rich as it is."
229,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46497366-isabella-victoria,5,"How the mind works is a very interesting and eye opening book, What I liked about the book was that it talks about our biology, what is inside of us like our genes from our past ancestors and how that affects many generations in the lifestyle and decisions that they make. It also throws out there crazy concepts or that at least seem unordinary in our society such as raping individuals in our genes. What I also liked about the book was that it presented factual evidence on most of the topics discussed in the book. I also liked that it talked about evolution because that is one of my favorite topics to discuss and learn more information about because it astounds me how we can come from the forms that we come from and how we adapted to our environment and what we were exposed to. The thing that I didn't like about the book was that it came out bias in some aspect of the book just off the wording they were using, it seemed one sided at times and I like more when its holistic and you look at all the different aspects and keep your opinions to yourself that others may be sensitive to in a way. I learned a lot from the book such as the mind is so complex it holds within it what your ancestors may have embedded in your brain and what knowledge and information you have obtained through the years. Learn to understand the scientific side of life. Yes I would recommend this book to others because it gave me an array of information in just this 500 page book that I might have never learned in school because our system is censored at time and they don't like to discuss a lot of different challenging topics."

As most intellectually focused psychologists I try to read everything he writes. It's the basic psychology science presented in a simple but intellectual way.Pro:This is a huge book. It really goes into a lot of psychology topics and most of them are well illustrated. It's one of those books that is a bit hard to get into and read, but you want to read it again because there are so many good nuggets here. I feel like I may have missed a few great points.Con:If you have read a few evolutionary psychology books this will feel very familiar in many chapters. I was zoning out quite often as I he kept presenting topics I already had read about like mating, men, women and basic psychology. This also means that it's a great intro book into psychology. I will for sure recommend it to people getting into the field.Another thing is that it's a bit old. He is often talking about blank slate thinking and how it's bunk science, but old psychology is often more blank slate than current psychology. Since the 90's we have had a lot of gene and heritability studies that showed that most of the factors we thought were mostly environment are actually mostly genetic. Politics, personality, parenting, intelligence. We have had a lot of great studies on the heritability of these traits and they really ought to be included in such a book. It does feel a bit environment focused and it's predictable for a book this old. But it's not the end of the road for psychology knowledge anyhow and you ought to continue reading up on it. For anyone reading up on modern psychology this is it, but presented from a slight liberal view point which probably makes it a great intro book for people who are left of center and have a hard time getting into the hard science.It's a typical Pinker book. If you like his writing it's a must read for you."
231,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,4,"'How the Mind Works' is an ambitious book. Pinker addresses an insane medley of topics: if it pertains to the mind in any way whatsoever, it's fair game. This variety of topics discussed is the books greatest strength, but also it primary weakness.Firstly, the bad: this book isn't clearly connected by an overarching thesis. I suppose everything has to do with 'the mind' - though this is debatable, as there are long stretches where you'll be prone to forget this book is supposed to be about 'how the mind works'. If each of the 8 chapters (some of which span upwards of a 100 pages) had been published as a self-contained book, no one would have been the wiser. In this sense, some cohesion would have been nice. The material is presented in a somewhat haphazard manner.Now then, onto the good: the material presented is totally awesome. Pinker is a terrific writer, and just about everything covered in 'How the Mind Works' was intensely interesting. And cover a lot he does: you'll read about your brain's insane ability to make sense of visual input; about the importance of 'irrational' emotions (and why they're not so irrational after all); and about the evolutionary underpinning of sexuality, to name a few topics of interest. I didn't agree with everything said, and some of his opinions, presented as fact, are decidedly controversial. But most importantly, all of the topics were interesting, and his conclusions are almost always well supported. 'How the Mind Works' was never boring, and that's high praise for a book of this scope.Should you read this book? Maybe. It's pretty ambitious, and unless you're fairly stoked about the material, you might be better of finding something more focused and concise. But if you're willing to take the plunge, you're in for a treat - How the Mind Works is an intellectual tour de force."

This quote has chased me around my high school years like a leopard hounding after its prey. Ever since my youth, I have noticed my skepticism on the human capsule. I often wondered if rigorous science labs brought up such an idea as the human mind. Although, childhood beliefs kept my thoughts grounded to an absolute that a grater power was the innovator. How The Mind Works was food for my thoughts. Steven pinker did not answer all of my unending questions but did satisfy some of my mysteries. He starts off by stating about the importance of the cognitive niche. He also states how vision is one of the many factors that have allowed our minds to go to such far extents. I do agree with him in this. Vision has allowed us to make buildings as high as mountains, paintings that capture feelings, and better yet help us find a mate. In the book he explains illusions and different visionary test to see how our mind correlates to our brain and mind. The human mind has been a topic of discussion for over many centuries and I believe Steven Pinker simplified the structure of it in a way that's both enjoyable and informative. Although Pinker had such a great way of easing us into the wonders of the mind, he worked too much on certain topics such as individuality. He did not believe that culture, race, etc.... plays a part in our molding decisions throughout our lives. Those who wonder off into the next levels of the mind's philosophy should read this book. I highly recommend to any who is skeptical about how everything comes together. In the way that this book has helped many readers, it has also helped me add to my knowledge of the mind and the little details that come together to make it up."
233,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3239706-gordon,3,"A daunting book for the casual reader. I found most of the chapters individually readable, interesting, often controversial. But, there were few transitions from one theme to another, which I found distracting. Steven Pinker's overall thesis is that the mind is a neural-based computer that reflects the results of evolutionary psychology - meaning that the basis of much of what we do and why we do it has its roots in our historical hunter-gather origins and how we have evolved (through adaptive, natural selection) since. Pinker does not present a unifying theory of the mind, but does present interesting examples of many aspects of human behavior that he aptly explains according to his evolutionary gene-based model. I found much of what he said logical and believable, although some of the sections were less convincing than others. He spends an inordinate amount of pages on explaining gender, and by extension societal, behavior, which I found more entertaining than completely solid. The most controversial claims that Pinker makes have to do with his thoughts on the arts and religion. Pinker states that the arts have no intrinsic evolutionary value, but are outcomes of our desire for pleasure. Similarly he concludes that religion does not contribute to explaining how our brain has evolved and argues strongly against ""creationism"" and the value of religion in general. I'll conclude by sharing a quote from Pinker's book that sums up his thesis “human brains evolved by one set of laws, those of natural selection and genetics, and now interact with one another according to another set of laws, those of cognitive and social psychology, human ecology, and history”."
234,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23344184-sudnya,4,"Note that this book was written in the nineties before reading the book or this review.This book raised more questions than answers for me but that is not necessarily a bad thing.Pinker covers a wide range of topics from biological, anthropological to social constructs that have shaped our human mind and behavior. I found the chapter about the place of humor in evolution fascinating (maybe cause I have never read about it before). This book also clarified the notion of Richard Dawkin's 'selfish gene' in a broader context than just biological/evolutionary i.e. it is not animals that are selfish due to their selfish genes rather that their brains and behaviors are designed by the influence of the selfish genes. At times they will, in fact, make sacrifices which might seem altruistic from a societal perspective.Overall this huge book was quite difficult to digest and should be paced to read and ponder upon. It won't answer your questions but will provide a good framework to explore the questions whose answers you seek.The reason I knocked off a star was because I felt like it ended a bit abruptly when it was time to discuss human consciousness. It is a tall order to expect the author to provide answers but I wish he spent more time talking about it."
235,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49863781-steve,4,"Written by one of the world's foremost cognitive scientists, it's an eight-chapter deep dive on the human mind and how it functions. Starts with the physiological properties of the brain and its components - how language is processed, how physical environments are understood - and slowly transitions to the more abstract notion of the mind, including human behavior and evolutionary theories about how we got to be the way we are. I'm reasonably interested in psychology and social studies and evolutionary biology, and as such, I found the second half a lot more page-turning than the first - especially since Pinker uses all kinds of unfortunately dated computer analogies early on that were surely more apt back in 1997 than they are today. (An updated version of this book might be able to milk a lot more out of ""computational algorithm"" metaphors, particularly given the huge advancements made in artificial intelligence and machine learning over the last two decades.) Still a fascinating read with plenty to offer, and if you ever get a chance, check out some of Pinker's lectures and debates on YouTube. The guy's pretty good at what he does!"
236,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2815504-isaac-kerson,1,"This book has been made mostly completely obsolete by the field of epigenetics. The type of genetic (over) determinism espoused here was always questionable -- the author tries to explain 90% of human behavior through the narrow lense of the ""selfish gene"" -- but, epigenetics has shown that environmental factors can cause the body to put certain genetic expressions on hold for generations. The idea of genetic determinism if not flatout wrong, is at the very least deeply flawed. This is too bad because the book starts (Chapters 1 & 2) with an interesting and still-relevant discussion of modular brain functions, before it spins off into fantastic, disproven speculations which to a large extent are only tangentially related to ""How the Mind Works"". Your average Wikipedia page is better sourced than the last 5 chapters of this book. Not worth your time. Instead read: How Emotions are Made, The Ego Tunnel, or The Epigenetics Revolution"

The first section of the book, which analyzes how the brain is like a computer, is a bit of a slog. In some ways it was the most interesting for me, however, since everything he dealt with was new and cutting edge. If you get through that part the rest is a real page turner. For about a month this book turned me into a Steven Pinker quote machine (""Emotions are just a doomsday device!"", ""Marriage is just mate-socialsm!"") This, of course, makes you either highly fascinating, or the most annoying person on Earth, depending on who you talk to. Either way, I highly recommend this book.

It builds mental models and frameworks with strong explanatory power for understanding the human mind.

The conclusions arrived at bring insight and enlightenment and are well worth the journey - but be warned - many of these conclusions are preceded by the slow and careful development of ideas, which on occasion can be painstakingly dreary to the reader with non-specialist expertise in this topic (e.g. me).

I enjoyed mostly the chapter that mentioned how we would convince aliens that we are intelligent beings if they were to arrive. How they would differentiate us from cats and dogs and animals. It also answers questions about why robots cannot be created and I recommend it because it asks some questions that I have not really thought about before and it was very interesting to view the perspective of Steven Pinker since it very much is not similar to mine."

241,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7626390,3,"This was a good book overall, but it did not live up to my expectations, especially in the last few sections, which I felt were more like filler material; which is not to say that they were of little interest in and of themselves. I understand his need to make an argumentation in favor of evolutionary psychology, considering the current political climate and the constant denial of the existence of ""human nature"" on the extreme left, but I think it simply did not belong in this book.Apart from the section where the author detailed the human sense of vision, and how the brain processes visual information to build a 3D image of the environment (with all kinds of tricks and assumptions to solve problems that are technically unsolvable), in addition to the introduction of the Computational Theory of Mind, there was little talk of ""how the mind works"" actually. We learn more in this book about how the human brain might have evolved, and the environmental pressures to which it might have been subjected during that process, as well as the consequences of this evolution on human traits and behavior, than about the modules and processes within the brain that convert sensory data to meaningful information, actions, and qualia.There are whole sections dedicated to conflict between individuals, groups, sexes, parents and children, and how this might have directed our evolution, but little in the way of an explanation of what the brain is doing as it processes data about one's social standing, social relationships, etc, to generate emotions, actions, reactions and conscious decisions.The earlier sections about the modular and hierarchical nature of brain structures, and the combinatorial nature of its processes, were interesting as a refresher, but by no means offered any new ideas to me personally. The introduction and argumentation for CTM on the other hand left a greater impact on my intellect, and I'm enthused to learn more about it.Perhaps Pinker's relative failure in this book (compared to ""The Language Instinct"") is due to his attempt to tackle subjects outside of his area of expertise.That being said, it was still a enjoyable read, and was by no means devoid of good insights."
242,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2233542-mike,5,"It's hard to absorb and review a book this big. I think of it as something like a one semester college course. Some parts are very difficult and I can't say I understood them all, and others are just fun. But it's not really ""How the Mind Works"" in the sense I was looking for. I was hoping to learn how all those neurons, glia, synaps and axons work together to make thoughts and actions happen. That's not this book. This book is more about how natural selection (Pinker uses the word ""adaptation"" a lot) and the Computational Theory of the Mind result in the capabilities that our brains have, like vision, other senses, and solving problems. Much of the book is thought exercises (however clever) to suss out how a particular brain capability could have resulted in greater reproductive success. Along the way, you get a heavy dose of how amazing the mind is given the difficulty of the problems it can solve almost instantly. The penultimate chapter is all about sex and relationships (and decidedly un-PC), which is fun to read, but really strays from ""How the Mind Works"". In the last chapter, Pinker tackles, probably as well as anybody, the problems of mental activities that don't seem to have any evolutionary purpose, such as art, music and religion. Lastly, he discusses consciousness, somewhat unsuccessfully in my opinion, but who has ever tackled that one successfully?This book reminded me a lot of Jarad Diamond's writings, particularly ""The World Until Yesterday"". Like Pinker, Diamond believes *almost* all behavior and customs must serve some evolutionary purpose, i.e. increase the reproductive success of the practitioners. I can't blame these guys, after all, there is no other coherent scientific theory, but to be truthful, ""How the Mind Works"" sometimes made me doubt that the theory of evolution explains everything.I would love for Pinker to update this book. Written 20 years ago, I think he greatly underestimates the eventual capabilities of computers. While I agree that the mind is unlike any current computer, advances in AI, such as language recognition and visual interpretation might steer his thoughts in a different way."
243,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/97471543-alessandro,5,"I prefer to hear the bad news before the good, so let’s begin with the negative feedback:Through the whole book, Pinker often engages with a certain subject by stating the inaccurateness by thinkers that are not mentioned. For example (p.509): ”Many intellectuals believe that primitive warfare is rare, mild and ritualized, or at least was so until the noble savages we're contaminated by contact with the Westerners. But this is romantic nonsense.” This argument is repeatedly used in the book as a way to introduce the various subjects. I would agree that we should directly mention other thinkers’ faults, instead of fabricating something less ”hurtful”. Secondly, Pinker often falls in his own traps. In one of his later books, The Sense of Style (2014), he introduced the book by stating one of the primary reasons for bad writing; the Curse of Knowledge. This cognitive bias refers to the phenomena that the knowledge that we have gathered becomes obvious: you forget the time you weren’t yet aware of that particular information, so you rest on the assumption that others presumably know it as well. In non-fiction books, we see this bias when the authors don’t explain concepts that are self-explanatory to them. You just can’t always predict what kind of readers will read your book. Just like (barely) every author of non-fiction books, Pinker also makes use of this bias. As a psychology student myself it’s less difficult (but I have to admit, I don’t know everything), but my dad who works in insurance had a hard time reading a few pages. As you can see, I gave this book five stars. So it can’t be all bad. Firstly, most of the (psychological) knowledge is still very relevant in today's psychological (and more importantly, political) environment, even though it’s at least 20 years old. Whether you like it or not, Pinker deserves credit for this. Many of the ‘assumptions’ that reviewers mention, about are equally as valuable after two decades. Some of these assumptions can’t be classified as assumptions anymore. The now politically incorrect value that some of the paragraphs hold (mostly in the chapter: Family Values) are very effective in debates that for example show the (biological/psychological/reproductive/etc.) differences between men and women. Lastly, as I’ve stated, I study psychology. This book was a great way to go over the different subjects and building on existing knowledge. The subjects can often be perceived as dull and technical. But Pinker does a great job by adding humor and information of different academic fields to make these subjects easily consumed. Incorporating various disciplines does not only tells you something about the interests of the author but also about (in this case) psychology itself: that psychology is not only composed of psychology. When Pinker writes about an economic concept, to me, it feels as like he is really interested in the whole discipline. This makes me want to read more different books on different subjects to increase my field of interest. The ’power’ to make you want to read more books is (for me) probably the most valuable feature of a book. Have a great new year’s eve! "
244,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98058161-daniel-solomon,5,"This may be the best books summarising the interaction of neural networks/neuroscience, psychology, biology and sociology that forms modern cognitive science for the non expert. In part, that's because there aren't that many books trying to do that.The key ideas are the computional theory of the mind/mind=brain as a computational system using inputs from reality and mental models and languages to generate mental representations/pictures that guide our answers and choices (but quite different in several ways from a digital computer), and natural selection/evolution generating a species/humans that specialise in survival due to superior cognitive abilities. There's also an introduction to neural networks as how the brain implements the mind, a decent discussion about consciousness, emotions, bounded rationality and cognitive biases, but those discussions are relatively short and the topics better covered in other later books (e.g Kahneman's Thinking Fast Thinking Slow for cognitive biases, Dahaene's Consciousness and the brain etc...).Much has been made about the power of artificial neural networks to learn and even outperform humans in some restricted domains, and the computational theory of mind and its focus on innate knowledge has been dismissed by some of the researchers involved. But behind the scenes many of those successes rely on good data that is similar to providing the networks to strongly informative Bayesian priors and state of the art AI is putting more emphasis on organising neural network learning via good models and the equivalent of innate knowledge or prior probabilities. The basic idea of a computational system processing inputs into various propositions/representations implemented by (deep) neural networks remains a decent synthesis, though the last 20 years (this book is from 1998) have seen big improvements in both neural networks and more structural models such Bayesian networks."

Nowadays we know how the brain works, we know how the parts are connected and what they produce in our bodies but we still know nothing of how the human mind works. What parts of the brain makes us be aware of the world and ourselves? are we really aware of ourselves? do other animals with similar brains have different type of awareness? why does our brain makes us enjoy sex? how come we invented music, art or religion if it serves to nothing from an evolutionary perspective? or perhaps it does serve to something? why did evolution gave way to love, hate, embarrassment, sarcasm? what do these types of feelings really do behind the curtains of our awareness of them ? why do we really laugh at a joke?.... These and more are questions answered in this book and I'm so excited that we can now talk about all this thanks to the evolution of artificial intelligence and the ""computational theory of mind""."
246,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7807167-ayman,5,"This book explains how the human brain feels and thinks from an evolutionary biology stand point. How we see, smell, hear, perceive, abstract and memorize has all been shaped by tangible survival needs of our ancestors. However, the surprising and interesting part of the book is about how our emotions and social skills were also a product of evolution. Even romantic love!! :)However, there was a point ~60,000 years ago when evolution (a very slow process that works over millions of years) became secondary in shaping the human mind who started to discover itself and the world around it. We were the first species to have such advanced mental faculties that moved on from solving survival problems to ask fundamental questions about the meaning of the world itself. The problem is our brain is not biologically built to answer these questions and therefore we probably need a different mind or type of mind (an AI maybe?) to attempt such answers."
247,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52456731-lynn-derks,5,"As of this post, I am pursuing an M.A. in music and worship. My thesis is going to be something about music as language, so I was particularly interested in reading Pinker's ""The Language Instinct."" I stumbled upon HTMW before purchasing a copy of TLI, so I read HTMW first. It proved to be a valuable basis for understanding Pinker. I think Pinker might be surprised to hear that Scripture does not conflict with many of his beliefs (Scripture and science work well together - but that's another discussion). Here's an interesting issue: Pinker believes emotions to be adaptive (they were developed for survival and replication of the organism). He asserts that music is strictly a device for communicating emotions. He believes music is not adaptive (music does not aid in survival or replication of an organism). Does anyone see the problem here?"
248,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91751604-roy,4,"According to Dr. Pinker, the mind's functioning can be explained by the computational theory of mind, that is, the theory that the human mind is the product of complex neuronal activity shaped over thousands of generations through natural selection. This theory posits that the mind is comprised of specific problem solving modules each designed to tackle problems of survival. The book could have been titled the evolutionary theory of mind since much of it is focused on natural selection and the propagation of genes as an explanation for how human mental modules came to exist. It is an entertaining attempt to explain many facets of human behavior, but I think the book could have been half as long. Of particular interest is the final chapter in which he attempts to shed light on the arts, music, humor, religion, and philosophy. These areas of life he argues have little adaptive or survival value and he attempts to use the theory to understand why human beings hold these things in such high esteem. Finally, he presents the idea that perhaps the human brain did not evolve the capacity to solve the deepest mysteries of human existence."

I felt the first half of the book was a drag. There were a lot of places where analogies or explanations about computations the brain does were augmented with cultural references which I didn't care about or didn't understand. I thought that it muddied the point that was attempted to being made and didn't help me understand the overall structure of the chapter.The second half was an easier read since there isn't much of the computation explanation going on but, is still riddled with cultural references."

Other chapters, not so much; low-level vision science is woefully boring (that’s a personal preference though) and using evolutionary theory still remains a “grand theory of everything” that can be used as a post-hoc explanation of some but not all interpersonal phenomena."
251,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/251567-karen-ng,3,This book is a little harder to comprehend than other Pinker books... I will not recommend it as a neuroscience primer. Incognito by David Eagleman is so much better.

253,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/218323-becky,4,"Very interesting, well-written, and comprehensive. I appreciated the overview of both computational and evolutionary psychology in one tome of a book; computational psychology is pretty much awesome, and though I must confess that I skipped some of the technical examples in an effort to prevent my brain from breaking, Pinker's writing was for the most part clear and explanatory. I learned a lot!I would be interested to find out whether any of the specific evolutionary theories have become passe over the last ten years, since a great deal of new research must have come out since then. A second edition would be great if necessary.I still have reservations about the conclusion of the book. Basically, Pinker says that the computational view of the mind means that consciousness - the ability of the mind to actually experience stimulus and thought, like the taste of a strawberry or the redness of red - has no apparent function. People could go through the complex computational steps of mental activity without experiencing any of it. There is no way to prove that the person sitting next to you is not a ""philosophical zombie,"" who acts like they think and feel but is really just a mechanical thing.Not only does this mean I have no solid proof that all of you aren't just automatons, but no can explain why we experience things to begin with! Very perverse philosophers have attempted to argue that experience is an illusion, but of course this makes very little sense. Pinker is forced to conclude that our brains are just not smart enough to solve a peculiar problem like the nature of consciousness and self, along with some other potential philosophical problems like the possibility of absolute morality or the ability of language to refer to real things (don't understand the problem with this last one myself.)I'm not saying that I can prove Pinker is absolutely wrong in this conclusion, but it is deeply unsatisfying. Our minds are, apparently, the product of a lawful universe. Logic is able to tackle, if not solve, every other problem with which we have been presented, from pulsars to microorganisms. The only exception is strange, peripheral problem of where the universe came from to begin with. Why should our minds be another such exception? If we can't explain our minds as a logical evolutionary adaptation, doesn't that call into question evolutionary psychology as a theory? How could human awareness not be the product of evolution (the ultimate logical process)?Pinker tries to compare our failure to understand the mind to an autistic person's failure to understand the existence of other minds or a dog's colorblindness. But the problem with an autistic person, as I understand it, is not that they can't have the existence of other minds explained to them, but that they don't intuitively act as if they exist. Similarly, if the dog were more intelligent, they could obviously believe in and understand what color is, they just can't imagine what it is to see it. If we were blind to the nature of how sentience interacts with the rest of the universe, we should not realize that we have this blindness until it is explained to us. As it is, we are aware of a blindness and can't think of how to see what we know we know must be out there to be seen.Finally, if Pinker is right that science has failed us regarding the problem of human consciousness, it's rather questionable for him to argue that religious or mystical explanations are out of the question, because if that were so, it wouldn't be an unsolvable problem after all. Either the logical forces of the universe to which we are all accustomed are responsible for consciousness, or Something Else is. Pinker is right; it would be presumptuous and unscientific to call the Something Else God or Divine Energies or what have you. But we cannot discount these hypotheses outright, and the notion that our consciousnesses apparently work apart from the causation that is evolution at least means that the universe is a much stranger place than we have been led to believe. Really I would rather believe that my mind is the result of scientifically knowable causes, I like science, but if I am to believe Pinker, then another, very weird solution is out there.Very interesting read, but the ultimate difficulties brought up by the theories are much more frustrating than the elegant solutions they provide! Mostly I just don't like giving up on a scientific solution to a problem; it seems wrong."
254,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21015158-sam-caldwell,4,"I was surprised at just how comprehensive and compelling the two theories presented in the book are:1) the mind is an information processor, i.e. computer2) many characteristics of the mind can be explained in terms of the selective pressures on humans living as tribes of hunter/gatherers.Some bits that stand out are viewing emotions as facilitators of cooperation, in that they offer difficult-to-spoof insights to someone's state of mind. They also implement a doomsday-device-like deterrent; an infuriated person acts in a way that seems clearly not in their rational self-interest. The (credible) possibility of such a rage acts as a deterrent to those who might consider exploiting the subject.One thing I didn't like is the author's tendency to take potshots at different groups."

256,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,3,"To a large extent the answer to the books title is that we have learnt a lot but still have a long way to go! The first part of the book digs into the 'mechanics' of the brain and the mind that 'inhabits' it. Discussion of he phenomenon of concsiousness is undertaken early on and given a naturalistic solution later in the book, although it is not a very satisfying one. While I enjoyed he attempt to identify the mechanics of concsiousness, the 'answer' seemed to rely more on philosophy and a natural selection - based hypothesis about how it might work. Other chapters in the early part of the book were also concerned with mind mechanics, and the discussion of how we see and the way the mind gets involved is excellent, if mind bogglingly complex. In the latter part of the book, as refered to earlier, the flavour relies less on measured infofomation abou the brain, instead inferring what goes on through pschology studies interpreted with a natural selection lens. The arguments made are soundly reasoned and reveal uncomfortable truths for many idealist viewpoints on 'human nature' in both left and right camps. It certainly presents an alternative perspective that deeerves a more prominent place in public discussion, although it carries the risk of misinterpretation and abuse, and the message that ethics lies in a different sphere would need o be given equally clear emphasis. however, regarding the scientific underpinnings of the conclusions, these sections seemed lacking, - the argument seems to be ""because of our primitive survival and reproduction needs, our emotions are tuned to follow these basic intincts"". Connection with how this connects with the mind and how competing instincts are resolved was given little attention. The final chapter attemptsto explain the religious instinct and felt particularly ad hoc. Much of what I've wrtten is critical - the book was challengin and thought provoking. It is certainly worth a read although it is reatively long and requires some perserverance. There are a few other books around which may add to some of this (i is relatively old now - 10 years or so) and certainly makes GEB more concrete and as a reslut is prbably a good place to start for modern unerstanding of the brain."

I'm a liberal arts major who never even took Psych 101 and this tome did a great job filling me in about the different modes of the human mind. This book by turns fascinated me, astonished me, and caused me to marvel, all great things. Having a book kindle one's curiosity is always splendid, especially when the objects of that curiosity are the myriad amazing things our body does each moment of each day but whose wonder we become desensitized to. In HTMW we learn that ""The mind is not the brain, but what the brain does...The brain's special status comes from a special thing the brain does which makes us see, think, feel, choose and act. That special thing is information processing, or computation"" (24). Pinker bases his book on two scientific theories: the Computational Theory of Mind and Evolution through Natural Selection. Basically, he argues that the mind is an adaptation that evolved to help humans outwit the environment, animals, objects, and human beings. In the opening chapters he explains these theories, and then for the rest of the book applies them to several of the mind's many modules, such as: the visual system, ideas, personal emotions, social emotions, and philosophy, religion, art, and music (""Auditory cheesecake""). I learned a ridiculous amount from this book and often felt ecstatic reading it. His arguments are very convincing and copiously documented. And his prose is very rich and memorable. I re-read many sections in sheer delight and things stuck with me due to the engaging way he wrote them. I plan to re-read portions of this book for a long while to come. The chapter on personal emotions, ""Hotheads,"" was a highlight for me, looking at why we feel at all, where different feelings come from in our evolutionary past, and what emotions are and are for. He discusses all kinds of feelings such as anger, happiness, grief, and disgust. It's a fantastic chapter!Overall, this book enhanced my worldview through a detailed look at the human mind's inner workings and boosted my curiosity, both invaluable assets! I am looking forward to reading more of Mr. Pinker's works."
258,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1571969-billie-pritchett,4,"Steven Pinker's How the Mind Works is a long book and a Book about Everything. Although the title suggests it's a popular psychology book, the discoveries of psychology and especially psychology understood as evolutionary psychology are used to explain all aspects of human life. Most of the first part of the book is not technical but might be boring to its readers. For example, there's a long explanation about how vision works that was a complete snooze-fest. From about halfway on in the book, I think the readers would be interested. There, Pinker writes about how evolutionary psychology helps explain societies, and, later, our leisurely appreciation of beauty and excellence like that expressed in art or music.Part of what the book is driving at, although it is not expressed explicitly until a later work, The Blank Slate, is that the human mind is richly endowed with these innate faculties for understanding ourselves and the world but they are, by design, limited in the ways that they allow us to interpret the information we receive from the senses. Even our faculties for scientific discovery seem to have an upper limit on them. He proposes near the end of the book philosophical questions such as ""How can free will exist in a deterministic world?"" might be a mystery for our species because our brains weren't designed to handle that kind of question. The characters in the book Flatland are two-dimensional shapes who live in a two-dimensional world. Any person would be free to leave the world they live in called Flatland if only they left through the third dimension. But the people in flatland are only familiar with two dimensions: forward/backward and left/right. Their minds can ask the question but they could never understand what it would mean to move in a third dimension (up/down). Because of the human mind, we're in a similar position. No reason to be pessimistic, though: The human mind is awfully rich as it is."

It also throws out there crazy concepts or that at least seem unordinary in our society such as raping individuals in our genes. What I also liked about the book was that it presented factual evidence on most of the topics discussed in the book. I also liked that it talked about evolution because that is one of my favorite topics to discuss and learn more information about because it astounds me how we can come from the forms that we come from and how we adapted to our environment and what we were exposed to. The thing that I didn't like about the book was that it came out bias in some aspect of the book just off the wording they were using, it seemed one sided at times and I like more when its holistic and you look at all the different aspects and keep your opinions to yourself that others may be sensitive to in a way. I learned a lot from the book such as the mind is so complex it holds within it what your ancestors may have embedded in your brain and what knowledge and information you have obtained through the years. Learn to understand the scientific side of life. Yes I would recommend this book to others because it gave me an array of information in just this 500 page book that I might have never learned in school because our system is censored at time and they don't like to discuss a lot of different challenging topics."

As most intellectually focused psychologists I try to read everything he writes. It's the basic psychology science presented in a simple but intellectual way.Pro:This is a huge book. It really goes into a lot of psychology topics and most of them are well illustrated. It's one of those books that is a bit hard to get into and read, but you want to read it again because there are so many good nuggets here. I feel like I may have missed a few great points.Con:If you have read a few evolutionary psychology books this will feel very familiar in many chapters. I was zoning out quite often as I he kept presenting topics I already had read about like mating, men, women and basic psychology. This also means that it's a great intro book into psychology. I will for sure recommend it to people getting into the field.Another thing is that it's a bit old. He is often talking about blank slate thinking and how it's bunk science, but old psychology is often more blank slate than current psychology. Since the 90's we have had a lot of gene and heritability studies that showed that most of the factors we thought were mostly environment are actually mostly genetic. Politics, personality, parenting, intelligence. We have had a lot of great studies on the heritability of these traits and they really ought to be included in such a book. It does feel a bit environment focused and it's predictable for a book this old. But it's not the end of the road for psychology knowledge anyhow and you ought to continue reading up on it. For anyone reading up on modern psychology this is it, but presented from a slight liberal view point which probably makes it a great intro book for people who are left of center and have a hard time getting into the hard science.It's a typical Pinker book.

261,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,4,"'How the Mind Works' is an ambitious book. Pinker addresses an insane medley of topics: if it pertains to the mind in any way whatsoever, it's fair game. This variety of topics discussed is the books greatest strength, but also it primary weakness.Firstly, the bad: this book isn't clearly connected by an overarching thesis. I suppose everything has to do with 'the mind' - though this is debatable, as there are long stretches where you'll be prone to forget this book is supposed to be about 'how the mind works'. If each of the 8 chapters (some of which span upwards of a 100 pages) had been published as a self-contained book, no one would have been the wiser. In this sense, some cohesion would have been nice. The material is presented in a somewhat haphazard manner.Now then, onto the good: the material presented is totally awesome. Pinker is a terrific writer, and just about everything covered in 'How the Mind Works' was intensely interesting. And cover a lot he does: you'll read about your brain's insane ability to make sense of visual input; about the importance of 'irrational' emotions (and why they're not so irrational after all); and about the evolutionary underpinning of sexuality, to name a few topics of interest. I didn't agree with everything said, and some of his opinions, presented as fact, are decidedly controversial. But most importantly, all of the topics were interesting, and his conclusions are almost always well supported. 'How the Mind Works' was never boring, and that's high praise for a book of this scope.Should you read this book? Maybe. It's pretty ambitious, and unless you're fairly stoked about the material, you might be better of finding something more focused and concise. But if you're willing to take the plunge, you're in for a treat - How the Mind Works is an intellectual tour de force."

This quote has chased me around my high school years like a leopard hounding after its prey. Ever since my youth, I have noticed my skepticism on the human capsule. I often wondered if rigorous science labs brought up such an idea as the human mind. Although, childhood beliefs kept my thoughts grounded to an absolute that a grater power was the innovator. How The Mind Works was food for my thoughts. Steven pinker did not answer all of my unending questions but did satisfy some of my mysteries. He starts off by stating about the importance of the cognitive niche. He also states how vision is one of the many factors that have allowed our minds to go to such far extents. I do agree with him in this. Vision has allowed us to make buildings as high as mountains, paintings that capture feelings, and better yet help us find a mate. In the book he explains illusions and different visionary test to see how our mind correlates to our brain and mind. The human mind has been a topic of discussion for over many centuries and I believe Steven Pinker simplified the structure of it in a way that's both enjoyable and informative. Although Pinker had such a great way of easing us into the wonders of the mind, he worked too much on certain topics such as individuality. He did not believe that culture, race, etc.... plays a part in our molding decisions throughout our lives. Those who wonder off into the next levels of the mind's philosophy should read this book. I highly recommend to any who is skeptical about how everything comes together. In the way that this book has helped many readers, it has also helped me add to my knowledge of the mind and the little details that come together to make it up."
263,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3239706-gordon,3,"A daunting book for the casual reader. I found most of the chapters individually readable, interesting, often controversial. But, there were few transitions from one theme to another, which I found distracting. Steven Pinker's overall thesis is that the mind is a neural-based computer that reflects the results of evolutionary psychology - meaning that the basis of much of what we do and why we do it has its roots in our historical hunter-gather origins and how we have evolved (through adaptive, natural selection) since. Pinker does not present a unifying theory of the mind, but does present interesting examples of many aspects of human behavior that he aptly explains according to his evolutionary gene-based model. I found much of what he said logical and believable, although some of the sections were less convincing than others. He spends an inordinate amount of pages on explaining gender, and by extension societal, behavior, which I found more entertaining than completely solid. The most controversial claims that Pinker makes have to do with his thoughts on the arts and religion. Pinker states that the arts have no intrinsic evolutionary value, but are outcomes of our desire for pleasure. Similarly he concludes that religion does not contribute to explaining how our brain has evolved and argues strongly against ""creationism"" and the value of religion in general. I'll conclude by sharing a quote from Pinker's book that sums up his thesis “human brains evolved by one set of laws, those of natural selection and genetics, and now interact with one another according to another set of laws, those of cognitive and social psychology, human ecology, and history”."
264,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23344184-sudnya,4,"Note that this book was written in the nineties before reading the book or this review.This book raised more questions than answers for me but that is not necessarily a bad thing.Pinker covers a wide range of topics from biological, anthropological to social constructs that have shaped our human mind and behavior. I found the chapter about the place of humor in evolution fascinating (maybe cause I have never read about it before). This book also clarified the notion of Richard Dawkin's 'selfish gene' in a broader context than just biological/evolutionary i.e. it is not animals that are selfish due to their selfish genes rather that their brains and behaviors are designed by the influence of the selfish genes. At times they will, in fact, make sacrifices which might seem altruistic from a societal perspective.Overall this huge book was quite difficult to digest and should be paced to read and ponder upon. It won't answer your questions but will provide a good framework to explore the questions whose answers you seek.The reason I knocked off a star was because I felt like it ended a bit abruptly when it was time to discuss human consciousness. It is a tall order to expect the author to provide answers but I wish he spent more time talking about it."
265,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49863781-steve,4,"Written by one of the world's foremost cognitive scientists, it's an eight-chapter deep dive on the human mind and how it functions. Starts with the physiological properties of the brain and its components - how language is processed, how physical environments are understood - and slowly transitions to the more abstract notion of the mind, including human behavior and evolutionary theories about how we got to be the way we are. I'm reasonably interested in psychology and social studies and evolutionary biology, and as such, I found the second half a lot more page-turning than the first - especially since Pinker uses all kinds of unfortunately dated computer analogies early on that were surely more apt back in 1997 than they are today. (An updated version of this book might be able to milk a lot more out of ""computational algorithm"" metaphors, particularly given the huge advancements made in artificial intelligence and machine learning over the last two decades.) Still a fascinating read with plenty to offer, and if you ever get a chance, check out some of Pinker's lectures and debates on YouTube. The guy's pretty good at what he does!"
266,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2815504-isaac-kerson,1,"This book has been made mostly completely obsolete by the field of epigenetics. The type of genetic (over) determinism espoused here was always questionable -- the author tries to explain 90% of human behavior through the narrow lense of the ""selfish gene"" -- but, epigenetics has shown that environmental factors can cause the body to put certain genetic expressions on hold for generations. The idea of genetic determinism if not flatout wrong, is at the very least deeply flawed. This is too bad because the book starts (Chapters 1 & 2) with an interesting and still-relevant discussion of modular brain functions, before it spins off into fantastic, disproven speculations which to a large extent are only tangentially related to ""How the Mind Works"". Your average Wikipedia page is better sourced than the last 5 chapters of this book. Not worth your time. Instead read: How Emotions are Made, The Ego Tunnel, or The Epigenetics Revolution"
267,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/399523-mike,5,"This is really a great book. I've been a fan of Steven Pinker's since the ""The Blank Slate"", and he does an amazing job of distilling complicated technical subjects in a way that is easily digestible and interesting to a layperson like myself. The first section of the book, which analyzes how the brain is like a computer, is a bit of a slog. In some ways it was the most interesting for me, however, since everything he dealt with was new and cutting edge. If you get through that part the rest is a real page turner. For about a month this book turned me into a Steven Pinker quote machine (""Emotions are just a doomsday device!"", ""Marriage is just mate-socialsm!"") This, of course, makes you either highly fascinating, or the most annoying person on Earth, depending on who you talk to. Either way, I highly recommend this book. It really makes you step back and reconsider our your outdated beliefs about how people think."

It builds mental models and frameworks with strong explanatory power for understanding the human mind. This book impacts the way you view your own behaviour and the behaviour of others by exposing you to a deeper evolution-based grounding to the very complex topic of the human mind.It is a big book containing just 8 chapters approaching 80-100 pages each . The conclusions arrived at bring insight and enlightenment and are well worth the journey - but be warned - many of these conclusions are preceded by the slow and careful development of ideas, which on occasion can be painstakingly dreary to the reader with non-specialist expertise in this topic (e.g. me). However, the journey (even the dreary bits) is worth it - this book can open your mind - there is much to be gained in reading it."

I recommend this also for people who are curious about why things are the way they are. This answers questions about why certain people think about certain things. I enjoyed mostly the chapter that mentioned how we would convince aliens that we are intelligent beings if they were to arrive. How they would differentiate us from cats and dogs and animals. It also answers questions about why robots cannot be created and I recommend it because it asks some questions that I have not really thought about before and it was very interesting to view the perspective of Steven Pinker since it very much is not similar to mine."

This was due in part to this one book having more width and depth than all the psychology courses I took at university put together. I almost wish that I had skipped Uni and read this instead, but then again I doubt I would have understood this book without the basic grounding their courses kindly provided.A rare mixture of luminous thinking and clear writing is how I would summarise this book.I'm not really feeling in a mood to be verbose about psychology and philosophy today so you're going to have to be content with this.If you want more then scan through my 'reading progress' notes - they give more detail."

Even if you don't believe in evolution (which I'm still not sure I do) this book gives AMAZING insights into everything we do as humans, from emotions to relationships to our appreciation for art and humor... and explains how the process of evolution shaped it all. A hard read (read it with a pen and make notes in the margins), but absolutely mind-blowing.I especially love how he illustrates heavy academic material with easily accessible examples from pop culture. While you DO need to have a, you know, 'mind that really works' to read this book, you do NOT need any kind of previous scientific training or understanding to grasp the concepts."

Today I decided to abandon it, even though I was already at the last chapter.Very interesting topic, but the book gets really obsessively detailed and repetitive at times. While Pinker have a way of explaining things, I am just frustrated that none of the things he explains have actual hard evidence backing it. It is fine to be able to come up with a seemingly logical explanation for certain human behaviour, but the lack of real evidence just don't cut it for me."
273,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826775-a-reader,3,"I liked the book, i think it is an intellectually stimulating piece of work. My main objection is Pinker's notion that behaviour is adapted to a Stone Age way of life and cannot cope wery well with the modernity of Space Age world.'Our brains', he writes, 'are not wired to cope with anonymous crowds, schooling, written language, governments, police, courts, armies, modern medicine, formal social institutions, high technology, and other newcomers to the human experience.' I cannot understant it. Why not? Is the human mind that created all these and many more, after all.."

290,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/662191-noreen,5,"COMPUTATIONAL THEORY OF MINDJust before reading this, I read a rambling, anecdotal, autobiographical mess that purports to be a science book. When I pick up a science book, I expect a clear statement of the main argument and a straightforward, organized presentation of evidence. I would think that to be a good scientist one would need clear thinking skills and a good grasp of logic, and an ability to express that clarity in writing. Just a few pages into this book I knew I would not be disappointed. I suspected that by the end I would know very little about Steven Pinker and a lot about the mind. Reading this before reading Tooby and Cosmides is probably like reading Dawkins before Darwin. But that worked for me, because the later writer interpreted the former so well that it increased my understanding of the underlying principles. I have bookmarked evolutionary psychology material by Tooby and Cosmides to read later.Though this book is written for the non-scientist, nothing here is condescending or glib. When he uses a term, he states which definition he is using. I really appreciate these efforts. This book is filled with the most complex and esoteric ideas, yet it was a pleasure and a joy to read.""The idea that parents shape their children is so ingrained that most people don't even realize it is a testable hypothesis and not a self-evident truth."" What I found truly striking is that many common beliefs about social science are just plain wrong. We base public policy on them, but the evidence doesn't bear them out. One is that parents have a lot of influence on their children's personalities. Evolutionary biology predicts they have very little influence, and studies confirm it. But it's not a popular idea in our society. We want to think we have influence over our children. We also want someone to blame when children go bad. So the myth persists.""It's not that the claim that there is an interaction between innate structure and learning (or between heredity and environment, nature and nurture, biology and culture) is literally wrong. Rather, it falls into the category of ideas that are so bad they are not even wrong."" ""Evolution and learning can also go on simultaneously, with innate structure evolving in an animal that also learns.""I just finished the first chapter. Wow. He begins with the robot challenge, demonstrating just how difficult it is to mechanically replicate even the simplest things people do. He describes the problem of understanding human vision as the difference between what information our eyes gather as contrasted with what our brains interpret. (I ""see"" things differently after reading this part.) He shows how what we consider ""common sense"" is far beyond the ability of any robot we've constructed so far. There are revolutionary arguments here, and some inflammatory statements. No wonder he's controversial. He discredits a lot of popular concepts in psychiatry and psychology. He talks about ""modules,"" but not in the simplistic structure/function way you might expect. He says our minds are produced by natural selection, but that doesn't mean we are limited to our biological drives. We have ""a complex mind that is designed to mesh with what is in nature.""He argues against the popular notions of biology or culture being causes of our behavior, saying, first, that the biology/culture dichotomy is a false one, and second, that it is used as an argument to abdicate personal responsibility. (He can't help it: he was born that way, or he ate too many Twinkies, or it was the system, or he was abused, etc.) Personal responsibility, however, would seem to require free will, whatever that is. Whether our decisions are based on random causes, intentional causes, or uncaused causes, free will remains a mystery.Most importantly, he portrays the brain as an information processor, saying information theory has revolutionized the study of neuroscience. Even with all the analogies, I'm having trouble grasping idea of the computational theory of mind. What I can comprehend is that it's central to understanding consciousness and intelligence without resorting to a magical explanation. Using Dennett's analogy, the brain as a machine can be explained by breaking down complex processes into ever smaller tasks until even the most stupid homunculus, or demon, can do each of them. Then, put millions of these tiny steps together, and speed up the process, and intelligence results. (I think.) On the other hand, apparently sentience is simply is a construct of our consciousness and doesn't bear scientific examination. It's another mystery.He argues, quite effectively I think, against popular theories of mind such as associationism and connectionism, saying they are not alternatives of, but adjuncts to the computational theory of mind.The next argument is for the theory of natural selection, as if it needs defending. It turns out it does, and not just against creationists. He picks apart opposing arguments, such as macromutation and random drift. After carefully showing how the human brain could be the result of natural selection, and that humans, rather than being its pinnacle or ""goal"" (because it has no goals) are just another, different product, he goes into how and why humans differ from the other animals.Again he examines the complex ways we think and plan and he mentions the ""cognitive niche"" proposed by Toobey. He writes about the tracking ability of the modern hunter gatherers (!Kung) showing they use abstract thinking. It made me think about the claim by James Gleick in The Information that cognitive thought as we understand it could not exist prior to written language (a claim that one reviewer of that book said has been largely discredited). Pinker may have been one of those who discredited it, perhaps in The Language Instinct. However, I may be confusing ""abstract thought"" and ""cognitive thought."" I had this aha moment when I thought abstract thought is what people do without language, but cognitive thought is what happens when people put those thoughts into symbols (words) that can be expressed or communicated. Basically, I think cognitive thought is ""thinking about thinking."" I imagine this isn't an original idea. I probably just figured out for myself what cognitive science has known for decades.After some stuff about our understanding (or rather lack of it) regarding math and physics beyond that needed for survival, and some treatment of the language instinct, we arrive at what is a more interesting topic for me: emotions. The claims are that the triune brain theory (reptilian brain) is wrong and that emotions were essential to our survival and are not nonadaptive baggage. He says, ""intelligence is the pursuit of goals in the face of obstacles"" and ""emotions are mechanisms that set the brain's highest level goals.""While reading the section of chapter 6 on food taboos, I kept seeing parallels with religion. Disgust at certain foods is grounded in avoidance of poisons, yet it differs between cultures and is mostly irrational. Children up to two years old will put almost anything in their mouths. They learn from their parents what is disgusting and they pass that knowledge on to their children. Many food taboos are religious, and the principle can easily be expanded to other religious beliefs and practices.One thing I take issue with is that he keeps using wording that hints at teleology. He says, ""'selfish' means 'acting in ways that make one's own replication more likely.'"" I would word this more passively, something like, ""'selfish' means being able to live long enough to replicate, having inherited the characteristics that allowed one's parents to survive long enough to replicate.""The section headed ""The Doomsday Machine"" is particularly interesting. It's about emotions, especially those of honor and vengeance, and the advertising of them by facial expressions. It's about the genuineness of those expressions, which Pinker says is evidenced by the fact that they are handcuffed to our involuntarily physical processes (and therefore maybe the triune brain theory does have validity). There is much speculation here, but it's food for thought.And here's a thought: that grief is a useless emotion unexplainable except as a doomsday machine (to ensure people have an interest in protecting people they love).Cheesecake, pornography, and the arts.I found the honesty of the last chapter refreshing. Pinker says it like it is -- that the arts are not biologically adaptive; that they are shortcuts we created to excite the pleasure circuits of the brain that ordinarily would be stimulated by activities that increase fitness. That view is unpopular today. People don't want to admit that art, like fashion, is a matter of status. People who have the wealth and leisure time to spend lots of resources on the arts want to justify their obsession. They're influential people, which might explain why popular culture (and some science writers) indulge that wish. The book I mentioned at the outset of this review is one such treatment. The author, who is admittedly obsessed with music, argues that music is not just ""auditory cheesecake""; that it is biologically adaptive. Now I know why I felt it was such a waste of time. When my book group discussed it, a member told us that he has taught himself to appreciate Schönberg by repeatedly listening to recordings of his work, to his wife's annoyance. (I heard a Schönberg piece at a symphony performance, and once was enough for a lifetime.) I don't feel any need to pretend to like something to impress anyone. I can't think of any other reason one would do it, especially now that I've read Pinker. Humans do other biologically functionless activities. The intellect itself may be nonadaptive. Religion and philosophy. Psychology. I'm sure the irony is not lost on Pinker that his own education and profession fall under this umbrella. He doesn't denigrate these activities; he just says evolutionary biology doesn't explain them."
291,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8173124-george-marshall,4,"I very much enjoyed the book. The topic is more ""Why The Mind Works"", and with that being the author's actual stated aim, the book seems misnamed. The author is making a case for seeing the mind as an evolved consortium of mental modules. Much of the thought in the book is not necessarily his own - the book is abounding with quotations, some in defense, some to rail against. The quotes, frankly, are frequently more interesting than the surrounding detail. He even points out early on that he is not adding new information, but seeking to bring it together in a readable form. Despite, he balances things fairly well and brings a coherent whole out of it.Pinker is a little full of himself. He can be dismissive. He will mine the sources for whatever can be used in support of his point, even if the authors themselves disagree with him, sometimes pointedly. One example of his unique way of handling other viewpoints stuck out to me:""When I mentioned the theory of parent-offspring conflict to console a colleague whose two-year-old son had become a pest after the birth of a younger brother he snapped. ""All you're saying is that people are selfish!"" Sleepless for weeks, he could be forgiven for missing the point. Clearly, parents aren't selfish; parents are the least selfish entities in the known universe. But they aren't infinitely selfless either..."" (p.442)To which one can only remark that while studying psychology and the mind, Pinker had forgotten or ignored the example of Job and his rather unhelpful set of friends. He had been a terrible friend and/or colleague, offering up his ""wisdom"" in place of the sympathy requested. I chuckle, though I am probably as bad at times, but he seems unaware of how pompous this recounting makes him appear. ""He could be forgiven..."" The temerity! Ah, well.But back to the point, he is usually successful in making his point. He presents a pretty compelling case for how many of the modules we see at work in the mind could have been ""designed"" through adaptive means. But in a number of instances he ends by simply spitting out a multitude of possibilities to answer the open question. This he does while maintaining the certitude that adaptive means can account for all we could want to know about the inner workings of the mind.Until it isn't. With music, specifically, he seems to get into weeds, giving all manner of technical details of harmonics and such, as if, lacking a good argument for how we adapted a sense for the pleasures of music, he might bore the reader into acceptance through fine print. In the end, music in his opinion is non-adaptive, ""cheesecake"" in his words - a pleasureful cocktail that plays off of the other modules, but was not itself selected for. At least he admits the picture he paints of our musical inclinations is ""speculative"".Of course a book that tries to treat the whole of the human mind and its development will have to address the subject of religion and our propensity towards it. Pinker comes off derisively, from the introduction to the bitter end, but most of the time it did not distract from the meat of what was being said. While arrogant, he is as dismissive of religious practitioners as he is of feminists unable to square their moral convictions with the reality of the evolved nature of our minds (for good or bad!). Though, he does apologize - backhandedly - to the feminists:""I wish I could have discussed the evolutionary psychology of sexuality without the asides about feminist theory, but in today's intellectual climate that is impossible...These kinds of arguments combine bad biology (nature is nice), bad psychology (the mind is created by society), and bad ethics (what people like is good). Feminism would lose nothing by giving them up."" (pp.492-3)The book naturally flows from the fundamental modules until it reaches the point where one is not sure what is adaptation and what is the working of culture with the framework it has been given. In turn he discusses vision, body adaptation, language, logic (of a sort), probability (especially in the sense of cheat sensing), mating and reproduction, friendship, and onto arts and literature.Getting to the big question of sentience, he spends very little time in throwing out a ""we can't know"", as if that is somehow better than the answers he dismisses so quickly and easily. An unsatisfying ending. But this does not overcome the mountain of enjoyed reading that makes up the book."
292,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57079482-chuck-kollars,3,"This book is quite long, and glancingly touches on a very wide variety of topics. Even such an abstruse question as why the art of painting might have more appeal to social elites is discussed a little. This variety shouldn't though obscure the fact that some very basic views about human thinking provide the main focus of the book and tie it all together. The author clearly made a mighty attempt to organize the mass of ideas and evidence in a sensible way; nevertheless the end result feels a bit scattered, probably mostly because the topics covered range so widely. It seemed to me (a more careful reader might produce a more accurate summary) the book's central ideas were:1. The human brain is a melange of fairly separate parts.2. Many of the parts are quite sophisticated. For example interpreting the visual data of 3D objects under variable illumination is nearly impossible, yet the brain manages to do it with ease. 3. The procedure by which the human brain decides which course of action to take when different parts of the brain come to different conclusions is simple, straightforward, and effective. 4. Almost all the operation of the human brain is ""automatic"" in the sense that it's not available to reflection/consciousness at all no matter what. 5. The operation and sophistication of each subsystem of the brain can be directly explained by evolution, typically with reference to the way humans lived in hunter-gatherer groups five thousand years ago. (Here I have a quibble, as the book just _assumes_ without evidence that human biological evolution has pretty much stopped.)6. Ideas that fit well into any one of these subsystems tend to take over, resulting in what we call ""cultural evolution"". (Or to put it in cruder words, there's something to the ""cultural meme"" hypothesis)7. Many of our most cherished things (for example ""cheesecake"") are in fact hacks that exploit some sort of quirk in each of several different brain parts. 8. Our taste for aesthetic/artistic things does _not_ indicate some sort of higher level of consciousness, _nor_ is it the ""purpose"" of life. Rather, it arises simply as an unintended side effect of the way the human brain is organized. (It may also arise from the evolutionary results of pressure to reproduce.)(Interestingly, the idea that -compared to ""reasoned"" responses- ""emotional"" responses that come out of a human brain are ""heuristic shortcuts"" that are much much faster and right often enough to be useful, is most definitely _not_ among those used by the book. The book doesn't ""disgree"" with this idea; a better description is the book simply ""ignores"" it, presenting its case without recourse one way or the other to this idea.)A fair amount of evidence from the results of experiments is presented to support these ideas. At the same time, an implicit case is made that these ideas make sense when taken _all_together_, that they support each other ...a lot. Much of the research stems from a rather small group of investigators. The _possibility_ that putting these ideas together is in fact revolutionary and is not yet generally accepted even by many academics is not discussed at all. The book provides a good overview of an entire subject area at a level deeper than a journalistic article but not nearly as deep as the original scientific papers; a little deeper even than Scientific American (and much longer:-), but not so arcane it feels like reading a graduate level textbook."
293,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419307-rachel,4,"Whew! This has been on my to-read list for years, and I've been trying to read it for months, but people keep recalling it from the library. At nearly 600 pithy pages, this book is more than worthwhile despite its age -- now 20 years old! My primary takeaway from reading this was learning how to frame each of our human traits in the context of evolution (natural selection). The ""computational theory of mind"" fits neatly with the pressures of natural selection, evolving us as beings highly adapted to solving problems of survival as foraging peoples. It is fascinating to look at traits not obviously related to survival problems (love, religion, music), although you have to wait until the very end for these juicy tidbits. I do have some criticisms of the book. One is that you really have to slog through some theory before getting to the meat of the book, and I could see a lot of people abandoning the book in the first 100 pages due to this unnecessarily detailed discussion. Another is that Pinker gives outsize focus to the subjects he is seemingly most expert in, like vision, but cultural aspects like music get tacked on at the end in a very superficial way. Also, leaving out the language component simply because he already wrote about it in another book is a pretty big flaw in this one.As a musician, I found the section on music to be woefully lacking, with many of the statements highly objectionable. For example: ""Many movies and television shows literally orchestrate the viewer's emotions from beginning to end with quasi-musical arrangements. They have no real rhythm, melody, or grouping."" Grouping? Does he mean form? Any undergraduate music student could tell you that movie scores consist not only of rhythm and melody, but of form on multiple levels. Pinker goes on to refer to the ""Jaws"" and ""Mission Impossible"" scores as ""pseudo-music."" If the Mission Impossible theme isn't music, I don't know what is! Also, although I enjoyed the discussion of the overtone series, he accepts Schenker as an inherent fact of music rather than a Western construct. He uses the word ""perhaps"" about twice per paragraph in this section, a clear indication that he's going out on a limb when trying to write on this subject. It made me question what specialists in the other fields think about the sections on visual arts, emotion, etc.Finally, I have to take issue with the statements about women and the treatment of gender roles in this book. No matter how many times or how elegantly Pinker qualified his statements as not being what is ""good,"" simply what natural selection has evolved, I could have used a much more nuanced discussion about this in a contemporary context rather than defaulting to referring to the mother as the one responsible for raising the young. Also, where is the discussion of homosexuality and nontraditional family structures? I get that this is probably outside of the scope of this book, but the way these subjects were treated sometimes felt so backwards that it was hard to swallow.But still, read it."
294,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,3,"In this book, Steven Pinker describes our mind - more precisely: our mental faculties - as a complex set of algorithms, sculpted by natural selection. Pinker uses two theories - the computational theory of mind and the theory of evolution by natural selection - to accomplish this amazing feat.According to the computational theory of mind, our mental organs are composed of algorithms, built up out of simpler subroutines which are in turn built up out of subsubroutines. This goes all the way down to the most basic, simplest algorithms that are digital: yes/no, on/off, etc. What it means, in essence, is that we come equipped with pre-programmed mental software with which we perceive the world. This software works is based on certain assumptions - based on the stability and the continuity of physical laws - and it's in the moments that the assumptions don't hold that we are tricked or fooled by our own mind (i.e. cognitive illusions).The other building block of Pinkers story is evolution by natural selection. Evolution shaped all the organisms on this planet, including us. Homo sapiens is unique in its mental capabilities, even though our mind is just one way to solve the natural problems (some others being strong, quick, etc.). I think the theory of evolution by natural selection has been described by excellent writers such as Dawkins, Dennett, Ridley and Zimmer (not to mention Darwin himself, even though his theory of inheritence was flawed), so I will not dwell on it here.Now to Pinkers main thesis: to understand our mind, we have to reverse-engineer our mental organs. In other words: for every psychological trait or phenomenon we have to ask the question 'what was its adaptive function in our ancestors' environment?' It is precisely this question that cuts deep through the delusional paradigms of modern day academicians and intellectuals. The mantra is ""culture determines who we are"". In other words: men rape because they are raised in a culture that's hostile to women. Instead of letting ideology guide science, Pinker approaches the problem from a scientific viewpoint: first describing the facts, then using the simplest theory as possible to explain the data and after this making moral statements. Some examples:In the chapter on Family Values, Pinker tackles the conflicts of interests between parents and offspring, husbands and wives, men and women in general and siblings. He explains these conflicts in terms of different evolutionary strategies between men and women. It pays for men to seek out sex as much as possible; it pays for women to be very selective who to mate with. This is a biological truth that even feminists and neo-marxists/blank slaters can't deny. This fundamental difference leads to competition between men for sexual access to women and to the pursuit of looking young and fertile (i.e. beautiful) between women. One of the most overlooked facts that Pinker mentions in this chapter is that a lot of the incentives for war, rape and murder are sexual motives. Maybe the men joining the army are not so crazy after all: throughout history, one of the most important rewards of victorious armies has been the genocide of men and kids and the mass rape of women. Pinkers paradigm offers new insights into our urge for agression.But this is not all, Pinkers paradigm also offers new insights into our urge to have friends and seek out honest reputations. Evolutionary speaking, it paid to cooperate. The only problem is that this presupposes cheater-detection mechanisms, which are prone to be exploited. One of the most important parts of our social life is the earning of an honest reputation; this shows others that you are a reliable cooperator. A third interesting aspect was the chapter on vision. Pinker analyzes the geometry of paintings and other visual art forms. One of the common threads is the presence of open landscapes with a broad horizon and some places of shelter. This was the environment our ancestors evolved in, it explains our like for these sorts of paintings and surroundings and our dislike for thick forests and deserts. A fourth insight is the way how our ideas are formed. We come equipped with mental software to perceive the world - including the other minds in this world - and to make decisions. These algorithms are heuristic in nature. In other words: they are based on assumptions that normally held in our ancestors' environment. Sometimes we encounter situations where these assumptions don't hold and we fall prey to cognitive illusions. For example, it is commonly known that the frame in which a logical problem is placed determines the effectivity of our judgments.A final important subject to note is the function of our emotions. Our emotions guide are actions, they are the incentives that lead us to chase pleasure and avoid pain. The objects of pleasure and pain are goals, set by evolution. We enjoy sex because organisms (i.e. our ancestors) that enjoyed sex had more sex and thereby had more offspring than organisms that didn't enjoy sex. We enjoy certain foods because our ancestors enjoyed those foods - and those that didn't had less offspring. In a sense, Hume was right when he wrote ""reason is the slave of our passions."" Our passions motive us to seek out the things we enjoy and avoid the things we hate. To summarize: Pinker tries to show that by looking at our psychology as mental organs, consisting of algorithms, that were sculpted by natural selection in the past eons, we have a new paradigm to understand our mind. A paradigm based on two of the most accepted theories in science and one that excludes ideology. Only a realistic understanding of our mental constitution can lead us to appreciate what is good and what should be changed for the better. An informed ethics presupposes evolutionary psychology. Even though I completely agree with Pinker's message and am interested in evolutionary psychology, I can't really recommend this book to laypeople. It would be better, before reading How the Mind Works, to school yourself in evolutionary biology and psychology, because Pinker's style of explaining is not for the faint hearted; he makes use of many terms that presuppose a lot of prior knowledge about the subjects involved. And a thing that annoyed me is the sheer mass of this book: 660 pages. Some chapters contained 90+ pages, which is way too long (in my opinion). But I should not end this review on a sour note, this was a pleasant read and value the various insights I gained from this.On a sidenote: Pinker's treatment of free will and consciousness is confusing. On the one hand, he makes valuable distinctions. So when he deals with consciousness, he makes a distinction between self knowledge, access to information and sentience and explains that the first to senses are in theory explainable by science. This is helpful. On the other hand, Pinker offers no route to answers himself and seems to retreat in a very un-academic mindset with regard to these topics. So in the example of consciousness, even though the first two aforementioned senses are explainable in scientific terms, sentience is not. Even stronger: our mind has been shaped by natural selection to deal with everyday problems and situations, offering the solution to the riddle of sentience not being one of them. In other words: the problem of consciousness is unsolvable in principle and we should not waste any more intellectual effort on this futile search. A very un-scientific mindset. (In 1542 people thought the earth was the centre of the cosmos; in 1543 Copernicus showed the earth to be just another mass of iron orbiting the sun; in the 20th century we discovered that even our sun is not so special: we live in an increasingly expanding universe in which we are just a temporary spec of dust)."
295,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6149613-marcus,3,"As so often is the case with popular science books I’m picking up, I feel that any attempt to review this volume must be done from two different perspectives – literary and in terms of content.If we start with the literary experience, I’ll put it plainly – it was far more difficult read than it had to be and the blame for it rests squarely on the shoulders of the author and the editor. When a book is titled ‘How the mind works’, it shouldn’t come as a big surprise that the reader expects some sort of introduction to the topic defined on the cover. Professor Pinker decided however that the best way to start his book was by launching a vigorous defense of his position on the topic, without really stating what that position is. Next, just to make things even more confusing, he continues with another defense speech, this time around regarding validity of Darwin’s theory of evolution. This ‘introduction’ to the topic at hand takes up about one fifth of the book. I have to admit that while struggling through it I mostly wondered when, if ever, we’re going to get to the actual ‘human mind’ part.Well, we did get there… eventually. The ‘good stuff’ starts off with a discussion about brain and how it (possibly) works on most basic neural level. Next the discussion moves on to sight and its absolutely central role in functionality of human brain and therefore also human mind. And then the course of discussion makes a rapid final change of course and we embark on a guided trip through different aspects of human mind, or in my opinion at least, human behavior. This final part of the book does indeed feel more like a guided tour than deep and meaningful discussion and to be perfectly honest, most of the time left me quite unsatisfied.Content-wise, I suspect that whether or not this book will be to a reader’s liking will depend on one single thing – degree of acceptance of the claim that computational theory of mind is the correct one. The author is one of main advocates of this theory and this volume, once all the unnecessary tangents are peeled of, is nothing more than presentation of its fundamental concepts.Personally I found this book to be a bag of mixed blessings. Perhaps half of it was simply fascinating – I don't necessarily agree with all of the ideas presented by the author, but as long as he stuck to the actual 'explanation', I found it both informative and thought provoking. I was far less impressed by his tangential rants, which in my opinion fail to serve any purpose in a popular science book intended for general public."
296,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64785453-andrei-khrapavitski,4,"Twenty years have passed since this book was originally published in 1997. And this is still a worthy read for anyone interested in human psychology. Steven Pinker, IMHO, is one of the best science authors of the past decades. His book ""The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined"" is one of my all-time favorites. ""The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature"" is also a brilliant book I often recommend. ""How the Mind Works"" would rank lower on the list of my recommendations simply because the pace of neuroscientific discoveries has accelerated in the last 20 years, and this book, given its magisterial title, lacks discussion of what we have learnt in recent years, for instance, through functional magnetic resonance imaging, etc. For that, please, refer to a truly profound ""Behave"" by Robert Sapolsky, published in 2017. ""How the Mind Works"" focuses quite a lot on human behavior, but Pinker develops this topic in his following books in a much greater detail. Still Pinker packs a lot in this volume. And this will surely be of interest to a lot of people eager for his brilliant style of writing and wit. Read this book if you want to learn about a computational theory of mind, which is still a solid view, not without criticism, on how our brain functions, positing that it is an information processing system, and thinking can be compared to computing. Pinker covers a few other alternative theories, too. I found really fascinating this book's insights on why we like certain art, music, entertainment, colors and music. It is much more rudimentary than most people imagine and is connected quite a lot to whether our vision or hearing processing can cling to some straightforward geometry or sounds. When it was published, it was met with both praise and criticism. Pinker has responded to some of it in ""the Blank Slate,"" which is a great follow-up and, as I mentioned, a perfect read by its own merit. However, if you have time for just one Pinker's book, ""Better Angels"" is his masterpiece. Really looking forward to his next book ""Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress"" due out on February 27, 2018."
297,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68837787-mart,5,"If you are looking for a neurobiology book which would explain how electric impulses and neurotransmitters become thoughts, this is not what you are after. Pinker presents a comprehensive and well documented series of theories, studies, experiments, reasonings and proposals and uses them to build a fully evolutionary view on the psychology of our species. His explanations are grounded on scientific and neurobiological information, in the sense that he takes them into account and doesn’t contradict them, but they work on the psychological level. As a matter of fact, he states that this book is purported to explain how the mind works and not how the brain works. I wouldn’t say though that this is a book recommended for people who are not familiar with the theory of evolution and its contemporary understanding. The book refers to other findings and scientists and employs concepts which in lack of some deeper background in the subject may sound loose or needing specific proof. The style may seem vague or giving things for granted for people who are not familiar with the field and its regular set of internally undisputed facts. All things said, Pinker provides a comprehensive list of notes where all his statements and experiment summaries are linked to a reference or more detailed explanation. This makes the style easier to follow, as he is discussing complex issues which need a lot of focus. The book does take a lot of time to rebuke very common misconceptions about the theory of evolution which would undermine a proper comprehension of its content. This could be seen as useful or as useless, depending on whether the reader needs ir or not. I believe the biggest advantage of this book is that it presents a totally coherent, well researched and thoroughly documented explanation of what we do scientifically know about our minds. If this is what you are looking for and you already know a little bit of evolution, ethology and psychology, you will find it here. Everything that is just a proposal is presented as such, and what is unknown is claimed to be so as well, so you won’t be lured into believing every speculation. "
298,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1038815-jc,3,"I don't think this is Pinker's best work, even if it was a best seller and a Pulitzer Prize finalist (so whad-do I know??). My complaints are, I admit, picky. A major work on a complex and broad topic like this needs a a couple of things: a meaningful introduction or opening chapter (his short preface does not suffice) laying out the book's goals and major themes; on the other end, some sort of afterword bringing together the themes into a coherent thesis. Getting to the meat of the book, I did not feel that most of the first chapter was necessary. Chap. 1 kind of wandered, in parts bordered on incoherent, and sometimes seemed to be part of a different work altogether. Again, maybe a serious introduction, final tie-it-all-together chapter, or an afterword may have explained how Chap. 1 fit in. This is significant as the opening chapter (mostly dealing with A.I.) takes up more than 10% of the book. I actually felt that in the opening chapter he strongly contradicted some of his major themes in the rest of the book. However, once I finished schlogging through that, I found most of the rest of the book fascinating (if still in need of some minor editing). The only theme that carried through from chap. 1 to the end was ""reverse engineering,"" and I found both his definition and use of the phrase to be weak. I have heard Pinker lecture more than once, and like much of his other writing (and look forward to his next work, ""Enlightenment Now,"" due out in Feb. 2018), so I don't mean this as a knock on Pinker, his views, or his public output. However, I think here he was trying to do a bit too much in one volume, and kind of stumbled over himself a bit. [it WAS good enough that I did read it all, but I think he has presented the science, and his interpretations of that science, better elsewhere]"
299,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70100482-zo,4,"I probably would give this 5-stars if I hadn’t encountered many of the ideas it discusses already, but there still was a lot I had not considered or new ways of presenting things that made them worthwhile. I found the section on vision/perception fairly boring, but other than that Pinker consistently found interesting ways to discuss the mechanisms of human behavior. It’s one of those books that covers so much that I don’t have any specific strong takeaways, but I am most interested in the idea that some of these explanations which seemed so solid at the time have since been revised by new discoveries (though I’m having trouble remembering what theory comes before what / what is “actually” right on some Q’s). Particularly as I’m almost done with Henrich’s book right now I am very interested in the way he revises many of Pinker’s claims, and how definitive/testable Henrich’s revisions are (for some of them I’m also not sure how much he actually differs). I think generally Pinker’s explanation of feelings and social behavior are most accurate, but his explanation of “higher” human callings, while certainly providing part of the answers, still seems lacking (or maybe that’s just wishful thinking). Also interested in reading how Miller’s book revises some of the survival-based explanations Pinker offers. Curiously, I did find myself at times descending into nihilism about what to do with the knowledge Pinker offers, and the semi-determinist conclusions they provide about human behavior. I’m not sure if that is a product of current mental states, simply having read too much of this stuff recently, or something about the way Pinker presents it, but it at least got me thinking productively about how to integrate these explanations into moral philosophy debates. Look forward to more Pinker in the future."

This was due in part to this one book having more width and depth than all the psychology courses I took at university put together. I almost wish that I had skipped Uni and read this instead, but then again I doubt I would have understood this book without the basic grounding their courses kindly provided.A rare mixture of luminous thinking and clear writing is how I would summarise this book.I'm not really feeling in a mood to be verbose about psychology and philosophy today so you're going to have to be content with this.If you want more then scan through my 'reading progress' notes - they give more detail."

Even if you don't believe in evolution (which I'm still not sure I do) this book gives AMAZING insights into everything we do as humans, from emotions to relationships to our appreciation for art and humor... and explains how the process of evolution shaped it all. A hard read (read it with a pen and make notes in the margins), but absolutely mind-blowing.I especially love how he illustrates heavy academic material with easily accessible examples from pop culture. While you DO need to have a, you know, 'mind that really works' to read this book, you do NOT need any kind of previous scientific training or understanding to grasp the concepts."

Today I decided to abandon it, even though I was already at the last chapter.Very interesting topic, but the book gets really obsessively detailed and repetitive at times. While Pinker have a way of explaining things, I am just frustrated that none of the things he explains have actual hard evidence backing it. It is fine to be able to come up with a seemingly logical explanation for certain human behaviour, but the lack of real evidence just don't cut it for me."
303,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826775-a-reader,3,"I liked the book, i think it is an intellectually stimulating piece of work. My main objection is Pinker's notion that behaviour is adapted to a Stone Age way of life and cannot cope wery well with the modernity of Space Age world.'Our brains', he writes, 'are not wired to cope with anonymous crowds, schooling, written language, governments, police, courts, armies, modern medicine, formal social institutions, high technology, and other newcomers to the human experience.'

When I pick up a science book, I expect a clear statement of the main argument and a straightforward, organized presentation of evidence. I would think that to be a good scientist one would need clear thinking skills and a good grasp of logic, and an ability to express that clarity in writing. Just a few pages into this book I knew I would not be disappointed. I suspected that by the end I would know very little about Steven Pinker and a lot about the mind. Reading this before reading Tooby and Cosmides is probably like reading Dawkins before Darwin. But that worked for me, because the later writer interpreted the former so well that it increased my understanding of the underlying principles. I have bookmarked evolutionary psychology material by Tooby and Cosmides to read later.Though this book is written for the non-scientist, nothing here is condescending or glib. When he uses a term, he states which definition he is using. I really appreciate these efforts. This book is filled with the most complex and esoteric ideas, yet it was a pleasure and a joy to read.""The idea that parents shape their children is so ingrained that most people don't even realize it is a testable hypothesis and not a self-evident truth."" What I found truly striking is that many common beliefs about social science are just plain wrong. We base public policy on them, but the evidence doesn't bear them out. One is that parents have a lot of influence on their children's personalities. Evolutionary biology predicts they have very little influence, and studies confirm it. But it's not a popular idea in our society. We want to think we have influence over our children. We also want someone to blame when children go bad. So the myth persists.""It's not that the claim that there is an interaction between innate structure and learning (or between heredity and environment, nature and nurture, biology and culture) is literally wrong. Rather, it falls into the category of ideas that are so bad they are not even wrong."" ""Evolution and learning can also go on simultaneously, with innate structure evolving in an animal that also learns.""I just finished the first chapter. Wow. He begins with the robot challenge, demonstrating just how difficult it is to mechanically replicate even the simplest things people do. He describes the problem of understanding human vision as the difference between what information our eyes gather as contrasted with what our brains interpret. (I ""see"" things differently after reading this part.) He shows how what we consider ""common sense"" is far beyond the ability of any robot we've constructed so far. There are revolutionary arguments here, and some inflammatory statements. No wonder he's controversial. He discredits a lot of popular concepts in psychiatry and psychology. He talks about ""modules,"" but not in the simplistic structure/function way you might expect. He says our minds are produced by natural selection, but that doesn't mean we are limited to our biological drives. We have ""a complex mind that is designed to mesh with what is in nature.""He argues against the popular notions of biology or culture being causes of our behavior, saying, first, that the biology/culture dichotomy is a false one, and second, that it is used as an argument to abdicate personal responsibility. (He can't help it: he was born that way, or he ate too many Twinkies, or it was the system, or he was abused, etc.) Personal responsibility, however, would seem to require free will, whatever that is. Whether our decisions are based on random causes, intentional causes, or uncaused causes, free will remains a mystery.Most importantly, he portrays the brain as an information processor, saying information theory has revolutionized the study of neuroscience. Even with all the analogies, I'm having trouble grasping idea of the computational theory of mind. What I can comprehend is that it's central to understanding consciousness and intelligence without resorting to a magical explanation. Using Dennett's analogy, the brain as a machine can be explained by breaking down complex processes into ever smaller tasks until even the most stupid homunculus, or demon, can do each of them. Then, put millions of these tiny steps together, and speed up the process, and intelligence results. (I think.) On the other hand, apparently sentience is simply is a construct of our consciousness and doesn't bear scientific examination. It's another mystery.He argues, quite effectively I think, against popular theories of mind such as associationism and connectionism, saying they are not alternatives of, but adjuncts to the computational theory of mind.The next argument is for the theory of natural selection, as if it needs defending. It turns out it does, and not just against creationists. He picks apart opposing arguments, such as macromutation and random drift. After carefully showing how the human brain could be the result of natural selection, and that humans, rather than being its pinnacle or ""goal"" (because it has no goals) are just another, different product, he goes into how and why humans differ from the other animals.Again he examines the complex ways we think and plan and he mentions the ""cognitive niche"" proposed by Toobey. He writes about the tracking ability of the modern hunter gatherers (!Kung) showing they use abstract thinking. It made me think about the claim by James Gleick in The Information that cognitive thought as we understand it could not exist prior to written language (a claim that one reviewer of that book said has been largely discredited). Pinker may have been one of those who discredited it, perhaps in The Language Instinct. However, I may be confusing ""abstract thought"" and ""cognitive thought."" I had this aha moment when I thought abstract thought is what people do without language, but cognitive thought is what happens when people put those thoughts into symbols (words) that can be expressed or communicated. Basically, I think cognitive thought is ""thinking about thinking."" I imagine this isn't an original idea. I probably just figured out for myself what cognitive science has known for decades.After some stuff about our understanding (or rather lack of it) regarding math and physics beyond that needed for survival, and some treatment of the language instinct, we arrive at what is a more interesting topic for me: emotions. The claims are that the triune brain theory (reptilian brain) is wrong and that emotions were essential to our survival and are not nonadaptive baggage. He says, ""intelligence is the pursuit of goals in the face of obstacles"" and ""emotions are mechanisms that set the brain's highest level goals.""While reading the section of chapter 6 on food taboos, I kept seeing parallels with religion. Disgust at certain foods is grounded in avoidance of poisons, yet it differs between cultures and is mostly irrational. Children up to two years old will put almost anything in their mouths. They learn from their parents what is disgusting and they pass that knowledge on to their children. Many food taboos are religious, and the principle can easily be expanded to other religious beliefs and practices.One thing I take issue with is that he keeps using wording that hints at teleology. He says, ""'selfish' means 'acting in ways that make one's own replication more likely.'"" I would word this more passively, something like, ""'selfish' means being able to live long enough to replicate, having inherited the characteristics that allowed one's parents to survive long enough to replicate.""The section headed ""The Doomsday Machine"" is particularly interesting. It's about emotions, especially those of honor and vengeance, and the advertising of them by facial expressions. It's about the genuineness of those expressions, which Pinker says is evidenced by the fact that they are handcuffed to our involuntarily physical processes (and therefore maybe the triune brain theory does have validity). There is much speculation here, but it's food for thought.And here's a thought: that grief is a useless emotion unexplainable except as a doomsday machine (to ensure people have an interest in protecting people they love).Cheesecake, pornography, and the arts.I found the honesty of the last chapter refreshing. Pinker says it like it is -- that the arts are not biologically adaptive; that they are shortcuts we created to excite the pleasure circuits of the brain that ordinarily would be stimulated by activities that increase fitness. That view is unpopular today. People don't want to admit that art, like fashion, is a matter of status. People who have the wealth and leisure time to spend lots of resources on the arts want to justify their obsession. They're influential people, which might explain why popular culture (and some science writers) indulge that wish. The book I mentioned at the outset of this review is one such treatment. The author, who is admittedly obsessed with music, argues that music is not just ""auditory cheesecake""; that it is biologically adaptive. Now I know why I felt it was such a waste of time. When my book group discussed it, a member told us that he has taught himself to appreciate Schönberg by repeatedly listening to recordings of his work, to his wife's annoyance. (I heard a Schönberg piece at a symphony performance, and once was enough for a lifetime.) I don't feel any need to pretend to like something to impress anyone. I can't think of any other reason one would do it, especially now that I've read Pinker. Humans do other biologically functionless activities. The intellect itself may be nonadaptive. Religion and philosophy. Psychology. I'm sure the irony is not lost on Pinker that his own education and profession fall under this umbrella. He doesn't denigrate these activities; he just says evolutionary biology doesn't explain them."
321,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8173124-george-marshall,4,"I very much enjoyed the book. The topic is more ""Why The Mind Works"", and with that being the author's actual stated aim, the book seems misnamed. The author is making a case for seeing the mind as an evolved consortium of mental modules. Much of the thought in the book is not necessarily his own - the book is abounding with quotations, some in defense, some to rail against. The quotes, frankly, are frequently more interesting than the surrounding detail. He even points out early on that he is not adding new information, but seeking to bring it together in a readable form. Despite, he balances things fairly well and brings a coherent whole out of it.Pinker is a little full of himself. He can be dismissive. He will mine the sources for whatever can be used in support of his point, even if the authors themselves disagree with him, sometimes pointedly. One example of his unique way of handling other viewpoints stuck out to me:""When I mentioned the theory of parent-offspring conflict to console a colleague whose two-year-old son had become a pest after the birth of a younger brother he snapped. ""All you're saying is that people are selfish!"" Sleepless for weeks, he could be forgiven for missing the point. Clearly, parents aren't selfish; parents are the least selfish entities in the known universe. But they aren't infinitely selfless either..."" (p.442)To which one can only remark that while studying psychology and the mind, Pinker had forgotten or ignored the example of Job and his rather unhelpful set of friends. He had been a terrible friend and/or colleague, offering up his ""wisdom"" in place of the sympathy requested. I chuckle, though I am probably as bad at times, but he seems unaware of how pompous this recounting makes him appear. ""He could be forgiven..."" The temerity! Ah, well.But back to the point, he is usually successful in making his point. He presents a pretty compelling case for how many of the modules we see at work in the mind could have been ""designed"" through adaptive means. But in a number of instances he ends by simply spitting out a multitude of possibilities to answer the open question. This he does while maintaining the certitude that adaptive means can account for all we could want to know about the inner workings of the mind.Until it isn't. With music, specifically, he seems to get into weeds, giving all manner of technical details of harmonics and such, as if, lacking a good argument for how we adapted a sense for the pleasures of music, he might bore the reader into acceptance through fine print. In the end, music in his opinion is non-adaptive, ""cheesecake"" in his words - a pleasureful cocktail that plays off of the other modules, but was not itself selected for. At least he admits the picture he paints of our musical inclinations is ""speculative"".Of course a book that tries to treat the whole of the human mind and its development will have to address the subject of religion and our propensity towards it. Pinker comes off derisively, from the introduction to the bitter end, but most of the time it did not distract from the meat of what was being said. While arrogant, he is as dismissive of religious practitioners as he is of feminists unable to square their moral convictions with the reality of the evolved nature of our minds (for good or bad!). Though, he does apologize - backhandedly - to the feminists:""I wish I could have discussed the evolutionary psychology of sexuality without the asides about feminist theory, but in today's intellectual climate that is impossible...These kinds of arguments combine bad biology (nature is nice), bad psychology (the mind is created by society), and bad ethics (what people like is good). Feminism would lose nothing by giving them up."" (pp.492-3)The book naturally flows from the fundamental modules until it reaches the point where one is not sure what is adaptation and what is the working of culture with the framework it has been given. In turn he discusses vision, body adaptation, language, logic (of a sort), probability (especially in the sense of cheat sensing), mating and reproduction, friendship, and onto arts and literature.Getting to the big question of sentience, he spends very little time in throwing out a ""we can't know"", as if that is somehow better than the answers he dismisses so quickly and easily. An unsatisfying ending. But this does not overcome the mountain of enjoyed reading that makes up the book."
322,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57079482-chuck-kollars,3,"This book is quite long, and glancingly touches on a very wide variety of topics. Even such an abstruse question as why the art of painting might have more appeal to social elites is discussed a little. This variety shouldn't though obscure the fact that some very basic views about human thinking provide the main focus of the book and tie it all together. The author clearly made a mighty attempt to organize the mass of ideas and evidence in a sensible way; nevertheless the end result feels a bit scattered, probably mostly because the topics covered range so widely. It seemed to me (a more careful reader might produce a more accurate summary) the book's central ideas were:1. The human brain is a melange of fairly separate parts.2. Many of the parts are quite sophisticated. For example interpreting the visual data of 3D objects under variable illumination is nearly impossible, yet the brain manages to do it with ease. 3. The procedure by which the human brain decides which course of action to take when different parts of the brain come to different conclusions is simple, straightforward, and effective. 4. Almost all the operation of the human brain is ""automatic"" in the sense that it's not available to reflection/consciousness at all no matter what. 5. The operation and sophistication of each subsystem of the brain can be directly explained by evolution, typically with reference to the way humans lived in hunter-gatherer groups five thousand years ago. (Here I have a quibble, as the book just _assumes_ without evidence that human biological evolution has pretty much stopped.)6. Ideas that fit well into any one of these subsystems tend to take over, resulting in what we call ""cultural evolution"". (Or to put it in cruder words, there's something to the ""cultural meme"" hypothesis)7. Many of our most cherished things (for example ""cheesecake"") are in fact hacks that exploit some sort of quirk in each of several different brain parts. 8. Our taste for aesthetic/artistic things does _not_ indicate some sort of higher level of consciousness, _nor_ is it the ""purpose"" of life. Rather, it arises simply as an unintended side effect of the way the human brain is organized. (It may also arise from the evolutionary results of pressure to reproduce.)(Interestingly, the idea that -compared to ""reasoned"" responses- ""emotional"" responses that come out of a human brain are ""heuristic shortcuts"" that are much much faster and right often enough to be useful, is most definitely _not_ among those used by the book. The book doesn't ""disgree"" with this idea; a better description is the book simply ""ignores"" it, presenting its case without recourse one way or the other to this idea.)A fair amount of evidence from the results of experiments is presented to support these ideas. At the same time, an implicit case is made that these ideas make sense when taken _all_together_, that they support each other ...a lot. Much of the research stems from a rather small group of investigators. The _possibility_ that putting these ideas together is in fact revolutionary and is not yet generally accepted even by many academics is not discussed at all. The book provides a good overview of an entire subject area at a level deeper than a journalistic article but not nearly as deep as the original scientific papers; a little deeper even than Scientific American (and much longer:-), but not so arcane it feels like reading a graduate level textbook."
323,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419307-rachel,4,"Whew! This has been on my to-read list for years, and I've been trying to read it for months, but people keep recalling it from the library. At nearly 600 pithy pages, this book is more than worthwhile despite its age -- now 20 years old! My primary takeaway from reading this was learning how to frame each of our human traits in the context of evolution (natural selection). The ""computational theory of mind"" fits neatly with the pressures of natural selection, evolving us as beings highly adapted to solving problems of survival as foraging peoples. It is fascinating to look at traits not obviously related to survival problems (love, religion, music), although you have to wait until the very end for these juicy tidbits. I do have some criticisms of the book. One is that you really have to slog through some theory before getting to the meat of the book, and I could see a lot of people abandoning the book in the first 100 pages due to this unnecessarily detailed discussion. Another is that Pinker gives outsize focus to the subjects he is seemingly most expert in, like vision, but cultural aspects like music get tacked on at the end in a very superficial way. Also, leaving out the language component simply because he already wrote about it in another book is a pretty big flaw in this one.As a musician, I found the section on music to be woefully lacking, with many of the statements highly objectionable. For example: ""Many movies and television shows literally orchestrate the viewer's emotions from beginning to end with quasi-musical arrangements. They have no real rhythm, melody, or grouping."" Grouping? Does he mean form? Any undergraduate music student could tell you that movie scores consist not only of rhythm and melody, but of form on multiple levels. Pinker goes on to refer to the ""Jaws"" and ""Mission Impossible"" scores as ""pseudo-music."" If the Mission Impossible theme isn't music, I don't know what is! Also, although I enjoyed the discussion of the overtone series, he accepts Schenker as an inherent fact of music rather than a Western construct. He uses the word ""perhaps"" about twice per paragraph in this section, a clear indication that he's going out on a limb when trying to write on this subject. It made me question what specialists in the other fields think about the sections on visual arts, emotion, etc.Finally, I have to take issue with the statements about women and the treatment of gender roles in this book. No matter how many times or how elegantly Pinker qualified his statements as not being what is ""good,"" simply what natural selection has evolved, I could have used a much more nuanced discussion about this in a contemporary context rather than defaulting to referring to the mother as the one responsible for raising the young. Also, where is the discussion of homosexuality and nontraditional family structures? I get that this is probably outside of the scope of this book, but the way these subjects were treated sometimes felt so backwards that it was hard to swallow.But still, read it."
324,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,3,"In this book, Steven Pinker describes our mind - more precisely: our mental faculties - as a complex set of algorithms, sculpted by natural selection. Pinker uses two theories - the computational theory of mind and the theory of evolution by natural selection - to accomplish this amazing feat.According to the computational theory of mind, our mental organs are composed of algorithms, built up out of simpler subroutines which are in turn built up out of subsubroutines. This goes all the way down to the most basic, simplest algorithms that are digital: yes/no, on/off, etc. What it means, in essence, is that we come equipped with pre-programmed mental software with which we perceive the world. This software works is based on certain assumptions - based on the stability and the continuity of physical laws - and it's in the moments that the assumptions don't hold that we are tricked or fooled by our own mind (i.e. cognitive illusions).The other building block of Pinkers story is evolution by natural selection. Evolution shaped all the organisms on this planet, including us. Homo sapiens is unique in its mental capabilities, even though our mind is just one way to solve the natural problems (some others being strong, quick, etc.). I think the theory of evolution by natural selection has been described by excellent writers such as Dawkins, Dennett, Ridley and Zimmer (not to mention Darwin himself, even though his theory of inheritence was flawed), so I will not dwell on it here.Now to Pinkers main thesis: to understand our mind, we have to reverse-engineer our mental organs. In other words: for every psychological trait or phenomenon we have to ask the question 'what was its adaptive function in our ancestors' environment?' It is precisely this question that cuts deep through the delusional paradigms of modern day academicians and intellectuals. The mantra is ""culture determines who we are"". In other words: men rape because they are raised in a culture that's hostile to women. Instead of letting ideology guide science, Pinker approaches the problem from a scientific viewpoint: first describing the facts, then using the simplest theory as possible to explain the data and after this making moral statements. Some examples:In the chapter on Family Values, Pinker tackles the conflicts of interests between parents and offspring, husbands and wives, men and women in general and siblings. He explains these conflicts in terms of different evolutionary strategies between men and women. It pays for men to seek out sex as much as possible; it pays for women to be very selective who to mate with. This is a biological truth that even feminists and neo-marxists/blank slaters can't deny. This fundamental difference leads to competition between men for sexual access to women and to the pursuit of looking young and fertile (i.e. beautiful) between women. One of the most overlooked facts that Pinker mentions in this chapter is that a lot of the incentives for war, rape and murder are sexual motives. Maybe the men joining the army are not so crazy after all: throughout history, one of the most important rewards of victorious armies has been the genocide of men and kids and the mass rape of women. Pinkers paradigm offers new insights into our urge for agression.But this is not all, Pinkers paradigm also offers new insights into our urge to have friends and seek out honest reputations. Evolutionary speaking, it paid to cooperate. The only problem is that this presupposes cheater-detection mechanisms, which are prone to be exploited. One of the most important parts of our social life is the earning of an honest reputation; this shows others that you are a reliable cooperator. A third interesting aspect was the chapter on vision. Pinker analyzes the geometry of paintings and other visual art forms. One of the common threads is the presence of open landscapes with a broad horizon and some places of shelter. This was the environment our ancestors evolved in, it explains our like for these sorts of paintings and surroundings and our dislike for thick forests and deserts. A fourth insight is the way how our ideas are formed. We come equipped with mental software to perceive the world - including the other minds in this world - and to make decisions. These algorithms are heuristic in nature. In other words: they are based on assumptions that normally held in our ancestors' environment. Sometimes we encounter situations where these assumptions don't hold and we fall prey to cognitive illusions. For example, it is commonly known that the frame in which a logical problem is placed determines the effectivity of our judgments.A final important subject to note is the function of our emotions. Our emotions guide are actions, they are the incentives that lead us to chase pleasure and avoid pain. The objects of pleasure and pain are goals, set by evolution. We enjoy sex because organisms (i.e. our ancestors) that enjoyed sex had more sex and thereby had more offspring than organisms that didn't enjoy sex. We enjoy certain foods because our ancestors enjoyed those foods - and those that didn't had less offspring. In a sense, Hume was right when he wrote ""reason is the slave of our passions."" Our passions motive us to seek out the things we enjoy and avoid the things we hate. To summarize: Pinker tries to show that by looking at our psychology as mental organs, consisting of algorithms, that were sculpted by natural selection in the past eons, we have a new paradigm to understand our mind. A paradigm based on two of the most accepted theories in science and one that excludes ideology. Only a realistic understanding of our mental constitution can lead us to appreciate what is good and what should be changed for the better. An informed ethics presupposes evolutionary psychology. Even though I completely agree with Pinker's message and am interested in evolutionary psychology, I can't really recommend this book to laypeople. It would be better, before reading How the Mind Works, to school yourself in evolutionary biology and psychology, because Pinker's style of explaining is not for the faint hearted; he makes use of many terms that presuppose a lot of prior knowledge about the subjects involved. And a thing that annoyed me is the sheer mass of this book: 660 pages. Some chapters contained 90+ pages, which is way too long (in my opinion). But I should not end this review on a sour note, this was a pleasant read and value the various insights I gained from this.On a sidenote: Pinker's treatment of free will and consciousness is confusing. On the one hand, he makes valuable distinctions. So when he deals with consciousness, he makes a distinction between self knowledge, access to information and sentience and explains that the first to senses are in theory explainable by science. This is helpful. On the other hand, Pinker offers no route to answers himself and seems to retreat in a very un-academic mindset with regard to these topics. So in the example of consciousness, even though the first two aforementioned senses are explainable in scientific terms, sentience is not. Even stronger: our mind has been shaped by natural selection to deal with everyday problems and situations, offering the solution to the riddle of sentience not being one of them. In other words: the problem of consciousness is unsolvable in principle and we should not waste any more intellectual effort on this futile search. A very un-scientific mindset. (In 1542 people thought the earth was the centre of the cosmos; in 1543 Copernicus showed the earth to be just another mass of iron orbiting the sun; in the 20th century we discovered that even our sun is not so special: we live in an increasingly expanding universe in which we are just a temporary spec of dust)."
325,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6149613-marcus,3,"As so often is the case with popular science books I’m picking up, I feel that any attempt to review this volume must be done from two different perspectives – literary and in terms of content.If we start with the literary experience, I’ll put it plainly – it was far more difficult read than it had to be and the blame for it rests squarely on the shoulders of the author and the editor. When a book is titled ‘How the mind works’, it shouldn’t come as a big surprise that the reader expects some sort of introduction to the topic defined on the cover. Professor Pinker decided however that the best way to start his book was by launching a vigorous defense of his position on the topic, without really stating what that position is. Next, just to make things even more confusing, he continues with another defense speech, this time around regarding validity of Darwin’s theory of evolution. This ‘introduction’ to the topic at hand takes up about one fifth of the book. I have to admit that while struggling through it I mostly wondered when, if ever, we’re going to get to the actual ‘human mind’ part.Well, we did get there… eventually. The ‘good stuff’ starts off with a discussion about brain and how it (possibly) works on most basic neural level. Next the discussion moves on to sight and its absolutely central role in functionality of human brain and therefore also human mind. And then the course of discussion makes a rapid final change of course and we embark on a guided trip through different aspects of human mind, or in my opinion at least, human behavior. This final part of the book does indeed feel more like a guided tour than deep and meaningful discussion and to be perfectly honest, most of the time left me quite unsatisfied.Content-wise, I suspect that whether or not this book will be to a reader’s liking will depend on one single thing – degree of acceptance of the claim that computational theory of mind is the correct one. The author is one of main advocates of this theory and this volume, once all the unnecessary tangents are peeled of, is nothing more than presentation of its fundamental concepts.Personally I found this book to be a bag of mixed blessings. Perhaps half of it was simply fascinating – I don't necessarily agree with all of the ideas presented by the author, but as long as he stuck to the actual 'explanation', I found it both informative and thought provoking. I was far less impressed by his tangential rants, which in my opinion fail to serve any purpose in a popular science book intended for general public."
326,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64785453-andrei-khrapavitski,4,"Twenty years have passed since this book was originally published in 1997. And this is still a worthy read for anyone interested in human psychology. Steven Pinker, IMHO, is one of the best science authors of the past decades. His book ""The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined"" is one of my all-time favorites. ""The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature"" is also a brilliant book I often recommend. ""How the Mind Works"" would rank lower on the list of my recommendations simply because the pace of neuroscientific discoveries has accelerated in the last 20 years, and this book, given its magisterial title, lacks discussion of what we have learnt in recent years, for instance, through functional magnetic resonance imaging, etc. For that, please, refer to a truly profound ""Behave"" by Robert Sapolsky, published in 2017. ""How the Mind Works"" focuses quite a lot on human behavior, but Pinker develops this topic in his following books in a much greater detail. Still Pinker packs a lot in this volume. And this will surely be of interest to a lot of people eager for his brilliant style of writing and wit. Read this book if you want to learn about a computational theory of mind, which is still a solid view, not without criticism, on how our brain functions, positing that it is an information processing system, and thinking can be compared to computing. Pinker covers a few other alternative theories, too. I found really fascinating this book's insights on why we like certain art, music, entertainment, colors and music. It is much more rudimentary than most people imagine and is connected quite a lot to whether our vision or hearing processing can cling to some straightforward geometry or sounds. When it was published, it was met with both praise and criticism. Pinker has responded to some of it in ""the Blank Slate,"" which is a great follow-up and, as I mentioned, a perfect read by its own merit. However, if you have time for just one Pinker's book, ""Better Angels"" is his masterpiece. Really looking forward to his next book ""Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress"" due out on February 27, 2018."
327,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68837787-mart,5,"If you are looking for a neurobiology book which would explain how electric impulses and neurotransmitters become thoughts, this is not what you are after. Pinker presents a comprehensive and well documented series of theories, studies, experiments, reasonings and proposals and uses them to build a fully evolutionary view on the psychology of our species. His explanations are grounded on scientific and neurobiological information, in the sense that he takes them into account and doesn’t contradict them, but they work on the psychological level. As a matter of fact, he states that this book is purported to explain how the mind works and not how the brain works. I wouldn’t say though that this is a book recommended for people who are not familiar with the theory of evolution and its contemporary understanding. The book refers to other findings and scientists and employs concepts which in lack of some deeper background in the subject may sound loose or needing specific proof. The style may seem vague or giving things for granted for people who are not familiar with the field and its regular set of internally undisputed facts. All things said, Pinker provides a comprehensive list of notes where all his statements and experiment summaries are linked to a reference or more detailed explanation. This makes the style easier to follow, as he is discussing complex issues which need a lot of focus. The book does take a lot of time to rebuke very common misconceptions about the theory of evolution which would undermine a proper comprehension of its content. This could be seen as useful or as useless, depending on whether the reader needs ir or not. I believe the biggest advantage of this book is that it presents a totally coherent, well researched and thoroughly documented explanation of what we do scientifically know about our minds. If this is what you are looking for and you already know a little bit of evolution, ethology and psychology, you will find it here. Everything that is just a proposal is presented as such, and what is unknown is claimed to be so as well, so you won’t be lured into believing every speculation. "
328,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1038815-jc,3,"I don't think this is Pinker's best work, even if it was a best seller and a Pulitzer Prize finalist (so whad-do I know??). My complaints are, I admit, picky. A major work on a complex and broad topic like this needs a a couple of things: a meaningful introduction or opening chapter (his short preface does not suffice) laying out the book's goals and major themes; on the other end, some sort of afterword bringing together the themes into a coherent thesis. Getting to the meat of the book, I did not feel that most of the first chapter was necessary. Chap. 1 kind of wandered, in parts bordered on incoherent, and sometimes seemed to be part of a different work altogether. Again, maybe a serious introduction, final tie-it-all-together chapter, or an afterword may have explained how Chap. 1 fit in. This is significant as the opening chapter (mostly dealing with A.I.) takes up more than 10% of the book. I actually felt that in the opening chapter he strongly contradicted some of his major themes in the rest of the book. However, once I finished schlogging through that, I found most of the rest of the book fascinating (if still in need of some minor editing). The only theme that carried through from chap. 1 to the end was ""reverse engineering,"" and I found both his definition and use of the phrase to be weak. I have heard Pinker lecture more than once, and like much of his other writing (and look forward to his next work, ""Enlightenment Now,"" due out in Feb. 2018), so I don't mean this as a knock on Pinker, his views, or his public output. However, I think here he was trying to do a bit too much in one volume, and kind of stumbled over himself a bit. [it WAS good enough that I did read it all, but I think he has presented the science, and his interpretations of that science, better elsewhere]"
329,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70100482-zo,4,"I probably would give this 5-stars if I hadn’t encountered many of the ideas it discusses already, but there still was a lot I had not considered or new ways of presenting things that made them worthwhile. I found the section on vision/perception fairly boring, but other than that Pinker consistently found interesting ways to discuss the mechanisms of human behavior. It’s one of those books that covers so much that I don’t have any specific strong takeaways, but I am most interested in the idea that some of these explanations which seemed so solid at the time have since been revised by new discoveries (though I’m having trouble remembering what theory comes before what / what is “actually” right on some Q’s). Particularly as I’m almost done with Henrich’s book right now I am very interested in the way he revises many of Pinker’s claims, and how definitive/testable Henrich’s revisions are (for some of them I’m also not sure how much he actually differs). I think generally Pinker’s explanation of feelings and social behavior are most accurate, but his explanation of “higher” human callings, while certainly providing part of the answers, still seems lacking (or maybe that’s just wishful thinking). Also interested in reading how Miller’s book revises some of the survival-based explanations Pinker offers. Curiously, I did find myself at times descending into nihilism about what to do with the knowledge Pinker offers, and the semi-determinist conclusions they provide about human behavior. I’m not sure if that is a product of current mental states, simply having read too much of this stuff recently, or something about the way Pinker presents it, but it at least got me thinking productively about how to integrate these explanations into moral philosophy debates. Look forward to more Pinker in the future."

This was due in part to this one book having more width and depth than all the psychology courses I took at university put together. I almost wish that I had skipped Uni and read this instead, but then again I doubt I would have understood this book without the basic grounding their courses kindly provided.A rare mixture of luminous thinking and clear writing is how I would summarise this book.I'm not really feeling in a mood to be verbose about psychology and philosophy today so you're going to have to be content with this.If you want more then scan through my 'reading progress' notes - they give more detail."

Even if you don't believe in evolution (which I'm still not sure I do) this book gives AMAZING insights into everything we do as humans, from emotions to relationships to our appreciation for art and humor... and explains how the process of evolution shaped it all. A hard read (read it with a pen and make notes in the margins), but absolutely mind-blowing.I especially love how he illustrates heavy academic material with easily accessible examples from pop culture. While you DO need to have a, you know, 'mind that really works' to read this book, you do NOT need any kind of previous scientific training or understanding to grasp the concepts."

Today I decided to abandon it, even though I was already at the last chapter.Very interesting topic, but the book gets really obsessively detailed and repetitive at times. While Pinker have a way of explaining things, I am just frustrated that none of the things he explains have actual hard evidence backing it. It is fine to be able to come up with a seemingly logical explanation for certain human behaviour, but the lack of real evidence just don't cut it for me."

350,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/662191-noreen,5,"COMPUTATIONAL THEORY OF MINDJust before reading this, I read a rambling, anecdotal, autobiographical mess that purports to be a science book. When I pick up a science book, I expect a clear statement of the main argument and a straightforward, organized presentation of evidence. I would think that to be a good scientist one would need clear thinking skills and a good grasp of logic, and an ability to express that clarity in writing. Just a few pages into this book I knew I would not be disappointed. I suspected that by the end I would know very little about Steven Pinker and a lot about the mind. Reading this before reading Tooby and Cosmides is probably like reading Dawkins before Darwin. But that worked for me, because the later writer interpreted the former so well that it increased my understanding of the underlying principles. I have bookmarked evolutionary psychology material by Tooby and Cosmides to read later.Though this book is written for the non-scientist, nothing here is condescending or glib. When he uses a term, he states which definition he is using. I really appreciate these efforts. This book is filled with the most complex and esoteric ideas, yet it was a pleasure and a joy to read.""The idea that parents shape their children is so ingrained that most people don't even realize it is a testable hypothesis and not a self-evident truth."" What I found truly striking is that many common beliefs about social science are just plain wrong. We base public policy on them, but the evidence doesn't bear them out. One is that parents have a lot of influence on their children's personalities. Evolutionary biology predicts they have very little influence, and studies confirm it. But it's not a popular idea in our society. We want to think we have influence over our children. We also want someone to blame when children go bad. So the myth persists.""It's not that the claim that there is an interaction between innate structure and learning (or between heredity and environment, nature and nurture, biology and culture) is literally wrong. Rather, it falls into the category of ideas that are so bad they are not even wrong."" ""Evolution and learning can also go on simultaneously, with innate structure evolving in an animal that also learns.""I just finished the first chapter. Wow. He begins with the robot challenge, demonstrating just how difficult it is to mechanically replicate even the simplest things people do. He describes the problem of understanding human vision as the difference between what information our eyes gather as contrasted with what our brains interpret. (I ""see"" things differently after reading this part.) He shows how what we consider ""common sense"" is far beyond the ability of any robot we've constructed so far. There are revolutionary arguments here, and some inflammatory statements. No wonder he's controversial. He discredits a lot of popular concepts in psychiatry and psychology. He talks about ""modules,"" but not in the simplistic structure/function way you might expect. He says our minds are produced by natural selection, but that doesn't mean we are limited to our biological drives. We have ""a complex mind that is designed to mesh with what is in nature.""He argues against the popular notions of biology or culture being causes of our behavior, saying, first, that the biology/culture dichotomy is a false one, and second, that it is used as an argument to abdicate personal responsibility. (He can't help it: he was born that way, or he ate too many Twinkies, or it was the system, or he was abused, etc.) Personal responsibility, however, would seem to require free will, whatever that is. Whether our decisions are based on random causes, intentional causes, or uncaused causes, free will remains a mystery.Most importantly, he portrays the brain as an information processor, saying information theory has revolutionized the study of neuroscience. Even with all the analogies, I'm having trouble grasping idea of the computational theory of mind. What I can comprehend is that it's central to understanding consciousness and intelligence without resorting to a magical explanation. Using Dennett's analogy, the brain as a machine can be explained by breaking down complex processes into ever smaller tasks until even the most stupid homunculus, or demon, can do each of them. Then, put millions of these tiny steps together, and speed up the process, and intelligence results. (I think.) On the other hand, apparently sentience is simply is a construct of our consciousness and doesn't bear scientific examination. It's another mystery.He argues, quite effectively I think, against popular theories of mind such as associationism and connectionism, saying they are not alternatives of, but adjuncts to the computational theory of mind.The next argument is for the theory of natural selection, as if it needs defending. It turns out it does, and not just against creationists. He picks apart opposing arguments, such as macromutation and random drift. After carefully showing how the human brain could be the result of natural selection, and that humans, rather than being its pinnacle or ""goal"" (because it has no goals) are just another, different product, he goes into how and why humans differ from the other animals.Again he examines the complex ways we think and plan and he mentions the ""cognitive niche"" proposed by Toobey. He writes about the tracking ability of the modern hunter gatherers (!Kung) showing they use abstract thinking. It made me think about the claim by James Gleick in The Information that cognitive thought as we understand it could not exist prior to written language (a claim that one reviewer of that book said has been largely discredited). Pinker may have been one of those who discredited it, perhaps in The Language Instinct. However, I may be confusing ""abstract thought"" and ""cognitive thought."" I had this aha moment when I thought abstract thought is what people do without language, but cognitive thought is what happens when people put those thoughts into symbols (words) that can be expressed or communicated. Basically, I think cognitive thought is ""thinking about thinking."" I imagine this isn't an original idea. I probably just figured out for myself what cognitive science has known for decades.After some stuff about our understanding (or rather lack of it) regarding math and physics beyond that needed for survival, and some treatment of the language instinct, we arrive at what is a more interesting topic for me: emotions. The claims are that the triune brain theory (reptilian brain) is wrong and that emotions were essential to our survival and are not nonadaptive baggage. He says, ""intelligence is the pursuit of goals in the face of obstacles"" and ""emotions are mechanisms that set the brain's highest level goals.""While reading the section of chapter 6 on food taboos, I kept seeing parallels with religion. Disgust at certain foods is grounded in avoidance of poisons, yet it differs between cultures and is mostly irrational. Children up to two years old will put almost anything in their mouths. They learn from their parents what is disgusting and they pass that knowledge on to their children. Many food taboos are religious, and the principle can easily be expanded to other religious beliefs and practices.One thing I take issue with is that he keeps using wording that hints at teleology. He says, ""'selfish' means 'acting in ways that make one's own replication more likely.'"" I would word this more passively, something like, ""'selfish' means being able to live long enough to replicate, having inherited the characteristics that allowed one's parents to survive long enough to replicate.""The section headed ""The Doomsday Machine"" is particularly interesting. It's about emotions, especially those of honor and vengeance, and the advertising of them by facial expressions. It's about the genuineness of those expressions, which Pinker says is evidenced by the fact that they are handcuffed to our involuntarily physical processes (and therefore maybe the triune brain theory does have validity). There is much speculation here, but it's food for thought.And here's a thought: that grief is a useless emotion unexplainable except as a doomsday machine (to ensure people have an interest in protecting people they love).Cheesecake, pornography, and the arts.I found the honesty of the last chapter refreshing. Pinker says it like it is -- that the arts are not biologically adaptive; that they are shortcuts we created to excite the pleasure circuits of the brain that ordinarily would be stimulated by activities that increase fitness. That view is unpopular today. People don't want to admit that art, like fashion, is a matter of status. People who have the wealth and leisure time to spend lots of resources on the arts want to justify their obsession. They're influential people, which might explain why popular culture (and some science writers) indulge that wish. The book I mentioned at the outset of this review is one such treatment. The author, who is admittedly obsessed with music, argues that music is not just ""auditory cheesecake""; that it is biologically adaptive. Now I know why I felt it was such a waste of time. When my book group discussed it, a member told us that he has taught himself to appreciate Schönberg by repeatedly listening to recordings of his work, to his wife's annoyance. (I heard a Schönberg piece at a symphony performance, and once was enough for a lifetime.) I don't feel any need to pretend to like something to impress anyone. I can't think of any other reason one would do it, especially now that I've read Pinker. Humans do other biologically functionless activities. The intellect itself may be nonadaptive. Religion and philosophy. Psychology. I'm sure the irony is not lost on Pinker that his own education and profession fall under this umbrella. He doesn't denigrate these activities; he just says evolutionary biology doesn't explain them."
351,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8173124-george-marshall,4,"I very much enjoyed the book. The topic is more ""Why The Mind Works"", and with that being the author's actual stated aim, the book seems misnamed. The author is making a case for seeing the mind as an evolved consortium of mental modules. Much of the thought in the book is not necessarily his own - the book is abounding with quotations, some in defense, some to rail against. The quotes, frankly, are frequently more interesting than the surrounding detail. He even points out early on that he is not adding new information, but seeking to bring it together in a readable form. Despite, he balances things fairly well and brings a coherent whole out of it.Pinker is a little full of himself. He can be dismissive. He will mine the sources for whatever can be used in support of his point, even if the authors themselves disagree with him, sometimes pointedly. One example of his unique way of handling other viewpoints stuck out to me:""When I mentioned the theory of parent-offspring conflict to console a colleague whose two-year-old son had become a pest after the birth of a younger brother he snapped. ""All you're saying is that people are selfish!"" Sleepless for weeks, he could be forgiven for missing the point. Clearly, parents aren't selfish; parents are the least selfish entities in the known universe. But they aren't infinitely selfless either..."" (p.442)To which one can only remark that while studying psychology and the mind, Pinker had forgotten or ignored the example of Job and his rather unhelpful set of friends. He had been a terrible friend and/or colleague, offering up his ""wisdom"" in place of the sympathy requested. I chuckle, though I am probably as bad at times, but he seems unaware of how pompous this recounting makes him appear. ""He could be forgiven..."" The temerity! Ah, well.But back to the point, he is usually successful in making his point. He presents a pretty compelling case for how many of the modules we see at work in the mind could have been ""designed"" through adaptive means. But in a number of instances he ends by simply spitting out a multitude of possibilities to answer the open question. This he does while maintaining the certitude that adaptive means can account for all we could want to know about the inner workings of the mind.Until it isn't. With music, specifically, he seems to get into weeds, giving all manner of technical details of harmonics and such, as if, lacking a good argument for how we adapted a sense for the pleasures of music, he might bore the reader into acceptance through fine print. In the end, music in his opinion is non-adaptive, ""cheesecake"" in his words - a pleasureful cocktail that plays off of the other modules, but was not itself selected for. At least he admits the picture he paints of our musical inclinations is ""speculative"".Of course a book that tries to treat the whole of the human mind and its development will have to address the subject of religion and our propensity towards it. Pinker comes off derisively, from the introduction to the bitter end, but most of the time it did not distract from the meat of what was being said. While arrogant, he is as dismissive of religious practitioners as he is of feminists unable to square their moral convictions with the reality of the evolved nature of our minds (for good or bad!). Though, he does apologize - backhandedly - to the feminists:""I wish I could have discussed the evolutionary psychology of sexuality without the asides about feminist theory, but in today's intellectual climate that is impossible...These kinds of arguments combine bad biology (nature is nice), bad psychology (the mind is created by society), and bad ethics (what people like is good). Feminism would lose nothing by giving them up."" (pp.492-3)The book naturally flows from the fundamental modules until it reaches the point where one is not sure what is adaptation and what is the working of culture with the framework it has been given. In turn he discusses vision, body adaptation, language, logic (of a sort), probability (especially in the sense of cheat sensing), mating and reproduction, friendship, and onto arts and literature.Getting to the big question of sentience, he spends very little time in throwing out a ""we can't know"", as if that is somehow better than the answers he dismisses so quickly and easily. An unsatisfying ending. But this does not overcome the mountain of enjoyed reading that makes up the book."
352,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57079482-chuck-kollars,3,"This book is quite long, and glancingly touches on a very wide variety of topics. Even such an abstruse question as why the art of painting might have more appeal to social elites is discussed a little. This variety shouldn't though obscure the fact that some very basic views about human thinking provide the main focus of the book and tie it all together. The author clearly made a mighty attempt to organize the mass of ideas and evidence in a sensible way; nevertheless the end result feels a bit scattered, probably mostly because the topics covered range so widely. It seemed to me (a more careful reader might produce a more accurate summary) the book's central ideas were:1. The human brain is a melange of fairly separate parts.2. Many of the parts are quite sophisticated. For example interpreting the visual data of 3D objects under variable illumination is nearly impossible, yet the brain manages to do it with ease. 3. The procedure by which the human brain decides which course of action to take when different parts of the brain come to different conclusions is simple, straightforward, and effective. 4. Almost all the operation of the human brain is ""automatic"" in the sense that it's not available to reflection/consciousness at all no matter what. 5. The operation and sophistication of each subsystem of the brain can be directly explained by evolution, typically with reference to the way humans lived in hunter-gatherer groups five thousand years ago. (Here I have a quibble, as the book just _assumes_ without evidence that human biological evolution has pretty much stopped.)6. Ideas that fit well into any one of these subsystems tend to take over, resulting in what we call ""cultural evolution"". (Or to put it in cruder words, there's something to the ""cultural meme"" hypothesis)7. Many of our most cherished things (for example ""cheesecake"") are in fact hacks that exploit some sort of quirk in each of several different brain parts. 8. Our taste for aesthetic/artistic things does _not_ indicate some sort of higher level of consciousness, _nor_ is it the ""purpose"" of life. Rather, it arises simply as an unintended side effect of the way the human brain is organized. (It may also arise from the evolutionary results of pressure to reproduce.)(Interestingly, the idea that -compared to ""reasoned"" responses- ""emotional"" responses that come out of a human brain are ""heuristic shortcuts"" that are much much faster and right often enough to be useful, is most definitely _not_ among those used by the book. The book doesn't ""disgree"" with this idea; a better description is the book simply ""ignores"" it, presenting its case without recourse one way or the other to this idea.)A fair amount of evidence from the results of experiments is presented to support these ideas. At the same time, an implicit case is made that these ideas make sense when taken _all_together_, that they support each other ...a lot. Much of the research stems from a rather small group of investigators. The _possibility_ that putting these ideas together is in fact revolutionary and is not yet generally accepted even by many academics is not discussed at all. The book provides a good overview of an entire subject area at a level deeper than a journalistic article but not nearly as deep as the original scientific papers; a little deeper even than Scientific American (and much longer:-), but not so arcane it feels like reading a graduate level textbook."
353,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419307-rachel,4,"Whew! This has been on my to-read list for years, and I've been trying to read it for months, but people keep recalling it from the library. At nearly 600 pithy pages, this book is more than worthwhile despite its age -- now 20 years old! My primary takeaway from reading this was learning how to frame each of our human traits in the context of evolution (natural selection). The ""computational theory of mind"" fits neatly with the pressures of natural selection, evolving us as beings highly adapted to solving problems of survival as foraging peoples. It is fascinating to look at traits not obviously related to survival problems (love, religion, music), although you have to wait until the very end for these juicy tidbits. I do have some criticisms of the book. One is that you really have to slog through some theory before getting to the meat of the book, and I could see a lot of people abandoning the book in the first 100 pages due to this unnecessarily detailed discussion. Another is that Pinker gives outsize focus to the subjects he is seemingly most expert in, like vision, but cultural aspects like music get tacked on at the end in a very superficial way. Also, leaving out the language component simply because he already wrote about it in another book is a pretty big flaw in this one.As a musician, I found the section on music to be woefully lacking, with many of the statements highly objectionable. For example: ""Many movies and television shows literally orchestrate the viewer's emotions from beginning to end with quasi-musical arrangements. They have no real rhythm, melody, or grouping."" Grouping? Does he mean form? Any undergraduate music student could tell you that movie scores consist not only of rhythm and melody, but of form on multiple levels. Pinker goes on to refer to the ""Jaws"" and ""Mission Impossible"" scores as ""pseudo-music."" If the Mission Impossible theme isn't music, I don't know what is! Also, although I enjoyed the discussion of the overtone series, he accepts Schenker as an inherent fact of music rather than a Western construct. He uses the word ""perhaps"" about twice per paragraph in this section, a clear indication that he's going out on a limb when trying to write on this subject. It made me question what specialists in the other fields think about the sections on visual arts, emotion, etc.Finally, I have to take issue with the statements about women and the treatment of gender roles in this book. No matter how many times or how elegantly Pinker qualified his statements as not being what is ""good,"" simply what natural selection has evolved, I could have used a much more nuanced discussion about this in a contemporary context rather than defaulting to referring to the mother as the one responsible for raising the young. Also, where is the discussion of homosexuality and nontraditional family structures? I get that this is probably outside of the scope of this book, but the way these subjects were treated sometimes felt so backwards that it was hard to swallow.But still, read it."
354,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,3,"In this book, Steven Pinker describes our mind - more precisely: our mental faculties - as a complex set of algorithms, sculpted by natural selection. Pinker uses two theories - the computational theory of mind and the theory of evolution by natural selection - to accomplish this amazing feat.According to the computational theory of mind, our mental organs are composed of algorithms, built up out of simpler subroutines which are in turn built up out of subsubroutines. This goes all the way down to the most basic, simplest algorithms that are digital: yes/no, on/off, etc. What it means, in essence, is that we come equipped with pre-programmed mental software with which we perceive the world. This software works is based on certain assumptions - based on the stability and the continuity of physical laws - and it's in the moments that the assumptions don't hold that we are tricked or fooled by our own mind (i.e. cognitive illusions).The other building block of Pinkers story is evolution by natural selection. Evolution shaped all the organisms on this planet, including us. Homo sapiens is unique in its mental capabilities, even though our mind is just one way to solve the natural problems (some others being strong, quick, etc.). I think the theory of evolution by natural selection has been described by excellent writers such as Dawkins, Dennett, Ridley and Zimmer (not to mention Darwin himself, even though his theory of inheritence was flawed), so I will not dwell on it here.Now to Pinkers main thesis: to understand our mind, we have to reverse-engineer our mental organs. In other words: for every psychological trait or phenomenon we have to ask the question 'what was its adaptive function in our ancestors' environment?' It is precisely this question that cuts deep through the delusional paradigms of modern day academicians and intellectuals. The mantra is ""culture determines who we are"". In other words: men rape because they are raised in a culture that's hostile to women. Instead of letting ideology guide science, Pinker approaches the problem from a scientific viewpoint: first describing the facts, then using the simplest theory as possible to explain the data and after this making moral statements. Some examples:In the chapter on Family Values, Pinker tackles the conflicts of interests between parents and offspring, husbands and wives, men and women in general and siblings. He explains these conflicts in terms of different evolutionary strategies between men and women. It pays for men to seek out sex as much as possible; it pays for women to be very selective who to mate with. This is a biological truth that even feminists and neo-marxists/blank slaters can't deny. This fundamental difference leads to competition between men for sexual access to women and to the pursuit of looking young and fertile (i.e. beautiful) between women. One of the most overlooked facts that Pinker mentions in this chapter is that a lot of the incentives for war, rape and murder are sexual motives. Maybe the men joining the army are not so crazy after all: throughout history, one of the most important rewards of victorious armies has been the genocide of men and kids and the mass rape of women. Pinkers paradigm offers new insights into our urge for agression.But this is not all, Pinkers paradigm also offers new insights into our urge to have friends and seek out honest reputations. Evolutionary speaking, it paid to cooperate. The only problem is that this presupposes cheater-detection mechanisms, which are prone to be exploited. One of the most important parts of our social life is the earning of an honest reputation; this shows others that you are a reliable cooperator. A third interesting aspect was the chapter on vision. Pinker analyzes the geometry of paintings and other visual art forms. One of the common threads is the presence of open landscapes with a broad horizon and some places of shelter. This was the environment our ancestors evolved in, it explains our like for these sorts of paintings and surroundings and our dislike for thick forests and deserts. A fourth insight is the way how our ideas are formed. We come equipped with mental software to perceive the world - including the other minds in this world - and to make decisions. These algorithms are heuristic in nature. In other words: they are based on assumptions that normally held in our ancestors' environment. Sometimes we encounter situations where these assumptions don't hold and we fall prey to cognitive illusions. For example, it is commonly known that the frame in which a logical problem is placed determines the effectivity of our judgments.A final important subject to note is the function of our emotions. Our emotions guide are actions, they are the incentives that lead us to chase pleasure and avoid pain. The objects of pleasure and pain are goals, set by evolution. We enjoy sex because organisms (i.e. our ancestors) that enjoyed sex had more sex and thereby had more offspring than organisms that didn't enjoy sex. We enjoy certain foods because our ancestors enjoyed those foods - and those that didn't had less offspring. In a sense, Hume was right when he wrote ""reason is the slave of our passions."" Our passions motive us to seek out the things we enjoy and avoid the things we hate. To summarize: Pinker tries to show that by looking at our psychology as mental organs, consisting of algorithms, that were sculpted by natural selection in the past eons, we have a new paradigm to understand our mind. A paradigm based on two of the most accepted theories in science and one that excludes ideology. Only a realistic understanding of our mental constitution can lead us to appreciate what is good and what should be changed for the better. An informed ethics presupposes evolutionary psychology. Even though I completely agree with Pinker's message and am interested in evolutionary psychology, I can't really recommend this book to laypeople. It would be better, before reading How the Mind Works, to school yourself in evolutionary biology and psychology, because Pinker's style of explaining is not for the faint hearted; he makes use of many terms that presuppose a lot of prior knowledge about the subjects involved. And a thing that annoyed me is the sheer mass of this book: 660 pages. Some chapters contained 90+ pages, which is way too long (in my opinion). But I should not end this review on a sour note, this was a pleasant read and value the various insights I gained from this.On a sidenote: Pinker's treatment of free will and consciousness is confusing. On the one hand, he makes valuable distinctions. So when he deals with consciousness, he makes a distinction between self knowledge, access to information and sentience and explains that the first to senses are in theory explainable by science. This is helpful. On the other hand, Pinker offers no route to answers himself and seems to retreat in a very un-academic mindset with regard to these topics. So in the example of consciousness, even though the first two aforementioned senses are explainable in scientific terms, sentience is not. Even stronger: our mind has been shaped by natural selection to deal with everyday problems and situations, offering the solution to the riddle of sentience not being one of them. In other words: the problem of consciousness is unsolvable in principle and we should not waste any more intellectual effort on this futile search. A very un-scientific mindset. (In 1542 people thought the earth was the centre of the cosmos; in 1543 Copernicus showed the earth to be just another mass of iron orbiting the sun; in the 20th century we discovered that even our sun is not so special: we live in an increasingly expanding universe in which we are just a temporary spec of dust)."
355,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6149613-marcus,3,"As so often is the case with popular science books I’m picking up, I feel that any attempt to review this volume must be done from two different perspectives – literary and in terms of content.If we start with the literary experience, I’ll put it plainly – it was far more difficult read than it had to be and the blame for it rests squarely on the shoulders of the author and the editor. When a book is titled ‘How the mind works’, it shouldn’t come as a big surprise that the reader expects some sort of introduction to the topic defined on the cover. Professor Pinker decided however that the best way to start his book was by launching a vigorous defense of his position on the topic, without really stating what that position is. Next, just to make things even more confusing, he continues with another defense speech, this time around regarding validity of Darwin’s theory of evolution. This ‘introduction’ to the topic at hand takes up about one fifth of the book. I have to admit that while struggling through it I mostly wondered when, if ever, we’re going to get to the actual ‘human mind’ part.Well, we did get there… eventually. The ‘good stuff’ starts off with a discussion about brain and how it (possibly) works on most basic neural level. Next the discussion moves on to sight and its absolutely central role in functionality of human brain and therefore also human mind. And then the course of discussion makes a rapid final change of course and we embark on a guided trip through different aspects of human mind, or in my opinion at least, human behavior. This final part of the book does indeed feel more like a guided tour than deep and meaningful discussion and to be perfectly honest, most of the time left me quite unsatisfied.Content-wise, I suspect that whether or not this book will be to a reader’s liking will depend on one single thing – degree of acceptance of the claim that computational theory of mind is the correct one. The author is one of main advocates of this theory and this volume, once all the unnecessary tangents are peeled of, is nothing more than presentation of its fundamental concepts.Personally I found this book to be a bag of mixed blessings. Perhaps half of it was simply fascinating – I don't necessarily agree with all of the ideas presented by the author, but as long as he stuck to the actual 'explanation', I found it both informative and thought provoking. I was far less impressed by his tangential rants, which in my opinion fail to serve any purpose in a popular science book intended for general public."
356,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64785453-andrei-khrapavitski,4,"Twenty years have passed since this book was originally published in 1997. And this is still a worthy read for anyone interested in human psychology. Steven Pinker, IMHO, is one of the best science authors of the past decades. His book ""The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined"" is one of my all-time favorites. ""The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature"" is also a brilliant book I often recommend. ""How the Mind Works"" would rank lower on the list of my recommendations simply because the pace of neuroscientific discoveries has accelerated in the last 20 years, and this book, given its magisterial title, lacks discussion of what we have learnt in recent years, for instance, through functional magnetic resonance imaging, etc. For that, please, refer to a truly profound ""Behave"" by Robert Sapolsky, published in 2017. ""How the Mind Works"" focuses quite a lot on human behavior, but Pinker develops this topic in his following books in a much greater detail. Still Pinker packs a lot in this volume. And this will surely be of interest to a lot of people eager for his brilliant style of writing and wit. Read this book if you want to learn about a computational theory of mind, which is still a solid view, not without criticism, on how our brain functions, positing that it is an information processing system, and thinking can be compared to computing. Pinker covers a few other alternative theories, too. I found really fascinating this book's insights on why we like certain art, music, entertainment, colors and music. It is much more rudimentary than most people imagine and is connected quite a lot to whether our vision or hearing processing can cling to some straightforward geometry or sounds. When it was published, it was met with both praise and criticism. Pinker has responded to some of it in ""the Blank Slate,"" which is a great follow-up and, as I mentioned, a perfect read by its own merit. However, if you have time for just one Pinker's book, ""Better Angels"" is his masterpiece. Really looking forward to his next book ""Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress"" due out on February 27, 2018."
357,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68837787-mart,5,"If you are looking for a neurobiology book which would explain how electric impulses and neurotransmitters become thoughts, this is not what you are after. Pinker presents a comprehensive and well documented series of theories, studies, experiments, reasonings and proposals and uses them to build a fully evolutionary view on the psychology of our species. His explanations are grounded on scientific and neurobiological information, in the sense that he takes them into account and doesn’t contradict them, but they work on the psychological level. As a matter of fact, he states that this book is purported to explain how the mind works and not how the brain works. I wouldn’t say though that this is a book recommended for people who are not familiar with the theory of evolution and its contemporary understanding. The book refers to other findings and scientists and employs concepts which in lack of some deeper background in the subject may sound loose or needing specific proof. The style may seem vague or giving things for granted for people who are not familiar with the field and its regular set of internally undisputed facts. All things said, Pinker provides a comprehensive list of notes where all his statements and experiment summaries are linked to a reference or more detailed explanation. This makes the style easier to follow, as he is discussing complex issues which need a lot of focus. The book does take a lot of time to rebuke very common misconceptions about the theory of evolution which would undermine a proper comprehension of its content. This could be seen as useful or as useless, depending on whether the reader needs ir or not. I believe the biggest advantage of this book is that it presents a totally coherent, well researched and thoroughly documented explanation of what we do scientifically know about our minds. If this is what you are looking for and you already know a little bit of evolution, ethology and psychology, you will find it here. Everything that is just a proposal is presented as such, and what is unknown is claimed to be so as well, so you won’t be lured into believing every speculation. "
358,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1038815-jc,3,"I don't think this is Pinker's best work, even if it was a best seller and a Pulitzer Prize finalist (so whad-do I know??). My complaints are, I admit, picky. A major work on a complex and broad topic like this needs a a couple of things: a meaningful introduction or opening chapter (his short preface does not suffice) laying out the book's goals and major themes; on the other end, some sort of afterword bringing together the themes into a coherent thesis. Getting to the meat of the book, I did not feel that most of the first chapter was necessary. Chap. 1 kind of wandered, in parts bordered on incoherent, and sometimes seemed to be part of a different work altogether. Again, maybe a serious introduction, final tie-it-all-together chapter, or an afterword may have explained how Chap. 1 fit in. This is significant as the opening chapter (mostly dealing with A.I.) takes up more than 10% of the book. I actually felt that in the opening chapter he strongly contradicted some of his major themes in the rest of the book. However, once I finished schlogging through that, I found most of the rest of the book fascinating (if still in need of some minor editing). The only theme that carried through from chap. 1 to the end was ""reverse engineering,"" and I found both his definition and use of the phrase to be weak. I have heard Pinker lecture more than once, and like much of his other writing (and look forward to his next work, ""Enlightenment Now,"" due out in Feb. 2018), so I don't mean this as a knock on Pinker, his views, or his public output. However, I think here he was trying to do a bit too much in one volume, and kind of stumbled over himself a bit. [it WAS good enough that I did read it all, but I think he has presented the science, and his interpretations of that science, better elsewhere]"
359,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70100482-zo,4,"I probably would give this 5-stars if I hadn’t encountered many of the ideas it discusses already, but there still was a lot I had not considered or new ways of presenting things that made them worthwhile. I found the section on vision/perception fairly boring, but other than that Pinker consistently found interesting ways to discuss the mechanisms of human behavior. It’s one of those books that covers so much that I don’t have any specific strong takeaways, but I am most interested in the idea that some of these explanations which seemed so solid at the time have since been revised by new discoveries (though I’m having trouble remembering what theory comes before what / what is “actually” right on some Q’s). Particularly as I’m almost done with Henrich’s book right now I am very interested in the way he revises many of Pinker’s claims, and how definitive/testable Henrich’s revisions are (for some of them I’m also not sure how much he actually differs). I think generally Pinker’s explanation of feelings and social behavior are most accurate, but his explanation of “higher” human callings, while certainly providing part of the answers, still seems lacking (or maybe that’s just wishful thinking). Also interested in reading how Miller’s book revises some of the survival-based explanations Pinker offers. Curiously, I did find myself at times descending into nihilism about what to do with the knowledge Pinker offers, and the semi-determinist conclusions they provide about human behavior. I’m not sure if that is a product of current mental states, simply having read too much of this stuff recently, or something about the way Pinker presents it, but it at least got me thinking productively about how to integrate these explanations into moral philosophy debates. Look forward to more Pinker in the future."

This was due in part to this one book having more width and depth than all the psychology courses I took at university put together. I almost wish that I had skipped Uni and read this instead, but then again I doubt I would have understood this book without the basic grounding their courses kindly provided.A rare mixture of luminous thinking and clear writing is how I would summarise this book.I'm not really feeling in a mood to be verbose about psychology and philosophy today so you're going to have to be content with this.If you want more then scan through my 'reading progress' notes - they give more detail."

Even if you don't believe in evolution (which I'm still not sure I do) this book gives AMAZING insights into everything we do as humans, from emotions to relationships to our appreciation for art and humor... and explains how the process of evolution shaped it all. A hard read (read it with a pen and make notes in the margins), but absolutely mind-blowing.I especially love how he illustrates heavy academic material with easily accessible examples from pop culture. While you DO need to have a, you know, 'mind that really works' to read this book, you do NOT need any kind of previous scientific training or understanding to grasp the concepts."
362,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1173151-coqueline,1,"Enough already. I started reading this book in September, and for so long I was slogging it joylessly. Today I decided to abandon it, even though I was already at the last chapter.Very interesting topic, but the book gets really obsessively detailed and repetitive at times. While Pinker have a way of explaining things, I am just frustrated that none of the things he explains have actual hard evidence backing it. It is fine to be able to come up with a seemingly logical explanation for certain human behaviour, but the lack of real evidence just don't cut it for me."
363,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826775-a-reader,3,"I liked the book, i think it is an intellectually stimulating piece of work. My main objection is Pinker's notion that behaviour is adapted to a Stone Age way of life and cannot cope wery well with the modernity of Space Age world.'Our brains', he writes, 'are not wired to cope with anonymous crowds, schooling, written language, governments, police, courts, armies, modern medicine, formal social institutions, high technology, and other newcomers to the human experience.' I cannot understant it. Why not? Is the human mind that created all these and many more, after all.."

380,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/662191-noreen,5,"COMPUTATIONAL THEORY OF MINDJust before reading this, I read a rambling, anecdotal, autobiographical mess that purports to be a science book. When I pick up a science book, I expect a clear statement of the main argument and a straightforward, organized presentation of evidence. I would think that to be a good scientist one would need clear thinking skills and a good grasp of logic, and an ability to express that clarity in writing. Just a few pages into this book I knew I would not be disappointed. I suspected that by the end I would know very little about Steven Pinker and a lot about the mind. Reading this before reading Tooby and Cosmides is probably like reading Dawkins before Darwin. But that worked for me, because the later writer interpreted the former so well that it increased my understanding of the underlying principles. I have bookmarked evolutionary psychology material by Tooby and Cosmides to read later.Though this book is written for the non-scientist, nothing here is condescending or glib. When he uses a term, he states which definition he is using. I really appreciate these efforts. This book is filled with the most complex and esoteric ideas, yet it was a pleasure and a joy to read.""The idea that parents shape their children is so ingrained that most people don't even realize it is a testable hypothesis and not a self-evident truth."" What I found truly striking is that many common beliefs about social science are just plain wrong. We base public policy on them, but the evidence doesn't bear them out. One is that parents have a lot of influence on their children's personalities. Evolutionary biology predicts they have very little influence, and studies confirm it. But it's not a popular idea in our society. We want to think we have influence over our children. We also want someone to blame when children go bad. So the myth persists.""It's not that the claim that there is an interaction between innate structure and learning (or between heredity and environment, nature and nurture, biology and culture) is literally wrong. Rather, it falls into the category of ideas that are so bad they are not even wrong."" ""Evolution and learning can also go on simultaneously, with innate structure evolving in an animal that also learns.""I just finished the first chapter. Wow. He begins with the robot challenge, demonstrating just how difficult it is to mechanically replicate even the simplest things people do. He describes the problem of understanding human vision as the difference between what information our eyes gather as contrasted with what our brains interpret. (I ""see"" things differently after reading this part.) He shows how what we consider ""common sense"" is far beyond the ability of any robot we've constructed so far. There are revolutionary arguments here, and some inflammatory statements. No wonder he's controversial. He discredits a lot of popular concepts in psychiatry and psychology. He talks about ""modules,"" but not in the simplistic structure/function way you might expect. He says our minds are produced by natural selection, but that doesn't mean we are limited to our biological drives. We have ""a complex mind that is designed to mesh with what is in nature.""He argues against the popular notions of biology or culture being causes of our behavior, saying, first, that the biology/culture dichotomy is a false one, and second, that it is used as an argument to abdicate personal responsibility. (He can't help it: he was born that way, or he ate too many Twinkies, or it was the system, or he was abused, etc.) Personal responsibility, however, would seem to require free will, whatever that is. Whether our decisions are based on random causes, intentional causes, or uncaused causes, free will remains a mystery.Most importantly, he portrays the brain as an information processor, saying information theory has revolutionized the study of neuroscience. Even with all the analogies, I'm having trouble grasping idea of the computational theory of mind. What I can comprehend is that it's central to understanding consciousness and intelligence without resorting to a magical explanation. Using Dennett's analogy, the brain as a machine can be explained by breaking down complex processes into ever smaller tasks until even the most stupid homunculus, or demon, can do each of them. Then, put millions of these tiny steps together, and speed up the process, and intelligence results. (I think.) On the other hand, apparently sentience is simply is a construct of our consciousness and doesn't bear scientific examination. It's another mystery.He argues, quite effectively I think, against popular theories of mind such as associationism and connectionism, saying they are not alternatives of, but adjuncts to the computational theory of mind.The next argument is for the theory of natural selection, as if it needs defending. It turns out it does, and not just against creationists. He picks apart opposing arguments, such as macromutation and random drift. After carefully showing how the human brain could be the result of natural selection, and that humans, rather than being its pinnacle or ""goal"" (because it has no goals) are just another, different product, he goes into how and why humans differ from the other animals.Again he examines the complex ways we think and plan and he mentions the ""cognitive niche"" proposed by Toobey. He writes about the tracking ability of the modern hunter gatherers (!Kung) showing they use abstract thinking. It made me think about the claim by James Gleick in The Information that cognitive thought as we understand it could not exist prior to written language (a claim that one reviewer of that book said has been largely discredited). Pinker may have been one of those who discredited it, perhaps in The Language Instinct. However, I may be confusing ""abstract thought"" and ""cognitive thought."" I had this aha moment when I thought abstract thought is what people do without language, but cognitive thought is what happens when people put those thoughts into symbols (words) that can be expressed or communicated. Basically, I think cognitive thought is ""thinking about thinking."" I imagine this isn't an original idea. I probably just figured out for myself what cognitive science has known for decades.After some stuff about our understanding (or rather lack of it) regarding math and physics beyond that needed for survival, and some treatment of the language instinct, we arrive at what is a more interesting topic for me: emotions. The claims are that the triune brain theory (reptilian brain) is wrong and that emotions were essential to our survival and are not nonadaptive baggage. He says, ""intelligence is the pursuit of goals in the face of obstacles"" and ""emotions are mechanisms that set the brain's highest level goals.""While reading the section of chapter 6 on food taboos, I kept seeing parallels with religion. Disgust at certain foods is grounded in avoidance of poisons, yet it differs between cultures and is mostly irrational. Children up to two years old will put almost anything in their mouths. They learn from their parents what is disgusting and they pass that knowledge on to their children. Many food taboos are religious, and the principle can easily be expanded to other religious beliefs and practices.One thing I take issue with is that he keeps using wording that hints at teleology. He says, ""'selfish' means 'acting in ways that make one's own replication more likely.'"" I would word this more passively, something like, ""'selfish' means being able to live long enough to replicate, having inherited the characteristics that allowed one's parents to survive long enough to replicate.""The section headed ""The Doomsday Machine"" is particularly interesting. It's about emotions, especially those of honor and vengeance, and the advertising of them by facial expressions. It's about the genuineness of those expressions, which Pinker says is evidenced by the fact that they are handcuffed to our involuntarily physical processes (and therefore maybe the triune brain theory does have validity). There is much speculation here, but it's food for thought.And here's a thought: that grief is a useless emotion unexplainable except as a doomsday machine (to ensure people have an interest in protecting people they love).Cheesecake, pornography, and the arts.I found the honesty of the last chapter refreshing. Pinker says it like it is -- that the arts are not biologically adaptive; that they are shortcuts we created to excite the pleasure circuits of the brain that ordinarily would be stimulated by activities that increase fitness. That view is unpopular today. People don't want to admit that art, like fashion, is a matter of status. People who have the wealth and leisure time to spend lots of resources on the arts want to justify their obsession. They're influential people, which might explain why popular culture (and some science writers) indulge that wish. The book I mentioned at the outset of this review is one such treatment. The author, who is admittedly obsessed with music, argues that music is not just ""auditory cheesecake""; that it is biologically adaptive. Now I know why I felt it was such a waste of time. When my book group discussed it, a member told us that he has taught himself to appreciate Schönberg by repeatedly listening to recordings of his work, to his wife's annoyance. (I heard a Schönberg piece at a symphony performance, and once was enough for a lifetime.) I don't feel any need to pretend to like something to impress anyone. I can't think of any other reason one would do it, especially now that I've read Pinker. Humans do other biologically functionless activities. The intellect itself may be nonadaptive. Religion and philosophy. Psychology. I'm sure the irony is not lost on Pinker that his own education and profession fall under this umbrella. He doesn't denigrate these activities; he just says evolutionary biology doesn't explain them."
381,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8173124-george-marshall,4,"I very much enjoyed the book. The topic is more ""Why The Mind Works"", and with that being the author's actual stated aim, the book seems misnamed. The author is making a case for seeing the mind as an evolved consortium of mental modules. Much of the thought in the book is not necessarily his own - the book is abounding with quotations, some in defense, some to rail against. The quotes, frankly, are frequently more interesting than the surrounding detail. He even points out early on that he is not adding new information, but seeking to bring it together in a readable form. Despite, he balances things fairly well and brings a coherent whole out of it.Pinker is a little full of himself. He can be dismissive. He will mine the sources for whatever can be used in support of his point, even if the authors themselves disagree with him, sometimes pointedly. One example of his unique way of handling other viewpoints stuck out to me:""When I mentioned the theory of parent-offspring conflict to console a colleague whose two-year-old son had become a pest after the birth of a younger brother he snapped. ""All you're saying is that people are selfish!"" Sleepless for weeks, he could be forgiven for missing the point. Clearly, parents aren't selfish; parents are the least selfish entities in the known universe. But they aren't infinitely selfless either..."" (p.442)To which one can only remark that while studying psychology and the mind, Pinker had forgotten or ignored the example of Job and his rather unhelpful set of friends. He had been a terrible friend and/or colleague, offering up his ""wisdom"" in place of the sympathy requested. I chuckle, though I am probably as bad at times, but he seems unaware of how pompous this recounting makes him appear. ""He could be forgiven..."" The temerity! Ah, well.But back to the point, he is usually successful in making his point. He presents a pretty compelling case for how many of the modules we see at work in the mind could have been ""designed"" through adaptive means. But in a number of instances he ends by simply spitting out a multitude of possibilities to answer the open question. This he does while maintaining the certitude that adaptive means can account for all we could want to know about the inner workings of the mind.Until it isn't. With music, specifically, he seems to get into weeds, giving all manner of technical details of harmonics and such, as if, lacking a good argument for how we adapted a sense for the pleasures of music, he might bore the reader into acceptance through fine print. In the end, music in his opinion is non-adaptive, ""cheesecake"" in his words - a pleasureful cocktail that plays off of the other modules, but was not itself selected for. At least he admits the picture he paints of our musical inclinations is ""speculative"".Of course a book that tries to treat the whole of the human mind and its development will have to address the subject of religion and our propensity towards it. Pinker comes off derisively, from the introduction to the bitter end, but most of the time it did not distract from the meat of what was being said. While arrogant, he is as dismissive of religious practitioners as he is of feminists unable to square their moral convictions with the reality of the evolved nature of our minds (for good or bad!). Though, he does apologize - backhandedly - to the feminists:""I wish I could have discussed the evolutionary psychology of sexuality without the asides about feminist theory, but in today's intellectual climate that is impossible...These kinds of arguments combine bad biology (nature is nice), bad psychology (the mind is created by society), and bad ethics (what people like is good). Feminism would lose nothing by giving them up."" (pp.492-3)The book naturally flows from the fundamental modules until it reaches the point where one is not sure what is adaptation and what is the working of culture with the framework it has been given. In turn he discusses vision, body adaptation, language, logic (of a sort), probability (especially in the sense of cheat sensing), mating and reproduction, friendship, and onto arts and literature.Getting to the big question of sentience, he spends very little time in throwing out a ""we can't know"", as if that is somehow better than the answers he dismisses so quickly and easily. An unsatisfying ending. But this does not overcome the mountain of enjoyed reading that makes up the book."
382,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57079482-chuck-kollars,3,"This book is quite long, and glancingly touches on a very wide variety of topics. Even such an abstruse question as why the art of painting might have more appeal to social elites is discussed a little. This variety shouldn't though obscure the fact that some very basic views about human thinking provide the main focus of the book and tie it all together. The author clearly made a mighty attempt to organize the mass of ideas and evidence in a sensible way; nevertheless the end result feels a bit scattered, probably mostly because the topics covered range so widely. It seemed to me (a more careful reader might produce a more accurate summary) the book's central ideas were:1. The human brain is a melange of fairly separate parts.2. Many of the parts are quite sophisticated. For example interpreting the visual data of 3D objects under variable illumination is nearly impossible, yet the brain manages to do it with ease. 3. The procedure by which the human brain decides which course of action to take when different parts of the brain come to different conclusions is simple, straightforward, and effective. 4. Almost all the operation of the human brain is ""automatic"" in the sense that it's not available to reflection/consciousness at all no matter what. 5. The operation and sophistication of each subsystem of the brain can be directly explained by evolution, typically with reference to the way humans lived in hunter-gatherer groups five thousand years ago. (Here I have a quibble, as the book just _assumes_ without evidence that human biological evolution has pretty much stopped.)6. Ideas that fit well into any one of these subsystems tend to take over, resulting in what we call ""cultural evolution"". (Or to put it in cruder words, there's something to the ""cultural meme"" hypothesis)7. Many of our most cherished things (for example ""cheesecake"") are in fact hacks that exploit some sort of quirk in each of several different brain parts. 8. Our taste for aesthetic/artistic things does _not_ indicate some sort of higher level of consciousness, _nor_ is it the ""purpose"" of life. Rather, it arises simply as an unintended side effect of the way the human brain is organized. (It may also arise from the evolutionary results of pressure to reproduce.)(Interestingly, the idea that -compared to ""reasoned"" responses- ""emotional"" responses that come out of a human brain are ""heuristic shortcuts"" that are much much faster and right often enough to be useful, is most definitely _not_ among those used by the book. The book doesn't ""disgree"" with this idea; a better description is the book simply ""ignores"" it, presenting its case without recourse one way or the other to this idea.)A fair amount of evidence from the results of experiments is presented to support these ideas. At the same time, an implicit case is made that these ideas make sense when taken _all_together_, that they support each other ...a lot. Much of the research stems from a rather small group of investigators. The _possibility_ that putting these ideas together is in fact revolutionary and is not yet generally accepted even by many academics is not discussed at all. The book provides a good overview of an entire subject area at a level deeper than a journalistic article but not nearly as deep as the original scientific papers; a little deeper even than Scientific American (and much longer:-), but not so arcane it feels like reading a graduate level textbook."
383,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419307-rachel,4,"Whew! This has been on my to-read list for years, and I've been trying to read it for months, but people keep recalling it from the library. At nearly 600 pithy pages, this book is more than worthwhile despite its age -- now 20 years old! My primary takeaway from reading this was learning how to frame each of our human traits in the context of evolution (natural selection). The ""computational theory of mind"" fits neatly with the pressures of natural selection, evolving us as beings highly adapted to solving problems of survival as foraging peoples. It is fascinating to look at traits not obviously related to survival problems (love, religion, music), although you have to wait until the very end for these juicy tidbits. I do have some criticisms of the book. One is that you really have to slog through some theory before getting to the meat of the book, and I could see a lot of people abandoning the book in the first 100 pages due to this unnecessarily detailed discussion. Another is that Pinker gives outsize focus to the subjects he is seemingly most expert in, like vision, but cultural aspects like music get tacked on at the end in a very superficial way. Also, leaving out the language component simply because he already wrote about it in another book is a pretty big flaw in this one.As a musician, I found the section on music to be woefully lacking, with many of the statements highly objectionable. For example: ""Many movies and television shows literally orchestrate the viewer's emotions from beginning to end with quasi-musical arrangements. They have no real rhythm, melody, or grouping."" Grouping? Does he mean form? Any undergraduate music student could tell you that movie scores consist not only of rhythm and melody, but of form on multiple levels. Pinker goes on to refer to the ""Jaws"" and ""Mission Impossible"" scores as ""pseudo-music."" If the Mission Impossible theme isn't music, I don't know what is! Also, although I enjoyed the discussion of the overtone series, he accepts Schenker as an inherent fact of music rather than a Western construct. He uses the word ""perhaps"" about twice per paragraph in this section, a clear indication that he's going out on a limb when trying to write on this subject. It made me question what specialists in the other fields think about the sections on visual arts, emotion, etc.Finally, I have to take issue with the statements about women and the treatment of gender roles in this book. No matter how many times or how elegantly Pinker qualified his statements as not being what is ""good,"" simply what natural selection has evolved, I could have used a much more nuanced discussion about this in a contemporary context rather than defaulting to referring to the mother as the one responsible for raising the young. Also, where is the discussion of homosexuality and nontraditional family structures? I get that this is probably outside of the scope of this book, but the way these subjects were treated sometimes felt so backwards that it was hard to swallow.But still, read it."
384,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,3,"In this book, Steven Pinker describes our mind - more precisely: our mental faculties - as a complex set of algorithms, sculpted by natural selection. Pinker uses two theories - the computational theory of mind and the theory of evolution by natural selection - to accomplish this amazing feat.According to the computational theory of mind, our mental organs are composed of algorithms, built up out of simpler subroutines which are in turn built up out of subsubroutines. This goes all the way down to the most basic, simplest algorithms that are digital: yes/no, on/off, etc. What it means, in essence, is that we come equipped with pre-programmed mental software with which we perceive the world. This software works is based on certain assumptions - based on the stability and the continuity of physical laws - and it's in the moments that the assumptions don't hold that we are tricked or fooled by our own mind (i.e. cognitive illusions).The other building block of Pinkers story is evolution by natural selection. Evolution shaped all the organisms on this planet, including us. Homo sapiens is unique in its mental capabilities, even though our mind is just one way to solve the natural problems (some others being strong, quick, etc.). I think the theory of evolution by natural selection has been described by excellent writers such as Dawkins, Dennett, Ridley and Zimmer (not to mention Darwin himself, even though his theory of inheritence was flawed), so I will not dwell on it here.Now to Pinkers main thesis: to understand our mind, we have to reverse-engineer our mental organs. In other words: for every psychological trait or phenomenon we have to ask the question 'what was its adaptive function in our ancestors' environment?' It is precisely this question that cuts deep through the delusional paradigms of modern day academicians and intellectuals. The mantra is ""culture determines who we are"". In other words: men rape because they are raised in a culture that's hostile to women. Instead of letting ideology guide science, Pinker approaches the problem from a scientific viewpoint: first describing the facts, then using the simplest theory as possible to explain the data and after this making moral statements. Some examples:In the chapter on Family Values, Pinker tackles the conflicts of interests between parents and offspring, husbands and wives, men and women in general and siblings. He explains these conflicts in terms of different evolutionary strategies between men and women. It pays for men to seek out sex as much as possible; it pays for women to be very selective who to mate with. This is a biological truth that even feminists and neo-marxists/blank slaters can't deny. This fundamental difference leads to competition between men for sexual access to women and to the pursuit of looking young and fertile (i.e. beautiful) between women. One of the most overlooked facts that Pinker mentions in this chapter is that a lot of the incentives for war, rape and murder are sexual motives. Maybe the men joining the army are not so crazy after all: throughout history, one of the most important rewards of victorious armies has been the genocide of men and kids and the mass rape of women. Pinkers paradigm offers new insights into our urge for agression.But this is not all, Pinkers paradigm also offers new insights into our urge to have friends and seek out honest reputations. Evolutionary speaking, it paid to cooperate. The only problem is that this presupposes cheater-detection mechanisms, which are prone to be exploited. One of the most important parts of our social life is the earning of an honest reputation; this shows others that you are a reliable cooperator. A third interesting aspect was the chapter on vision. Pinker analyzes the geometry of paintings and other visual art forms. One of the common threads is the presence of open landscapes with a broad horizon and some places of shelter. This was the environment our ancestors evolved in, it explains our like for these sorts of paintings and surroundings and our dislike for thick forests and deserts. A fourth insight is the way how our ideas are formed. We come equipped with mental software to perceive the world - including the other minds in this world - and to make decisions. These algorithms are heuristic in nature. In other words: they are based on assumptions that normally held in our ancestors' environment. Sometimes we encounter situations where these assumptions don't hold and we fall prey to cognitive illusions. For example, it is commonly known that the frame in which a logical problem is placed determines the effectivity of our judgments.A final important subject to note is the function of our emotions. Our emotions guide are actions, they are the incentives that lead us to chase pleasure and avoid pain. The objects of pleasure and pain are goals, set by evolution. We enjoy sex because organisms (i.e. our ancestors) that enjoyed sex had more sex and thereby had more offspring than organisms that didn't enjoy sex. We enjoy certain foods because our ancestors enjoyed those foods - and those that didn't had less offspring. In a sense, Hume was right when he wrote ""reason is the slave of our passions."" Our passions motive us to seek out the things we enjoy and avoid the things we hate. To summarize: Pinker tries to show that by looking at our psychology as mental organs, consisting of algorithms, that were sculpted by natural selection in the past eons, we have a new paradigm to understand our mind. A paradigm based on two of the most accepted theories in science and one that excludes ideology. Only a realistic understanding of our mental constitution can lead us to appreciate what is good and what should be changed for the better. An informed ethics presupposes evolutionary psychology. Even though I completely agree with Pinker's message and am interested in evolutionary psychology, I can't really recommend this book to laypeople. It would be better, before reading How the Mind Works, to school yourself in evolutionary biology and psychology, because Pinker's style of explaining is not for the faint hearted; he makes use of many terms that presuppose a lot of prior knowledge about the subjects involved. And a thing that annoyed me is the sheer mass of this book: 660 pages. Some chapters contained 90+ pages, which is way too long (in my opinion). But I should not end this review on a sour note, this was a pleasant read and value the various insights I gained from this.On a sidenote: Pinker's treatment of free will and consciousness is confusing. On the one hand, he makes valuable distinctions. So when he deals with consciousness, he makes a distinction between self knowledge, access to information and sentience and explains that the first to senses are in theory explainable by science. This is helpful. On the other hand, Pinker offers no route to answers himself and seems to retreat in a very un-academic mindset with regard to these topics. So in the example of consciousness, even though the first two aforementioned senses are explainable in scientific terms, sentience is not. Even stronger: our mind has been shaped by natural selection to deal with everyday problems and situations, offering the solution to the riddle of sentience not being one of them. In other words: the problem of consciousness is unsolvable in principle and we should not waste any more intellectual effort on this futile search. A very un-scientific mindset. (In 1542 people thought the earth was the centre of the cosmos; in 1543 Copernicus showed the earth to be just another mass of iron orbiting the sun; in the 20th century we discovered that even our sun is not so special: we live in an increasingly expanding universe in which we are just a temporary spec of dust)."
385,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6149613-marcus,3,"As so often is the case with popular science books I’m picking up, I feel that any attempt to review this volume must be done from two different perspectives – literary and in terms of content.If we start with the literary experience, I’ll put it plainly – it was far more difficult read than it had to be and the blame for it rests squarely on the shoulders of the author and the editor. When a book is titled ‘How the mind works’, it shouldn’t come as a big surprise that the reader expects some sort of introduction to the topic defined on the cover. Professor Pinker decided however that the best way to start his book was by launching a vigorous defense of his position on the topic, without really stating what that position is. Next, just to make things even more confusing, he continues with another defense speech, this time around regarding validity of Darwin’s theory of evolution. This ‘introduction’ to the topic at hand takes up about one fifth of the book. I have to admit that while struggling through it I mostly wondered when, if ever, we’re going to get to the actual ‘human mind’ part.Well, we did get there… eventually. The ‘good stuff’ starts off with a discussion about brain and how it (possibly) works on most basic neural level. Next the discussion moves on to sight and its absolutely central role in functionality of human brain and therefore also human mind. And then the course of discussion makes a rapid final change of course and we embark on a guided trip through different aspects of human mind, or in my opinion at least, human behavior. This final part of the book does indeed feel more like a guided tour than deep and meaningful discussion and to be perfectly honest, most of the time left me quite unsatisfied.Content-wise, I suspect that whether or not this book will be to a reader’s liking will depend on one single thing – degree of acceptance of the claim that computational theory of mind is the correct one. The author is one of main advocates of this theory and this volume, once all the unnecessary tangents are peeled of, is nothing more than presentation of its fundamental concepts.Personally I found this book to be a bag of mixed blessings. Perhaps half of it was simply fascinating – I don't necessarily agree with all of the ideas presented by the author, but as long as he stuck to the actual 'explanation', I found it both informative and thought provoking. I was far less impressed by his tangential rants, which in my opinion fail to serve any purpose in a popular science book intended for general public."
386,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64785453-andrei-khrapavitski,4,"Twenty years have passed since this book was originally published in 1997. And this is still a worthy read for anyone interested in human psychology. Steven Pinker, IMHO, is one of the best science authors of the past decades. His book ""The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined"" is one of my all-time favorites. ""The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature"" is also a brilliant book I often recommend. ""How the Mind Works"" would rank lower on the list of my recommendations simply because the pace of neuroscientific discoveries has accelerated in the last 20 years, and this book, given its magisterial title, lacks discussion of what we have learnt in recent years, for instance, through functional magnetic resonance imaging, etc. For that, please, refer to a truly profound ""Behave"" by Robert Sapolsky, published in 2017. ""How the Mind Works"" focuses quite a lot on human behavior, but Pinker develops this topic in his following books in a much greater detail. Still Pinker packs a lot in this volume. And this will surely be of interest to a lot of people eager for his brilliant style of writing and wit. Read this book if you want to learn about a computational theory of mind, which is still a solid view, not without criticism, on how our brain functions, positing that it is an information processing system, and thinking can be compared to computing. Pinker covers a few other alternative theories, too. I found really fascinating this book's insights on why we like certain art, music, entertainment, colors and music. It is much more rudimentary than most people imagine and is connected quite a lot to whether our vision or hearing processing can cling to some straightforward geometry or sounds. When it was published, it was met with both praise and criticism. Pinker has responded to some of it in ""the Blank Slate,"" which is a great follow-up and, as I mentioned, a perfect read by its own merit. However, if you have time for just one Pinker's book, ""Better Angels"" is his masterpiece. Really looking forward to his next book ""Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress"" due out on February 27, 2018."
387,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68837787-mart,5,"If you are looking for a neurobiology book which would explain how electric impulses and neurotransmitters become thoughts, this is not what you are after. Pinker presents a comprehensive and well documented series of theories, studies, experiments, reasonings and proposals and uses them to build a fully evolutionary view on the psychology of our species. His explanations are grounded on scientific and neurobiological information, in the sense that he takes them into account and doesn’t contradict them, but they work on the psychological level. As a matter of fact, he states that this book is purported to explain how the mind works and not how the brain works. I wouldn’t say though that this is a book recommended for people who are not familiar with the theory of evolution and its contemporary understanding. The book refers to other findings and scientists and employs concepts which in lack of some deeper background in the subject may sound loose or needing specific proof. The style may seem vague or giving things for granted for people who are not familiar with the field and its regular set of internally undisputed facts. All things said, Pinker provides a comprehensive list of notes where all his statements and experiment summaries are linked to a reference or more detailed explanation. This makes the style easier to follow, as he is discussing complex issues which need a lot of focus. The book does take a lot of time to rebuke very common misconceptions about the theory of evolution which would undermine a proper comprehension of its content. This could be seen as useful or as useless, depending on whether the reader needs ir or not. I believe the biggest advantage of this book is that it presents a totally coherent, well researched and thoroughly documented explanation of what we do scientifically know about our minds. If this is what you are looking for and you already know a little bit of evolution, ethology and psychology, you will find it here. Everything that is just a proposal is presented as such, and what is unknown is claimed to be so as well, so you won’t be lured into believing every speculation. "
388,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1038815-jc,3,"I don't think this is Pinker's best work, even if it was a best seller and a Pulitzer Prize finalist (so whad-do I know??). My complaints are, I admit, picky. A major work on a complex and broad topic like this needs a a couple of things: a meaningful introduction or opening chapter (his short preface does not suffice) laying out the book's goals and major themes; on the other end, some sort of afterword bringing together the themes into a coherent thesis. Getting to the meat of the book, I did not feel that most of the first chapter was necessary. Chap. 1 kind of wandered, in parts bordered on incoherent, and sometimes seemed to be part of a different work altogether. Again, maybe a serious introduction, final tie-it-all-together chapter, or an afterword may have explained how Chap. 1 fit in. This is significant as the opening chapter (mostly dealing with A.I.) takes up more than 10% of the book. I actually felt that in the opening chapter he strongly contradicted some of his major themes in the rest of the book. However, once I finished schlogging through that, I found most of the rest of the book fascinating (if still in need of some minor editing). The only theme that carried through from chap. 1 to the end was ""reverse engineering,"" and I found both his definition and use of the phrase to be weak. I have heard Pinker lecture more than once, and like much of his other writing (and look forward to his next work, ""Enlightenment Now,"" due out in Feb. 2018), so I don't mean this as a knock on Pinker, his views, or his public output. However, I think here he was trying to do a bit too much in one volume, and kind of stumbled over himself a bit. [it WAS good enough that I did read it all, but I think he has presented the science, and his interpretations of that science, better elsewhere]"
389,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70100482-zo,4,"I probably would give this 5-stars if I hadn’t encountered many of the ideas it discusses already, but there still was a lot I had not considered or new ways of presenting things that made them worthwhile. I found the section on vision/perception fairly boring, but other than that Pinker consistently found interesting ways to discuss the mechanisms of human behavior. It’s one of those books that covers so much that I don’t have any specific strong takeaways, but I am most interested in the idea that some of these explanations which seemed so solid at the time have since been revised by new discoveries (though I’m having trouble remembering what theory comes before what / what is “actually” right on some Q’s). Particularly as I’m almost done with Henrich’s book right now I am very interested in the way he revises many of Pinker’s claims, and how definitive/testable Henrich’s revisions are (for some of them I’m also not sure how much he actually differs). I think generally Pinker’s explanation of feelings and social behavior are most accurate, but his explanation of “higher” human callings, while certainly providing part of the answers, still seems lacking (or maybe that’s just wishful thinking). Also interested in reading how Miller’s book revises some of the survival-based explanations Pinker offers. Curiously, I did find myself at times descending into nihilism about what to do with the knowledge Pinker offers, and the semi-determinist conclusions they provide about human behavior. I’m not sure if that is a product of current mental states, simply having read too much of this stuff recently, or something about the way Pinker presents it, but it at least got me thinking productively about how to integrate these explanations into moral philosophy debates. Look forward to more Pinker in the future."

This was due in part to this one book having more width and depth than all the psychology courses I took at university put together. I almost wish that I had skipped Uni and read this instead, but then again I doubt I would have understood this book without the basic grounding their courses kindly provided.A rare mixture of luminous thinking and clear writing is how I would summarise this book.I'm not really feeling in a mood to be verbose about psychology and philosophy today so you're going to have to be content with this.If you want more then scan through my 'reading progress' notes - they give more detail."

Even if you don't believe in evolution (which I'm still not sure I do) this book gives AMAZING insights into everything we do as humans, from emotions to relationships to our appreciation for art and humor... and explains how the process of evolution shaped it all. A hard read (read it with a pen and make notes in the margins), but absolutely mind-blowing.I especially love how he illustrates heavy academic material with easily accessible examples from pop culture. While you DO need to have a, you know, 'mind that really works' to read this book, you do NOT need any kind of previous scientific training or understanding to grasp the concepts."

Today I decided to abandon it, even though I was already at the last chapter.Very interesting topic, but the book gets really obsessively detailed and repetitive at times. While Pinker have a way of explaining things, I am just frustrated that none of the things he explains have actual hard evidence backing it. It is fine to be able to come up with a seemingly logical explanation for certain human behaviour, but the lack of real evidence just don't cut it for me."
393,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826775-a-reader,3,"I liked the book, i think it is an intellectually stimulating piece of work. My main objection is Pinker's notion that behaviour is adapted to a Stone Age way of life and cannot cope wery well with the modernity of Space Age world.'Our brains', he writes, 'are not wired to cope with anonymous crowds, schooling, written language, governments, police, courts, armies, modern medicine, formal social institutions, high technology, and other newcomers to the human experience.' I cannot understant it. Why not? Is the human mind that created all these and many more, after all.."

410,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/662191-noreen,5,"COMPUTATIONAL THEORY OF MINDJust before reading this, I read a rambling, anecdotal, autobiographical mess that purports to be a science book. When I pick up a science book, I expect a clear statement of the main argument and a straightforward, organized presentation of evidence. I would think that to be a good scientist one would need clear thinking skills and a good grasp of logic, and an ability to express that clarity in writing. Just a few pages into this book I knew I would not be disappointed. I suspected that by the end I would know very little about Steven Pinker and a lot about the mind. Reading this before reading Tooby and Cosmides is probably like reading Dawkins before Darwin. But that worked for me, because the later writer interpreted the former so well that it increased my understanding of the underlying principles. I have bookmarked evolutionary psychology material by Tooby and Cosmides to read later.Though this book is written for the non-scientist, nothing here is condescending or glib. When he uses a term, he states which definition he is using. I really appreciate these efforts. This book is filled with the most complex and esoteric ideas, yet it was a pleasure and a joy to read.""The idea that parents shape their children is so ingrained that most people don't even realize it is a testable hypothesis and not a self-evident truth."" What I found truly striking is that many common beliefs about social science are just plain wrong. We base public policy on them, but the evidence doesn't bear them out. One is that parents have a lot of influence on their children's personalities. Evolutionary biology predicts they have very little influence, and studies confirm it. But it's not a popular idea in our society. We want to think we have influence over our children. We also want someone to blame when children go bad. So the myth persists.""It's not that the claim that there is an interaction between innate structure and learning (or between heredity and environment, nature and nurture, biology and culture) is literally wrong. Rather, it falls into the category of ideas that are so bad they are not even wrong."" ""Evolution and learning can also go on simultaneously, with innate structure evolving in an animal that also learns.""I just finished the first chapter. Wow. He begins with the robot challenge, demonstrating just how difficult it is to mechanically replicate even the simplest things people do. He describes the problem of understanding human vision as the difference between what information our eyes gather as contrasted with what our brains interpret. (I ""see"" things differently after reading this part.) He shows how what we consider ""common sense"" is far beyond the ability of any robot we've constructed so far. There are revolutionary arguments here, and some inflammatory statements. No wonder he's controversial. He discredits a lot of popular concepts in psychiatry and psychology. He talks about ""modules,"" but not in the simplistic structure/function way you might expect. He says our minds are produced by natural selection, but that doesn't mean we are limited to our biological drives. We have ""a complex mind that is designed to mesh with what is in nature.""He argues against the popular notions of biology or culture being causes of our behavior, saying, first, that the biology/culture dichotomy is a false one, and second, that it is used as an argument to abdicate personal responsibility. (He can't help it: he was born that way, or he ate too many Twinkies, or it was the system, or he was abused, etc.) Personal responsibility, however, would seem to require free will, whatever that is. Whether our decisions are based on random causes, intentional causes, or uncaused causes, free will remains a mystery.Most importantly, he portrays the brain as an information processor, saying information theory has revolutionized the study of neuroscience. Even with all the analogies, I'm having trouble grasping idea of the computational theory of mind. What I can comprehend is that it's central to understanding consciousness and intelligence without resorting to a magical explanation. Using Dennett's analogy, the brain as a machine can be explained by breaking down complex processes into ever smaller tasks until even the most stupid homunculus, or demon, can do each of them. Then, put millions of these tiny steps together, and speed up the process, and intelligence results. (I think.) On the other hand, apparently sentience is simply is a construct of our consciousness and doesn't bear scientific examination. It's another mystery.He argues, quite effectively I think, against popular theories of mind such as associationism and connectionism, saying they are not alternatives of, but adjuncts to the computational theory of mind.The next argument is for the theory of natural selection, as if it needs defending. It turns out it does, and not just against creationists. He picks apart opposing arguments, such as macromutation and random drift. After carefully showing how the human brain could be the result of natural selection, and that humans, rather than being its pinnacle or ""goal"" (because it has no goals) are just another, different product, he goes into how and why humans differ from the other animals.Again he examines the complex ways we think and plan and he mentions the ""cognitive niche"" proposed by Toobey. He writes about the tracking ability of the modern hunter gatherers (!Kung) showing they use abstract thinking. It made me think about the claim by James Gleick in The Information that cognitive thought as we understand it could not exist prior to written language (a claim that one reviewer of that book said has been largely discredited). Pinker may have been one of those who discredited it, perhaps in The Language Instinct. However, I may be confusing ""abstract thought"" and ""cognitive thought."" I had this aha moment when I thought abstract thought is what people do without language, but cognitive thought is what happens when people put those thoughts into symbols (words) that can be expressed or communicated. Basically, I think cognitive thought is ""thinking about thinking."" I imagine this isn't an original idea. I probably just figured out for myself what cognitive science has known for decades.After some stuff about our understanding (or rather lack of it) regarding math and physics beyond that needed for survival, and some treatment of the language instinct, we arrive at what is a more interesting topic for me: emotions. The claims are that the triune brain theory (reptilian brain) is wrong and that emotions were essential to our survival and are not nonadaptive baggage. He says, ""intelligence is the pursuit of goals in the face of obstacles"" and ""emotions are mechanisms that set the brain's highest level goals.""While reading the section of chapter 6 on food taboos, I kept seeing parallels with religion. Disgust at certain foods is grounded in avoidance of poisons, yet it differs between cultures and is mostly irrational. Children up to two years old will put almost anything in their mouths. They learn from their parents what is disgusting and they pass that knowledge on to their children. Many food taboos are religious, and the principle can easily be expanded to other religious beliefs and practices.One thing I take issue with is that he keeps using wording that hints at teleology. He says, ""'selfish' means 'acting in ways that make one's own replication more likely.'"" I would word this more passively, something like, ""'selfish' means being able to live long enough to replicate, having inherited the characteristics that allowed one's parents to survive long enough to replicate.""The section headed ""The Doomsday Machine"" is particularly interesting. It's about emotions, especially those of honor and vengeance, and the advertising of them by facial expressions. It's about the genuineness of those expressions, which Pinker says is evidenced by the fact that they are handcuffed to our involuntarily physical processes (and therefore maybe the triune brain theory does have validity). There is much speculation here, but it's food for thought.And here's a thought: that grief is a useless emotion unexplainable except as a doomsday machine (to ensure people have an interest in protecting people they love).Cheesecake, pornography, and the arts.I found the honesty of the last chapter refreshing. Pinker says it like it is -- that the arts are not biologically adaptive; that they are shortcuts we created to excite the pleasure circuits of the brain that ordinarily would be stimulated by activities that increase fitness. That view is unpopular today. People don't want to admit that art, like fashion, is a matter of status. People who have the wealth and leisure time to spend lots of resources on the arts want to justify their obsession. They're influential people, which might explain why popular culture (and some science writers) indulge that wish. The book I mentioned at the outset of this review is one such treatment. The author, who is admittedly obsessed with music, argues that music is not just ""auditory cheesecake""; that it is biologically adaptive. Now I know why I felt it was such a waste of time. When my book group discussed it, a member told us that he has taught himself to appreciate Schönberg by repeatedly listening to recordings of his work, to his wife's annoyance. (I heard a Schönberg piece at a symphony performance, and once was enough for a lifetime.) I don't feel any need to pretend to like something to impress anyone. I can't think of any other reason one would do it, especially now that I've read Pinker. Humans do other biologically functionless activities. The intellect itself may be nonadaptive. Religion and philosophy. Psychology. I'm sure the irony is not lost on Pinker that his own education and profession fall under this umbrella. He doesn't denigrate these activities; he just says evolutionary biology doesn't explain them."
411,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8173124-george-marshall,4,"I very much enjoyed the book. The topic is more ""Why The Mind Works"", and with that being the author's actual stated aim, the book seems misnamed. The author is making a case for seeing the mind as an evolved consortium of mental modules. Much of the thought in the book is not necessarily his own - the book is abounding with quotations, some in defense, some to rail against. The quotes, frankly, are frequently more interesting than the surrounding detail. He even points out early on that he is not adding new information, but seeking to bring it together in a readable form. Despite, he balances things fairly well and brings a coherent whole out of it.Pinker is a little full of himself. He can be dismissive. He will mine the sources for whatever can be used in support of his point, even if the authors themselves disagree with him, sometimes pointedly. One example of his unique way of handling other viewpoints stuck out to me:""When I mentioned the theory of parent-offspring conflict to console a colleague whose two-year-old son had become a pest after the birth of a younger brother he snapped. ""All you're saying is that people are selfish!"" Sleepless for weeks, he could be forgiven for missing the point. Clearly, parents aren't selfish; parents are the least selfish entities in the known universe. But they aren't infinitely selfless either..."" (p.442)To which one can only remark that while studying psychology and the mind, Pinker had forgotten or ignored the example of Job and his rather unhelpful set of friends. He had been a terrible friend and/or colleague, offering up his ""wisdom"" in place of the sympathy requested. I chuckle, though I am probably as bad at times, but he seems unaware of how pompous this recounting makes him appear. ""He could be forgiven..."" The temerity! Ah, well.But back to the point, he is usually successful in making his point. He presents a pretty compelling case for how many of the modules we see at work in the mind could have been ""designed"" through adaptive means. But in a number of instances he ends by simply spitting out a multitude of possibilities to answer the open question. This he does while maintaining the certitude that adaptive means can account for all we could want to know about the inner workings of the mind.Until it isn't. With music, specifically, he seems to get into weeds, giving all manner of technical details of harmonics and such, as if, lacking a good argument for how we adapted a sense for the pleasures of music, he might bore the reader into acceptance through fine print. In the end, music in his opinion is non-adaptive, ""cheesecake"" in his words - a pleasureful cocktail that plays off of the other modules, but was not itself selected for. At least he admits the picture he paints of our musical inclinations is ""speculative"".Of course a book that tries to treat the whole of the human mind and its development will have to address the subject of religion and our propensity towards it. Pinker comes off derisively, from the introduction to the bitter end, but most of the time it did not distract from the meat of what was being said. While arrogant, he is as dismissive of religious practitioners as he is of feminists unable to square their moral convictions with the reality of the evolved nature of our minds (for good or bad!). Though, he does apologize - backhandedly - to the feminists:""I wish I could have discussed the evolutionary psychology of sexuality without the asides about feminist theory, but in today's intellectual climate that is impossible...These kinds of arguments combine bad biology (nature is nice), bad psychology (the mind is created by society), and bad ethics (what people like is good). Feminism would lose nothing by giving them up."" (pp.492-3)The book naturally flows from the fundamental modules until it reaches the point where one is not sure what is adaptation and what is the working of culture with the framework it has been given. In turn he discusses vision, body adaptation, language, logic (of a sort), probability (especially in the sense of cheat sensing), mating and reproduction, friendship, and onto arts and literature.Getting to the big question of sentience, he spends very little time in throwing out a ""we can't know"", as if that is somehow better than the answers he dismisses so quickly and easily. An unsatisfying ending. But this does not overcome the mountain of enjoyed reading that makes up the book."
412,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57079482-chuck-kollars,3,"This book is quite long, and glancingly touches on a very wide variety of topics. Even such an abstruse question as why the art of painting might have more appeal to social elites is discussed a little. This variety shouldn't though obscure the fact that some very basic views about human thinking provide the main focus of the book and tie it all together. The author clearly made a mighty attempt to organize the mass of ideas and evidence in a sensible way; nevertheless the end result feels a bit scattered, probably mostly because the topics covered range so widely. It seemed to me (a more careful reader might produce a more accurate summary) the book's central ideas were:1. The human brain is a melange of fairly separate parts.2. Many of the parts are quite sophisticated. For example interpreting the visual data of 3D objects under variable illumination is nearly impossible, yet the brain manages to do it with ease. 3. The procedure by which the human brain decides which course of action to take when different parts of the brain come to different conclusions is simple, straightforward, and effective. 4. Almost all the operation of the human brain is ""automatic"" in the sense that it's not available to reflection/consciousness at all no matter what. 5. The operation and sophistication of each subsystem of the brain can be directly explained by evolution, typically with reference to the way humans lived in hunter-gatherer groups five thousand years ago. (Here I have a quibble, as the book just _assumes_ without evidence that human biological evolution has pretty much stopped.)6. Ideas that fit well into any one of these subsystems tend to take over, resulting in what we call ""cultural evolution"". (Or to put it in cruder words, there's something to the ""cultural meme"" hypothesis)7. Many of our most cherished things (for example ""cheesecake"") are in fact hacks that exploit some sort of quirk in each of several different brain parts. 8. Our taste for aesthetic/artistic things does _not_ indicate some sort of higher level of consciousness, _nor_ is it the ""purpose"" of life. Rather, it arises simply as an unintended side effect of the way the human brain is organized. (It may also arise from the evolutionary results of pressure to reproduce.)(Interestingly, the idea that -compared to ""reasoned"" responses- ""emotional"" responses that come out of a human brain are ""heuristic shortcuts"" that are much much faster and right often enough to be useful, is most definitely _not_ among those used by the book. The book doesn't ""disgree"" with this idea; a better description is the book simply ""ignores"" it, presenting its case without recourse one way or the other to this idea.)A fair amount of evidence from the results of experiments is presented to support these ideas. At the same time, an implicit case is made that these ideas make sense when taken _all_together_, that they support each other ...a lot. Much of the research stems from a rather small group of investigators. The _possibility_ that putting these ideas together is in fact revolutionary and is not yet generally accepted even by many academics is not discussed at all. The book provides a good overview of an entire subject area at a level deeper than a journalistic article but not nearly as deep as the original scientific papers; a little deeper even than Scientific American (and much longer:-), but not so arcane it feels like reading a graduate level textbook."
413,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419307-rachel,4,"Whew! This has been on my to-read list for years, and I've been trying to read it for months, but people keep recalling it from the library. At nearly 600 pithy pages, this book is more than worthwhile despite its age -- now 20 years old! My primary takeaway from reading this was learning how to frame each of our human traits in the context of evolution (natural selection). The ""computational theory of mind"" fits neatly with the pressures of natural selection, evolving us as beings highly adapted to solving problems of survival as foraging peoples. It is fascinating to look at traits not obviously related to survival problems (love, religion, music), although you have to wait until the very end for these juicy tidbits. I do have some criticisms of the book. One is that you really have to slog through some theory before getting to the meat of the book, and I could see a lot of people abandoning the book in the first 100 pages due to this unnecessarily detailed discussion. Another is that Pinker gives outsize focus to the subjects he is seemingly most expert in, like vision, but cultural aspects like music get tacked on at the end in a very superficial way. Also, leaving out the language component simply because he already wrote about it in another book is a pretty big flaw in this one.As a musician, I found the section on music to be woefully lacking, with many of the statements highly objectionable. For example: ""Many movies and television shows literally orchestrate the viewer's emotions from beginning to end with quasi-musical arrangements. They have no real rhythm, melody, or grouping."" Grouping? Does he mean form? Any undergraduate music student could tell you that movie scores consist not only of rhythm and melody, but of form on multiple levels. Pinker goes on to refer to the ""Jaws"" and ""Mission Impossible"" scores as ""pseudo-music."" If the Mission Impossible theme isn't music, I don't know what is! Also, although I enjoyed the discussion of the overtone series, he accepts Schenker as an inherent fact of music rather than a Western construct. He uses the word ""perhaps"" about twice per paragraph in this section, a clear indication that he's going out on a limb when trying to write on this subject. It made me question what specialists in the other fields think about the sections on visual arts, emotion, etc.Finally, I have to take issue with the statements about women and the treatment of gender roles in this book. No matter how many times or how elegantly Pinker qualified his statements as not being what is ""good,"" simply what natural selection has evolved, I could have used a much more nuanced discussion about this in a contemporary context rather than defaulting to referring to the mother as the one responsible for raising the young. Also, where is the discussion of homosexuality and nontraditional family structures? I get that this is probably outside of the scope of this book, but the way these subjects were treated sometimes felt so backwards that it was hard to swallow.But still, read it."
414,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,3,"In this book, Steven Pinker describes our mind - more precisely: our mental faculties - as a complex set of algorithms, sculpted by natural selection. Pinker uses two theories - the computational theory of mind and the theory of evolution by natural selection - to accomplish this amazing feat.According to the computational theory of mind, our mental organs are composed of algorithms, built up out of simpler subroutines which are in turn built up out of subsubroutines. This goes all the way down to the most basic, simplest algorithms that are digital: yes/no, on/off, etc. What it means, in essence, is that we come equipped with pre-programmed mental software with which we perceive the world. This software works is based on certain assumptions - based on the stability and the continuity of physical laws - and it's in the moments that the assumptions don't hold that we are tricked or fooled by our own mind (i.e. cognitive illusions).The other building block of Pinkers story is evolution by natural selection. Evolution shaped all the organisms on this planet, including us. Homo sapiens is unique in its mental capabilities, even though our mind is just one way to solve the natural problems (some others being strong, quick, etc.). I think the theory of evolution by natural selection has been described by excellent writers such as Dawkins, Dennett, Ridley and Zimmer (not to mention Darwin himself, even though his theory of inheritence was flawed), so I will not dwell on it here.Now to Pinkers main thesis: to understand our mind, we have to reverse-engineer our mental organs. In other words: for every psychological trait or phenomenon we have to ask the question 'what was its adaptive function in our ancestors' environment?' It is precisely this question that cuts deep through the delusional paradigms of modern day academicians and intellectuals. The mantra is ""culture determines who we are"". In other words: men rape because they are raised in a culture that's hostile to women. Instead of letting ideology guide science, Pinker approaches the problem from a scientific viewpoint: first describing the facts, then using the simplest theory as possible to explain the data and after this making moral statements. Some examples:In the chapter on Family Values, Pinker tackles the conflicts of interests between parents and offspring, husbands and wives, men and women in general and siblings. He explains these conflicts in terms of different evolutionary strategies between men and women. It pays for men to seek out sex as much as possible; it pays for women to be very selective who to mate with. This is a biological truth that even feminists and neo-marxists/blank slaters can't deny. This fundamental difference leads to competition between men for sexual access to women and to the pursuit of looking young and fertile (i.e. beautiful) between women. One of the most overlooked facts that Pinker mentions in this chapter is that a lot of the incentives for war, rape and murder are sexual motives. Maybe the men joining the army are not so crazy after all: throughout history, one of the most important rewards of victorious armies has been the genocide of men and kids and the mass rape of women. Pinkers paradigm offers new insights into our urge for agression.But this is not all, Pinkers paradigm also offers new insights into our urge to have friends and seek out honest reputations. Evolutionary speaking, it paid to cooperate. The only problem is that this presupposes cheater-detection mechanisms, which are prone to be exploited. One of the most important parts of our social life is the earning of an honest reputation; this shows others that you are a reliable cooperator. A third interesting aspect was the chapter on vision. Pinker analyzes the geometry of paintings and other visual art forms. One of the common threads is the presence of open landscapes with a broad horizon and some places of shelter. This was the environment our ancestors evolved in, it explains our like for these sorts of paintings and surroundings and our dislike for thick forests and deserts. A fourth insight is the way how our ideas are formed. We come equipped with mental software to perceive the world - including the other minds in this world - and to make decisions. These algorithms are heuristic in nature. In other words: they are based on assumptions that normally held in our ancestors' environment. Sometimes we encounter situations where these assumptions don't hold and we fall prey to cognitive illusions. For example, it is commonly known that the frame in which a logical problem is placed determines the effectivity of our judgments.A final important subject to note is the function of our emotions. Our emotions guide are actions, they are the incentives that lead us to chase pleasure and avoid pain. The objects of pleasure and pain are goals, set by evolution. We enjoy sex because organisms (i.e. our ancestors) that enjoyed sex had more sex and thereby had more offspring than organisms that didn't enjoy sex. We enjoy certain foods because our ancestors enjoyed those foods - and those that didn't had less offspring. In a sense, Hume was right when he wrote ""reason is the slave of our passions."" Our passions motive us to seek out the things we enjoy and avoid the things we hate. To summarize: Pinker tries to show that by looking at our psychology as mental organs, consisting of algorithms, that were sculpted by natural selection in the past eons, we have a new paradigm to understand our mind. A paradigm based on two of the most accepted theories in science and one that excludes ideology. Only a realistic understanding of our mental constitution can lead us to appreciate what is good and what should be changed for the better. An informed ethics presupposes evolutionary psychology. Even though I completely agree with Pinker's message and am interested in evolutionary psychology, I can't really recommend this book to laypeople. It would be better, before reading How the Mind Works, to school yourself in evolutionary biology and psychology, because Pinker's style of explaining is not for the faint hearted; he makes use of many terms that presuppose a lot of prior knowledge about the subjects involved. And a thing that annoyed me is the sheer mass of this book: 660 pages. Some chapters contained 90+ pages, which is way too long (in my opinion). But I should not end this review on a sour note, this was a pleasant read and value the various insights I gained from this.On a sidenote: Pinker's treatment of free will and consciousness is confusing. On the one hand, he makes valuable distinctions. So when he deals with consciousness, he makes a distinction between self knowledge, access to information and sentience and explains that the first to senses are in theory explainable by science. This is helpful. On the other hand, Pinker offers no route to answers himself and seems to retreat in a very un-academic mindset with regard to these topics. So in the example of consciousness, even though the first two aforementioned senses are explainable in scientific terms, sentience is not. Even stronger: our mind has been shaped by natural selection to deal with everyday problems and situations, offering the solution to the riddle of sentience not being one of them. In other words: the problem of consciousness is unsolvable in principle and we should not waste any more intellectual effort on this futile search. A very un-scientific mindset. (In 1542 people thought the earth was the centre of the cosmos; in 1543 Copernicus showed the earth to be just another mass of iron orbiting the sun; in the 20th century we discovered that even our sun is not so special: we live in an increasingly expanding universe in which we are just a temporary spec of dust)."
415,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6149613-marcus,3,"As so often is the case with popular science books I’m picking up, I feel that any attempt to review this volume must be done from two different perspectives – literary and in terms of content.If we start with the literary experience, I’ll put it plainly – it was far more difficult read than it had to be and the blame for it rests squarely on the shoulders of the author and the editor. When a book is titled ‘How the mind works’, it shouldn’t come as a big surprise that the reader expects some sort of introduction to the topic defined on the cover. Professor Pinker decided however that the best way to start his book was by launching a vigorous defense of his position on the topic, without really stating what that position is. Next, just to make things even more confusing, he continues with another defense speech, this time around regarding validity of Darwin’s theory of evolution. This ‘introduction’ to the topic at hand takes up about one fifth of the book. I have to admit that while struggling through it I mostly wondered when, if ever, we’re going to get to the actual ‘human mind’ part.Well, we did get there… eventually. The ‘good stuff’ starts off with a discussion about brain and how it (possibly) works on most basic neural level. Next the discussion moves on to sight and its absolutely central role in functionality of human brain and therefore also human mind. And then the course of discussion makes a rapid final change of course and we embark on a guided trip through different aspects of human mind, or in my opinion at least, human behavior. This final part of the book does indeed feel more like a guided tour than deep and meaningful discussion and to be perfectly honest, most of the time left me quite unsatisfied.Content-wise, I suspect that whether or not this book will be to a reader’s liking will depend on one single thing – degree of acceptance of the claim that computational theory of mind is the correct one. The author is one of main advocates of this theory and this volume, once all the unnecessary tangents are peeled of, is nothing more than presentation of its fundamental concepts.Personally I found this book to be a bag of mixed blessings. Perhaps half of it was simply fascinating – I don't necessarily agree with all of the ideas presented by the author, but as long as he stuck to the actual 'explanation', I found it both informative and thought provoking. I was far less impressed by his tangential rants, which in my opinion fail to serve any purpose in a popular science book intended for general public."
416,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64785453-andrei-khrapavitski,4,"Twenty years have passed since this book was originally published in 1997. And this is still a worthy read for anyone interested in human psychology. Steven Pinker, IMHO, is one of the best science authors of the past decades. His book ""The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined"" is one of my all-time favorites. ""The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature"" is also a brilliant book I often recommend. ""How the Mind Works"" would rank lower on the list of my recommendations simply because the pace of neuroscientific discoveries has accelerated in the last 20 years, and this book, given its magisterial title, lacks discussion of what we have learnt in recent years, for instance, through functional magnetic resonance imaging, etc. For that, please, refer to a truly profound ""Behave"" by Robert Sapolsky, published in 2017. ""How the Mind Works"" focuses quite a lot on human behavior, but Pinker develops this topic in his following books in a much greater detail. Still Pinker packs a lot in this volume. And this will surely be of interest to a lot of people eager for his brilliant style of writing and wit. Read this book if you want to learn about a computational theory of mind, which is still a solid view, not without criticism, on how our brain functions, positing that it is an information processing system, and thinking can be compared to computing. Pinker covers a few other alternative theories, too. I found really fascinating this book's insights on why we like certain art, music, entertainment, colors and music. It is much more rudimentary than most people imagine and is connected quite a lot to whether our vision or hearing processing can cling to some straightforward geometry or sounds. When it was published, it was met with both praise and criticism. Pinker has responded to some of it in ""the Blank Slate,"" which is a great follow-up and, as I mentioned, a perfect read by its own merit. However, if you have time for just one Pinker's book, ""Better Angels"" is his masterpiece. Really looking forward to his next book ""Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress"" due out on February 27, 2018."
417,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68837787-mart,5,"If you are looking for a neurobiology book which would explain how electric impulses and neurotransmitters become thoughts, this is not what you are after. Pinker presents a comprehensive and well documented series of theories, studies, experiments, reasonings and proposals and uses them to build a fully evolutionary view on the psychology of our species. His explanations are grounded on scientific and neurobiological information, in the sense that he takes them into account and doesn’t contradict them, but they work on the psychological level. As a matter of fact, he states that this book is purported to explain how the mind works and not how the brain works. I wouldn’t say though that this is a book recommended for people who are not familiar with the theory of evolution and its contemporary understanding. The book refers to other findings and scientists and employs concepts which in lack of some deeper background in the subject may sound loose or needing specific proof. The style may seem vague or giving things for granted for people who are not familiar with the field and its regular set of internally undisputed facts. All things said, Pinker provides a comprehensive list of notes where all his statements and experiment summaries are linked to a reference or more detailed explanation. This makes the style easier to follow, as he is discussing complex issues which need a lot of focus. The book does take a lot of time to rebuke very common misconceptions about the theory of evolution which would undermine a proper comprehension of its content. This could be seen as useful or as useless, depending on whether the reader needs ir or not. I believe the biggest advantage of this book is that it presents a totally coherent, well researched and thoroughly documented explanation of what we do scientifically know about our minds. If this is what you are looking for and you already know a little bit of evolution, ethology and psychology, you will find it here. Everything that is just a proposal is presented as such, and what is unknown is claimed to be so as well, so you won’t be lured into believing every speculation. "
418,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1038815-jc,3,"I don't think this is Pinker's best work, even if it was a best seller and a Pulitzer Prize finalist (so whad-do I know??). My complaints are, I admit, picky. A major work on a complex and broad topic like this needs a a couple of things: a meaningful introduction or opening chapter (his short preface does not suffice) laying out the book's goals and major themes; on the other end, some sort of afterword bringing together the themes into a coherent thesis. Getting to the meat of the book, I did not feel that most of the first chapter was necessary. Chap. 1 kind of wandered, in parts bordered on incoherent, and sometimes seemed to be part of a different work altogether. Again, maybe a serious introduction, final tie-it-all-together chapter, or an afterword may have explained how Chap. 1 fit in. This is significant as the opening chapter (mostly dealing with A.I.) takes up more than 10% of the book. I actually felt that in the opening chapter he strongly contradicted some of his major themes in the rest of the book. However, once I finished schlogging through that, I found most of the rest of the book fascinating (if still in need of some minor editing). The only theme that carried through from chap. 1 to the end was ""reverse engineering,"" and I found both his definition and use of the phrase to be weak. I have heard Pinker lecture more than once, and like much of his other writing (and look forward to his next work, ""Enlightenment Now,"" due out in Feb. 2018), so I don't mean this as a knock on Pinker, his views, or his public output. However, I think here he was trying to do a bit too much in one volume, and kind of stumbled over himself a bit. [it WAS good enough that I did read it all, but I think he has presented the science, and his interpretations of that science, better elsewhere]"
419,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70100482-zo,4,"I probably would give this 5-stars if I hadn’t encountered many of the ideas it discusses already, but there still was a lot I had not considered or new ways of presenting things that made them worthwhile. I found the section on vision/perception fairly boring, but other than that Pinker consistently found interesting ways to discuss the mechanisms of human behavior. It’s one of those books that covers so much that I don’t have any specific strong takeaways, but I am most interested in the idea that some of these explanations which seemed so solid at the time have since been revised by new discoveries (though I’m having trouble remembering what theory comes before what / what is “actually” right on some Q’s). Particularly as I’m almost done with Henrich’s book right now I am very interested in the way he revises many of Pinker’s claims, and how definitive/testable Henrich’s revisions are (for some of them I’m also not sure how much he actually differs). I think generally Pinker’s explanation of feelings and social behavior are most accurate, but his explanation of “higher” human callings, while certainly providing part of the answers, still seems lacking (or maybe that’s just wishful thinking). Also interested in reading how Miller’s book revises some of the survival-based explanations Pinker offers. Curiously, I did find myself at times descending into nihilism about what to do with the knowledge Pinker offers, and the semi-determinist conclusions they provide about human behavior. I’m not sure if that is a product of current mental states, simply having read too much of this stuff recently, or something about the way Pinker presents it, but it at least got me thinking productively about how to integrate these explanations into moral philosophy debates. Look forward to more Pinker in the future."

This was due in part to this one book having more width and depth than all the psychology courses I took at university put together. I almost wish that I had skipped Uni and read this instead, but then again I doubt I would have understood this book without the basic grounding their courses kindly provided.A rare mixture of luminous thinking and clear writing is how I would summarise this book.I'm not really feeling in a mood to be verbose about psychology and philosophy today so you're going to have to be content with this.If you want more then scan through my 'reading progress' notes - they give more detail."

Even if you don't believe in evolution (which I'm still not sure I do) this book gives AMAZING insights into everything we do as humans, from emotions to relationships to our appreciation for art and humor... and explains how the process of evolution shaped it all. A hard read (read it with a pen and make notes in the margins), but absolutely mind-blowing.I especially love how he illustrates heavy academic material with easily accessible examples from pop culture. While you DO need to have a, you know, 'mind that really works' to read this book, you do NOT need any kind of previous scientific training or understanding to grasp the concepts."

Today I decided to abandon it, even though I was already at the last chapter.Very interesting topic, but the book gets really obsessively detailed and repetitive at times. While Pinker have a way of explaining things, I am just frustrated that none of the things he explains have actual hard evidence backing it. It is fine to be able to come up with a seemingly logical explanation for certain human behaviour, but the lack of real evidence just don't cut it for me."
423,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826775-a-reader,3,"I liked the book, i think it is an intellectually stimulating piece of work. My main objection is Pinker's notion that behaviour is adapted to a Stone Age way of life and cannot cope wery well with the modernity of Space Age world.'Our brains', he writes, 'are not wired to cope with anonymous crowds, schooling, written language, governments, police, courts, armies, modern medicine, formal social institutions, high technology, and other newcomers to the human experience.'

440,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/662191-noreen,5,"COMPUTATIONAL THEORY OF MINDJust before reading this, I read a rambling, anecdotal, autobiographical mess that purports to be a science book. When I pick up a science book, I expect a clear statement of the main argument and a straightforward, organized presentation of evidence. I would think that to be a good scientist one would need clear thinking skills and a good grasp of logic, and an ability to express that clarity in writing. Just a few pages into this book I knew I would not be disappointed. I suspected that by the end I would know very little about Steven Pinker and a lot about the mind. Reading this before reading Tooby and Cosmides is probably like reading Dawkins before Darwin. But that worked for me, because the later writer interpreted the former so well that it increased my understanding of the underlying principles. I have bookmarked evolutionary psychology material by Tooby and Cosmides to read later.Though this book is written for the non-scientist, nothing here is condescending or glib. When he uses a term, he states which definition he is using. I really appreciate these efforts. This book is filled with the most complex and esoteric ideas, yet it was a pleasure and a joy to read.""The idea that parents shape their children is so ingrained that most people don't even realize it is a testable hypothesis and not a self-evident truth."" What I found truly striking is that many common beliefs about social science are just plain wrong. We base public policy on them, but the evidence doesn't bear them out. One is that parents have a lot of influence on their children's personalities. Evolutionary biology predicts they have very little influence, and studies confirm it. But it's not a popular idea in our society. We want to think we have influence over our children. We also want someone to blame when children go bad. So the myth persists.""It's not that the claim that there is an interaction between innate structure and learning (or between heredity and environment, nature and nurture, biology and culture) is literally wrong. Rather, it falls into the category of ideas that are so bad they are not even wrong."" ""Evolution and learning can also go on simultaneously, with innate structure evolving in an animal that also learns.""I just finished the first chapter. Wow. He begins with the robot challenge, demonstrating just how difficult it is to mechanically replicate even the simplest things people do. He describes the problem of understanding human vision as the difference between what information our eyes gather as contrasted with what our brains interpret. (I ""see"" things differently after reading this part.) He shows how what we consider ""common sense"" is far beyond the ability of any robot we've constructed so far. There are revolutionary arguments here, and some inflammatory statements. No wonder he's controversial. He discredits a lot of popular concepts in psychiatry and psychology. He talks about ""modules,"" but not in the simplistic structure/function way you might expect. He says our minds are produced by natural selection, but that doesn't mean we are limited to our biological drives. We have ""a complex mind that is designed to mesh with what is in nature.""He argues against the popular notions of biology or culture being causes of our behavior, saying, first, that the biology/culture dichotomy is a false one, and second, that it is used as an argument to abdicate personal responsibility. (He can't help it: he was born that way, or he ate too many Twinkies, or it was the system, or he was abused, etc.) Personal responsibility, however, would seem to require free will, whatever that is. Whether our decisions are based on random causes, intentional causes, or uncaused causes, free will remains a mystery.Most importantly, he portrays the brain as an information processor, saying information theory has revolutionized the study of neuroscience. Even with all the analogies, I'm having trouble grasping idea of the computational theory of mind. What I can comprehend is that it's central to understanding consciousness and intelligence without resorting to a magical explanation. Using Dennett's analogy, the brain as a machine can be explained by breaking down complex processes into ever smaller tasks until even the most stupid homunculus, or demon, can do each of them. Then, put millions of these tiny steps together, and speed up the process, and intelligence results. (I think.) On the other hand, apparently sentience is simply is a construct of our consciousness and doesn't bear scientific examination. It's another mystery.He argues, quite effectively I think, against popular theories of mind such as associationism and connectionism, saying they are not alternatives of, but adjuncts to the computational theory of mind.The next argument is for the theory of natural selection, as if it needs defending. It turns out it does, and not just against creationists. He picks apart opposing arguments, such as macromutation and random drift. After carefully showing how the human brain could be the result of natural selection, and that humans, rather than being its pinnacle or ""goal"" (because it has no goals) are just another, different product, he goes into how and why humans differ from the other animals.Again he examines the complex ways we think and plan and he mentions the ""cognitive niche"" proposed by Toobey. He writes about the tracking ability of the modern hunter gatherers (!Kung) showing they use abstract thinking. It made me think about the claim by James Gleick in The Information that cognitive thought as we understand it could not exist prior to written language (a claim that one reviewer of that book said has been largely discredited). Pinker may have been one of those who discredited it, perhaps in The Language Instinct. However, I may be confusing ""abstract thought"" and ""cognitive thought."" I had this aha moment when I thought abstract thought is what people do without language, but cognitive thought is what happens when people put those thoughts into symbols (words) that can be expressed or communicated. Basically, I think cognitive thought is ""thinking about thinking."" I imagine this isn't an original idea. I probably just figured out for myself what cognitive science has known for decades.After some stuff about our understanding (or rather lack of it) regarding math and physics beyond that needed for survival, and some treatment of the language instinct, we arrive at what is a more interesting topic for me: emotions. The claims are that the triune brain theory (reptilian brain) is wrong and that emotions were essential to our survival and are not nonadaptive baggage. He says, ""intelligence is the pursuit of goals in the face of obstacles"" and ""emotions are mechanisms that set the brain's highest level goals.""While reading the section of chapter 6 on food taboos, I kept seeing parallels with religion. Disgust at certain foods is grounded in avoidance of poisons, yet it differs between cultures and is mostly irrational. Children up to two years old will put almost anything in their mouths. They learn from their parents what is disgusting and they pass that knowledge on to their children. Many food taboos are religious, and the principle can easily be expanded to other religious beliefs and practices.One thing I take issue with is that he keeps using wording that hints at teleology. He says, ""'selfish' means 'acting in ways that make one's own replication more likely.'"" I would word this more passively, something like, ""'selfish' means being able to live long enough to replicate, having inherited the characteristics that allowed one's parents to survive long enough to replicate.""The section headed ""The Doomsday Machine"" is particularly interesting. It's about emotions, especially those of honor and vengeance, and the advertising of them by facial expressions. It's about the genuineness of those expressions, which Pinker says is evidenced by the fact that they are handcuffed to our involuntarily physical processes (and therefore maybe the triune brain theory does have validity). There is much speculation here, but it's food for thought.And here's a thought: that grief is a useless emotion unexplainable except as a doomsday machine (to ensure people have an interest in protecting people they love).Cheesecake, pornography, and the arts.I found the honesty of the last chapter refreshing. Pinker says it like it is -- that the arts are not biologically adaptive; that they are shortcuts we created to excite the pleasure circuits of the brain that ordinarily would be stimulated by activities that increase fitness. That view is unpopular today. People don't want to admit that art, like fashion, is a matter of status. People who have the wealth and leisure time to spend lots of resources on the arts want to justify their obsession. They're influential people, which might explain why popular culture (and some science writers) indulge that wish. The book I mentioned at the outset of this review is one such treatment. The author, who is admittedly obsessed with music, argues that music is not just ""auditory cheesecake""; that it is biologically adaptive. Now I know why I felt it was such a waste of time. When my book group discussed it, a member told us that he has taught himself to appreciate Schönberg by repeatedly listening to recordings of his work, to his wife's annoyance. (I heard a Schönberg piece at a symphony performance, and once was enough for a lifetime.) I don't feel any need to pretend to like something to impress anyone. I can't think of any other reason one would do it, especially now that I've read Pinker. Humans do other biologically functionless activities. The intellect itself may be nonadaptive. Religion and philosophy. Psychology. I'm sure the irony is not lost on Pinker that his own education and profession fall under this umbrella. He doesn't denigrate these activities; he just says evolutionary biology doesn't explain them."
441,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8173124-george-marshall,4,"I very much enjoyed the book. The topic is more ""Why The Mind Works"", and with that being the author's actual stated aim, the book seems misnamed. The author is making a case for seeing the mind as an evolved consortium of mental modules. Much of the thought in the book is not necessarily his own - the book is abounding with quotations, some in defense, some to rail against. The quotes, frankly, are frequently more interesting than the surrounding detail. He even points out early on that he is not adding new information, but seeking to bring it together in a readable form. Despite, he balances things fairly well and brings a coherent whole out of it.Pinker is a little full of himself. He can be dismissive. He will mine the sources for whatever can be used in support of his point, even if the authors themselves disagree with him, sometimes pointedly. One example of his unique way of handling other viewpoints stuck out to me:""When I mentioned the theory of parent-offspring conflict to console a colleague whose two-year-old son had become a pest after the birth of a younger brother he snapped. ""All you're saying is that people are selfish!"" Sleepless for weeks, he could be forgiven for missing the point. Clearly, parents aren't selfish; parents are the least selfish entities in the known universe. But they aren't infinitely selfless either..."" (p.442)To which one can only remark that while studying psychology and the mind, Pinker had forgotten or ignored the example of Job and his rather unhelpful set of friends. He had been a terrible friend and/or colleague, offering up his ""wisdom"" in place of the sympathy requested. I chuckle, though I am probably as bad at times, but he seems unaware of how pompous this recounting makes him appear. ""He could be forgiven..."" The temerity! Ah, well.But back to the point, he is usually successful in making his point. He presents a pretty compelling case for how many of the modules we see at work in the mind could have been ""designed"" through adaptive means. But in a number of instances he ends by simply spitting out a multitude of possibilities to answer the open question. This he does while maintaining the certitude that adaptive means can account for all we could want to know about the inner workings of the mind.Until it isn't. With music, specifically, he seems to get into weeds, giving all manner of technical details of harmonics and such, as if, lacking a good argument for how we adapted a sense for the pleasures of music, he might bore the reader into acceptance through fine print. In the end, music in his opinion is non-adaptive, ""cheesecake"" in his words - a pleasureful cocktail that plays off of the other modules, but was not itself selected for. At least he admits the picture he paints of our musical inclinations is ""speculative"".Of course a book that tries to treat the whole of the human mind and its development will have to address the subject of religion and our propensity towards it. Pinker comes off derisively, from the introduction to the bitter end, but most of the time it did not distract from the meat of what was being said. While arrogant, he is as dismissive of religious practitioners as he is of feminists unable to square their moral convictions with the reality of the evolved nature of our minds (for good or bad!). Though, he does apologize - backhandedly - to the feminists:""I wish I could have discussed the evolutionary psychology of sexuality without the asides about feminist theory, but in today's intellectual climate that is impossible...These kinds of arguments combine bad biology (nature is nice), bad psychology (the mind is created by society), and bad ethics (what people like is good). Feminism would lose nothing by giving them up."" (pp.492-3)The book naturally flows from the fundamental modules until it reaches the point where one is not sure what is adaptation and what is the working of culture with the framework it has been given. In turn he discusses vision, body adaptation, language, logic (of a sort), probability (especially in the sense of cheat sensing), mating and reproduction, friendship, and onto arts and literature.Getting to the big question of sentience, he spends very little time in throwing out a ""we can't know"", as if that is somehow better than the answers he dismisses so quickly and easily. An unsatisfying ending. But this does not overcome the mountain of enjoyed reading that makes up the book."
442,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57079482-chuck-kollars,3,"This book is quite long, and glancingly touches on a very wide variety of topics. Even such an abstruse question as why the art of painting might have more appeal to social elites is discussed a little. This variety shouldn't though obscure the fact that some very basic views about human thinking provide the main focus of the book and tie it all together. The author clearly made a mighty attempt to organize the mass of ideas and evidence in a sensible way; nevertheless the end result feels a bit scattered, probably mostly because the topics covered range so widely. It seemed to me (a more careful reader might produce a more accurate summary) the book's central ideas were:1. The human brain is a melange of fairly separate parts.2. Many of the parts are quite sophisticated. For example interpreting the visual data of 3D objects under variable illumination is nearly impossible, yet the brain manages to do it with ease. 3. The procedure by which the human brain decides which course of action to take when different parts of the brain come to different conclusions is simple, straightforward, and effective. 4. Almost all the operation of the human brain is ""automatic"" in the sense that it's not available to reflection/consciousness at all no matter what. 5. The operation and sophistication of each subsystem of the brain can be directly explained by evolution, typically with reference to the way humans lived in hunter-gatherer groups five thousand years ago. (Here I have a quibble, as the book just _assumes_ without evidence that human biological evolution has pretty much stopped.)6. Ideas that fit well into any one of these subsystems tend to take over, resulting in what we call ""cultural evolution"". (Or to put it in cruder words, there's something to the ""cultural meme"" hypothesis)7. Many of our most cherished things (for example ""cheesecake"") are in fact hacks that exploit some sort of quirk in each of several different brain parts. 8. Our taste for aesthetic/artistic things does _not_ indicate some sort of higher level of consciousness, _nor_ is it the ""purpose"" of life. Rather, it arises simply as an unintended side effect of the way the human brain is organized. (It may also arise from the evolutionary results of pressure to reproduce.)(Interestingly, the idea that -compared to ""reasoned"" responses- ""emotional"" responses that come out of a human brain are ""heuristic shortcuts"" that are much much faster and right often enough to be useful, is most definitely _not_ among those used by the book. The book doesn't ""disgree"" with this idea; a better description is the book simply ""ignores"" it, presenting its case without recourse one way or the other to this idea.)A fair amount of evidence from the results of experiments is presented to support these ideas. At the same time, an implicit case is made that these ideas make sense when taken _all_together_, that they support each other ...a lot. Much of the research stems from a rather small group of investigators. The _possibility_ that putting these ideas together is in fact revolutionary and is not yet generally accepted even by many academics is not discussed at all. The book provides a good overview of an entire subject area at a level deeper than a journalistic article but not nearly as deep as the original scientific papers; a little deeper even than Scientific American (and much longer:-), but not so arcane it feels like reading a graduate level textbook."
443,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419307-rachel,4,"Whew! This has been on my to-read list for years, and I've been trying to read it for months, but people keep recalling it from the library. At nearly 600 pithy pages, this book is more than worthwhile despite its age -- now 20 years old! My primary takeaway from reading this was learning how to frame each of our human traits in the context of evolution (natural selection). The ""computational theory of mind"" fits neatly with the pressures of natural selection, evolving us as beings highly adapted to solving problems of survival as foraging peoples. It is fascinating to look at traits not obviously related to survival problems (love, religion, music), although you have to wait until the very end for these juicy tidbits. I do have some criticisms of the book. One is that you really have to slog through some theory before getting to the meat of the book, and I could see a lot of people abandoning the book in the first 100 pages due to this unnecessarily detailed discussion. Another is that Pinker gives outsize focus to the subjects he is seemingly most expert in, like vision, but cultural aspects like music get tacked on at the end in a very superficial way. Also, leaving out the language component simply because he already wrote about it in another book is a pretty big flaw in this one.As a musician, I found the section on music to be woefully lacking, with many of the statements highly objectionable. For example: ""Many movies and television shows literally orchestrate the viewer's emotions from beginning to end with quasi-musical arrangements. They have no real rhythm, melody, or grouping."" Grouping? Does he mean form? Any undergraduate music student could tell you that movie scores consist not only of rhythm and melody, but of form on multiple levels. Pinker goes on to refer to the ""Jaws"" and ""Mission Impossible"" scores as ""pseudo-music."" If the Mission Impossible theme isn't music, I don't know what is! Also, although I enjoyed the discussion of the overtone series, he accepts Schenker as an inherent fact of music rather than a Western construct. He uses the word ""perhaps"" about twice per paragraph in this section, a clear indication that he's going out on a limb when trying to write on this subject. It made me question what specialists in the other fields think about the sections on visual arts, emotion, etc.Finally, I have to take issue with the statements about women and the treatment of gender roles in this book. No matter how many times or how elegantly Pinker qualified his statements as not being what is ""good,"" simply what natural selection has evolved, I could have used a much more nuanced discussion about this in a contemporary context rather than defaulting to referring to the mother as the one responsible for raising the young. Also, where is the discussion of homosexuality and nontraditional family structures? I get that this is probably outside of the scope of this book, but the way these subjects were treated sometimes felt so backwards that it was hard to swallow.But still, read it."
444,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,3,"In this book, Steven Pinker describes our mind - more precisely: our mental faculties - as a complex set of algorithms, sculpted by natural selection. Pinker uses two theories - the computational theory of mind and the theory of evolution by natural selection - to accomplish this amazing feat.According to the computational theory of mind, our mental organs are composed of algorithms, built up out of simpler subroutines which are in turn built up out of subsubroutines. This goes all the way down to the most basic, simplest algorithms that are digital: yes/no, on/off, etc. What it means, in essence, is that we come equipped with pre-programmed mental software with which we perceive the world. This software works is based on certain assumptions - based on the stability and the continuity of physical laws - and it's in the moments that the assumptions don't hold that we are tricked or fooled by our own mind (i.e. cognitive illusions).The other building block of Pinkers story is evolution by natural selection. Evolution shaped all the organisms on this planet, including us. Homo sapiens is unique in its mental capabilities, even though our mind is just one way to solve the natural problems (some others being strong, quick, etc.). I think the theory of evolution by natural selection has been described by excellent writers such as Dawkins, Dennett, Ridley and Zimmer (not to mention Darwin himself, even though his theory of inheritence was flawed), so I will not dwell on it here.Now to Pinkers main thesis: to understand our mind, we have to reverse-engineer our mental organs. In other words: for every psychological trait or phenomenon we have to ask the question 'what was its adaptive function in our ancestors' environment?' It is precisely this question that cuts deep through the delusional paradigms of modern day academicians and intellectuals. The mantra is ""culture determines who we are"". In other words: men rape because they are raised in a culture that's hostile to women. Instead of letting ideology guide science, Pinker approaches the problem from a scientific viewpoint: first describing the facts, then using the simplest theory as possible to explain the data and after this making moral statements. Some examples:In the chapter on Family Values, Pinker tackles the conflicts of interests between parents and offspring, husbands and wives, men and women in general and siblings. He explains these conflicts in terms of different evolutionary strategies between men and women. It pays for men to seek out sex as much as possible; it pays for women to be very selective who to mate with. This is a biological truth that even feminists and neo-marxists/blank slaters can't deny. This fundamental difference leads to competition between men for sexual access to women and to the pursuit of looking young and fertile (i.e. beautiful) between women. One of the most overlooked facts that Pinker mentions in this chapter is that a lot of the incentives for war, rape and murder are sexual motives. Maybe the men joining the army are not so crazy after all: throughout history, one of the most important rewards of victorious armies has been the genocide of men and kids and the mass rape of women. Pinkers paradigm offers new insights into our urge for agression.But this is not all, Pinkers paradigm also offers new insights into our urge to have friends and seek out honest reputations. Evolutionary speaking, it paid to cooperate. The only problem is that this presupposes cheater-detection mechanisms, which are prone to be exploited. One of the most important parts of our social life is the earning of an honest reputation; this shows others that you are a reliable cooperator. A third interesting aspect was the chapter on vision. Pinker analyzes the geometry of paintings and other visual art forms. One of the common threads is the presence of open landscapes with a broad horizon and some places of shelter. This was the environment our ancestors evolved in, it explains our like for these sorts of paintings and surroundings and our dislike for thick forests and deserts. A fourth insight is the way how our ideas are formed. We come equipped with mental software to perceive the world - including the other minds in this world - and to make decisions. These algorithms are heuristic in nature. In other words: they are based on assumptions that normally held in our ancestors' environment. Sometimes we encounter situations where these assumptions don't hold and we fall prey to cognitive illusions. For example, it is commonly known that the frame in which a logical problem is placed determines the effectivity of our judgments.A final important subject to note is the function of our emotions. Our emotions guide are actions, they are the incentives that lead us to chase pleasure and avoid pain. The objects of pleasure and pain are goals, set by evolution. We enjoy sex because organisms (i.e. our ancestors) that enjoyed sex had more sex and thereby had more offspring than organisms that didn't enjoy sex. We enjoy certain foods because our ancestors enjoyed those foods - and those that didn't had less offspring. In a sense, Hume was right when he wrote ""reason is the slave of our passions."" Our passions motive us to seek out the things we enjoy and avoid the things we hate. To summarize: Pinker tries to show that by looking at our psychology as mental organs, consisting of algorithms, that were sculpted by natural selection in the past eons, we have a new paradigm to understand our mind. A paradigm based on two of the most accepted theories in science and one that excludes ideology. Only a realistic understanding of our mental constitution can lead us to appreciate what is good and what should be changed for the better. An informed ethics presupposes evolutionary psychology. Even though I completely agree with Pinker's message and am interested in evolutionary psychology, I can't really recommend this book to laypeople. It would be better, before reading How the Mind Works, to school yourself in evolutionary biology and psychology, because Pinker's style of explaining is not for the faint hearted; he makes use of many terms that presuppose a lot of prior knowledge about the subjects involved. And a thing that annoyed me is the sheer mass of this book: 660 pages. Some chapters contained 90+ pages, which is way too long (in my opinion). But I should not end this review on a sour note, this was a pleasant read and value the various insights I gained from this.On a sidenote: Pinker's treatment of free will and consciousness is confusing. On the one hand, he makes valuable distinctions. So when he deals with consciousness, he makes a distinction between self knowledge, access to information and sentience and explains that the first to senses are in theory explainable by science. This is helpful. On the other hand, Pinker offers no route to answers himself and seems to retreat in a very un-academic mindset with regard to these topics. So in the example of consciousness, even though the first two aforementioned senses are explainable in scientific terms, sentience is not. Even stronger: our mind has been shaped by natural selection to deal with everyday problems and situations, offering the solution to the riddle of sentience not being one of them. In other words: the problem of consciousness is unsolvable in principle and we should not waste any more intellectual effort on this futile search. A very un-scientific mindset. (In 1542 people thought the earth was the centre of the cosmos; in 1543 Copernicus showed the earth to be just another mass of iron orbiting the sun; in the 20th century we discovered that even our sun is not so special: we live in an increasingly expanding universe in which we are just a temporary spec of dust)."
445,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6149613-marcus,3,"As so often is the case with popular science books I’m picking up, I feel that any attempt to review this volume must be done from two different perspectives – literary and in terms of content.If we start with the literary experience, I’ll put it plainly – it was far more difficult read than it had to be and the blame for it rests squarely on the shoulders of the author and the editor. When a book is titled ‘How the mind works’, it shouldn’t come as a big surprise that the reader expects some sort of introduction to the topic defined on the cover. Professor Pinker decided however that the best way to start his book was by launching a vigorous defense of his position on the topic, without really stating what that position is. Next, just to make things even more confusing, he continues with another defense speech, this time around regarding validity of Darwin’s theory of evolution. This ‘introduction’ to the topic at hand takes up about one fifth of the book. I have to admit that while struggling through it I mostly wondered when, if ever, we’re going to get to the actual ‘human mind’ part.Well, we did get there… eventually. The ‘good stuff’ starts off with a discussion about brain and how it (possibly) works on most basic neural level. Next the discussion moves on to sight and its absolutely central role in functionality of human brain and therefore also human mind. And then the course of discussion makes a rapid final change of course and we embark on a guided trip through different aspects of human mind, or in my opinion at least, human behavior. This final part of the book does indeed feel more like a guided tour than deep and meaningful discussion and to be perfectly honest, most of the time left me quite unsatisfied.Content-wise, I suspect that whether or not this book will be to a reader’s liking will depend on one single thing – degree of acceptance of the claim that computational theory of mind is the correct one. The author is one of main advocates of this theory and this volume, once all the unnecessary tangents are peeled of, is nothing more than presentation of its fundamental concepts.Personally I found this book to be a bag of mixed blessings. Perhaps half of it was simply fascinating – I don't necessarily agree with all of the ideas presented by the author, but as long as he stuck to the actual 'explanation', I found it both informative and thought provoking. I was far less impressed by his tangential rants, which in my opinion fail to serve any purpose in a popular science book intended for general public."
446,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64785453-andrei-khrapavitski,4,"Twenty years have passed since this book was originally published in 1997. And this is still a worthy read for anyone interested in human psychology. Steven Pinker, IMHO, is one of the best science authors of the past decades. His book ""The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined"" is one of my all-time favorites. ""The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature"" is also a brilliant book I often recommend. ""How the Mind Works"" would rank lower on the list of my recommendations simply because the pace of neuroscientific discoveries has accelerated in the last 20 years, and this book, given its magisterial title, lacks discussion of what we have learnt in recent years, for instance, through functional magnetic resonance imaging, etc. For that, please, refer to a truly profound ""Behave"" by Robert Sapolsky, published in 2017. ""How the Mind Works"" focuses quite a lot on human behavior, but Pinker develops this topic in his following books in a much greater detail. Still Pinker packs a lot in this volume. And this will surely be of interest to a lot of people eager for his brilliant style of writing and wit. Read this book if you want to learn about a computational theory of mind, which is still a solid view, not without criticism, on how our brain functions, positing that it is an information processing system, and thinking can be compared to computing. Pinker covers a few other alternative theories, too. I found really fascinating this book's insights on why we like certain art, music, entertainment, colors and music. It is much more rudimentary than most people imagine and is connected quite a lot to whether our vision or hearing processing can cling to some straightforward geometry or sounds. When it was published, it was met with both praise and criticism. Pinker has responded to some of it in ""the Blank Slate,"" which is a great follow-up and, as I mentioned, a perfect read by its own merit. However, if you have time for just one Pinker's book, ""Better Angels"" is his masterpiece. Really looking forward to his next book ""Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress"" due out on February 27, 2018."
447,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68837787-mart,5,"If you are looking for a neurobiology book which would explain how electric impulses and neurotransmitters become thoughts, this is not what you are after. Pinker presents a comprehensive and well documented series of theories, studies, experiments, reasonings and proposals and uses them to build a fully evolutionary view on the psychology of our species. His explanations are grounded on scientific and neurobiological information, in the sense that he takes them into account and doesn’t contradict them, but they work on the psychological level. As a matter of fact, he states that this book is purported to explain how the mind works and not how the brain works. I wouldn’t say though that this is a book recommended for people who are not familiar with the theory of evolution and its contemporary understanding. The book refers to other findings and scientists and employs concepts which in lack of some deeper background in the subject may sound loose or needing specific proof. The style may seem vague or giving things for granted for people who are not familiar with the field and its regular set of internally undisputed facts. All things said, Pinker provides a comprehensive list of notes where all his statements and experiment summaries are linked to a reference or more detailed explanation. This makes the style easier to follow, as he is discussing complex issues which need a lot of focus. The book does take a lot of time to rebuke very common misconceptions about the theory of evolution which would undermine a proper comprehension of its content. This could be seen as useful or as useless, depending on whether the reader needs ir or not. I believe the biggest advantage of this book is that it presents a totally coherent, well researched and thoroughly documented explanation of what we do scientifically know about our minds. If this is what you are looking for and you already know a little bit of evolution, ethology and psychology, you will find it here. Everything that is just a proposal is presented as such, and what is unknown is claimed to be so as well, so you won’t be lured into believing every speculation. "
448,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1038815-jc,3,"I don't think this is Pinker's best work, even if it was a best seller and a Pulitzer Prize finalist (so whad-do I know??). My complaints are, I admit, picky. A major work on a complex and broad topic like this needs a a couple of things: a meaningful introduction or opening chapter (his short preface does not suffice) laying out the book's goals and major themes; on the other end, some sort of afterword bringing together the themes into a coherent thesis. Getting to the meat of the book, I did not feel that most of the first chapter was necessary. Chap. 1 kind of wandered, in parts bordered on incoherent, and sometimes seemed to be part of a different work altogether. Again, maybe a serious introduction, final tie-it-all-together chapter, or an afterword may have explained how Chap. 1 fit in. This is significant as the opening chapter (mostly dealing with A.I.) takes up more than 10% of the book. I actually felt that in the opening chapter he strongly contradicted some of his major themes in the rest of the book. However, once I finished schlogging through that, I found most of the rest of the book fascinating (if still in need of some minor editing). The only theme that carried through from chap. 1 to the end was ""reverse engineering,"" and I found both his definition and use of the phrase to be weak. I have heard Pinker lecture more than once, and like much of his other writing (and look forward to his next work, ""Enlightenment Now,"" due out in Feb. 2018), so I don't mean this as a knock on Pinker, his views, or his public output. However, I think here he was trying to do a bit too much in one volume, and kind of stumbled over himself a bit. [it WAS good enough that I did read it all, but I think he has presented the science, and his interpretations of that science, better elsewhere]"
449,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70100482-zo,4,"I probably would give this 5-stars if I hadn’t encountered many of the ideas it discusses already, but there still was a lot I had not considered or new ways of presenting things that made them worthwhile. I found the section on vision/perception fairly boring, but other than that Pinker consistently found interesting ways to discuss the mechanisms of human behavior. It’s one of those books that covers so much that I don’t have any specific strong takeaways, but I am most interested in the idea that some of these explanations which seemed so solid at the time have since been revised by new discoveries (though I’m having trouble remembering what theory comes before what / what is “actually” right on some Q’s). Particularly as I’m almost done with Henrich’s book right now I am very interested in the way he revises many of Pinker’s claims, and how definitive/testable Henrich’s revisions are (for some of them I’m also not sure how much he actually differs). I think generally Pinker’s explanation of feelings and social behavior are most accurate, but his explanation of “higher” human callings, while certainly providing part of the answers, still seems lacking (or maybe that’s just wishful thinking). Also interested in reading how Miller’s book revises some of the survival-based explanations Pinker offers. Curiously, I did find myself at times descending into nihilism about what to do with the knowledge Pinker offers, and the semi-determinist conclusions they provide about human behavior. I’m not sure if that is a product of current mental states, simply having read too much of this stuff recently, or something about the way Pinker presents it, but it at least got me thinking productively about how to integrate these explanations into moral philosophy debates. Look forward to more Pinker in the future."
450,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78846946-chris-hall,3,"A friend of mine gave me this book about ten years ago - only now have I got around to reading it.He raved over it - even going so far as to buy a second copy when he realised that he was unlikely to get back the one he leant me.Having finally read it, I'm not entirely sure why he was so keen on it. It isn't a bad book - it's just dull in places - despite Pinker's genuine efforts to make it otherwise. I suppose it's possible that I didn't get as much as I'd hoped out of it because my background meant I was already familiar with the concepts underlying Artificial Intelligence and natural language processing; if these areas are new to you then there's more to get out of the book.Some thoughts:(*) I was disappointed with Pinker's approach (or rather lack of approach) to transcendent consciousness. This had the potential to be the most interesting part of the book however he largely brushes it aside saying that not enough is known about it for it to be looked at seriously.(*) I don't think Pinker appreciates the extent of the plasticity of brain activity. If he had he may well have considered the existence of some sort of overarching control mechanism that oversees and manages it.(*) While he talks in depth about the mental processes involved in drawing conclusions about the world around us, he doesn't address the question of how it's known when a conclusion has been found."
451,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69405631-steve,4,"Whew! Pretty heavy-going in places. Parts philosophy, computer science and evolution all under the umbrella of cognitive psychology. I learned that the adaptive mutations of evolution produced the brain (neurons, etc) and that the mind (thinking, decision-making, creativity) is the product of the brain. An aha moment came for me when the book said autistic people are ""mind blind."" They perceive the sensory world and can operate in it but (generalizing here) don't understand the world of other people's thoughts or shared ideas. Concepts such as the ""Roaring Twenties"" or ""grace under pressure"" or ""spring fever"" are not singular physical things one can point at like an egg or brick, yet the mind grasps them and their myriad manifestations whenever someone brings them up. How it does that is pretty amazing. Also, though brains across the animal kingdom are made of the same meat, it is the arrangement of that meat that matters--just as books are all made up of letters but the arrangement of those letters leads to vastly different stories.This is one of Pinker's earlier books and it feels a little uneven, diving into complex optical science for seemingly endless stretches, then pulling back to muse on art, music, and humor in light of evolution. I struggled to tie it all together. But I'd like to read it again to make better sense of it all."

And by we I mean everyone, past, present, and future. Evolution isn't a contribution, it's the sole explanation. For everything we do. (HINT: Evolution doesn't really care about your happiness.). That alone is worth reading the book.Some evolution topics covered I found fascinating:•Peer influence vs. family influence. •Conspicuous wealth, conspicuous waste, conspicuous leisure (e.g., art and liberal art degrees!), even conspicuous outrage (current political climate).•War and violence.•Language... Understanding Evolution but lays the ground. Pinker goes much farther. Using computer / computational science and advanced ""thinking"" models / Artificial Intelligence he breaks down the micro programming of the human brain.This is a very readable book, thoroughly researched and written with precision and wit. My only minor qualm is his short chapter on humor. Feels short-shrifted. Someone as witty as Pinker could mine much more here. But, as E.B. White’s said in 1941, “Humor can be dissected, as a frog can, but the thing dies in the process and the innards are discouraging to any but the pure scientific mind.” It changed how I see the world and myself."

And with a bit of philosophy thrown in the mix, naturally, unavoidable when talking about the human mind.Pinker is not only presenting the accumulated knowledge gathered by thousands of scientists and philosophers that came before him, but also grouping the knowledge in a way as to make sense of how it all comes together to define different areas of humanity and human mind.And all of that in enthusiastic but humble way, acknowledging the complexity and uncertainty of what he's trying to do.I'm sure he would have a couple of more worthwhile things to say nowadays, given the rise of AI and a bit more progress science has achieved on the mind and genetics front. This is the only thing I could hold against the book, the fact it could've been longer if it was written yesterday.Great read, keeping the spark of curiosity and thirst for knowledge alive."
454,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75157556-lucas-h-golding,4,"An interesting observational look into the workings of the mind and the deceiving aspects of our senses. There’s no doubt in my mind that Mr. Pinker is a very thoughtful writer. He’s very good at analogies and painting a clear and concise picture of the message he’s trying to portray. I’d say my favorite part of the book is the last chapter which deals with everything from how music supercharges our emotional states to the meaning of humor. The most philosophical argument of the book comes in the explanation of why we as humans have the ability to ask such philosophical questions when paradoxically our brain evolved because of natural selection for solving problems that are related to survival(flight or fight) or reproduction(feed and breed). Why then do we ask ourselves questions such as “Does everyone see the color RED the way I see the color RED?” Pinker appropriately does not try to answer such questions, because most likely there is no answer. Yet it’s hard not to be in awe of the complexities of the mind and it’s inner workings, something this book definitely makes you think about."
455,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,3,"This was an interesting and eye-opening look into how exactly our minds do all the things that we take for granted. Pinker goes through everything from the experience of consciousness to how underlying assumptions behind the way our eyes interpret the world lead to visual illusions. While he sometimes goes in too much death, as in the overly-detailed way that he detailed how our brain interprets visual illusions, he is usually concise and engaging. Similarly, while he firmly plants his arguments in a biological/evolutionary framework, he gives the best explanation for the naturalist fallacy that I’ve ever read. Drawing exact distinctions between what “is” from what “ought” to be and not shying away from arguing how an evolutionary understanding of rape in no way condones the behavior. He emphatically stresses how the same way in which we thwart our genes by putting on condoms before intercourse we can use moral and legal means to thwart what is a morally aberrant mating strategy. I highly recommend this book to anyone who had been curious just how exactly our brains make up our experience of consciousness. "
456,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40215344-mike-hovis,0,"This book is filled with contradictions. The author states up front that he wants to convince the reader that the mind is not the product of some godly vapor or single wonder principle. He maintains the mind is the product of evolution. And yet he cannot talk about the mind or the eye or the ear without words such as “designed”, “engineered”, or manufactured”. I do not dispute that the mind, the eye, the ear, or any other parts of the human body are designed or engineered. The very complexity of these things is evidence of design. But design requires intelligence, a mind that can conceive, design, and bring into being what it has conceived. Natural processes such as natural selection do not possess a mind. A process itself is evidence of a designer who conceived it and set it in motion. That process can only repeatedly do what it was designed to do. Who is the designer of the highly designed eye, ear, mind, etc.? “his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made.” (Romans 1:20 ESV)."

Regardless, in my view it's very well researched and written, and gives the reader a new way of seeing everyday things through the lens of evolution and brain mechanics. The first few chapters are somewhat more technical, but form a basis for the more flowing later chapters, which apply the general notions to topics like family and humor.I'll leave some (serious and funny) quotes here, in case I lose the many sticky notes I littered the book with:
[...] the dichotomy between ""in nature"" and ""socially constructed"" shows a poverty of imagination, because it omits a third alternative: that some categories are products of a complex mind designed to mesh with what is in nature.

We joke that you can't be a little bit pregnant or a little bit married, and after a Canadian survey reportat that married women have sex 1.57 times a week, the cartoonist Terry Mosher drew a woman sitting up in bed beside her dozing husband and muttering, ""Well, that was .57.""

Left and right shoes look so alike that children must be taught tricks to distinguish them. [...] Even the English language likes to collapse left and right: beside and next to denote side-by-side without specifying who's on the left, but there is no word like bebove or aneath that denotes up-and-down without specifying who's on top.

Objects designed for definite purposes can, as a result of their structural complexity, perform many other tasks as well. A factory may install a computer only to issue the monthly pay checks, but such a machine can also analyze the election returns or whip anyone's ass (or at least perpetually tie them) in tic-tac-toe.

Space and force pervade language. Many cognitive scientist have concluded from their research on language that a handful of concepts about places, paths, motions, agency, and causation undelie the literal of figurative meanings of tens of thousands of words and constructions, not only in English but in every other language that has been studied. The thought underlying the sentence ""Minnie gave the house to Mary"" would be something like ""Minnie cause [house go-possessionally from Minnie to Mary]."" These concepts and relations appear to be the vocabulary and syntax of mentalese, the language of thought.

People everywhere beseech gods and spirits for recovery from illness, for success in love or on the battlefield, and for good weather. Religion is a desperate measure that people resort to when the takes are high and they have exhausted the usual techniques for the causation of success - medicines, strategies, courtship, and, in the case of the weather, nothing.

It is easy to read, true, but the simpleness of his writing comes at the cost of rigor and depth, satisfying itself with easy answers and haphazard conclusions, which becomes more pronounced in the later chapters dealing with evolutionary psychology.Pinker does raise good points, but unfortunately this does not absolve his poor reasoning, creating a ""sugar with poison"" problem that requires the reader to discern relevant information from utter bollocks, not unlike another Canadian Psychologist that comes to mind, who employs a similar rambling argumentative style instead of backing up his assertions with concise evidence.Regardless, it is what it is, popular science, and I would argue that the sacrifices made are not worth the costs on this one, but that a critical reader will nonetheless be able to take some worthwhile ideas from it."

The central theme is that all of these just cannot be understood without invoking evolutionary psychology, for the simple reason that all of our mental apparatus and or morality, came into existence as a result of evolutionary pressuresSometimes, the author goes into a little too much depth for a book written with a lay audience in mind, but it's mostly extremely lucid.Even if you read nothing of it, the chapter titled ""Family Values"" is an absolutely essential piece. You'll learn why men and women differ, why mothers care for their child (and why fathers are less likely to), why adultery evolved, and when does it not in certain animals. It's truly eye-opening"

He just often has a strong “get off my lawn” flavor, which is a shame, as his arguments are overall very persuasive. Some parts of the text can be a struggle, in particular his neural models of information processing toward the beginning of the book.

Wow is all I can say to the amount of research and information The final chapters of the book also expand thoughts on why we are here in the first place as well as the meaning of life.

This way of writing is adequate but quite tiresome for the reader, especially when there are ideas that do not require overly elaborate metaphors and complementary examples to make them clear. With this comment I do not try to criticize the author knowledge and all the evident work that this book entailed for him (who seems to me a very brilliant person), I only try to comment on how problematic it can be to read concentrating on certain topics."

Then he goes through several facts knitted together by both theory of evolution and theory of computation to show us how the mind works. Of course the focus is on how our brain has been evolving to cope with all the social interactions needed to thrive within human societies (reproduce?).

That's what Steven Pinker tried in ""How the Mind Works"" (1998). Unfortunately the first part of the concept harms the second a bit too much: it's just too much stuff to cover in too many fields, and so, the argumentation has invariably to remain shallow and often reductionistic. Especially when regarding literature and arts, the author proves himself a great neuroscientist (and that's not a compliment).My favourite part is the last one though, about the meaning of life."

Pinker occasionally rants about people whom he feels have wrong ideas, which is unnecessary and distracting. Sorry, but I don't share his outrage. He does do a plausible job of describing a reverse engineering of the human mind using evolution and psychophysics, but doesn't actually prove much of anything. But it is interesting speculation. (BTW, the Kindle edition falls down badly in the matter of the end notes. They are linked from the note section to the text, but not from the text to the notes which makes them essentially useless!)"
470,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75440802-jonatan,4,"Pinker does an amazing job in summarizing the mechanisms of the human mind. His sense of humour makes the long read (565 pages) worth it, but the length of the book is in my opinion also its weak spot. Since almost every single page is littered with such knowledge, you really don't want to rush through this book in a hurry. It ended up taking me three months to get through the whole thing, which to me is quite a lot of time. Did I learn anything? I sure did. Would I read it again? Not from cover to cover, no. But a chapter at a time every now and then, perhaps yes. I have a feeling this title will be a great piece of reference literature in a not too distant future."

He almost disregards anything not directly tied in to evolutionary biology as an explanation for our behaviour. The last chapter wasn't great for me. At every single point in human history a problem was touted as ''beyond our understanding'' or ''incapable of being deciphered'', only that to be proven false years later. We might not have figured out how to frame the problem of consciousness correctly, but I am sure someone will figure it out."
472,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85068346-rahul-shah,4,Difficult yet stimulating readThere are books where you come out knowing fully well what you've learned and then there are books which are difficult to reduce to 2-3 key insights. I would put this book in the latter category. Pinker is a great wordsmith but at some places his wizardry comes at the expense of deep understanding of the subject matter. Wish he could have been more accommodating of less eloquent folks like me. Having said that his understanding of his craft is top notch and there are quite a few insights that are gonna remain with me for a very long time. 
473,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75189921-jens-egholm,4,"How the mind works is a compact tour-de-force of psychological principles, and how Pinker believes they relate to the physical matter. The book is packed with analogies, experiments, historical anecdotes and interesting research, and provides a good overview of the complexity of the field(s).The degree of compaction makes the book hard to follow, and many of the presentations are unfounded. While I'll definitely recommend it if you're interested in psychology and cognitive science, I'd suggest starting with other, more accessible books on the topic."
474,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2894543-amin-delshad,5,Yet another brilliant book by Steven Pinker. I was skeptical at first to read a book about evolutionary psychology twenty years after its publication. Surely there have been new research into workings of the mind that would undermine some of the arguments in the book. But it was an entertaining and well-written book nonetheless.Mr. Pinker has definitely been a big factor in my worldview in the past few years and I would like such ideas to gain more mainstream attention.
475,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68250633-alexander-thomas,5,"Along with ""The Language Instinct,"" this is one of my favorite books by Steven Pinker.Here he tackles evolutionary psychology directly, showing how game theory and genetics and his general background in cognition combine to produce human nature directly out of evolutionary forces. A great read that brought together a bunch of different research at the time, and still holds as a great foundation in how our minds work (ie, the foundations of human nature).One of my all-time favorite books as well, which I re-read every few years."
476,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47967457-jos,3,"words,words, words...I think I stay with the first chapter definition that ""the mind is a system of organs designed by natural selection to solve kinds of problems our ancestors faced in their foraging wayof life."" And Pinkers whole set-up of the book is to prove that psychology is nothing else than reverse engineering of the brain. After that the book lingers on in endless meanders of thoughts, ideas, opinions, trivia etc.. A bit of a disilusionment as the title promised more. Or the book could have done with 400 pages less. I enjoyed ""enlightenment now"" much more. "
477,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57394557-jack-greenrose,3,"This is not Pinker's best book, but it is worth reading. I found the evolutionary explanations behind human behavior to be caricatural and greatly exaggerated at best—and in 2017, twenty years after the publication, Pinker's take on female sexuality (or the alleged absence of it) seems hands down laughable. Yet, the humorous style and overall level of quality content make this book still a good piece of popularized science literature. "
478,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/731907-andrea-patrick,5,"I've become a big Steven Pinker fan. He's brilliant, a good writer, a clear thinker, and he knows how to footnote. It seems like every time I picked this book up, it had something to say that was relevant to something in my daily life (I read it over a period of several weeks). The beginning part was a little bit of a slog, but the book as a whole is well worth it. Anyone interested in cognitive science shouldn't miss this book."

The complexity of the human mind that this book reveals leaves the idea of machine-based intelligence that could replicate a sentinent human, remaining in the realm of science fiction even now, 20 years after it's publication. "
480,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78846946-chris-hall,3,"A friend of mine gave me this book about ten years ago - only now have I got around to reading it.He raved over it - even going so far as to buy a second copy when he realised that he was unlikely to get back the one he leant me.Having finally read it, I'm not entirely sure why he was so keen on it. It isn't a bad book - it's just dull in places - despite Pinker's genuine efforts to make it otherwise. I suppose it's possible that I didn't get as much as I'd hoped out of it because my background meant I was already familiar with the concepts underlying Artificial Intelligence and natural language processing; if these areas are new to you then there's more to get out of the book.Some thoughts:(*) I was disappointed with Pinker's approach (or rather lack of approach) to transcendent consciousness. This had the potential to be the most interesting part of the book however he largely brushes it aside saying that not enough is known about it for it to be looked at seriously.(*) I don't think Pinker appreciates the extent of the plasticity of brain activity. If he had he may well have considered the existence of some sort of overarching control mechanism that oversees and manages it.(*) While he talks in depth about the mental processes involved in drawing conclusions about the world around us, he doesn't address the question of how it's known when a conclusion has been found."
481,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69405631-steve,4,"Whew! Pretty heavy-going in places. Parts philosophy, computer science and evolution all under the umbrella of cognitive psychology. I learned that the adaptive mutations of evolution produced the brain (neurons, etc) and that the mind (thinking, decision-making, creativity) is the product of the brain. An aha moment came for me when the book said autistic people are ""mind blind."" They perceive the sensory world and can operate in it but (generalizing here) don't understand the world of other people's thoughts or shared ideas. Concepts such as the ""Roaring Twenties"" or ""grace under pressure"" or ""spring fever"" are not singular physical things one can point at like an egg or brick, yet the mind grasps them and their myriad manifestations whenever someone brings them up. How it does that is pretty amazing. Also, though brains across the animal kingdom are made of the same meat, it is the arrangement of that meat that matters--just as books are all made up of letters but the arrangement of those letters leads to vastly different stories.This is one of Pinker's earlier books and it feels a little uneven, diving into complex optical science for seemingly endless stretches, then pulling back to muse on art, music, and humor in light of evolution. I struggled to tie it all together. But I'd like to read it again to make better sense of it all."
482,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2621914-bruce-black,5,"One of the best books I've ever read. Highly recommend. How and why we think and act. And by we I mean everyone, past, present, and future. Evolution isn't a contribution, it's the sole explanation. For everything we do. (HINT: Evolution doesn't really care about your happiness.). That alone is worth reading the book.Some evolution topics covered I found fascinating:•Peer influence vs. family influence. •Conspicuous wealth, conspicuous waste, conspicuous leisure (e.g., art and liberal art degrees!), even conspicuous outrage (current political climate).•War and violence.•Language... Understanding Evolution but lays the ground. Pinker goes much farther. Using computer / computational science and advanced ""thinking"" models / Artificial Intelligence he breaks down the micro programming of the human brain.This is a very readable book, thoroughly researched and written with precision and wit. My only minor qualm is his short chapter on humor. Feels short-shrifted. Someone as witty as Pinker could mine much more here. But, as E.B. White’s said in 1941, “Humor can be dissected, as a frog can, but the thing dies in the process and the innards are discouraging to any but the pure scientific mind.” It changed how I see the world and myself."
483,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105810951-bojan-todorovic,4,"The ambition of themes the book tries to explain is truly matched by the amount of work the good doctor Pinker's has put into it.It full of scientific theories about the mind, results of decades of meticulous research and experiments, thought experiments, and finally unestablished but educated guesses about the areas the science has yet to crack. And with a bit of philosophy thrown in the mix, naturally, unavoidable when talking about the human mind.Pinker is not only presenting the accumulated knowledge gathered by thousands of scientists and philosophers that came before him, but also grouping the knowledge in a way as to make sense of how it all comes together to define different areas of humanity and human mind.And all of that in enthusiastic but humble way, acknowledging the complexity and uncertainty of what he's trying to do.I'm sure he would have a couple of more worthwhile things to say nowadays, given the rise of AI and a bit more progress science has achieved on the mind and genetics front. This is the only thing I could hold against the book, the fact it could've been longer if it was written yesterday.Great read, keeping the spark of curiosity and thirst for knowledge alive."
484,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75157556-lucas-h-golding,4,"An interesting observational look into the workings of the mind and the deceiving aspects of our senses. There’s no doubt in my mind that Mr. Pinker is a very thoughtful writer. He’s very good at analogies and painting a clear and concise picture of the message he’s trying to portray. I’d say my favorite part of the book is the last chapter which deals with everything from how music supercharges our emotional states to the meaning of humor. The most philosophical argument of the book comes in the explanation of why we as humans have the ability to ask such philosophical questions when paradoxically our brain evolved because of natural selection for solving problems that are related to survival(flight or fight) or reproduction(feed and breed). Why then do we ask ourselves questions such as “Does everyone see the color RED the way I see the color RED?” Pinker appropriately does not try to answer such questions, because most likely there is no answer. Yet it’s hard not to be in awe of the complexities of the mind and it’s inner workings, something this book definitely makes you think about."
485,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,3,"This was an interesting and eye-opening look into how exactly our minds do all the things that we take for granted. Pinker goes through everything from the experience of consciousness to how underlying assumptions behind the way our eyes interpret the world lead to visual illusions. While he sometimes goes in too much death, as in the overly-detailed way that he detailed how our brain interprets visual illusions, he is usually concise and engaging. Similarly, while he firmly plants his arguments in a biological/evolutionary framework, he gives the best explanation for the naturalist fallacy that I’ve ever read. Drawing exact distinctions between what “is” from what “ought” to be and not shying away from arguing how an evolutionary understanding of rape in no way condones the behavior. He emphatically stresses how the same way in which we thwart our genes by putting on condoms before intercourse we can use moral and legal means to thwart what is a morally aberrant mating strategy. I highly recommend this book to anyone who had been curious just how exactly our brains make up our experience of consciousness. "
486,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40215344-mike-hovis,0,"This book is filled with contradictions. The author states up front that he wants to convince the reader that the mind is not the product of some godly vapor or single wonder principle. He maintains the mind is the product of evolution. And yet he cannot talk about the mind or the eye or the ear without words such as “designed”, “engineered”, or manufactured”. I do not dispute that the mind, the eye, the ear, or any other parts of the human body are designed or engineered. The very complexity of these things is evidence of design. But design requires intelligence, a mind that can conceive, design, and bring into being what it has conceived. Natural processes such as natural selection do not possess a mind. A process itself is evidence of a designer who conceived it and set it in motion. That process can only repeatedly do what it was designed to do. Who is the designer of the highly designed eye, ear, mind, etc.? “his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made.” (Romans 1:20 ESV)."

I cannot say I understood everything - in fact, I'm happy with a rough 50% and the self-promise of a reread. Regardless, in my view it's very well researched and written, and gives the reader a new way of seeing everyday things through the lens of evolution and brain mechanics. The first few chapters are somewhat more technical, but form a basis for the more flowing later chapters, which apply the general notions to topics like family and humor.I'll leave some (serious and funny) quotes here, in case I lose the many sticky notes I littered the book with:
[...] the dichotomy between ""in nature"" and ""socially constructed"" shows a poverty of imagination, because it omits a third alternative: that some categories are products of a complex mind designed to mesh with what is in nature.
 - p. 57
We joke that you can't be a little bit pregnant or a little bit married, and after a Canadian survey reportat that married women have sex 1.57 times a week, the cartoonist Terry Mosher drew a woman sitting up in bed beside her dozing husband and muttering, ""Well, that was .57."" 
 - p. 127
Left and right shoes look so alike that children must be taught tricks to distinguish them. [...] Even the English language likes to collapse left and right: beside and next to denote side-by-side without specifying who's on the left, but there is no word like bebove or aneath that denotes up-and-down without specifying who's on top.
 - p. 277
Objects designed for definite purposes can, as a result of their structural complexity, perform many other tasks as well. A factory may install a computer only to issue the monthly pay checks, but such a machine can also analyze the election returns or whip anyone's ass (or at least perpetually tie them) in tic-tac-toe.
 - p. 301
Space and force pervade language. Many cognitive scientist have concluded from their research on language that a handful of concepts about places, paths, motions, agency, and causation undelie the literal of figurative meanings of tens of thousands of words and constructions, not only in English but in every other language that has been studied. The thought underlying the sentence ""Minnie gave the house to Mary"" would be something like ""Minnie cause [house go-possessionally from Minnie to Mary]."" These concepts and relations appear to be the vocabulary and syntax of mentalese, the language of thought.
 - p. 355
People everywhere beseech gods and spirits for recovery from illness, for success in love or on the battlefield, and for good weather. Religion is a desperate measure that people resort to when the takes are high and they have exhausted the usual techniques for the causation of success - medicines, strategies, courtship, and, in the case of the weather, nothing.

It is easy to read, true, but the simpleness of his writing comes at the cost of rigor and depth, satisfying itself with easy answers and haphazard conclusions, which becomes more pronounced in the later chapters dealing with evolutionary psychology.Pinker does raise good points, but unfortunately this does not absolve his poor reasoning, creating a ""sugar with poison"" problem that requires the reader to discern relevant information from utter bollocks, not unlike another Canadian Psychologist that comes to mind, who employs a similar rambling argumentative style instead of backing up his assertions with concise evidence.Regardless, it is what it is, popular science, and I would argue that the sacrifices made are not worth the costs on this one, but that a critical reader will nonetheless be able to take some worthwhile ideas from it."

Wow is all I can say to the amount of research and information The final chapters of the book also expand thoughts on why we are here in the first place as well as the meaning of life.

He does do a plausible job of describing a reverse engineering of the human mind using evolution and psychophysics, but doesn't actually prove much of anything. But it is interesting speculation.

His sense of humour makes the long read (565 pages) worth it, but the length of the book is in my opinion also its weak spot. Since almost every single page is littered with such knowledge, you really don't want to rush through this book in a hurry. It ended up taking me three months to get through the whole thing, which to me is quite a lot of time. Did I learn anything? I sure did. Would I read it again? Not from cover to cover, no.

He almost disregards anything not directly tied in to evolutionary biology as an explanation for our behaviour. The last chapter wasn't great for me. At every single point in human history a problem was touted as ''beyond our understanding'' or ''incapable of being deciphered'', only that to be proven false years later. We might not have figured out how to frame the problem of consciousness correctly, but I am sure someone will figure it out."
502,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85068346-rahul-shah,4,Difficult yet stimulating readThere are books where you come out knowing fully well what you've learned and then there are books which are difficult to reduce to 2-3 key insights. I would put this book in the latter category. Pinker is a great wordsmith but at some places his wizardry comes at the expense of deep understanding of the subject matter. Wish he could have been more accommodating of less eloquent folks like me. Having said that his understanding of his craft is top notch and there are quite a few insights that are gonna remain with me for a very long time. 
503,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75189921-jens-egholm,4,"How the mind works is a compact tour-de-force of psychological principles, and how Pinker believes they relate to the physical matter. The book is packed with analogies, experiments, historical anecdotes and interesting research, and provides a good overview of the complexity of the field(s).The degree of compaction makes the book hard to follow, and many of the presentations are unfounded. While I'll definitely recommend it if you're interested in psychology and cognitive science, I'd suggest starting with other, more accessible books on the topic."
504,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2894543-amin-delshad,5,Yet another brilliant book by Steven Pinker. I was skeptical at first to read a book about evolutionary psychology twenty years after its publication. Surely there have been new research into workings of the mind that would undermine some of the arguments in the book. But it was an entertaining and well-written book nonetheless.Mr. Pinker has definitely been a big factor in my worldview in the past few years and I would like such ideas to gain more mainstream attention.
505,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68250633-alexander-thomas,5,"Along with ""The Language Instinct,"" this is one of my favorite books by Steven Pinker.Here he tackles evolutionary psychology directly, showing how game theory and genetics and his general background in cognition combine to produce human nature directly out of evolutionary forces. A great read that brought together a bunch of different research at the time, and still holds as a great foundation in how our minds work (ie, the foundations of human nature).One of my all-time favorite books as well, which I re-read every few years."
506,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47967457-jos,3,"words,words, words...I think I stay with the first chapter definition that ""the mind is a system of organs designed by natural selection to solve kinds of problems our ancestors faced in their foraging wayof life."" And Pinkers whole set-up of the book is to prove that psychology is nothing else than reverse engineering of the brain. After that the book lingers on in endless meanders of thoughts, ideas, opinions, trivia etc.. A bit of a disilusionment as the title promised more. Or the book could have done with 400 pages less. I enjoyed ""enlightenment now"" much more. "
507,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57394557-jack-greenrose,3,"This is not Pinker's best book, but it is worth reading. I found the evolutionary explanations behind human behavior to be caricatural and greatly exaggerated at best—and in 2017, twenty years after the publication, Pinker's take on female sexuality (or the alleged absence of it) seems hands down laughable. Yet, the humorous style and overall level of quality content make this book still a good piece of popularized science literature. "
508,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/731907-andrea-patrick,5,"I've become a big Steven Pinker fan. He's brilliant, a good writer, a clear thinker, and he knows how to footnote. It seems like every time I picked this book up, it had something to say that was relevant to something in my daily life (I read it over a period of several weeks). The beginning part was a little bit of a slog, but the book as a whole is well worth it. Anyone interested in cognitive science shouldn't miss this book."
509,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57084184-dana,4,"FascinatingEvery chapter has its worthy insights and because you quickly realize that you will keep reading even when the material presented seems to be not relevant and then surprise, a revelation or idea you hadn't thought of. The complexity of the human mind that this book reveals leaves the idea of machine-based intelligence that could replicate a sentinent human, remaining in the realm of science fiction even now, 20 years after it's publication. "
510,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78846946-chris-hall,3,"A friend of mine gave me this book about ten years ago - only now have I got around to reading it.He raved over it - even going so far as to buy a second copy when he realised that he was unlikely to get back the one he leant me.Having finally read it, I'm not entirely sure why he was so keen on it. It isn't a bad book - it's just dull in places - despite Pinker's genuine efforts to make it otherwise. I suppose it's possible that I didn't get as much as I'd hoped out of it because my background meant I was already familiar with the concepts underlying Artificial Intelligence and natural language processing; if these areas are new to you then there's more to get out of the book.Some thoughts:(*) I was disappointed with Pinker's approach (or rather lack of approach) to transcendent consciousness. This had the potential to be the most interesting part of the book however he largely brushes it aside saying that not enough is known about it for it to be looked at seriously.(*) I don't think Pinker appreciates the extent of the plasticity of brain activity. If he had he may well have considered the existence of some sort of overarching control mechanism that oversees and manages it.(*) While he talks in depth about the mental processes involved in drawing conclusions about the world around us, he doesn't address the question of how it's known when a conclusion has been found."
511,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69405631-steve,4,"Whew! Pretty heavy-going in places. Parts philosophy, computer science and evolution all under the umbrella of cognitive psychology. I learned that the adaptive mutations of evolution produced the brain (neurons, etc) and that the mind (thinking, decision-making, creativity) is the product of the brain. An aha moment came for me when the book said autistic people are ""mind blind."" They perceive the sensory world and can operate in it but (generalizing here) don't understand the world of other people's thoughts or shared ideas. Concepts such as the ""Roaring Twenties"" or ""grace under pressure"" or ""spring fever"" are not singular physical things one can point at like an egg or brick, yet the mind grasps them and their myriad manifestations whenever someone brings them up. How it does that is pretty amazing. Also, though brains across the animal kingdom are made of the same meat, it is the arrangement of that meat that matters--just as books are all made up of letters but the arrangement of those letters leads to vastly different stories.This is one of Pinker's earlier books and it feels a little uneven, diving into complex optical science for seemingly endless stretches, then pulling back to muse on art, music, and humor in light of evolution. I struggled to tie it all together. But I'd like to read it again to make better sense of it all."
512,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2621914-bruce-black,5,"One of the best books I've ever read. Highly recommend. How and why we think and act. And by we I mean everyone, past, present, and future. Evolution isn't a contribution, it's the sole explanation. For everything we do. (HINT: Evolution doesn't really care about your happiness.). That alone is worth reading the book.Some evolution topics covered I found fascinating:•Peer influence vs. family influence. •Conspicuous wealth, conspicuous waste, conspicuous leisure (e.g., art and liberal art degrees!), even conspicuous outrage (current political climate).•War and violence.•Language... Understanding Evolution but lays the ground. Pinker goes much farther. Using computer / computational science and advanced ""thinking"" models / Artificial Intelligence he breaks down the micro programming of the human brain.This is a very readable book, thoroughly researched and written with precision and wit. My only minor qualm is his short chapter on humor. Feels short-shrifted. Someone as witty as Pinker could mine much more here. But, as E.B. White’s said in 1941, “Humor can be dissected, as a frog can, but the thing dies in the process and the innards are discouraging to any but the pure scientific mind.” It changed how I see the world and myself."
513,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105810951-bojan-todorovic,4,"The ambition of themes the book tries to explain is truly matched by the amount of work the good doctor Pinker's has put into it.It full of scientific theories about the mind, results of decades of meticulous research and experiments, thought experiments, and finally unestablished but educated guesses about the areas the science has yet to crack. And with a bit of philosophy thrown in the mix, naturally, unavoidable when talking about the human mind.Pinker is not only presenting the accumulated knowledge gathered by thousands of scientists and philosophers that came before him, but also grouping the knowledge in a way as to make sense of how it all comes together to define different areas of humanity and human mind.And all of that in enthusiastic but humble way, acknowledging the complexity and uncertainty of what he's trying to do.I'm sure he would have a couple of more worthwhile things to say nowadays, given the rise of AI and a bit more progress science has achieved on the mind and genetics front. This is the only thing I could hold against the book, the fact it could've been longer if it was written yesterday.Great read, keeping the spark of curiosity and thirst for knowledge alive."
514,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75157556-lucas-h-golding,4,"An interesting observational look into the workings of the mind and the deceiving aspects of our senses. There’s no doubt in my mind that Mr. Pinker is a very thoughtful writer. He’s very good at analogies and painting a clear and concise picture of the message he’s trying to portray. I’d say my favorite part of the book is the last chapter which deals with everything from how music supercharges our emotional states to the meaning of humor. The most philosophical argument of the book comes in the explanation of why we as humans have the ability to ask such philosophical questions when paradoxically our brain evolved because of natural selection for solving problems that are related to survival(flight or fight) or reproduction(feed and breed). Why then do we ask ourselves questions such as “Does everyone see the color RED the way I see the color RED?” Pinker appropriately does not try to answer such questions, because most likely there is no answer. Yet it’s hard not to be in awe of the complexities of the mind and it’s inner workings, something this book definitely makes you think about."
515,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,3,"This was an interesting and eye-opening look into how exactly our minds do all the things that we take for granted. Pinker goes through everything from the experience of consciousness to how underlying assumptions behind the way our eyes interpret the world lead to visual illusions. While he sometimes goes in too much death, as in the overly-detailed way that he detailed how our brain interprets visual illusions, he is usually concise and engaging. Similarly, while he firmly plants his arguments in a biological/evolutionary framework, he gives the best explanation for the naturalist fallacy that I’ve ever read. Drawing exact distinctions between what “is” from what “ought” to be and not shying away from arguing how an evolutionary understanding of rape in no way condones the behavior. He emphatically stresses how the same way in which we thwart our genes by putting on condoms before intercourse we can use moral and legal means to thwart what is a morally aberrant mating strategy. I highly recommend this book to anyone who had been curious just how exactly our brains make up our experience of consciousness. "
516,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40215344-mike-hovis,0,"This book is filled with contradictions. The author states up front that he wants to convince the reader that the mind is not the product of some godly vapor or single wonder principle. He maintains the mind is the product of evolution. And yet he cannot talk about the mind or the eye or the ear without words such as “designed”, “engineered”, or manufactured”. I do not dispute that the mind, the eye, the ear, or any other parts of the human body are designed or engineered. The very complexity of these things is evidence of design. But design requires intelligence, a mind that can conceive, design, and bring into being what it has conceived. Natural processes such as natural selection do not possess a mind. A process itself is evidence of a designer who conceived it and set it in motion. That process can only repeatedly do what it was designed to do. Who is the designer of the highly designed eye, ear, mind, etc.? “his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made.” (Romans 1:20 ESV)."
517,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20508475-raluca,4,"How the Mind Works is neither a book you can rush through, nor the most updated of texts - the '97 publishing date makes some of the technological metaphors insufficient or full-on outdated. I cannot say I understood everything - in fact, I'm happy with a rough 50% and the self-promise of a reread. Regardless, in my view it's very well researched and written, and gives the reader a new way of seeing everyday things through the lens of evolution and brain mechanics. The first few chapters are somewhat more technical, but form a basis for the more flowing later chapters, which apply the general notions to topics like family and humor.I'll leave some (serious and funny) quotes here, in case I lose the many sticky notes I littered the book with:
[...] the dichotomy between ""in nature"" and ""socially constructed"" shows a poverty of imagination, because it omits a third alternative: that some categories are products of a complex mind designed to mesh with what is in nature.
 - p. 57
We joke that you can't be a little bit pregnant or a little bit married, and after a Canadian survey reportat that married women have sex 1.57 times a week, the cartoonist Terry Mosher drew a woman sitting up in bed beside her dozing husband and muttering, ""Well, that was .57."" 
 - p. 127
Left and right shoes look so alike that children must be taught tricks to distinguish them. [...] Even the English language likes to collapse left and right: beside and next to denote side-by-side without specifying who's on the left, but there is no word like bebove or aneath that denotes up-and-down without specifying who's on top.
 - p. 277
Objects designed for definite purposes can, as a result of their structural complexity, perform many other tasks as well. A factory may install a computer only to issue the monthly pay checks, but such a machine can also analyze the election returns or whip anyone's ass (or at least perpetually tie them) in tic-tac-toe.
 - p. 301
Space and force pervade language. Many cognitive scientist have concluded from their research on language that a handful of concepts about places, paths, motions, agency, and causation undelie the literal of figurative meanings of tens of thousands of words and constructions, not only in English but in every other language that has been studied. The thought underlying the sentence ""Minnie gave the house to Mary"" would be something like ""Minnie cause [house go-possessionally from Minnie to Mary]."" These concepts and relations appear to be the vocabulary and syntax of mentalese, the language of thought.
 - p. 355
People everywhere beseech gods and spirits for recovery from illness, for success in love or on the battlefield, and for good weather. Religion is a desperate measure that people resort to when the takes are high and they have exhausted the usual techniques for the causation of success - medicines, strategies, courtship, and, in the case of the weather, nothing.

It is easy to read, true, but the simpleness of his writing comes at the cost of rigor and depth, satisfying itself with easy answers and haphazard conclusions, which becomes more pronounced in the later chapters dealing with evolutionary psychology.Pinker does raise good points, but unfortunately this does not absolve his poor reasoning, creating a ""sugar with poison"" problem that requires the reader to discern relevant information from utter bollocks, not unlike another Canadian Psychologist that comes to mind, who employs a similar rambling argumentative style instead of backing up his assertions with concise evidence.Regardless, it is what it is, popular science, and I would argue that the sacrifices made are not worth the costs on this one, but that a critical reader will nonetheless be able to take some worthwhile ideas from it."

The author explains illusions, 3D vision, the structure of language, the combinatorial nature of a brain, and so much more. The central theme is that all of these just cannot be understood without invoking evolutionary psychology, for the simple reason that all of our mental apparatus and or morality, came into existence as a result of evolutionary pressuresSometimes, the author goes into a little too much depth for a book written with a lay audience in mind, but it's mostly extremely lucid.Even if you read nothing of it, the chapter titled ""Family Values"" is an absolutely essential piece. You'll learn why men and women differ, why mothers care for their child (and why fathers are less likely to), why adultery evolved, and when does it not in certain animals. It's truly eye-opening"
520,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2579781-paul,4,"I think Pinker provides a fairly convincing story for most aspects of this. I was already more or less convinced of the overall concept of the computational theory of mind, and I think Pinker makes some good points about the specific details.Overall it seems well-organized, and the main detraction I see for this is that a lot of his points are ""evolutionary psychology adjacent."" Still, he seems to be on the reasonable side of evolutionary psychology. Ev-psych perspectives that are all based around, ""We do X because it is well-adapted for early human life"" tend to be much less believable, and based on more and shakier premises, than perspectives based on selfish genes, evolutionarily stable strategies and resource allocations in general."

Unfortunately, this book seems full of arguments and strawman fallacies without much empirical support. I was especially disheartened when the topic delved into evolutionary psychology. I was looking forward to an objective and holistic conversation about this topic. Yet, this book only provided the same trite evo. arguments I've heard so many times before without really unpacking the complexities. Furthermore, criticisms to these theories were completely ignored or superficially sprinkled into the conversation (e.g. Eagly & Wood). I wish the book was more balanced with less rants or biases. "

Some of it went over my head, but the majority was a very understandable look out how our minds work.The following is probably the excerpt that sums up the book:""The task of evolutionary psychology is not to weigh in on human nature, a task better left to others. It is to add the satisfying kind of insight that only science can provide: to connect what we know about human nature with the rest of our knowledge of how the world works, and to explain the largest number of facts with the smallest number of assumptions.""For a more practical snip:""A large industry of self-anointed seers hallucinate trends in the random walk of the stock market.""

The mind is what the brain does. The brain and all brains are evolutionary products which determine the material which is shaped by environments, differently but still can be studied. Okay. Yet saying that the alternative explanations for how the mind works are bad, aren't really explanation, doesn't actually explain how the mind works.If anything this book explains why the mind works - Darwinian selection favoured our intelligent brains. But it's ridiculous long pages of hot air of what statistics show, which is what and not how. To actually know how the mind works (as much as one can) read Robert Sapolsky's Behave. "

The biggest one is the author’s dismissive, embattled tone toward all competing theories and many cultural movements (think feminism or 60’s counterculture). He just often has a strong “get off my lawn” flavor, which is a shame, as his arguments are overall very persuasive. Some parts of the text can be a struggle, in particular his neural models of information processing toward the beginning of the book. I would recommend pushing through (or skipping ahead), as his explanation of vision and description of evolutionary differences between the sexes are much more readable.

He almost disregards anything not directly tied in to evolutionary biology as an explanation for our behaviour. The last chapter wasn't great for me. At every single point in human history a problem was touted as ''beyond our understanding'' or ''incapable of being deciphered'', only that to be proven false years later. We might not have figured out how to frame the problem of consciousness correctly, but I am sure someone will figure it out."

I would put this book in the latter category. Pinker is a great wordsmith but at some places his wizardry comes at the expense of deep understanding of the subject matter. Wish he could have been more accommodating of less eloquent folks like me. Having said that his understanding of his craft is top notch and there are quite a few insights that are gonna remain with me for a very long time.

After that the book lingers on in endless meanders of thoughts, ideas, opinions, trivia etc.. A bit of a disilusionment as the title promised more. Or the book could have done with 400 pages less.

540,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78846946-chris-hall,3,"A friend of mine gave me this book about ten years ago - only now have I got around to reading it.He raved over it - even going so far as to buy a second copy when he realised that he was unlikely to get back the one he leant me.Having finally read it, I'm not entirely sure why he was so keen on it. It isn't a bad book - it's just dull in places - despite Pinker's genuine efforts to make it otherwise. I suppose it's possible that I didn't get as much as I'd hoped out of it because my background meant I was already familiar with the concepts underlying Artificial Intelligence and natural language processing; if these areas are new to you then there's more to get out of the book.Some thoughts:(*) I was disappointed with Pinker's approach (or rather lack of approach) to transcendent consciousness. This had the potential to be the most interesting part of the book however he largely brushes it aside saying that not enough is known about it for it to be looked at seriously.(*) I don't think Pinker appreciates the extent of the plasticity of brain activity. If he had he may well have considered the existence of some sort of overarching control mechanism that oversees and manages it.(*) While he talks in depth about the mental processes involved in drawing conclusions about the world around us, he doesn't address the question of how it's known when a conclusion has been found."
541,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69405631-steve,4,"Whew! Pretty heavy-going in places. Parts philosophy, computer science and evolution all under the umbrella of cognitive psychology. I learned that the adaptive mutations of evolution produced the brain (neurons, etc) and that the mind (thinking, decision-making, creativity) is the product of the brain. An aha moment came for me when the book said autistic people are ""mind blind."" They perceive the sensory world and can operate in it but (generalizing here) don't understand the world of other people's thoughts or shared ideas. Concepts such as the ""Roaring Twenties"" or ""grace under pressure"" or ""spring fever"" are not singular physical things one can point at like an egg or brick, yet the mind grasps them and their myriad manifestations whenever someone brings them up. How it does that is pretty amazing. Also, though brains across the animal kingdom are made of the same meat, it is the arrangement of that meat that matters--just as books are all made up of letters but the arrangement of those letters leads to vastly different stories.This is one of Pinker's earlier books and it feels a little uneven, diving into complex optical science for seemingly endless stretches, then pulling back to muse on art, music, and humor in light of evolution. I struggled to tie it all together. But I'd like to read it again to make better sense of it all."
542,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2621914-bruce-black,5,"One of the best books I've ever read. Highly recommend. How and why we think and act. And by we I mean everyone, past, present, and future. Evolution isn't a contribution, it's the sole explanation. For everything we do. (HINT: Evolution doesn't really care about your happiness.). That alone is worth reading the book.Some evolution topics covered I found fascinating:•Peer influence vs. family influence. •Conspicuous wealth, conspicuous waste, conspicuous leisure (e.g., art and liberal art degrees!), even conspicuous outrage (current political climate).•War and violence.•Language... Understanding Evolution but lays the ground. Pinker goes much farther. Using computer / computational science and advanced ""thinking"" models / Artificial Intelligence he breaks down the micro programming of the human brain.This is a very readable book, thoroughly researched and written with precision and wit. My only minor qualm is his short chapter on humor. Feels short-shrifted. Someone as witty as Pinker could mine much more here. But, as E.B. White’s said in 1941, “Humor can be dissected, as a frog can, but the thing dies in the process and the innards are discouraging to any but the pure scientific mind.” It changed how I see the world and myself."
543,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105810951-bojan-todorovic,4,"The ambition of themes the book tries to explain is truly matched by the amount of work the good doctor Pinker's has put into it.It full of scientific theories about the mind, results of decades of meticulous research and experiments, thought experiments, and finally unestablished but educated guesses about the areas the science has yet to crack. And with a bit of philosophy thrown in the mix, naturally, unavoidable when talking about the human mind.Pinker is not only presenting the accumulated knowledge gathered by thousands of scientists and philosophers that came before him, but also grouping the knowledge in a way as to make sense of how it all comes together to define different areas of humanity and human mind.And all of that in enthusiastic but humble way, acknowledging the complexity and uncertainty of what he's trying to do.I'm sure he would have a couple of more worthwhile things to say nowadays, given the rise of AI and a bit more progress science has achieved on the mind and genetics front. This is the only thing I could hold against the book, the fact it could've been longer if it was written yesterday.Great read, keeping the spark of curiosity and thirst for knowledge alive."
544,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75157556-lucas-h-golding,4,"An interesting observational look into the workings of the mind and the deceiving aspects of our senses. There’s no doubt in my mind that Mr. Pinker is a very thoughtful writer. He’s very good at analogies and painting a clear and concise picture of the message he’s trying to portray. I’d say my favorite part of the book is the last chapter which deals with everything from how music supercharges our emotional states to the meaning of humor. The most philosophical argument of the book comes in the explanation of why we as humans have the ability to ask such philosophical questions when paradoxically our brain evolved because of natural selection for solving problems that are related to survival(flight or fight) or reproduction(feed and breed). Why then do we ask ourselves questions such as “Does everyone see the color RED the way I see the color RED?” Pinker appropriately does not try to answer such questions, because most likely there is no answer. Yet it’s hard not to be in awe of the complexities of the mind and it’s inner workings, something this book definitely makes you think about."
545,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,3,"This was an interesting and eye-opening look into how exactly our minds do all the things that we take for granted. Pinker goes through everything from the experience of consciousness to how underlying assumptions behind the way our eyes interpret the world lead to visual illusions. While he sometimes goes in too much death, as in the overly-detailed way that he detailed how our brain interprets visual illusions, he is usually concise and engaging. Similarly, while he firmly plants his arguments in a biological/evolutionary framework, he gives the best explanation for the naturalist fallacy that I’ve ever read. Drawing exact distinctions between what “is” from what “ought” to be and not shying away from arguing how an evolutionary understanding of rape in no way condones the behavior. He emphatically stresses how the same way in which we thwart our genes by putting on condoms before intercourse we can use moral and legal means to thwart what is a morally aberrant mating strategy. I highly recommend this book to anyone who had been curious just how exactly our brains make up our experience of consciousness. "
546,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40215344-mike-hovis,0,"This book is filled with contradictions. The author states up front that he wants to convince the reader that the mind is not the product of some godly vapor or single wonder principle. He maintains the mind is the product of evolution. And yet he cannot talk about the mind or the eye or the ear without words such as “designed”, “engineered”, or manufactured”. I do not dispute that the mind, the eye, the ear, or any other parts of the human body are designed or engineered. The very complexity of these things is evidence of design. But design requires intelligence, a mind that can conceive, design, and bring into being what it has conceived. Natural processes such as natural selection do not possess a mind. A process itself is evidence of a designer who conceived it and set it in motion. That process can only repeatedly do what it was designed to do. Who is the designer of the highly designed eye, ear, mind, etc.? “his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made.” (Romans 1:20 ESV)."
547,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20508475-raluca,4,"How the Mind Works is neither a book you can rush through, nor the most updated of texts - the '97 publishing date makes some of the technological metaphors insufficient or full-on outdated. I cannot say I understood everything - in fact, I'm happy with a rough 50% and the self-promise of a reread. Regardless, in my view it's very well researched and written, and gives the reader a new way of seeing everyday things through the lens of evolution and brain mechanics. The first few chapters are somewhat more technical, but form a basis for the more flowing later chapters, which apply the general notions to topics like family and humor.I'll leave some (serious and funny) quotes here, in case I lose the many sticky notes I littered the book with:
[...] the dichotomy between ""in nature"" and ""socially constructed"" shows a poverty of imagination, because it omits a third alternative: that some categories are products of a complex mind designed to mesh with what is in nature.
 - p. 57
We joke that you can't be a little bit pregnant or a little bit married, and after a Canadian survey reportat that married women have sex 1.57 times a week, the cartoonist Terry Mosher drew a woman sitting up in bed beside her dozing husband and muttering, ""Well, that was .57."" 
 - p. 127
Left and right shoes look so alike that children must be taught tricks to distinguish them. [...] Even the English language likes to collapse left and right: beside and next to denote side-by-side without specifying who's on the left, but there is no word like bebove or aneath that denotes up-and-down without specifying who's on top.
 - p. 277
Objects designed for definite purposes can, as a result of their structural complexity, perform many other tasks as well. A factory may install a computer only to issue the monthly pay checks, but such a machine can also analyze the election returns or whip anyone's ass (or at least perpetually tie them) in tic-tac-toe.
 - p. 301
Space and force pervade language. Many cognitive scientist have concluded from their research on language that a handful of concepts about places, paths, motions, agency, and causation undelie the literal of figurative meanings of tens of thousands of words and constructions, not only in English but in every other language that has been studied. The thought underlying the sentence ""Minnie gave the house to Mary"" would be something like ""Minnie cause [house go-possessionally from Minnie to Mary]."" These concepts and relations appear to be the vocabulary and syntax of mentalese, the language of thought.
 - p. 355
People everywhere beseech gods and spirits for recovery from illness, for success in love or on the battlefield, and for good weather. Religion is a desperate measure that people resort to when the takes are high and they have exhausted the usual techniques for the causation of success - medicines, strategies, courtship, and, in the case of the weather, nothing.

It is easy to read, true, but the simpleness of his writing comes at the cost of rigor and depth, satisfying itself with easy answers and haphazard conclusions, which becomes more pronounced in the later chapters dealing with evolutionary psychology.Pinker does raise good points, but unfortunately this does not absolve his poor reasoning, creating a ""sugar with poison"" problem that requires the reader to discern relevant information from utter bollocks, not unlike another Canadian Psychologist that comes to mind, who employs a similar rambling argumentative style instead of backing up his assertions with concise evidence.Regardless, it is what it is, popular science, and I would argue that the sacrifices made are not worth the costs on this one, but that a critical reader will nonetheless be able to take some worthwhile ideas from it."
549,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46735931-daud-khan,4,"An indispensable book if you wish to understand - truly understand - how the mind works (as far as a non-specialist can). The author explains illusions, 3D vision, the structure of language, the combinatorial nature of a brain, and so much more. The central theme is that all of these just cannot be understood without invoking evolutionary psychology, for the simple reason that all of our mental apparatus and or morality, came into existence as a result of evolutionary pressuresSometimes, the author goes into a little too much depth for a book written with a lay audience in mind, but it's mostly extremely lucid.Even if you read nothing of it, the chapter titled ""Family Values"" is an absolutely essential piece. You'll learn why men and women differ, why mothers care for their child (and why fathers are less likely to), why adultery evolved, and when does it not in certain animals. It's truly eye-opening"
550,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2579781-paul,4,"I think Pinker provides a fairly convincing story for most aspects of this. I was already more or less convinced of the overall concept of the computational theory of mind, and I think Pinker makes some good points about the specific details.Overall it seems well-organized, and the main detraction I see for this is that a lot of his points are ""evolutionary psychology adjacent."" Still, he seems to be on the reasonable side of evolutionary psychology. Ev-psych perspectives that are all based around, ""We do X because it is well-adapted for early human life"" tend to be much less believable, and based on more and shakier premises, than perspectives based on selfish genes, evolutionarily stable strategies and resource allocations in general."

Unfortunately, this book seems full of arguments and strawman fallacies without much empirical support. I was especially disheartened when the topic delved into evolutionary psychology. I was looking forward to an objective and holistic conversation about this topic. Yet, this book only provided the same trite evo. arguments I've heard so many times before without really unpacking the complexities. Furthermore, criticisms to these theories were completely ignored or superficially sprinkled into the conversation (e.g. Eagly & Wood). I wish the book was more balanced with less rants or biases. "

Some of it went over my head, but the majority was a very understandable look out how our minds work.The following is probably the excerpt that sums up the book:""The task of evolutionary psychology is not to weigh in on human nature, a task better left to others. It is to add the satisfying kind of insight that only science can provide: to connect what we know about human nature with the rest of our knowledge of how the world works, and to explain the largest number of facts with the smallest number of assumptions.""For a more practical snip:""A large industry of self-anointed seers hallucinate trends in the random walk of the stock market.""

The mind is what the brain does. The brain and all brains are evolutionary products which determine the material which is shaped by environments, differently but still can be studied. Okay. Yet saying that the alternative explanations for how the mind works are bad, aren't really explanation, doesn't actually explain how the mind works.If anything this book explains why the mind works - Darwinian selection favoured our intelligent brains. But it's ridiculous long pages of hot air of what statistics show, which is what and not how. To actually know how the mind works (as much as one can) read Robert Sapolsky's Behave. "
554,0393318486,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11019520-keith,3,"Since I teach AP Psychology, I felt compelled to finish this book in spite of its flaws. The biggest one is the author’s dismissive, embattled tone toward all competing theories and many cultural movements (think feminism or 60’s counterculture). He just often has a strong “get off my lawn” flavor, which is a shame, as his arguments are overall very persuasive. Some parts of the text can be a struggle, in particular his neural models of information processing toward the beginning of the book. I would recommend pushing through (or skipping ahead), as his explanation of vision and description of evolutionary differences between the sexes are much more readable.

Behavioral Psychology and the Science of the Brain research together makes an impressive argument for Conscientiousness and the many attributes to the evolution of the mind over 10,000 generations. Wow is all I can say to the amount of research and information The final chapters of the book also expand thoughts on why we are here in the first place as well as the meaning of life.

Unfortunately the first part of the concept harms the second a bit too much: it's just too much stuff to cover in too many fields, and so, the argumentation has invariably to remain shallow and often reductionistic. Especially when regarding literature and arts, the author proves himself a great neuroscientist (and that's not a compliment).My favourite part is the last one though, about the meaning of life."

He does do a plausible job of describing a reverse engineering of the human mind using evolution and psychophysics, but doesn't actually prove much of anything. But it is interesting speculation.

Since almost every single page is littered with such knowledge, you really don't want to rush through this book in a hurry. It ended up taking me three months to get through the whole thing, which to me is quite a lot of time. Did I learn anything? I sure did. Would I read it again? Not from cover to cover, no.

It seems like every time I picked this book up, it had something to say that was relevant to something in my daily life (I read it over a period of several weeks). The beginning part was a little bit of a slog, but the book as a whole is well worth it. Anyone interested in cognitive science shouldn't miss this book."

The complexity of the human mind that this book reveals leaves the idea of machine-based intelligence that could replicate a sentinent human, remaining in the realm of science fiction even now, 20 years after it's publication.
