0,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"On Monday, an old friend came round to lunch, and, while we were having a cup of tea in the living room, remarked on the number of Richard Dawkins books on my shelf. Somehow, I'd never heard that she'd actually had Dawkins as a supervisor for one term when she was an undergraduate at Oxford in the late 70s; it was in connection with the course she was reading on animal behaviour. I asked what he was like as a person, and she was unenthusiastic. Clearly very intelligent, but there was something about him that she found disquieting. She wouldn't go so far as to say that he'd behaved inappropriately, there was never a specific incident she could point to, but she constantly felt that he was just an inch from the line. Well... charismatic, thirty-something male supervisor, attractive young female undergraduate, animal behaviour, you can see plenty of scope for that. And she said that, even then, he'd go on about religion. After a while, she became increasingly sure that his hostile feelings were rooted in some kind of personal disappointment he'd suffered, though she had no idea what it might have been.I asked her which Dawkins she'd read, and, like most people, it was The Selfish Gene and The God Delusion. She hadn't particularly liked either one. I can sympathize with her point of view. But, as other reviewers here have said, Dawkins is a more complex person than he's generally given credit for, and if you read The Ancestor's Tale you'll see another side. I suppose one could say that he's attacking religion here too, but the strategy is completely the opposite of the blunt, in-your-face assault he uses in the The God Delusion; to my mind, it's also far more effective. Rather than tell you what's ugly and wrong about Intelligent Design, he concentrates his energies on showing you what's beautiful and right about evolution, and how, far from contradicting traditional religious beliefs, it reveals them with a clarity that previous generations have been unable to see. I kept thinking of Saint Francis of Assisi, and his love of all living creatures. ""Brother bird, sister ant""... they're beautiful poetic phrases. But what do they mean? Evidently, this finch can't literally be my brother. There is no way that my mother could have given birth to him. The conventional explanation is that we're both ""children of God"", which is fine as far as it goes; the problem is that it doesn't really shed much light on the nature of our relationship. The astonishing thing about evolution, which forms the core of this book, is that it shows how the bird and ant truly are my brother and sister. Well, not quite brother and sister - in fact, they're very distant cousins. Dawkins traces the family tree, and shows precisely how we're all related. He starts with the obvious cases (apes, monkeys), then goes back to other mammals, and then further through reptiles, birds, amphibians, insects, sponges, plants and all the way to protozoa. On the way, he tells you some extraordinary stories. Well, that shouldn't be a surprise; think what interesting stories you hear when you meet up with a friend you used to know well, but haven't seen for a decade. Here, you are in some cases meeting up with people you haven't seen for several hundred million years.At the end, I felt, as I had never felt before, how we're all one family in the plain, everyday sense of the word, and how we're linked though the genes we share, which we've inherited from our common ancestors. It's a truly incredible thought. As Dawkins says on the last page: it's not so much that he disagrees with religious people, it's more that they're saying it the wrong way. If you are yourself a religious person who wants to learn to be closer to God and His Creation, you could do worse than read this book."
1,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/224453-jen,5,"Poor Dawkins - he gets a bad reputation. People think he's mean and nasty and heartless and elitist. Okay, I might have to grant people the ""elitist"" bit, because, well, I'm a bit of an elitist myself. But I dare you all to read this book and then tell me that Dawkins isn't a total squishy. Let's just say this - he stops in the middle of the book to talk about how much he misses Douglas Adams, who was a dear friend of his. He waxes poetic about evolution and how much he wishes he could meet our ancestors. He refers to Olivia Judson's ""Doctor Tatiana's Sex Guide for All Creation,"" makes a brief homage to it, and then sweetly states that he could never do the style justice (making clear along the way that he's read the darned thing, which delights me for reasons that can only be understood by someone else who's read the book, because it's Just That Fabulous). And he puts his wife in the index, even though the references to her are miniscule (and, in fact, much less frequent than in any other book). He credits his research assistant as his co-author. In general, he's a sweetheart.I will stop fangirling the man, now, and simply tell you that the science in this book? Is brilliant, wondrous, and awe-inspiring in its breadth. Fantastic book. "
2,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53165-warwick,4,"There are some facts the simple knowing of which seems to me to be a supreme achievement of our species. The fact that we are all made of stardust. The fact that 99.9999999999999 percent of all matter is empty. The fact that mass and energy can be expressed in terms of each other. Stuff like that.Pre-eminent among these to me, for sheer mind-expanding awe, is the fact that life on this planet has developed precisely once, as far as we know, and everything on earth has evolved from it. That means that when you go outside and lie down in the garden, everything you can see and hear – people walking nearby, their pet dogs, the squirrel darting past, the birds you can hear tweeting, the insects and tiny bugs crawling around underneath you, the trees the birds are standing on, the grass you're lying on, the bacteria in your guts – all of them are your cousins: you're quite literally related to them in the real, genealogical sense.If you go far enough back in time, in other words, you will eventually find a creature whose descendants evolved into both squirrels (say) and people. Indeed, the rules of heredity being what they are, you could even find a single individual who was a common ancestor to every squirrel and human alive. And indeed such an animal really did exist, around 75 million years ago in the Upper Cretaceous. It probably looked sort of mousey, and Dawkins estimates that he or she was our ‘15-million-greats-grandparent’. Squirrels are not ‘closer’ to this creature than humans are: we and they are equally related, having been evolving independently for the same amount of time.The Ancestor's Tale takes exactly this approach to exploring evolution. It starts with humans and works backwards – looking first at the common ancestor between humans and chimpanzees, and continuing until we reach the common ancestor of all life on earth. Dawkins's word for a common ancestor of more than one species is ‘concestor’, and there are only about 40 of them (!) between us and the origin of life more than three billion years ago. The Cretaceous mammal I mentioned above, which evolved into us and squirrels (along with all the other rodents, lagomorphs and primates), is Concestor 10 according to this schema.I think there's a lot of traps you can fall into when you start thinking about evolution. It's easy to feel, instinctively, that evolution is somehow teleological: that it's been working towards – if not us, then at least creatures that are increasingly complex and increasingly intelligent. But that of course is not the case. Things survive that reproduce themselves well, and there are plenty of single-celled organisms still with us that have seen no need to get any more complicated for millions of years. Bacterial life is in fact astonishingly varied and rich, whole phyla of creatures that branched off before multicellular life even came about; indeed, chemically speaking,we are more similar to some bacteria than some bacteria are to other bacteria.Just think about that for a second.Before Dawkins got distracted by religious idiocy, he was well known as being one of the scientists most able to explain complicated ideas in a fresh and accessible way. All his skills are on display in this work. It's not just the zoology and the evolutionary biology, where you'd expect him to be strong; there's also a fantastically lucid explanation of the biochemistry within a cell, and even one of the best explanations of the physics of radioactivity that I've come across. He is calm and careful; he repeats himself where necessary; he shares several teacherly witticisms; and he does all this without ever condescending to the reader. He allows paragraphs of complex material to sit, so that you can read and re-read them a few times before he carries on. Occasionally he cannot stop himself breaking out in exclamations of wonder or poetic meditation – as when he discusses the fossilised footprints of three early hominids from some three-and-a-half million years ago:Who does not wonder what these individuals were to each other, whether they held hands or even talked, and what forgotten errand they shared in a Pliocene dawn?His enthusiasm is infectious. The whole book is a fantastic exploration of this most beautiful piece of modern human understanding. It's full of astonishing anecdotes and scientific details about the natural world, but it also all ties together into a conception of life that's more awe-inspiring and more moving than any supernatural system could ever be."
3,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is the 2016, revised edition of this fabulous book. In this edition, Richard Dawkins is a co-author with Yan Wong. This is a very hefty tome, just under 800 pages. It is a marvelously inventive, masterful look at evolution, as seen from the point of view of homo sapiens travelling backwards in time, back to the dawn of life. Each time the route of evolution reaches a branch point with another species, it is called a Rendezvous; there are 40 rendezvous altogether. The book is extremely interesting and informative. Below I summarize some of the interesting facts I learned.Some creationists point to the so-called gaps in the fossil record as proof that the scientific theory of evolution is not sufficient to explain the development of species. But Dawkins argues that even without any fossils, the evidence for evolution would still be immense. The distributions of species on continents and islands, the patterns of resemblance, an genetic sequences are sufficient to prove evolution. Fossils are a welcome bonus. The gaps in the fossil records are not all that important.The agricultural revolution helped to support a larger population, but did nothing to increase people's health or happiness; in fact it did just the opposite.There is a very interesting discussion about our most recent common ancestor. That is to say, the human who is the common ancestor to all people alive on Earth today. It is very surprising, that the most recent common ancestor lived around 10,000 years ago.Silver foxes bred in captivity by D.K. Belyaev for twenty years were bred for tameness. After twenty years, the foxes behaved like border collies! They became friendly, sought human company, and wagged their tails when approached. They even looked like border collies!We were told when we were young that eating carrots help us see better in the dark. But this was a rumor started by WWII strategists to avoid revealing the secret of radar.The best analogy for genes is not that they serve as a blueprint, but rather that they serve as a toolbox of routines. So, while a large percentage of our genes is in common with those of other animals, our main difference from other animals is not the toolbox of DNA routines, but is instead the pattern of choosing genetic routines from the available toolbox. This is called the science of epigenetics, which has been around since Conrad Weddington coined the term in 1942.In 1866, Ernst Haeckel announced that the hippo is a close relative to the whale. This has since been proven through DNA; the hippo's closest living relative actually is the whale!The duck-billed platypus closes its eyes shut when hunting for food. Its duck bill is a very sensitive organ with 60,000 mechanical and 40,000 electrical sensors. The platypus swivels its bill back and forth, feeling for impulses from potential prey. It probably gets a detailed 3D image of electrical disturbances in its vicinity. It probably is doing some sophisticated beamforming to increase its sensitivity.Dawkins remarks about a lot of interesting speculations why humans are bipedal. He gives a number of arguments both why bipedal walking is helpful, but others why it is not.In 1954, the British Colonial Administration destroyed the ecosystem of Lake Victoria. Against the advice of biologists, the Nile perch was introduced to the lake, which destroyed fifty species of cichlids, and critically endangered another 130 species. This newly introduced predator had caused devastation to the local economies around the lake. This is the reason why bureaucrats should not try to play God, and play around with ecosystems.This raises the question, how did so many species evolve in the lake, in the first place? Dawkins makes some interesting speculations about how various species could be physically isolated in the lake, in order to allow the species to branch out due to evolution.Dawkins makes a strong effort to avoid repeating stories that he told in other books. Instead of repeating them, he makes references to his many other books, for the reader to see additional examples. This is so different from that of many other authors, who often repeat themselves from one book to the next.A variety of human inventions were anticipated in the animal kingdom. Some examples: echo-ranging (bats), electro-location (duckbill platypus), dam (beaver), parabolic reflector (limpet), infrared sensor (snakes), hypodermic syringe (wasp, snake, scorpion), harpoon (cnidarian), jet propulsion (squid). The wheel and axle was also anticipated; the rhizobium has a true axle and a freely rotating hub, driven by a tiny molecular motor. Such a wheel could not evolve in a large organism, which would involve twisting blood vessels.I personally loved the renaming of the concept of Intelligent Designers from ""Argument from Irreducible Complexity"" to ""Argument from Personal Incredulity."" The argument ""says less about nature than about the poverty of your imagination.""Dawkins speculates about what would happen if the ""tape of evolution"" were to be re-run in the forward direction, starting from pre-Cambrian times? What would happen if it were re-run a statistical number of times? Or starting from an earlier or later time? This experiment has, in a sense, been done to a limited extent in isolated locations like Australia, New Zealand, Madagascar and South America. Also, evolution in has turned out very similarly when allowed to run twice. Eyes have evolved independently 40-60 times, using nine independent optical principles!Echolocation has evolved at least four times in four animals; toothed whales, oilbirds, cave swiftlets and bats. The venomous sting has evolved at least ten times independently. True flapping flight has evolved four times. Parachuting and gliding has evolved maybe hundreds of times.These notes above represent only a tiny fraction of the thought-provoking concepts in this book. This is a challenging book to read, not only because it is so long, but because of the many complex concepts that are described. The authors even warn the reader at one point that certain pages can be skipped if desired. But the entire book is fascinating. With each species rendezvous, a fractal diagram portrays the branching, along with dates and contour lines; what a fabulous visual portrayal of the concept of evolution!"
4,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani,4,"The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution, Richard DawkinsThe Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Life is a science book by Richard Dawkins and Yan Wong on the subject of evolution, which follows the path of humans backwards through evolutionary history, describing some of humanity's cousins as they converge on their common ancestors. It was first published in 2004, and substantially updated in 2016.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز چهارم ماه ژانویه سال 2018 میلادیعنوان: داستان نیاکان: سفری به آغاز حیات؛ نویسنده: ریچارد داوکینز؛داستان نیاکان با زیرعنوان «سفری به آغاز حیات» کتاب علمی عمومی نوشتهٔ ریچارد داوکینز در سال 2004 میلادی است؛ که با همکاری دستیار پژوهشی داوکینز، یان ونگ نوشته شده‌ است. این کتاب مسیر انسان در تاریخ تکاملی را از امروز تا گذشته تصویر می‌کند؛ و سفر را از انسان شروع کرده، به سوی پسرخاله‌ های قدیمی او در درخت زندگی می‌رود. در این مسیر به مرور با پسرخاله‌ های قبلی‌تر انسان، به عنوان «نیای مشترک» همگرا می‌شود. کتاب در سال 2005 نامزد جایزهٔ بهترین کتاب علمی اونتیز شد. چکیده: داستان به صورت یک سفر زیارتی روایت شده‌ است، که در آن مسیر همهٔ جانداران مدرن، به سوی منشا حیات پی گرفته می‌شود. انسان‌ها پسرخاله‌ های تکاملی خود را در پاتوق‌های میان راه ملاقات می‌کنند. در این نقاط تبارها منشعب می‌شوند. داوکینز در هرکدام از این نقاط تلاش می‌کند تا با استفاده از شواهد مولکولی و فسیلی، محتمل‌ترین نوع نزدیک‌ترین نیای مشترک را توضیح دهد؛ و در میان مسیر، جانداران مدرنی که در گذشته با انسان هم‌سفر بوده‌ اند را توصیف کند. سفر کلاً از چهل «میعادگاه» تشکیل شده که از «میعادگاه صفر» آغاز می‌شود و به سوی نزدیک‌ترین نیای مشترک انسان تا میعادگاه سی و نهم که باکتری است پیش می‌رود. با این وجود که داوکینز به‌ طور کل از درخت زندگی توصیف شده اطمینان دارد، در برخی از شاخه‌ ها هشدار داده که در زمان نوشتن، از وزنه ی سنگینی از مدارک بهره نداشته‌ است. داوکینز در هر نقطه ی ملاقات در میان سفر، داستان جالبی در مورد جانداران پسرخاله حکایت می‌کند. هر نوع تازه‌ ای اعم از گونه، سرده، و خانواده داستان منحصر بفردی را برای سرگرمی خوانشگر دربردارد. این ویژگی‌های عجیب به وسیلهٔ روش‌های تازهٔ زیست‌شناسی تکاملی شناسایی شده‌ اند، و با دقت در داستان قرار گرفته‌ اند تا نشان دهند چگونه نظریه تکامل داروینی قادر به توضیح همهٔ تنوع حیات بر روی کرهٔ زمین است. در این کتاب داستان‌های شخصی داوکینز در مورد موضوعات نیز به چشم می‌خورد؛ که در آن‌ها داستان‌هایی از دوران کودکی و دانشگاه خود نیز نقل کرده‌ است. برای مثال، او شگفتی خود را از فهمیدن اینکه اسب‌های آبی نزدیک‌ترین خویشاوندان نهنگها هستند را توصیف کرده‌ است. با اینکه کتاب به ترتیب زمانی نوشته شده‌ است، می‌توان هر بخش را به صورت جداگانه هم مطالعه کرد. به‌ طور کلی می‌توان داستان نیاکان را دانشنامه ای دربارهٔ موضوعات اصلی تکامل دانست. ایشان کتاب را به دوست و استاد اسبق داوکینز، جان مینارد اسمیت تقدیم کرده‌ است. ا. شربیانی"
5,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1148633-brian-hodges,5,"This book blew my mind so many times in so many ways. It is quite simply the most fascinating thing I have ever read about life on this planet. Dawkins traces our evolution from the present day back through the very first organisms on earth. He uses various ""rendezvouses"" to show the points where we connected with other species and phyla and what those connections say about us, about our biology and about life in general. By tracing our lineage back through these various “concestors” Dawkins makes you realize just how unique and amazing your own body is… amazing in ways you probably always took for granted. From the way we gestate to the fact that we have a spinal column to the way that our own cells even work. It was never a guarantee that we would have ANY of these things. It seriously makes you wonder how everything might have turned out had different evolutionary pressures been exerted millions, or even billions of years ago. For instance, had a meteorite not wiped out the dinosaurs, “we” would probably still be little more than tiny rodents scavenging for scraps at night while the REAL rulers of the planet slept.Dawkins touches on this latter aspect in the final chapter, with a series of thought experiments about how things might go down if evolution were to “rerun” from the beginning. Which aspects of life would be likely to sprout up again? Which aspects were far-fetched happy accidents? Perhaps one of the most mind blowing statements Dawkins makes is in reference to eukaryotic cells, which comprise every form of life on this planet except for bacteria. The formation of these special and absolutely “necessary” cells was such a long shot evolutionarily speaking that Dawkins doubts it likely to have happened twice. In fact he goes so far as to say he thinks that the formation of eukaryotic cells was probably MORE unfathomable than the initial spark of life itself! Whoever said scientists strip all the magic and wonder out of the universe has obviously never read this book.Dawkins' prose, as always, is fresh, illuminating, and often humorous, explaining heavy concepts so they make perfect sense to a layman. Seriously, if you're interested in this stuff at all, add this one to the very top of your list."
6,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5431286-david,5,"6-stars[NOTE: I like to provide a 6-star rating to a book when it has been able to keep me in a state of amazement almost continuously for at least 80% of its content.]A terrific book on evolution from the vast spectrum of creatures on this planet. Truly, a lot of information has been provided. Can be a bit heavy to people who may not be from a scientific academic background. Almost every topic that I read in the book kept me in a state of awe while I learnt new things. The book is a must-read for anyone who wishes to get mesmerized by stuff that exists on Planet Earth itself! :)HEAVILY RECOMMENDED!!"
7,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14084605-pink,4,"Wow. I like Richard Dawkins. I like what he has to say in The God Delusion and I like his tweets for the same reason. Lots of people don't like his confrontational stand on religion, but don't let that put you off here. First and foremost, he is an amazing scientist. This book is so comprehensive, it is daunting just thinking about it. When I collected it from the library and saw the size, I outwardly groaned, wondering how I would tackle it. I needn't have worried. Dawkins takes us on a 'backwards' pilgrimage through time, showing how we humans joined up with all other living creatures along the way. After getting through half the book and discovering that we'd already passed mammals, birds and fish, I wondered how interested I'd actually be in cnidarians, ctenophores or choanoflagellates, but they proved to be equally as fascinating. Dawkins breaks the information into short chapters, or rendezvous points, relating things back to animals we've already encountered along the way. Yet he doesn't stop there. He shows how we link with fungi, plants and bacteria, before finally considering how the first life forms began and whether or not this could be recreated. What I particularly liked was how Dawkins doesn't make guesswork for periods that we just don't know about. Where dates are so far away that we don't have the full picture (500 million years and counting) Dawkins relates what is known, then tells us the current theories. The gaps still to be filled are not a disappointment, but an exciting prospect of things yet to learn. I don't have a scientific background at all, though I was able to understand most of what I read. I did get confused with some terms and with trying to keep track of the different classifications (kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species) or timescales (eon, era, period, epoch, age) plus all the subdivisions within these. Luckily the book was comprehensive enough that I was able to flip back to an earlier section, or refer to a chart to refamiliarise myself before moving on to the next tale. I was left feeling a little overwhelmed by the end and so I'll finish with a quote from Dawkins that encapsulates things - ""It is not pride in my book but reverence for life itself that encourages me to say, if you want a justification for the latter, open the former, anywhere at random. And reflect on the fact that although this book has been written from a human point of view, another book could have been written in parallel for any 10 million starting pilgrims. Not only is life on this plant amazing, and deeply satisfying, to all those whose senses have not become dulled by familiarity: the very fact that we have evolved the brain power to understand our evolutionary genesis redoubles the amazement and compounds the satisfaction."" "
8,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/442308-gwc,3,"Fascinating zoology but plenty of flotsam. ""The Beaver's Tale"" ""The Duckbill's Tale"" and ""The Axolotl's Tale"" are outstanding examples of modern naturalism. The classical genetics is adequate but the molecular data is explained minimally and not compelling. More details on the challenges and uncertainties inherent in genomic sequencing and cross-species comparisons would have been helpful. When Dawkins is not discussing zoology the writing is overly verbose, and suffers the professor's conceit of assuming his readers are interested in his opinions on matters beyond his expertise which are infused with the type of absolutism he criticizes elsewhere in the book. The poor, strangely moralistic mathematics and tired political rants are best left for the faculty lounge or starry-eyed students. This is a good 600-page book that could be a great 300-page book with some vigorous editing."
9,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57901-jerzy,5,"Fantastic! If I'd read this in high school I would definitely be a biologist by now.Often I agree with Dawkins' views on creationists, but usually he's an obnoxious ass about it. Thankfully, in this book he only disses them occasionally. For most of the book he sticks to his strengths, i.e., clear and exciting explanations of the beautiful yet structured diversity of the natural world.Lots of nifty thoughts about how evolution works and how mind-shatteringly cool life is. There's an interesting structure to the book, traveling backwards in time from today to the origin of life, and telling tales or lessons from each of our major ancestors along the way. It made me appreciate how much more there is to life than the small handful of mammals, fish, birds, and trees we usually think about."
10,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4788401-lee-harmon,5,"While I read different genres, I only review books with a religious content. So, if I may be excused for one of my “liberal Christian rants,” let me say this: It’s a sad day when a book about evolution earns a spot on the shelves of a religion blog. It simply astounds me that half of all Americans still do not believe in evolution. The evidence is so overwhelmingly against a young earth that if Christianity is going to survive, it must pull its head out of the sand and reinterpret the Bible’s creation story (anything but a literal interpretation!) before it alienates the coming generation, who will simply know better.This book will help. I’m not a fan of Dawkins’ anti-religion tirades, but when he sticks to his evolutionary biology, his writing is a pure delight. It’s insightful, highly intelligent, and witty. The subtitle of the book is A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution, and it’s a long journey backward in time from present-day humans to the beginnings of life four million years ago.You’ll meet Cro-Magnon man, the Neanderthals, chimpanzees and gorillas, monkeys, rodents and rabbits, reptiles, sharks, flatworms, sponges, fungi, plants, and far more, each with their own unique role and story to tell.Scientific understanding is, and ever will be, in a state of transition. As we learn, we shape our theories to fit the facts. It’s an exploration that never ends, an exciting quest for truth that Dawkins excels in sharing. He stops often along this journey back in time to introduce interesting life forms and their evolutionary sidebars, evoking wonder and appreciation for the real creation story that far exceeds any ancient tales. It’s such a treat that I’m almost envious of long-time creationists who can, by opening their minds and turning the cover of this book, open themselves up to a new world of wonder.You will see the world in a different way after reading this."
11,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"Richard Dawkins' ""the ancestor's tale"" is the story of all life on Earth told in reverse order. It starts from us ""moderns"" and goes back to our closer cousins, all the way back to the common ancestor of all life on Earth. Dawkins uses the word ""concestor"" to refer to a common ancestor. It's a fascinating tale. Even though I had to go through nearly 800 pages, I wasn't bored in one single moment. There were times, of course, when it got a little more technical, but all in all I learned so much since a wealth of information is presented in each chapter. We are all African apes. Chimpanzees are our closest cousins and we share roughly 98 percent of our genes with them. You learn that natural selection grants no possibility of foresight. In other words, evolution does not plan ahead. To Alfred Wallace and Charles Darwin, co-discoverers of natural selection, the geographical aspect of natural history gave away the fact of evolution. If species were created independently, why should a Creator choose to put 50 species of lemur on Madagascar, but nowhere else? Why should the Galapagos host a set of finches so different from species on other oceanic islands, but strikingly similar both to each other and to birds on the nearest mainland? For Darwin, peahens choose peacocks simply because, in their eyes, they are pretty (sexual selection). For Alfred Wallace, there's something more than the outward appearance. The bright feathers are a token of their underlying health and fitness. In the fruit fly tale, we learn about DNA mechanism. Textbooks of biology are wrong when they describe DNA as a blueprint. Embryos do nothing remotely like following a blueprint. DNA is not a description in any language, of what the finished body should look like. On this planet, embryos follow recipes. Creationists foolishly liken darwinian natural selection to a hurricane blowing through a junkyard and having the luck to assemble a Boeing 747. They are wrong, of course, for they completely miss the gradual, cumulative nature of natural selection."
12,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/350233-casey,4,"After finishing The Selfish Gene, I rushed out to the store to buy another of Dawkins' books. While the size of this tome was quite intimidating, I found the premise utterly fascinating. The narrative traces humans' evolutionary ancestry, from primates to ""concestor zero,"" or the beginning of life on Earth.Dawkins' knowledge of zoology shines as he gives examples of the fascinating animals that share some of our genes. Readers will undoubtedly learn about plants and animals they had never heard of before, from Australian marsupials to the strange creatures that inhabit Madagascar. The book reads like a novel, and after finishing it I feel more connected, not just to my own species, but to all the creatures around me that share in this crazy thing called life."
13,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81791013-michael-kress,4,"Dawkins was the author who made me realize how fascinating evolutionary biology is. I had read a few of his books before I started this one, but they were all around 300 to 400 pages. This one is 614 pages. It goes back in time, starting in the present moment until we finally reach the dawn of evolution. What an interesting way to write a book! It tells the stories of many species and the common ancestors that we share with them. As the book progresses, our cousins get more and more distant. Eve's Tale explains how the Y chromosome was passed down from mother to daughter through all generations and can be traced back to a hypothetical “Eve.” The Peacock's Tale explains how male peacocks evolved colorful, flashy looking feathers to attract a mate. The Dodo's Tale is a sad story about extinction. Dodos never had to deal with predators, so they never evolved any ways of escaping from them. When humans arrived on their island, they were so slow and easy to kill that they went extinct in a short period of time. There are many more stories like these in the book. The ending of the book is well written and comes around full circle in a cool way. If you've never read anything by Dawkins, I would recommend The Selfish Gene or River Out of Eden. But if you have already read a few of his books, this is a good one that goes a little more in depth."
14,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,5,"Richard Dawkins has done an astounding job producing this book. If it were not for his other great works, The Selfish Gene and The Extended Phenotype: The Long Reach of the Gene, The Ancestor's Tale would be his best work in evolutionary science. It matters not one bit that it's a summary and synthesis of others' primary work: great scientists have always been able to look out across their field of expertise and write a defining work of value for both scientists and the educated public.My only, slight, quibble with the book is that in the decade since it was published there has been significant change in many parts of the ""tree of life."" More species have been discovered, more fossils found. Most importantly, molecular analysis across species of shared genetic haplotypes and DNA from mitochondria has unleashed a tidal wave of new information allowing a more precise determination of our common ancestors, especially the most distant. Dawkins used the earlier results of this same research when writing this book in 2003, but he notes in the book itself that it would have to be revised soon with new information. That, of course, is the way of science and what makes it exciting.Thus, I'm happy to find that the second, updated, edition will be published in early 2016 (see here: The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Life) with the latest scientific developments and additional evolution-relevant species ""tales."" I hope that one of these is ""told"" by a member of the fascinating Fungi—one of the three great multicellular kingdoms—with which we share an unidentified common ancestor roughly 1.1 billion years ago. The original edition naturally includes this rendezvous along with background information, but omits the tale.Should you wait for the new edition? No, unless your a critic of fine detail. The deep time and awesome diversity of evolution will not change. Our place as a species relative to the rest of life will not shift. And Dawkins' inspiring prose will remain."
15,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"What an interesting way to look at evolution, from the present back into the past in the format of & a homage to Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales. He chose 40 major stops along the journey & told some great tales. Thankfully, these were usually from his perspective so there wasn't any foolishness, but he was entertaining.I found the backward format a really good way of cementing various relationships into my mind better. There was a lot of new (to me) & fascinating material about how evolution works. He came up with great examples & occasionally wandered into other interesting areas such as human races.“Natural selection is a beguiling counterfeiter of deliberate purpose.”“Evolution, or its driving engine natural selection, has no foresight. In every generation within every species, the individuals best equipped to survive and reproduce contribute more than their fair share of genes to the next generation. The consequence, blind as it is, is the nearest approach to foresight that nature permits."" I've read several other books on evolution by Dawkins, so there was some repetition, but he cut down on much of that himself by referencing where he originally went into detail. As an audiobook read by him & Ward, it was fantastic, as always. Highly recommended."
16,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"Dawkins presents evolutionary biology in a Chaucerian format. As with the pilgrims in The Canterbury Tales, each of Dawkins tales is about pilgrims on their way to a common destination, in this case the beginning of life. Each group of species marches back in time rendezvousing where they share their most recent common ancestor, what Dawkins calls a “Concester”. The first rendezvous is six million years ago (6 Ma) where we, our Homo and Australopithecine ancestors share a Concestor with the chimpanzees, bonobos and their ancestors. Dawkins describes 40 rendezvous such as the apes meet the monkeys at 25 Ma, the primates meet the rodents and rabbits at 75 Ma, the chordates meet the echinoderms at 550 Ma and ending with bacteria. Working backwards helps eliminate hindsight, assuming that a creature evolved in a certain way because in the future it would be important. Each tale not only describes some life form but some aspect of science associated with it. For example we learn how scientists use the fossil record and genetic techniques as evaluation tools. He shows how dates and evolutionary branches are derived from genetics using mitochondrial DNA, the Y chromosome and triangulation of DNA sequences. He explains how dates are determined using dendrochronology (tree rings), paleomagnetism, and radioactive decay. As we follow the path of evolution in reverse, we learn the science behind it.I read the updated 2016 version coauthored with Yan Wang. It reflects recent discoveries such as those of the Denisovans, whose story takes the place of the Neanderthals in the earlier version. Improvements in DNA extraction and sequencing enabled scientists in 2009 to derive the entire genome of a Denisovian from a 40,000 year old fingertip. There are many other revisions and corrections to the first edition published in 2006. In another update convergent replaces related development to explain the origin of many flightless birds such as the Dodo. Genetic studies now show they are descended from pigeons that became isolated on remote islands where they thrived growing big and losing their wings. Our understanding of the tree of life is always changing. Below are other samples of Dawkins’ discussions that caught my attention.Dawkins presents evolution as a flow of groups of individuals. Species arise when intermediate creatures become extinct. But as evolution occurs there are no distinct lines. A variety of archaic Homo sapiens blurred the dividing line between Homo erectus and modern Homo sapiens. Classification can be arbitrary and is often contested. New genes work their way through the group and if the group is isolated from other groups eventually it becomes distinct. This all takes time. If closely related groups come in contact with each other there is hybridization. Modern humans apparently interbred with Neanderthals 45000 years ago even though the two lines had separated 500,000 years before that. Similarly modern humans interbred with Denisovans. Dawkins offers perspective citing the ring species. He points to California salamanders in mountains that form a circle around the Central Valley. At the southern end two distinct populations won’t interbreed, but each population interbreeds with its neighbors in the other direction. This interbreeding continues uninterrupted all around the mountains coming back to the neighbors that won’t interbreed. There is an unbroken chain between the two. Are they separate species? Similarly gulls that won’t interbreed in Britain interbreed with their neighbors to the east and west forming a continuous chain around the world ending with each other. Like the salamanders, the gulls are connected to each other through the unbroken chain until at the ends the differences seem to have become too great. Dawkins uses the ring species as an example of what happens with all species through time. There is a similar uninterrupted chain from us to our australopithecine ancestors and to the beginning of life. Only the demise of intermediaries lets us define species. Was the most recent common ancestor, Concester, of humans and chimpanzees bipedal? Some scientists believe this is the case. The chimpanzee may have reverted to knuckle walking. What drove bipedalism in the first place? Ability to see over tall grass, ability to carry food back to a mate, ability to squat feed for long periods when snails and worms were more abundant than fruit, or as Dawkins thinks, sexual selection? Even back then females may have liked their mates to stand tall. They and/or their males may also have preferred less body hair. No other ape lost its hair so sexual selection as opposed to natural selection seems reasonable. In most animals females select their mates, but Darwin thought that men selected women for less body hair. Whichever way, both sexes would be affected. A mate with a bigger brain may also have curried favor.Dawson educates us on plate tectonics and its evolutionary effects. The formation and breakup of Pangea into Laurasia and Gondwana had significant implications for the diversity of life. Subsequent breakups isolating Madagascar and Australia explain their unique animals. We get the Platypus Tale. Is the platypus primitive? It had as much time to evolve as we have. It lays eggs and has a bill but what a bill – supersensitive to movement and electric field disturbances. What other mammal can locate its prey without listening, seeing or touching it? Dawkins explores the nerve connections between bill and brain and speculates that the platypus visualizes the feedback from its bill just as we do the feedback from our eyes.Dawkins’ tale of the sea squirt shows the tongue and cheek that is sprinkled through his writing. This amazing creature starts out with a notochord and nervous system making it a chordate, a member of our phylum. It looks like a tadpole as a juvenile swimming around then in its adult stage, it lands head first on a rock and permanently attaches itself. It digests its nerve system, notochord and other parts and turns into a big bag that filters the plankton from seawater. Dawkins digresses ”A second Aldous Huxley might project fictional human longevity to the point where some super-Methuselah finally settles down on his head and metamorphoses into a giant sea squirt, fastened permanently to the sofa in front of a television.” Perhaps today we should substitute tablet or phone for TV. In either case, once settled, Dawkins notes that it “eats its brain, like an associate professor getting tenure.” We are entertained by the stories of many other bizarre creatures, behaviors and relationships. Who would, aside from a zoologist, think of the echinoderm (starfish, sea cucumber, etc.) as sharing the most recent common ancestor we have with another phylum? The starfish’s radial design means it has no front or back, left or right. It may lead with any of its five legs. Its nerve cord forms a circle. Its anus is on top and mouth on bottom. Yet the molecular biologists say its genes show it evolved from a bilateral animal just like us.What about the bdelloid rotifers? All of these tiny aquatic animals are female. There is no need for males, no shared gene pool. Each rotifer reproduces a new organism with two sets of chromosomes as do animals that reproduce sexually. Thus over the millennia as mutations accumulate the genes will become even more diverse than those in a shared pool. Millions of years of asexual reproduction have resulted in more than 450 species of these unique creatures. Then there are the animals that keep their males in place – literally. Some trigger fish females carry their diminutive males on their sides for use when and as needed. Some scale insect females carry their males as mere specs on their legs.Dawkins explores the beginning of life. He looks at RNA World theory which holds that life started with RNA as both a replicator and an enzyme, in essence a self-replicating catalyst. He points to experiments that show segments of RNA taken from viruses can replicate and evolve in water. He discusses the idea of life forming in rocks, going even further afield than theories about life starting around hydrothermal vents. He point out that cracks in rocks are teeming with bacteria that live off of chemical processes without benefit of the sun. Finally he ponders the different ways life could have evolved. If we went back to the beginning and started all over again what would life be like today? What aspects have been convergent and which contingent. Many features evolved more than once, for example eyes, echolocation, and flight. Others such as our big brains and use of language evolved only once. Perhaps most significant is the incorporation of bacteria into archaea forming mitochondria which made life for us eukaryotes possible. Nick Lane argues in his book Power, Sex, Suicide that this event would be unlikely to ever be repeated.The Ancestor’s Tale is a tour de force, a comprehensive view of evolutionary biology full of fascinating details about diverse life forms. It is packed with the latest scientific theories. Above all it demonstrates the interconnectedness of all life. This clearly is heartfelt by Dawkins. His awe and enthusiasm for his subject is infectious. Reading it was an experience. After 700 pages, I was sorry it was over. For those with a serious interest I can’t recommend it highly enough."
17,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,5,"I love this book. It's not the kind of thing I usually read, because I prefer fiction to non-fiction by far, at least when I have a choice about it. And I really, really loathe Dawkins' The God Delusion, largely because of the tone he takes toward people who are religious believers. But The Ancestor's Tale is mostly just science, and it's written in an accessible, almost conversational way. It actually has literary ancestors (ha), in the form of The Canterbury Tales, which Dawkins chose as his format to tell the tale of a pilgrimage through history to find our ancestors. He does slip in some references to his own beliefs, but here they aren't too offensive or intrusive.When I say 'accessible', I don't mean 'dumbed down'. The science and maths and the theory and the sheer detail is here. I read a couple of reviews that people found it boring once it got to a certain point because there's 'too much detail' about things like bacteria. Which I think is more of a 'your mileage may vary' attitude than anything -- I think Dawkins gave the space to the bacteria that they deserve, all things considered.There's a lot of speculation in here, too -- but so much of science is speculation. Dawkins is fairly clear about when he can and can't 'prove' things, and explains the methods by which they can be proved if they can. You don't have to have a huge knowledge of science or maths to understand -- some, and an interest in it, I suppose, but not so very very much."
18,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14115149-jaclynn,4,"Not recommended for those with a passing interest in evolution...this is heavy into the math and science realms.

The first rendezvous is six million years ago (6 Ma) where we, our Homo and Australopithecine ancestors share a Concestor with the chimpanzees, bonobos and their ancestors. There are so many thought-provoking concepts in this book, but this is a challenging book to read, not only because it is so long, but because of the many complex concepts that are described. But the entire book is fascinating. With each species rendezvous, a fractal diagram portrays the branching, along with dates and contour lines; what a fabulous visual portrayal of the concept of evolution! I am continually amazed the genius of Dawkins...this book is so comprehensive, it is daunting just thinking about it, let alone researching and writing it!"
19,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/270879-robin,5,"This is my favorite book in the whole world. Someday it may be eclipsed by something else but for now it's this. What I love most about this book is the number of times I found myself thinking, ""Wow, I had no idea"". It makes perfect sense when you think it out, but the entire premise of the book, that every living thing on earth, from human being to plant to bacteria, shares a common ancestor, that actually existed at a point sufficiently far enough in the past. The book consists of a ""pilgrimage"" to that ancestor modeled loosely after ""The Canterbury Tales"". "
20,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44504-brian,5,"I've been a fan of Dawkins for a while solely based on interviews, but this is the first of his books I've actually read. It works its way backwards through the evolutionary tree, detailing how all living things are related - how a stranger on the street, your dog, your house plant, bacteria and you are all distant cousins. It's a fascinating read, technical enough if you're interested, but not so much so that it's threatening to the non-science minded. It's broken into various ""tales"" - ""The Howler Monkey's Tale"", ""The Hippo's Tale"", ""The Blind Cave Fish's Tale"" - a la Chaucer - which makes the size of the book a bit less daunting. Best of all, it's excellent ammunition for the next time you find yourself in a debate with someone arguing for ""intelligent design."""

With a form based loosely on Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, Dawkins marches back in time to each of humankind's ancestors. Witty, brilliant and engaging, you will learn a great deal about evolutionary biology, and a million fun and intriguing facts. Whether you agree to disagree with the facts establishing evolution as a law of science, this book is worth your time.

Yep."
23,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,4,"Hefty Tome That Explains Evolution in Great DetailIf you have a hardcopy of this book, you know just how thick it is, and how dense the content is. Each chapter is another essay on the incredible mechanisms by which selective mutation, adaptation, and reproduction over millions of generations have led to the plethora of life on Earth, and how the process is not directed by a divine being waving life into existence, but rather an unfathomable number of successes and failures among individual creatures, with the only measure of success being reproduction, can lead to such a mind-boggling diversity of species.Dawkin's recurring theme as he delves further and further back to our more distant common ancestors is that evolution, while not directed from above, can often lead to convergence at similar outcomes, such as the independent development of eyes (truly a miracle of gradual evolution), sonar, poison, and various survival mechanisms in different locations and eras over hundreds of millions of years. While I think many readers, no matter how educated or knowledgeable they may be about evolutionary biology, may still struggle to accept that all this complexity and diversity is not a result of ""intelligent design"", I think Dawkins makes the case repeatedly and in great logical detail, and in the end it is we ourselves, as conscious and thinking intelligent beings, that can recognize and understand that we would not exist if it weren't for these incredible mechanisms over vast ages that have produced ourselves and all other life from microscopic life billions of years ago, our common ancestor."
24,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11331153-andy,5,"Your 30-million-greats-grandparent was a shrew. Your 270-million-greats-grandparent from over half a billion years ago looked like this worm. Did I mention that its mouth doubled as its anus? This book is filled with ways ways of making you feel very small. This is the type of book that doesn't let you ever see the world the same again, and proves that religion doesn't have a lock on the feelings of awe and the sublime.In an article from 2009 ""Growing Up in Ethology"" Dawkins describes this book as ""the largest and most demanding of my career"" noting that he almost gave up on it several times. It's understandable, apart from the contents, this book is audacious in its scope and detail. I got so deep into it that I was having recurrent dreams about its concepts and creatures.There's a lot of fascinating stories here -- too many to mention but I can't help going through many of them. When reading this I wanted to tell people how amazing this is, but I don't know too many people that are interested in science, so pardon me, this is my outlet. These are some that stuck me as particularly noteworthy.>>The Axolotl's Tale is about ""pedomorphosis"" which is where the juvenile of a species can become sexually mature without fully developing into an adult, and so it and its offspring never do. The axolotl does look like a larval-salamander hybrid which remains in the water. Many species carry within them the ""instructions"" to metamorphize through various stages (tadpoles into frogs for example), so strictly in theory, they could go backward too. This happens in newts which start as a larva, then emerge on land for some years, then return to water and regain some larval characteristics. It's speculated many species we see could be ""between stages"" like ostriches. As big as they are, they're actually juvenile chickens with their stubby wings. Some have speculated we are juvenile chimps and Dawkins doesn't entirely discount this idea.>>The Hippo's Tale was an amazing explanation of their close genetic relationship to whales, and how certain land animals returned to the water and became ""fish,"" evolving quickly because water-living took away their struggle with gravity. Likely there was a common ancestor which split into camels (and others) on one side, and hippo's/whales on the other, but we shouldn't imagine the ancestor necessarily looked like either. I also didn't know that camels originally evolved in what would have been considered North America, during a period when the position of the continents looked much different.>>The Howler Monkey's Tale explained how mammals lost their color vision due to becoming nocturnal shrew-like creatures during the age of the dinosaurs when they had to hide underground and only emerge at night. After the dinosaurs died off they re-emerged and re-gained the ability to see color which they'd retained in their genes, but this ability has been ""re-enabled"" in many independent ways.>>The Lungfish's Tale explains how we likely emerged from the water for the first time, and explores various fish today that ""walk"" on land for short periods. It is likely that our ancestor developed the ability to walk because it was attempting to get BACK into water from tide pools that left it stranded away from food sources.>>The Galapagos Finch's Tale showed in a powerful way how quickly evolution can occur due to certain ""bottlenecks"" or die-offs.>>The Fruit Fly's Tale's explanation of Hox genes and how they control the development of an embryo. This chapter takes a fairly complex concept and makes it understandable.>>The Lamprey's Tale tells about how different their haemoglobin genes (for carrying oxygen in the blood) are from ours. We split off from a common ancestor long, long ago and duplicated our genes for globin several times while lamprey's are from a very ancient ancestor, they predate this split and use much older globin genes. They independently evolved a system for oxygen carrying, as birds and bats independently evolved flight.And ""independent"" or ""convergent"" evolution is another big theme here. There are a couple of chapters that touch on how geographic distance evolves specialized species, some of which take up similar niches and roles that are found in other continents. Australia for example has evolved its version of the dog, the flying squirrel, the mole, etc. Dawkins sees the kangaroo as a sort of hopping version of the gazelle, and makes a good case for it.>>The Brine Shrimp's Tale explains how vertebrates are likely descended from worms that learned to swim on their backs, and adapted their internal organs for such. The Brine Shrimp's organs have similarly adapted so that it is no longer technically swimming ""upside down."" Some catfish today swim upside down and have started to adapt a camouflage system that is essentially the opposite of those who swim normally, i.e. their bellies are darker than their backs.>>The Rotifer's Tale explores asexual reproduction, how originally pairs of chromosomes became independent from one another by gradual mutations, whereas our pairs are copies of one another. Dawkins engages in an interesting discussion about whether sex is really necessary, and the natural selection pressure benefits it creates.>>In the Salamander's Tale Dawkins explores ""ring species."" The Central Valley of California has a section of mountains which form a ring around a valley. Salamanders live in the mountains around the valley, but do not venture into the valley itself. Those on the east side appear quite different from the western one, but in fact they are the same species and form a vast ring of gradual differentiation in coloring, those on the opposite sides are just too far from one another to interbreed. This is seen in a species of gull that forms a ring species that encircles the whole Earth! Dawkins makes the point that we humans could be a ""ring species"" too if the intermediates between us and the chimpanzees had not died off. When viewed this way it totally blurs the lines when thinking of separate species to begin with.>>The lengthy penultimate chapter ""Canterbury"" was the best thing I've read and better than any documentaries I've seen on how life theoretically began. Dawkins is honest about the many challenges, and lists a variety of scientific experiments which show how these can be overcome, at least in theory. He goes into detail about enzymes, mRNA, tRNA and ribosomes and makes it all understandable. Some textbook diagrams would have been appreciated, but the descriptions are still well-handled.There's many more examples of course. This book in the updated 2016 edition is over 700 pages and although this is the only book on evolution I've read, I imagine I'd be hard-pressed to find another that goes into this level of detail while still being this reader-friendly. Dawkins strikes a good balance.It's worth mentioning that this is a challenging read at times, primarily in the early chapters. (The chapter on Gibbon monkeys particularly so, but don't get discouraged!) At times there was more focus on methods than I probably wanted. For example, I don't need two pages of explanation of logarithmic graphing, I'll take your word for it that the graph is accurate.This book fits well with my overall ""Ligottian"" cosmic perspective on life. At one point in ""The Beaver's Tale"" Dawkins remarks, ""Do you protest that there aren’t ‘really’ any genes for behaviour; only genes for the nerves and muscles that make the behaviour? You are still wrecked among heathen dreams."" He doesn't exactly call us puppets of biology, he's subtler than that, but he makes a compelling argument. He uses the phrase ""clockwork mechanism,"" and a bit later in the same chapter he discusses how beavers held in a bare room will attempt to make dams when there's nothing at all there. That really put things in perspective.Dawkins very rarely speaks on religion or creationism in this book, he assumes the reader believes evolution is true -- which it is. But he does leave us with this, with which I wholeheartedly agree:""My objection to supernatural beliefs is precisely that they miserably fail to do justice to the sublime grandeur of the real world. They represent a narrowing-down from reality, an impoverishment of what the real world has to offer.""I've thought something like this for years, and reading this book can only open eyes to how amazing the real world is."

In order to better explain evolutionary science, Dawkins metaphorically borrows Chaucer's journey to Canterbury to travel back in time. We start in the present day, and then examine our common ancestors from mammals, to birds, reptiles, etc... all the way back to bacteria and how life itself may have come to be. It's a compelling argument.The book is full of ideas to contemplate. For example, in ""The Peacock's Tale"" chapter, he addresses human bare skin and why. ""Humans don't just have bare skin on their rumps like monkeys. They have bare skin all over, except on the top of the head, under the arms and in the pubic region. When we get ectoparasites such as lice, they are often confined to these very regions. Lice need hair, and Pagel and Bodmer's first suggestion is that the benefit of losing our body hair was that it reduced the real estate available to lice. Two questions arise. Why, if losing hair is such a good idea, have other mammals who also suffer from ectoparasites kept theirs?"" (And why is it still retained on our heads, etc...?)I won't give away the answers, but the analysis is thoughtful and persuasive. This is not a beach read. It demands your attention and concentration in order to consider the themes presented. I thought the time invested in the book was time well spent. 5 stars."

He starts the journey working backwards, beginning with Homo Sapiens and then the earliest bipedal apes like Homo Habilis, then ending with the earliest replicating life, the one that would've started it all billions of years ago. Unfortunately, it didn't leave any fossils behind (soft-body creatures tend not to sadly but it has happened at a site in China) but if we work the molecular clock backwards we can deduce that somewhere in the 'primordial soup' a molecule began to copy itself, and it was really good at it.As we meet the different pilgrims Dawkins explains how evolution shaped life in the most exciting and unusual ways. Some creatures on our planet function in the most ridiculous ways. I don't wish to spoil these parts but it is awe-inspiring for sure.This was a fun and truly educating read for me. I learned so much about the different kinds of life that inhabit our planet. Human beings are just one tiny branch in the grand tree of life.

30,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"On Monday, an old friend came round to lunch, and, while we were having a cup of tea in the living room, remarked on the number of Richard Dawkins books on my shelf. Somehow, I'd never heard that she'd actually had Dawkins as a supervisor for one term when she was an undergraduate at Oxford in the late 70s; it was in connection with the course she was reading on animal behaviour. I asked what he was like as a person, and she was unenthusiastic. Clearly very intelligent, but there was something about him that she found disquieting. She wouldn't go so far as to say that he'd behaved inappropriately, there was never a specific incident she could point to, but she constantly felt that he was just an inch from the line. Well... charismatic, thirty-something male supervisor, attractive young female undergraduate, animal behaviour, you can see plenty of scope for that. And she said that, even then, he'd go on about religion. After a while, she became increasingly sure that his hostile feelings were rooted in some kind of personal disappointment he'd suffered, though she had no idea what it might have been.I asked her which Dawkins she'd read, and, like most people, it was The Selfish Gene and The God Delusion. She hadn't particularly liked either one. I can sympathize with her point of view. But, as other reviewers here have said, Dawkins is a more complex person than he's generally given credit for, and if you read The Ancestor's Tale you'll see another side. I suppose one could say that he's attacking religion here too, but the strategy is completely the opposite of the blunt, in-your-face assault he uses in the The God Delusion; to my mind, it's also far more effective. Rather than tell you what's ugly and wrong about Intelligent Design, he concentrates his energies on showing you what's beautiful and right about evolution, and how, far from contradicting traditional religious beliefs, it reveals them with a clarity that previous generations have been unable to see. I kept thinking of Saint Francis of Assisi, and his love of all living creatures. ""Brother bird, sister ant""... they're beautiful poetic phrases. But what do they mean? Evidently, this finch can't literally be my brother. There is no way that my mother could have given birth to him. The conventional explanation is that we're both ""children of God"", which is fine as far as it goes; the problem is that it doesn't really shed much light on the nature of our relationship. The astonishing thing about evolution, which forms the core of this book, is that it shows how the bird and ant truly are my brother and sister. Well, not quite brother and sister - in fact, they're very distant cousins. Dawkins traces the family tree, and shows precisely how we're all related. He starts with the obvious cases (apes, monkeys), then goes back to other mammals, and then further through reptiles, birds, amphibians, insects, sponges, plants and all the way to protozoa. On the way, he tells you some extraordinary stories. Well, that shouldn't be a surprise; think what interesting stories you hear when you meet up with a friend you used to know well, but haven't seen for a decade. Here, you are in some cases meeting up with people you haven't seen for several hundred million years.At the end, I felt, as I had never felt before, how we're all one family in the plain, everyday sense of the word, and how we're linked though the genes we share, which we've inherited from our common ancestors. It's a truly incredible thought. As Dawkins says on the last page: it's not so much that he disagrees with religious people, it's more that they're saying it the wrong way. If you are yourself a religious person who wants to learn to be closer to God and His Creation, you could do worse than read this book."
31,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/224453-jen,5,"Poor Dawkins - he gets a bad reputation. People think he's mean and nasty and heartless and elitist. Okay, I might have to grant people the ""elitist"" bit, because, well, I'm a bit of an elitist myself. But I dare you all to read this book and then tell me that Dawkins isn't a total squishy. Let's just say this - he stops in the middle of the book to talk about how much he misses Douglas Adams, who was a dear friend of his. He waxes poetic about evolution and how much he wishes he could meet our ancestors. He refers to Olivia Judson's ""Doctor Tatiana's Sex Guide for All Creation,"" makes a brief homage to it, and then sweetly states that he could never do the style justice (making clear along the way that he's read the darned thing, which delights me for reasons that can only be understood by someone else who's read the book, because it's Just That Fabulous). And he puts his wife in the index, even though the references to her are miniscule (and, in fact, much less frequent than in any other book). He credits his research assistant as his co-author. In general, he's a sweetheart.I will stop fangirling the man, now, and simply tell you that the science in this book? Is brilliant, wondrous, and awe-inspiring in its breadth. Fantastic book. "
32,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53165-warwick,4,"There are some facts the simple knowing of which seems to me to be a supreme achievement of our species. The fact that we are all made of stardust. The fact that 99.9999999999999 percent of all matter is empty. The fact that mass and energy can be expressed in terms of each other. Stuff like that.Pre-eminent among these to me, for sheer mind-expanding awe, is the fact that life on this planet has developed precisely once, as far as we know, and everything on earth has evolved from it. That means that when you go outside and lie down in the garden, everything you can see and hear – people walking nearby, their pet dogs, the squirrel darting past, the birds you can hear tweeting, the insects and tiny bugs crawling around underneath you, the trees the birds are standing on, the grass you're lying on, the bacteria in your guts – all of them are your cousins: you're quite literally related to them in the real, genealogical sense.If you go far enough back in time, in other words, you will eventually find a creature whose descendants evolved into both squirrels (say) and people. Indeed, the rules of heredity being what they are, you could even find a single individual who was a common ancestor to every squirrel and human alive. And indeed such an animal really did exist, around 75 million years ago in the Upper Cretaceous. It probably looked sort of mousey, and Dawkins estimates that he or she was our ‘15-million-greats-grandparent’. Squirrels are not ‘closer’ to this creature than humans are: we and they are equally related, having been evolving independently for the same amount of time.The Ancestor's Tale takes exactly this approach to exploring evolution. It starts with humans and works backwards – looking first at the common ancestor between humans and chimpanzees, and continuing until we reach the common ancestor of all life on earth. Dawkins's word for a common ancestor of more than one species is ‘concestor’, and there are only about 40 of them (!) between us and the origin of life more than three billion years ago. The Cretaceous mammal I mentioned above, which evolved into us and squirrels (along with all the other rodents, lagomorphs and primates), is Concestor 10 according to this schema.I think there's a lot of traps you can fall into when you start thinking about evolution. It's easy to feel, instinctively, that evolution is somehow teleological: that it's been working towards – if not us, then at least creatures that are increasingly complex and increasingly intelligent. But that of course is not the case. Things survive that reproduce themselves well, and there are plenty of single-celled organisms still with us that have seen no need to get any more complicated for millions of years. Bacterial life is in fact astonishingly varied and rich, whole phyla of creatures that branched off before multicellular life even came about; indeed, chemically speaking,we are more similar to some bacteria than some bacteria are to other bacteria.Just think about that for a second.Before Dawkins got distracted by religious idiocy, he was well known as being one of the scientists most able to explain complicated ideas in a fresh and accessible way. All his skills are on display in this work. It's not just the zoology and the evolutionary biology, where you'd expect him to be strong; there's also a fantastically lucid explanation of the biochemistry within a cell, and even one of the best explanations of the physics of radioactivity that I've come across. He is calm and careful; he repeats himself where necessary; he shares several teacherly witticisms; and he does all this without ever condescending to the reader. He allows paragraphs of complex material to sit, so that you can read and re-read them a few times before he carries on. Occasionally he cannot stop himself breaking out in exclamations of wonder or poetic meditation – as when he discusses the fossilised footprints of three early hominids from some three-and-a-half million years ago:Who does not wonder what these individuals were to each other, whether they held hands or even talked, and what forgotten errand they shared in a Pliocene dawn?His enthusiasm is infectious. The whole book is a fantastic exploration of this most beautiful piece of modern human understanding. It's full of astonishing anecdotes and scientific details about the natural world, but it also all ties together into a conception of life that's more awe-inspiring and more moving than any supernatural system could ever be."
33,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is the 2016, revised edition of this fabulous book. In this edition, Richard Dawkins is a co-author with Yan Wong. This is a very hefty tome, just under 800 pages. It is a marvelously inventive, masterful look at evolution, as seen from the point of view of homo sapiens travelling backwards in time, back to the dawn of life. Each time the route of evolution reaches a branch point with another species, it is called a Rendezvous; there are 40 rendezvous altogether. The book is extremely interesting and informative. Below I summarize some of the interesting facts I learned.Some creationists point to the so-called gaps in the fossil record as proof that the scientific theory of evolution is not sufficient to explain the development of species. But Dawkins argues that even without any fossils, the evidence for evolution would still be immense. The distributions of species on continents and islands, the patterns of resemblance, an genetic sequences are sufficient to prove evolution. Fossils are a welcome bonus. The gaps in the fossil records are not all that important.The agricultural revolution helped to support a larger population, but did nothing to increase people's health or happiness; in fact it did just the opposite.There is a very interesting discussion about our most recent common ancestor. That is to say, the human who is the common ancestor to all people alive on Earth today. It is very surprising, that the most recent common ancestor lived around 10,000 years ago.Silver foxes bred in captivity by D.K. Belyaev for twenty years were bred for tameness. After twenty years, the foxes behaved like border collies! They became friendly, sought human company, and wagged their tails when approached. They even looked like border collies!We were told when we were young that eating carrots help us see better in the dark. But this was a rumor started by WWII strategists to avoid revealing the secret of radar.The best analogy for genes is not that they serve as a blueprint, but rather that they serve as a toolbox of routines. So, while a large percentage of our genes is in common with those of other animals, our main difference from other animals is not the toolbox of DNA routines, but is instead the pattern of choosing genetic routines from the available toolbox. This is called the science of epigenetics, which has been around since Conrad Weddington coined the term in 1942.In 1866, Ernst Haeckel announced that the hippo is a close relative to the whale. This has since been proven through DNA; the hippo's closest living relative actually is the whale!The duck-billed platypus closes its eyes shut when hunting for food. Its duck bill is a very sensitive organ with 60,000 mechanical and 40,000 electrical sensors. The platypus swivels its bill back and forth, feeling for impulses from potential prey. It probably gets a detailed 3D image of electrical disturbances in its vicinity. It probably is doing some sophisticated beamforming to increase its sensitivity.Dawkins remarks about a lot of interesting speculations why humans are bipedal. He gives a number of arguments both why bipedal walking is helpful, but others why it is not.In 1954, the British Colonial Administration destroyed the ecosystem of Lake Victoria. Against the advice of biologists, the Nile perch was introduced to the lake, which destroyed fifty species of cichlids, and critically endangered another 130 species. This newly introduced predator had caused devastation to the local economies around the lake. This is the reason why bureaucrats should not try to play God, and play around with ecosystems.This raises the question, how did so many species evolve in the lake, in the first place? Dawkins makes some interesting speculations about how various species could be physically isolated in the lake, in order to allow the species to branch out due to evolution.Dawkins makes a strong effort to avoid repeating stories that he told in other books. Instead of repeating them, he makes references to his many other books, for the reader to see additional examples. This is so different from that of many other authors, who often repeat themselves from one book to the next.A variety of human inventions were anticipated in the animal kingdom. Some examples: echo-ranging (bats), electro-location (duckbill platypus), dam (beaver), parabolic reflector (limpet), infrared sensor (snakes), hypodermic syringe (wasp, snake, scorpion), harpoon (cnidarian), jet propulsion (squid). The wheel and axle was also anticipated; the rhizobium has a true axle and a freely rotating hub, driven by a tiny molecular motor. Such a wheel could not evolve in a large organism, which would involve twisting blood vessels.I personally loved the renaming of the concept of Intelligent Designers from ""Argument from Irreducible Complexity"" to ""Argument from Personal Incredulity."" The argument ""says less about nature than about the poverty of your imagination.""Dawkins speculates about what would happen if the ""tape of evolution"" were to be re-run in the forward direction, starting from pre-Cambrian times? What would happen if it were re-run a statistical number of times? Or starting from an earlier or later time? This experiment has, in a sense, been done to a limited extent in isolated locations like Australia, New Zealand, Madagascar and South America. Also, evolution in has turned out very similarly when allowed to run twice. Eyes have evolved independently 40-60 times, using nine independent optical principles!Echolocation has evolved at least four times in four animals; toothed whales, oilbirds, cave swiftlets and bats. The venomous sting has evolved at least ten times independently. True flapping flight has evolved four times. Parachuting and gliding has evolved maybe hundreds of times.These notes above represent only a tiny fraction of the thought-provoking concepts in this book. This is a challenging book to read, not only because it is so long, but because of the many complex concepts that are described. The authors even warn the reader at one point that certain pages can be skipped if desired. But the entire book is fascinating. With each species rendezvous, a fractal diagram portrays the branching, along with dates and contour lines; what a fabulous visual portrayal of the concept of evolution!"

It was first published in 2004, and substantially updated in 2016.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز چهارم ماه ژانویه سال 2018 میلادیعنوان: داستان نیاکان: سفری به آغاز حیات؛ نویسنده: ریچارد داوکینز؛داستان نیاکان با زیرعنوان «سفری به آغاز حیات» کتاب علمی عمومی نوشتهٔ ریچارد داوکینز در سال 2004 میلادی است؛ که با همکاری دستیار پژوهشی داوکینز، یان ونگ نوشته شده‌ است. این کتاب مسیر انسان در تاریخ تکاملی را از امروز تا گذشته تصویر می‌کند؛ و سفر را از انسان شروع کرده، به سوی پسرخاله‌ های قدیمی او در درخت زندگی می‌رود. در این مسیر به مرور با پسرخاله‌ های قبلی‌تر انسان، به عنوان «نیای مشترک» همگرا می‌شود. کتاب در سال 2005 نامزد جایزهٔ بهترین کتاب علمی اونتیز شد. چکیده: داستان به صورت یک سفر زیارتی روایت شده‌ است، که در آن مسیر همهٔ جانداران مدرن، به سوی منشا حیات پی گرفته می‌شود. انسان‌ها پسرخاله‌ های تکاملی خود را در پاتوق‌های میان راه ملاقات می‌کنند. در این نقاط تبارها منشعب می‌شوند. داوکینز در هرکدام از این نقاط تلاش می‌کند تا با استفاده از شواهد مولکولی و فسیلی، محتمل‌ترین نوع نزدیک‌ترین نیای مشترک را توضیح دهد؛ و در میان مسیر، جانداران مدرنی که در گذشته با انسان هم‌سفر بوده‌ اند را توصیف کند. سفر کلاً از چهل «میعادگاه» تشکیل شده که از «میعادگاه صفر» آغاز می‌شود و به سوی نزدیک‌ترین نیای مشترک انسان تا میعادگاه سی و نهم که باکتری است پیش می‌رود. با این وجود که داوکینز به‌ طور کل از درخت زندگی توصیف شده اطمینان دارد، در برخی از شاخه‌ ها هشدار داده که در زمان نوشتن، از وزنه ی سنگینی از مدارک بهره نداشته‌ است. داوکینز در هر نقطه ی ملاقات در میان سفر، داستان جالبی در مورد جانداران پسرخاله حکایت می‌کند. هر نوع تازه‌ ای اعم از گونه، سرده، و خانواده داستان منحصر بفردی را برای سرگرمی خوانشگر دربردارد. این ویژگی‌های عجیب به وسیلهٔ روش‌های تازهٔ زیست‌شناسی تکاملی شناسایی شده‌ اند، و با دقت در داستان قرار گرفته‌ اند تا نشان دهند چگونه نظریه تکامل داروینی قادر به توضیح همهٔ تنوع حیات بر روی کرهٔ زمین است. در این کتاب داستان‌های شخصی داوکینز در مورد موضوعات نیز به چشم می‌خورد؛ که در آن‌ها داستان‌هایی از دوران کودکی و دانشگاه خود نیز نقل کرده‌ است. برای مثال، او شگفتی خود را از فهمیدن اینکه اسب‌های آبی نزدیک‌ترین خویشاوندان نهنگها هستند را توصیف کرده‌ است. با اینکه کتاب به ترتیب زمانی نوشته شده‌ است، می‌توان هر بخش را به صورت جداگانه هم مطالعه کرد. به‌ طور کلی می‌توان داستان نیاکان را دانشنامه ای دربارهٔ موضوعات اصلی تکامل دانست. ایشان کتاب را به دوست و استاد اسبق داوکینز، جان مینارد اسمیت تقدیم کرده‌ است. ا. شربیانی"
35,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1148633-brian-hodges,5,"This book blew my mind so many times in so many ways. It is quite simply the most fascinating thing I have ever read about life on this planet. Dawkins traces our evolution from the present day back through the very first organisms on earth. He uses various ""rendezvouses"" to show the points where we connected with other species and phyla and what those connections say about us, about our biology and about life in general. By tracing our lineage back through these various “concestors” Dawkins makes you realize just how unique and amazing your own body is… amazing in ways you probably always took for granted. From the way we gestate to the fact that we have a spinal column to the way that our own cells even work. It was never a guarantee that we would have ANY of these things. It seriously makes you wonder how everything might have turned out had different evolutionary pressures been exerted millions, or even billions of years ago. For instance, had a meteorite not wiped out the dinosaurs, “we” would probably still be little more than tiny rodents scavenging for scraps at night while the REAL rulers of the planet slept.Dawkins touches on this latter aspect in the final chapter, with a series of thought experiments about how things might go down if evolution were to “rerun” from the beginning. Which aspects of life would be likely to sprout up again? Which aspects were far-fetched happy accidents? Perhaps one of the most mind blowing statements Dawkins makes is in reference to eukaryotic cells, which comprise every form of life on this planet except for bacteria. The formation of these special and absolutely “necessary” cells was such a long shot evolutionarily speaking that Dawkins doubts it likely to have happened twice. In fact he goes so far as to say he thinks that the formation of eukaryotic cells was probably MORE unfathomable than the initial spark of life itself! Whoever said scientists strip all the magic and wonder out of the universe has obviously never read this book.Dawkins' prose, as always, is fresh, illuminating, and often humorous, explaining heavy concepts so they make perfect sense to a layman. Seriously, if you're interested in this stuff at all, add this one to the very top of your list."
36,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5431286-david,5,"6-stars[NOTE: I like to provide a 6-star rating to a book when it has been able to keep me in a state of amazement almost continuously for at least 80% of its content.]A terrific book on evolution from the vast spectrum of creatures on this planet. Truly, a lot of information has been provided. Can be a bit heavy to people who may not be from a scientific academic background. Almost every topic that I read in the book kept me in a state of awe while I learnt new things. The book is a must-read for anyone who wishes to get mesmerized by stuff that exists on Planet Earth itself! :)HEAVILY RECOMMENDED!!"
37,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14084605-pink,4,"Wow. I like Richard Dawkins. I like what he has to say in The God Delusion and I like his tweets for the same reason. Lots of people don't like his confrontational stand on religion, but don't let that put you off here. First and foremost, he is an amazing scientist. This book is so comprehensive, it is daunting just thinking about it. When I collected it from the library and saw the size, I outwardly groaned, wondering how I would tackle it. I needn't have worried. Dawkins takes us on a 'backwards' pilgrimage through time, showing how we humans joined up with all other living creatures along the way. After getting through half the book and discovering that we'd already passed mammals, birds and fish, I wondered how interested I'd actually be in cnidarians, ctenophores or choanoflagellates, but they proved to be equally as fascinating. Dawkins breaks the information into short chapters, or rendezvous points, relating things back to animals we've already encountered along the way. Yet he doesn't stop there. He shows how we link with fungi, plants and bacteria, before finally considering how the first life forms began and whether or not this could be recreated. What I particularly liked was how Dawkins doesn't make guesswork for periods that we just don't know about. Where dates are so far away that we don't have the full picture (500 million years and counting) Dawkins relates what is known, then tells us the current theories. The gaps still to be filled are not a disappointment, but an exciting prospect of things yet to learn. I don't have a scientific background at all, though I was able to understand most of what I read. I did get confused with some terms and with trying to keep track of the different classifications (kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species) or timescales (eon, era, period, epoch, age) plus all the subdivisions within these. Luckily the book was comprehensive enough that I was able to flip back to an earlier section, or refer to a chart to refamiliarise myself before moving on to the next tale. I was left feeling a little overwhelmed by the end and so I'll finish with a quote from Dawkins that encapsulates things - ""It is not pride in my book but reverence for life itself that encourages me to say, if you want a justification for the latter, open the former, anywhere at random. And reflect on the fact that although this book has been written from a human point of view, another book could have been written in parallel for any 10 million starting pilgrims. Not only is life on this plant amazing, and deeply satisfying, to all those whose senses have not become dulled by familiarity: the very fact that we have evolved the brain power to understand our evolutionary genesis redoubles the amazement and compounds the satisfaction."" "
38,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/442308-gwc,3,"Fascinating zoology but plenty of flotsam. ""The Beaver's Tale"" ""The Duckbill's Tale"" and ""The Axolotl's Tale"" are outstanding examples of modern naturalism. The classical genetics is adequate but the molecular data is explained minimally and not compelling. More details on the challenges and uncertainties inherent in genomic sequencing and cross-species comparisons would have been helpful. When Dawkins is not discussing zoology the writing is overly verbose, and suffers the professor's conceit of assuming his readers are interested in his opinions on matters beyond his expertise which are infused with the type of absolutism he criticizes elsewhere in the book. The poor, strangely moralistic mathematics and tired political rants are best left for the faculty lounge or starry-eyed students. This is a good 600-page book that could be a great 300-page book with some vigorous editing."
39,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57901-jerzy,5,"Fantastic! If I'd read this in high school I would definitely be a biologist by now.Often I agree with Dawkins' views on creationists, but usually he's an obnoxious ass about it. Thankfully, in this book he only disses them occasionally. For most of the book he sticks to his strengths, i.e., clear and exciting explanations of the beautiful yet structured diversity of the natural world.Lots of nifty thoughts about how evolution works and how mind-shatteringly cool life is. There's an interesting structure to the book, traveling backwards in time from today to the origin of life, and telling tales or lessons from each of our major ancestors along the way. It made me appreciate how much more there is to life than the small handful of mammals, fish, birds, and trees we usually think about."
40,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4788401-lee-harmon,5,"While I read different genres, I only review books with a religious content. So, if I may be excused for one of my “liberal Christian rants,” let me say this: It’s a sad day when a book about evolution earns a spot on the shelves of a religion blog. It simply astounds me that half of all Americans still do not believe in evolution. The evidence is so overwhelmingly against a young earth that if Christianity is going to survive, it must pull its head out of the sand and reinterpret the Bible’s creation story (anything but a literal interpretation!) before it alienates the coming generation, who will simply know better.This book will help. I’m not a fan of Dawkins’ anti-religion tirades, but when he sticks to his evolutionary biology, his writing is a pure delight. It’s insightful, highly intelligent, and witty. The subtitle of the book is A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution, and it’s a long journey backward in time from present-day humans to the beginnings of life four million years ago.You’ll meet Cro-Magnon man, the Neanderthals, chimpanzees and gorillas, monkeys, rodents and rabbits, reptiles, sharks, flatworms, sponges, fungi, plants, and far more, each with their own unique role and story to tell.Scientific understanding is, and ever will be, in a state of transition. As we learn, we shape our theories to fit the facts. It’s an exploration that never ends, an exciting quest for truth that Dawkins excels in sharing. He stops often along this journey back in time to introduce interesting life forms and their evolutionary sidebars, evoking wonder and appreciation for the real creation story that far exceeds any ancient tales. It’s such a treat that I’m almost envious of long-time creationists who can, by opening their minds and turning the cover of this book, open themselves up to a new world of wonder.You will see the world in a different way after reading this."
41,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"Richard Dawkins' ""the ancestor's tale"" is the story of all life on Earth told in reverse order. It starts from us ""moderns"" and goes back to our closer cousins, all the way back to the common ancestor of all life on Earth. Dawkins uses the word ""concestor"" to refer to a common ancestor. It's a fascinating tale. Even though I had to go through nearly 800 pages, I wasn't bored in one single moment. There were times, of course, when it got a little more technical, but all in all I learned so much since a wealth of information is presented in each chapter. We are all African apes. Chimpanzees are our closest cousins and we share roughly 98 percent of our genes with them. You learn that natural selection grants no possibility of foresight. In other words, evolution does not plan ahead. To Alfred Wallace and Charles Darwin, co-discoverers of natural selection, the geographical aspect of natural history gave away the fact of evolution. If species were created independently, why should a Creator choose to put 50 species of lemur on Madagascar, but nowhere else? Why should the Galapagos host a set of finches so different from species on other oceanic islands, but strikingly similar both to each other and to birds on the nearest mainland? For Darwin, peahens choose peacocks simply because, in their eyes, they are pretty (sexual selection). For Alfred Wallace, there's something more than the outward appearance. The bright feathers are a token of their underlying health and fitness. In the fruit fly tale, we learn about DNA mechanism. Textbooks of biology are wrong when they describe DNA as a blueprint. Embryos do nothing remotely like following a blueprint. DNA is not a description in any language, of what the finished body should look like. On this planet, embryos follow recipes. Creationists foolishly liken darwinian natural selection to a hurricane blowing through a junkyard and having the luck to assemble a Boeing 747. They are wrong, of course, for they completely miss the gradual, cumulative nature of natural selection."
42,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/350233-casey,4,"After finishing The Selfish Gene, I rushed out to the store to buy another of Dawkins' books. While the size of this tome was quite intimidating, I found the premise utterly fascinating. The narrative traces humans' evolutionary ancestry, from primates to ""concestor zero,"" or the beginning of life on Earth.Dawkins' knowledge of zoology shines as he gives examples of the fascinating animals that share some of our genes. Readers will undoubtedly learn about plants and animals they had never heard of before, from Australian marsupials to the strange creatures that inhabit Madagascar. The book reads like a novel, and after finishing it I feel more connected, not just to my own species, but to all the creatures around me that share in this crazy thing called life."
43,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81791013-michael-kress,4,"Dawkins was the author who made me realize how fascinating evolutionary biology is. I had read a few of his books before I started this one, but they were all around 300 to 400 pages. This one is 614 pages. It goes back in time, starting in the present moment until we finally reach the dawn of evolution. What an interesting way to write a book! It tells the stories of many species and the common ancestors that we share with them. As the book progresses, our cousins get more and more distant. Eve's Tale explains how the Y chromosome was passed down from mother to daughter through all generations and can be traced back to a hypothetical “Eve.” The Peacock's Tale explains how male peacocks evolved colorful, flashy looking feathers to attract a mate. The Dodo's Tale is a sad story about extinction. Dodos never had to deal with predators, so they never evolved any ways of escaping from them. When humans arrived on their island, they were so slow and easy to kill that they went extinct in a short period of time. There are many more stories like these in the book. The ending of the book is well written and comes around full circle in a cool way. If you've never read anything by Dawkins, I would recommend The Selfish Gene or River Out of Eden. But if you have already read a few of his books, this is a good one that goes a little more in depth."
44,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,5,"Richard Dawkins has done an astounding job producing this book. If it were not for his other great works, The Selfish Gene and The Extended Phenotype: The Long Reach of the Gene, The Ancestor's Tale would be his best work in evolutionary science. It matters not one bit that it's a summary and synthesis of others' primary work: great scientists have always been able to look out across their field of expertise and write a defining work of value for both scientists and the educated public.My only, slight, quibble with the book is that in the decade since it was published there has been significant change in many parts of the ""tree of life."" More species have been discovered, more fossils found. Most importantly, molecular analysis across species of shared genetic haplotypes and DNA from mitochondria has unleashed a tidal wave of new information allowing a more precise determination of our common ancestors, especially the most distant. Dawkins used the earlier results of this same research when writing this book in 2003, but he notes in the book itself that it would have to be revised soon with new information. That, of course, is the way of science and what makes it exciting.Thus, I'm happy to find that the second, updated, edition will be published in early 2016 (see here: The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Life) with the latest scientific developments and additional evolution-relevant species ""tales."" I hope that one of these is ""told"" by a member of the fascinating Fungi—one of the three great multicellular kingdoms—with which we share an unidentified common ancestor roughly 1.1 billion years ago. The original edition naturally includes this rendezvous along with background information, but omits the tale.Should you wait for the new edition? No, unless your a critic of fine detail. The deep time and awesome diversity of evolution will not change. Our place as a species relative to the rest of life will not shift. And Dawkins' inspiring prose will remain."
45,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"What an interesting way to look at evolution, from the present back into the past in the format of & a homage to Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales. He chose 40 major stops along the journey & told some great tales. Thankfully, these were usually from his perspective so there wasn't any foolishness, but he was entertaining.I found the backward format a really good way of cementing various relationships into my mind better. There was a lot of new (to me) & fascinating material about how evolution works. He came up with great examples & occasionally wandered into other interesting areas such as human races.“Natural selection is a beguiling counterfeiter of deliberate purpose.”“Evolution, or its driving engine natural selection, has no foresight. In every generation within every species, the individuals best equipped to survive and reproduce contribute more than their fair share of genes to the next generation. The consequence, blind as it is, is the nearest approach to foresight that nature permits."" I've read several other books on evolution by Dawkins, so there was some repetition, but he cut down on much of that himself by referencing where he originally went into detail. As an audiobook read by him & Ward, it was fantastic, as always. Highly recommended."
46,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"Dawkins presents evolutionary biology in a Chaucerian format. As with the pilgrims in The Canterbury Tales, each of Dawkins tales is about pilgrims on their way to a common destination, in this case the beginning of life. Each group of species marches back in time rendezvousing where they share their most recent common ancestor, what Dawkins calls a “Concester”. The first rendezvous is six million years ago (6 Ma) where we, our Homo and Australopithecine ancestors share a Concestor with the chimpanzees, bonobos and their ancestors. Dawkins describes 40 rendezvous such as the apes meet the monkeys at 25 Ma, the primates meet the rodents and rabbits at 75 Ma, the chordates meet the echinoderms at 550 Ma and ending with bacteria. Working backwards helps eliminate hindsight, assuming that a creature evolved in a certain way because in the future it would be important. Each tale not only describes some life form but some aspect of science associated with it. For example we learn how scientists use the fossil record and genetic techniques as evaluation tools. He shows how dates and evolutionary branches are derived from genetics using mitochondrial DNA, the Y chromosome and triangulation of DNA sequences. He explains how dates are determined using dendrochronology (tree rings), paleomagnetism, and radioactive decay. As we follow the path of evolution in reverse, we learn the science behind it.I read the updated 2016 version coauthored with Yan Wang. It reflects recent discoveries such as those of the Denisovans, whose story takes the place of the Neanderthals in the earlier version. Improvements in DNA extraction and sequencing enabled scientists in 2009 to derive the entire genome of a Denisovian from a 40,000 year old fingertip. There are many other revisions and corrections to the first edition published in 2006. In another update convergent replaces related development to explain the origin of many flightless birds such as the Dodo. Genetic studies now show they are descended from pigeons that became isolated on remote islands where they thrived growing big and losing their wings. Our understanding of the tree of life is always changing. Below are other samples of Dawkins’ discussions that caught my attention.Dawkins presents evolution as a flow of groups of individuals. Species arise when intermediate creatures become extinct. But as evolution occurs there are no distinct lines. A variety of archaic Homo sapiens blurred the dividing line between Homo erectus and modern Homo sapiens. Classification can be arbitrary and is often contested. New genes work their way through the group and if the group is isolated from other groups eventually it becomes distinct. This all takes time. If closely related groups come in contact with each other there is hybridization. Modern humans apparently interbred with Neanderthals 45000 years ago even though the two lines had separated 500,000 years before that. Similarly modern humans interbred with Denisovans. Dawkins offers perspective citing the ring species. He points to California salamanders in mountains that form a circle around the Central Valley. At the southern end two distinct populations won’t interbreed, but each population interbreeds with its neighbors in the other direction. This interbreeding continues uninterrupted all around the mountains coming back to the neighbors that won’t interbreed. There is an unbroken chain between the two. Are they separate species? Similarly gulls that won’t interbreed in Britain interbreed with their neighbors to the east and west forming a continuous chain around the world ending with each other. Like the salamanders, the gulls are connected to each other through the unbroken chain until at the ends the differences seem to have become too great. Dawkins uses the ring species as an example of what happens with all species through time. There is a similar uninterrupted chain from us to our australopithecine ancestors and to the beginning of life. Only the demise of intermediaries lets us define species. Was the most recent common ancestor, Concester, of humans and chimpanzees bipedal? Some scientists believe this is the case. The chimpanzee may have reverted to knuckle walking. What drove bipedalism in the first place? Ability to see over tall grass, ability to carry food back to a mate, ability to squat feed for long periods when snails and worms were more abundant than fruit, or as Dawkins thinks, sexual selection? Even back then females may have liked their mates to stand tall. They and/or their males may also have preferred less body hair. No other ape lost its hair so sexual selection as opposed to natural selection seems reasonable. In most animals females select their mates, but Darwin thought that men selected women for less body hair. Whichever way, both sexes would be affected. A mate with a bigger brain may also have curried favor.Dawson educates us on plate tectonics and its evolutionary effects. The formation and breakup of Pangea into Laurasia and Gondwana had significant implications for the diversity of life. Subsequent breakups isolating Madagascar and Australia explain their unique animals. We get the Platypus Tale. Is the platypus primitive? It had as much time to evolve as we have. It lays eggs and has a bill but what a bill – supersensitive to movement and electric field disturbances. What other mammal can locate its prey without listening, seeing or touching it? Dawkins explores the nerve connections between bill and brain and speculates that the platypus visualizes the feedback from its bill just as we do the feedback from our eyes.Dawkins’ tale of the sea squirt shows the tongue and cheek that is sprinkled through his writing. This amazing creature starts out with a notochord and nervous system making it a chordate, a member of our phylum. It looks like a tadpole as a juvenile swimming around then in its adult stage, it lands head first on a rock and permanently attaches itself. It digests its nerve system, notochord and other parts and turns into a big bag that filters the plankton from seawater. Dawkins digresses ”A second Aldous Huxley might project fictional human longevity to the point where some super-Methuselah finally settles down on his head and metamorphoses into a giant sea squirt, fastened permanently to the sofa in front of a television.” Perhaps today we should substitute tablet or phone for TV. In either case, once settled, Dawkins notes that it “eats its brain, like an associate professor getting tenure.” We are entertained by the stories of many other bizarre creatures, behaviors and relationships. Who would, aside from a zoologist, think of the echinoderm (starfish, sea cucumber, etc.) as sharing the most recent common ancestor we have with another phylum? The starfish’s radial design means it has no front or back, left or right. It may lead with any of its five legs. Its nerve cord forms a circle. Its anus is on top and mouth on bottom. Yet the molecular biologists say its genes show it evolved from a bilateral animal just like us.What about the bdelloid rotifers? All of these tiny aquatic animals are female. There is no need for males, no shared gene pool. Each rotifer reproduces a new organism with two sets of chromosomes as do animals that reproduce sexually. Thus over the millennia as mutations accumulate the genes will become even more diverse than those in a shared pool. Millions of years of asexual reproduction have resulted in more than 450 species of these unique creatures. Then there are the animals that keep their males in place – literally. Some trigger fish females carry their diminutive males on their sides for use when and as needed. Some scale insect females carry their males as mere specs on their legs.Dawkins explores the beginning of life. He looks at RNA World theory which holds that life started with RNA as both a replicator and an enzyme, in essence a self-replicating catalyst. He points to experiments that show segments of RNA taken from viruses can replicate and evolve in water. He discusses the idea of life forming in rocks, going even further afield than theories about life starting around hydrothermal vents. He point out that cracks in rocks are teeming with bacteria that live off of chemical processes without benefit of the sun. Finally he ponders the different ways life could have evolved. If we went back to the beginning and started all over again what would life be like today? What aspects have been convergent and which contingent. Many features evolved more than once, for example eyes, echolocation, and flight. Others such as our big brains and use of language evolved only once. Perhaps most significant is the incorporation of bacteria into archaea forming mitochondria which made life for us eukaryotes possible. Nick Lane argues in his book Power, Sex, Suicide that this event would be unlikely to ever be repeated.The Ancestor’s Tale is a tour de force, a comprehensive view of evolutionary biology full of fascinating details about diverse life forms. It is packed with the latest scientific theories. Above all it demonstrates the interconnectedness of all life. This clearly is heartfelt by Dawkins. His awe and enthusiasm for his subject is infectious. Reading it was an experience. After 700 pages, I was sorry it was over. For those with a serious interest I can’t recommend it highly enough."
47,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,5,"I love this book. It's not the kind of thing I usually read, because I prefer fiction to non-fiction by far, at least when I have a choice about it. And I really, really loathe Dawkins' The God Delusion, largely because of the tone he takes toward people who are religious believers. But The Ancestor's Tale is mostly just science, and it's written in an accessible, almost conversational way. It actually has literary ancestors (ha), in the form of The Canterbury Tales, which Dawkins chose as his format to tell the tale of a pilgrimage through history to find our ancestors. He does slip in some references to his own beliefs, but here they aren't too offensive or intrusive.When I say 'accessible', I don't mean 'dumbed down'. The science and maths and the theory and the sheer detail is here. I read a couple of reviews that people found it boring once it got to a certain point because there's 'too much detail' about things like bacteria. Which I think is more of a 'your mileage may vary' attitude than anything -- I think Dawkins gave the space to the bacteria that they deserve, all things considered.There's a lot of speculation in here, too -- but so much of science is speculation. Dawkins is fairly clear about when he can and can't 'prove' things, and explains the methods by which they can be proved if they can. You don't have to have a huge knowledge of science or maths to understand -- some, and an interest in it, I suppose, but not so very very much."
48,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14115149-jaclynn,4,"Not recommended for those with a passing interest in evolution...this is heavy into the math and science realms. This is an extremely in depth, hefty tome as seen from the point of view of homo sapiens travelling backwards in time to the dawn of life. Dawkins tale is modeled after Canterbury Tales, and is about pilgrims on their way to a common destination, in this case the beginning of life. Each group of species marches back in time rendezvousing where they share their most recent common ancestor, what Dawkins calls a “Concester”. The first rendezvous is six million years ago (6 Ma) where we, our Homo and Australopithecine ancestors share a Concestor with the chimpanzees, bonobos and their ancestors. There are so many thought-provoking concepts in this book, but this is a challenging book to read, not only because it is so long, but because of the many complex concepts that are described. But the entire book is fascinating. With each species rendezvous, a fractal diagram portrays the branching, along with dates and contour lines; what a fabulous visual portrayal of the concept of evolution! I am continually amazed the genius of Dawkins...this book is so comprehensive, it is daunting just thinking about it, let alone researching and writing it!"
49,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/270879-robin,5,"This is my favorite book in the whole world. Someday it may be eclipsed by something else but for now it's this. What I love most about this book is the number of times I found myself thinking, ""Wow, I had no idea"". It makes perfect sense when you think it out, but the entire premise of the book, that every living thing on earth, from human being to plant to bacteria, shares a common ancestor, that actually existed at a point sufficiently far enough in the past. The book consists of a ""pilgrimage"" to that ancestor modeled loosely after ""The Canterbury Tales"". "
50,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44504-brian,5,"I've been a fan of Dawkins for a while solely based on interviews, but this is the first of his books I've actually read. It works its way backwards through the evolutionary tree, detailing how all living things are related - how a stranger on the street, your dog, your house plant, bacteria and you are all distant cousins. It's a fascinating read, technical enough if you're interested, but not so much so that it's threatening to the non-science minded. It's broken into various ""tales"" - ""The Howler Monkey's Tale"", ""The Hippo's Tale"", ""The Blind Cave Fish's Tale"" - a la Chaucer - which makes the size of the book a bit less daunting. Best of all, it's excellent ammunition for the next time you find yourself in a debate with someone arguing for ""intelligent design."""
51,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/411786-courtney-stirrat,5,"The Ancestor's Tale is an incredible find! With a form based loosely on Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, Dawkins marches back in time to each of humankind's ancestors. Witty, brilliant and engaging, you will learn a great deal about evolutionary biology, and a million fun and intriguing facts. Whether you agree to disagree with the facts establishing evolution as a law of science, this book is worth your time. Plus, it is so dense and rich, you will feel proud to put it on your shelf after you have finished it!! "
52,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,4,"This book is a sort of Canterbury Tales for evolutionary biology.It follows our ancestors back to the root as they merge with other branches on the tree of life.For those who know programming, this sums it up succinctly:for(Species i = humans; i.parent != null; i = i.parent) { print(i.anecdotes[rand() % i.anecdotes.length]);}Dawkins is awesome. Yep."
53,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,4,"Hefty Tome That Explains Evolution in Great DetailIf you have a hardcopy of this book, you know just how thick it is, and how dense the content is. Each chapter is another essay on the incredible mechanisms by which selective mutation, adaptation, and reproduction over millions of generations have led to the plethora of life on Earth, and how the process is not directed by a divine being waving life into existence, but rather an unfathomable number of successes and failures among individual creatures, with the only measure of success being reproduction, can lead to such a mind-boggling diversity of species.Dawkin's recurring theme as he delves further and further back to our more distant common ancestors is that evolution, while not directed from above, can often lead to convergence at similar outcomes, such as the independent development of eyes (truly a miracle of gradual evolution), sonar, poison, and various survival mechanisms in different locations and eras over hundreds of millions of years. While I think many readers, no matter how educated or knowledgeable they may be about evolutionary biology, may still struggle to accept that all this complexity and diversity is not a result of ""intelligent design"", I think Dawkins makes the case repeatedly and in great logical detail, and in the end it is we ourselves, as conscious and thinking intelligent beings, that can recognize and understand that we would not exist if it weren't for these incredible mechanisms over vast ages that have produced ourselves and all other life from microscopic life billions of years ago, our common ancestor."
54,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11331153-andy,5,"Your 30-million-greats-grandparent was a shrew. Your 270-million-greats-grandparent from over half a billion years ago looked like this worm. Did I mention that its mouth doubled as its anus? This book is filled with ways ways of making you feel very small. This is the type of book that doesn't let you ever see the world the same again, and proves that religion doesn't have a lock on the feelings of awe and the sublime.In an article from 2009 ""Growing Up in Ethology"" Dawkins describes this book as ""the largest and most demanding of my career"" noting that he almost gave up on it several times. It's understandable, apart from the contents, this book is audacious in its scope and detail. I got so deep into it that I was having recurrent dreams about its concepts and creatures.There's a lot of fascinating stories here -- too many to mention but I can't help going through many of them. When reading this I wanted to tell people how amazing this is, but I don't know too many people that are interested in science, so pardon me, this is my outlet. These are some that stuck me as particularly noteworthy.>>The Axolotl's Tale is about ""pedomorphosis"" which is where the juvenile of a species can become sexually mature without fully developing into an adult, and so it and its offspring never do. The axolotl does look like a larval-salamander hybrid which remains in the water. Many species carry within them the ""instructions"" to metamorphize through various stages (tadpoles into frogs for example), so strictly in theory, they could go backward too. This happens in newts which start as a larva, then emerge on land for some years, then return to water and regain some larval characteristics. It's speculated many species we see could be ""between stages"" like ostriches. As big as they are, they're actually juvenile chickens with their stubby wings. Some have speculated we are juvenile chimps and Dawkins doesn't entirely discount this idea.>>The Hippo's Tale was an amazing explanation of their close genetic relationship to whales, and how certain land animals returned to the water and became ""fish,"" evolving quickly because water-living took away their struggle with gravity. Likely there was a common ancestor which split into camels (and others) on one side, and hippo's/whales on the other, but we shouldn't imagine the ancestor necessarily looked like either. I also didn't know that camels originally evolved in what would have been considered North America, during a period when the position of the continents looked much different.>>The Howler Monkey's Tale explained how mammals lost their color vision due to becoming nocturnal shrew-like creatures during the age of the dinosaurs when they had to hide underground and only emerge at night. After the dinosaurs died off they re-emerged and re-gained the ability to see color which they'd retained in their genes, but this ability has been ""re-enabled"" in many independent ways.>>The Lungfish's Tale explains how we likely emerged from the water for the first time, and explores various fish today that ""walk"" on land for short periods. It is likely that our ancestor developed the ability to walk because it was attempting to get BACK into water from tide pools that left it stranded away from food sources.>>The Galapagos Finch's Tale showed in a powerful way how quickly evolution can occur due to certain ""bottlenecks"" or die-offs.>>The Fruit Fly's Tale's explanation of Hox genes and how they control the development of an embryo. This chapter takes a fairly complex concept and makes it understandable.>>The Lamprey's Tale tells about how different their haemoglobin genes (for carrying oxygen in the blood) are from ours. We split off from a common ancestor long, long ago and duplicated our genes for globin several times while lamprey's are from a very ancient ancestor, they predate this split and use much older globin genes. They independently evolved a system for oxygen carrying, as birds and bats independently evolved flight.And ""independent"" or ""convergent"" evolution is another big theme here. There are a couple of chapters that touch on how geographic distance evolves specialized species, some of which take up similar niches and roles that are found in other continents. Australia for example has evolved its version of the dog, the flying squirrel, the mole, etc. Dawkins sees the kangaroo as a sort of hopping version of the gazelle, and makes a good case for it.>>The Brine Shrimp's Tale explains how vertebrates are likely descended from worms that learned to swim on their backs, and adapted their internal organs for such. The Brine Shrimp's organs have similarly adapted so that it is no longer technically swimming ""upside down."" Some catfish today swim upside down and have started to adapt a camouflage system that is essentially the opposite of those who swim normally, i.e. their bellies are darker than their backs.>>The Rotifer's Tale explores asexual reproduction, how originally pairs of chromosomes became independent from one another by gradual mutations, whereas our pairs are copies of one another. Dawkins engages in an interesting discussion about whether sex is really necessary, and the natural selection pressure benefits it creates.>>In the Salamander's Tale Dawkins explores ""ring species."" The Central Valley of California has a section of mountains which form a ring around a valley. Salamanders live in the mountains around the valley, but do not venture into the valley itself. Those on the east side appear quite different from the western one, but in fact they are the same species and form a vast ring of gradual differentiation in coloring, those on the opposite sides are just too far from one another to interbreed. This is seen in a species of gull that forms a ring species that encircles the whole Earth! Dawkins makes the point that we humans could be a ""ring species"" too if the intermediates between us and the chimpanzees had not died off. When viewed this way it totally blurs the lines when thinking of separate species to begin with.>>The lengthy penultimate chapter ""Canterbury"" was the best thing I've read and better than any documentaries I've seen on how life theoretically began. Dawkins is honest about the many challenges, and lists a variety of scientific experiments which show how these can be overcome, at least in theory. He goes into detail about enzymes, mRNA, tRNA and ribosomes and makes it all understandable. Some textbook diagrams would have been appreciated, but the descriptions are still well-handled.There's many more examples of course. This book in the updated 2016 edition is over 700 pages and although this is the only book on evolution I've read, I imagine I'd be hard-pressed to find another that goes into this level of detail while still being this reader-friendly. Dawkins strikes a good balance.It's worth mentioning that this is a challenging read at times, primarily in the early chapters. (The chapter on Gibbon monkeys particularly so, but don't get discouraged!) At times there was more focus on methods than I probably wanted. For example, I don't need two pages of explanation of logarithmic graphing, I'll take your word for it that the graph is accurate.This book fits well with my overall ""Ligottian"" cosmic perspective on life. At one point in ""The Beaver's Tale"" Dawkins remarks, ""Do you protest that there aren’t ‘really’ any genes for behaviour; only genes for the nerves and muscles that make the behaviour? You are still wrecked among heathen dreams."" He doesn't exactly call us puppets of biology, he's subtler than that, but he makes a compelling argument. He uses the phrase ""clockwork mechanism,"" and a bit later in the same chapter he discusses how beavers held in a bare room will attempt to make dams when there's nothing at all there. That really put things in perspective.Dawkins very rarely speaks on religion or creationism in this book, he assumes the reader believes evolution is true -- which it is. But he does leave us with this, with which I wholeheartedly agree:""My objection to supernatural beliefs is precisely that they miserably fail to do justice to the sublime grandeur of the real world. They represent a narrowing-down from reality, an impoverishment of what the real world has to offer.""I've thought something like this for years, and reading this book can only open eyes to how amazing the real world is."
55,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7408040-mark-hartzer,5,"It's a shame that some people get caught up in Mr. Dawkins as a supposed spokesman for Atheism because first and foremost, he's a scientist, and this book is about the science behind life on Earth. In order to better explain evolutionary science, Dawkins metaphorically borrows Chaucer's journey to Canterbury to travel back in time. We start in the present day, and then examine our common ancestors from mammals, to birds, reptiles, etc... all the way back to bacteria and how life itself may have come to be. It's a compelling argument.The book is full of ideas to contemplate. For example, in ""The Peacock's Tale"" chapter, he addresses human bare skin and why. ""Humans don't just have bare skin on their rumps like monkeys. They have bare skin all over, except on the top of the head, under the arms and in the pubic region. When we get ectoparasites such as lice, they are often confined to these very regions. Lice need hair, and Pagel and Bodmer's first suggestion is that the benefit of losing our body hair was that it reduced the real estate available to lice. Two questions arise. Why, if losing hair is such a good idea, have other mammals who also suffer from ectoparasites kept theirs?"" (And why is it still retained on our heads, etc...?)I won't give away the answers, but the analysis is thoughtful and persuasive. This is not a beach read. It demands your attention and concentration in order to consider the themes presented. I thought the time invested in the book was time well spent. 5 stars."

58,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69348187-xavier,5,"Richard Dawkins does a wonderful job at leading the reader on a grand pilgrimage throughout the eons, introducing you to our great evolutionary ancestors. He starts the journey working backwards, beginning with Homo Sapiens and then the earliest bipedal apes like Homo Habilis, then ending with the earliest replicating life, the one that would've started it all billions of years ago. Unfortunately, it didn't leave any fossils behind (soft-body creatures tend not to sadly but it has happened at a site in China) but if we work the molecular clock backwards we can deduce that somewhere in the 'primordial soup' a molecule began to copy itself, and it was really good at it.As we meet the different pilgrims Dawkins explains how evolution shaped life in the most exciting and unusual ways. Some creatures on our planet function in the most ridiculous ways. I don't wish to spoil these parts but it is awe-inspiring for sure.This was a fun and truly educating read for me. I learned so much about the different kinds of life that inhabit our planet. Human beings are just one tiny branch in the grand tree of life. We have only been here for a second in geological time, a drop in the bucket. The Ancestor's Tale is a humbling experience."

60,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,5,"On Monday, an old friend came round to lunch, and, while we were having a cup of tea in the living room, remarked on the number of Richard Dawkins books on my shelf. Somehow, I'd never heard that she'd actually had Dawkins as a supervisor for one term when she was an undergraduate at Oxford in the late 70s; it was in connection with the course she was reading on animal behaviour. I asked what he was like as a person, and she was unenthusiastic. Clearly very intelligent, but there was something about him that she found disquieting. She wouldn't go so far as to say that he'd behaved inappropriately, there was never a specific incident she could point to, but she constantly felt that he was just an inch from the line. Well... charismatic, thirty-something male supervisor, attractive young female undergraduate, animal behaviour, you can see plenty of scope for that. And she said that, even then, he'd go on about religion. After a while, she became increasingly sure that his hostile feelings were rooted in some kind of personal disappointment he'd suffered, though she had no idea what it might have been.I asked her which Dawkins she'd read, and, like most people, it was The Selfish Gene and The God Delusion. She hadn't particularly liked either one. I can sympathize with her point of view. But, as other reviewers here have said, Dawkins is a more complex person than he's generally given credit for, and if you read The Ancestor's Tale you'll see another side. I suppose one could say that he's attacking religion here too, but the strategy is completely the opposite of the blunt, in-your-face assault he uses in the The God Delusion; to my mind, it's also far more effective. Rather than tell you what's ugly and wrong about Intelligent Design, he concentrates his energies on showing you what's beautiful and right about evolution, and how, far from contradicting traditional religious beliefs, it reveals them with a clarity that previous generations have been unable to see. I kept thinking of Saint Francis of Assisi, and his love of all living creatures. ""Brother bird, sister ant""... they're beautiful poetic phrases. But what do they mean? Evidently, this finch can't literally be my brother. There is no way that my mother could have given birth to him. The conventional explanation is that we're both ""children of God"", which is fine as far as it goes; the problem is that it doesn't really shed much light on the nature of our relationship. The astonishing thing about evolution, which forms the core of this book, is that it shows how the bird and ant truly are my brother and sister. Well, not quite brother and sister - in fact, they're very distant cousins. Dawkins traces the family tree, and shows precisely how we're all related. He starts with the obvious cases (apes, monkeys), then goes back to other mammals, and then further through reptiles, birds, amphibians, insects, sponges, plants and all the way to protozoa. On the way, he tells you some extraordinary stories. Well, that shouldn't be a surprise; think what interesting stories you hear when you meet up with a friend you used to know well, but haven't seen for a decade. Here, you are in some cases meeting up with people you haven't seen for several hundred million years.At the end, I felt, as I had never felt before, how we're all one family in the plain, everyday sense of the word, and how we're linked though the genes we share, which we've inherited from our common ancestors. It's a truly incredible thought. As Dawkins says on the last page: it's not so much that he disagrees with religious people, it's more that they're saying it the wrong way. If you are yourself a religious person who wants to learn to be closer to God and His Creation, you could do worse than read this book."
61,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/224453-jen,5,"Poor Dawkins - he gets a bad reputation. People think he's mean and nasty and heartless and elitist. Okay, I might have to grant people the ""elitist"" bit, because, well, I'm a bit of an elitist myself. But I dare you all to read this book and then tell me that Dawkins isn't a total squishy. Let's just say this - he stops in the middle of the book to talk about how much he misses Douglas Adams, who was a dear friend of his. He waxes poetic about evolution and how much he wishes he could meet our ancestors. He refers to Olivia Judson's ""Doctor Tatiana's Sex Guide for All Creation,"" makes a brief homage to it, and then sweetly states that he could never do the style justice (making clear along the way that he's read the darned thing, which delights me for reasons that can only be understood by someone else who's read the book, because it's Just That Fabulous). And he puts his wife in the index, even though the references to her are miniscule (and, in fact, much less frequent than in any other book). He credits his research assistant as his co-author. In general, he's a sweetheart.I will stop fangirling the man, now, and simply tell you that the science in this book? Is brilliant, wondrous, and awe-inspiring in its breadth. Fantastic book. "
62,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53165-warwick,4,"There are some facts the simple knowing of which seems to me to be a supreme achievement of our species. The fact that we are all made of stardust. The fact that 99.9999999999999 percent of all matter is empty. The fact that mass and energy can be expressed in terms of each other. Stuff like that.Pre-eminent among these to me, for sheer mind-expanding awe, is the fact that life on this planet has developed precisely once, as far as we know, and everything on earth has evolved from it. That means that when you go outside and lie down in the garden, everything you can see and hear – people walking nearby, their pet dogs, the squirrel darting past, the birds you can hear tweeting, the insects and tiny bugs crawling around underneath you, the trees the birds are standing on, the grass you're lying on, the bacteria in your guts – all of them are your cousins: you're quite literally related to them in the real, genealogical sense.If you go far enough back in time, in other words, you will eventually find a creature whose descendants evolved into both squirrels (say) and people. Indeed, the rules of heredity being what they are, you could even find a single individual who was a common ancestor to every squirrel and human alive. And indeed such an animal really did exist, around 75 million years ago in the Upper Cretaceous. It probably looked sort of mousey, and Dawkins estimates that he or she was our ‘15-million-greats-grandparent’. Squirrels are not ‘closer’ to this creature than humans are: we and they are equally related, having been evolving independently for the same amount of time.The Ancestor's Tale takes exactly this approach to exploring evolution. It starts with humans and works backwards – looking first at the common ancestor between humans and chimpanzees, and continuing until we reach the common ancestor of all life on earth. Dawkins's word for a common ancestor of more than one species is ‘concestor’, and there are only about 40 of them (!) between us and the origin of life more than three billion years ago. The Cretaceous mammal I mentioned above, which evolved into us and squirrels (along with all the other rodents, lagomorphs and primates), is Concestor 10 according to this schema.I think there's a lot of traps you can fall into when you start thinking about evolution. It's easy to feel, instinctively, that evolution is somehow teleological: that it's been working towards – if not us, then at least creatures that are increasingly complex and increasingly intelligent. But that of course is not the case. Things survive that reproduce themselves well, and there are plenty of single-celled organisms still with us that have seen no need to get any more complicated for millions of years. Bacterial life is in fact astonishingly varied and rich, whole phyla of creatures that branched off before multicellular life even came about; indeed, chemically speaking,we are more similar to some bacteria than some bacteria are to other bacteria.Just think about that for a second.Before Dawkins got distracted by religious idiocy, he was well known as being one of the scientists most able to explain complicated ideas in a fresh and accessible way. All his skills are on display in this work. It's not just the zoology and the evolutionary biology, where you'd expect him to be strong; there's also a fantastically lucid explanation of the biochemistry within a cell, and even one of the best explanations of the physics of radioactivity that I've come across. He is calm and careful; he repeats himself where necessary; he shares several teacherly witticisms; and he does all this without ever condescending to the reader. He allows paragraphs of complex material to sit, so that you can read and re-read them a few times before he carries on. Occasionally he cannot stop himself breaking out in exclamations of wonder or poetic meditation – as when he discusses the fossilised footprints of three early hominids from some three-and-a-half million years ago:Who does not wonder what these individuals were to each other, whether they held hands or even talked, and what forgotten errand they shared in a Pliocene dawn?His enthusiasm is infectious. The whole book is a fantastic exploration of this most beautiful piece of modern human understanding. It's full of astonishing anecdotes and scientific details about the natural world, but it also all ties together into a conception of life that's more awe-inspiring and more moving than any supernatural system could ever be."
63,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is the 2016, revised edition of this fabulous book. In this edition, Richard Dawkins is a co-author with Yan Wong. This is a very hefty tome, just under 800 pages. It is a marvelously inventive, masterful look at evolution, as seen from the point of view of homo sapiens travelling backwards in time, back to the dawn of life. Each time the route of evolution reaches a branch point with another species, it is called a Rendezvous; there are 40 rendezvous altogether. The book is extremely interesting and informative. Below I summarize some of the interesting facts I learned.Some creationists point to the so-called gaps in the fossil record as proof that the scientific theory of evolution is not sufficient to explain the development of species. But Dawkins argues that even without any fossils, the evidence for evolution would still be immense. The distributions of species on continents and islands, the patterns of resemblance, an genetic sequences are sufficient to prove evolution. Fossils are a welcome bonus. The gaps in the fossil records are not all that important.The agricultural revolution helped to support a larger population, but did nothing to increase people's health or happiness; in fact it did just the opposite.There is a very interesting discussion about our most recent common ancestor. That is to say, the human who is the common ancestor to all people alive on Earth today. It is very surprising, that the most recent common ancestor lived around 10,000 years ago.Silver foxes bred in captivity by D.K. Belyaev for twenty years were bred for tameness. After twenty years, the foxes behaved like border collies! They became friendly, sought human company, and wagged their tails when approached. They even looked like border collies!We were told when we were young that eating carrots help us see better in the dark. But this was a rumor started by WWII strategists to avoid revealing the secret of radar.The best analogy for genes is not that they serve as a blueprint, but rather that they serve as a toolbox of routines. So, while a large percentage of our genes is in common with those of other animals, our main difference from other animals is not the toolbox of DNA routines, but is instead the pattern of choosing genetic routines from the available toolbox. This is called the science of epigenetics, which has been around since Conrad Weddington coined the term in 1942.In 1866, Ernst Haeckel announced that the hippo is a close relative to the whale. This has since been proven through DNA; the hippo's closest living relative actually is the whale!The duck-billed platypus closes its eyes shut when hunting for food. Its duck bill is a very sensitive organ with 60,000 mechanical and 40,000 electrical sensors. The platypus swivels its bill back and forth, feeling for impulses from potential prey. It probably gets a detailed 3D image of electrical disturbances in its vicinity. It probably is doing some sophisticated beamforming to increase its sensitivity.Dawkins remarks about a lot of interesting speculations why humans are bipedal. He gives a number of arguments both why bipedal walking is helpful, but others why it is not.In 1954, the British Colonial Administration destroyed the ecosystem of Lake Victoria. Against the advice of biologists, the Nile perch was introduced to the lake, which destroyed fifty species of cichlids, and critically endangered another 130 species. This newly introduced predator had caused devastation to the local economies around the lake. This is the reason why bureaucrats should not try to play God, and play around with ecosystems.This raises the question, how did so many species evolve in the lake, in the first place? Dawkins makes some interesting speculations about how various species could be physically isolated in the lake, in order to allow the species to branch out due to evolution.Dawkins makes a strong effort to avoid repeating stories that he told in other books. Instead of repeating them, he makes references to his many other books, for the reader to see additional examples. This is so different from that of many other authors, who often repeat themselves from one book to the next.A variety of human inventions were anticipated in the animal kingdom. Some examples: echo-ranging (bats), electro-location (duckbill platypus), dam (beaver), parabolic reflector (limpet), infrared sensor (snakes), hypodermic syringe (wasp, snake, scorpion), harpoon (cnidarian), jet propulsion (squid). The wheel and axle was also anticipated; the rhizobium has a true axle and a freely rotating hub, driven by a tiny molecular motor. Such a wheel could not evolve in a large organism, which would involve twisting blood vessels.I personally loved the renaming of the concept of Intelligent Designers from ""Argument from Irreducible Complexity"" to ""Argument from Personal Incredulity."" The argument ""says less about nature than about the poverty of your imagination.""Dawkins speculates about what would happen if the ""tape of evolution"" were to be re-run in the forward direction, starting from pre-Cambrian times? What would happen if it were re-run a statistical number of times? Or starting from an earlier or later time? This experiment has, in a sense, been done to a limited extent in isolated locations like Australia, New Zealand, Madagascar and South America. Also, evolution in has turned out very similarly when allowed to run twice. Eyes have evolved independently 40-60 times, using nine independent optical principles!Echolocation has evolved at least four times in four animals; toothed whales, oilbirds, cave swiftlets and bats. The venomous sting has evolved at least ten times independently. True flapping flight has evolved four times. Parachuting and gliding has evolved maybe hundreds of times.These notes above represent only a tiny fraction of the thought-provoking concepts in this book. This is a challenging book to read, not only because it is so long, but because of the many complex concepts that are described. The authors even warn the reader at one point that certain pages can be skipped if desired. But the entire book is fascinating. With each species rendezvous, a fractal diagram portrays the branching, along with dates and contour lines; what a fabulous visual portrayal of the concept of evolution!"

It was first published in 2004, and substantially updated in 2016.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز چهارم ماه ژانویه سال 2018 میلادیعنوان: داستان نیاکان: سفری به آغاز حیات؛ نویسنده: ریچارد داوکینز؛داستان نیاکان با زیرعنوان «سفری به آغاز حیات» کتاب علمی عمومی نوشتهٔ ریچارد داوکینز در سال 2004 میلادی است؛ که با همکاری دستیار پژوهشی داوکینز، یان ونگ نوشته شده‌ است. این کتاب مسیر انسان در تاریخ تکاملی را از امروز تا گذشته تصویر می‌کند؛ و سفر را از انسان شروع کرده، به سوی پسرخاله‌ های قدیمی او در درخت زندگی می‌رود. در این مسیر به مرور با پسرخاله‌ های قبلی‌تر انسان، به عنوان «نیای مشترک» همگرا می‌شود. کتاب در سال 2005 نامزد جایزهٔ بهترین کتاب علمی اونتیز شد. چکیده: داستان به صورت یک سفر زیارتی روایت شده‌ است، که در آن مسیر همهٔ جانداران مدرن، به سوی منشا حیات پی گرفته می‌شود. انسان‌ها پسرخاله‌ های تکاملی خود را در پاتوق‌های میان راه ملاقات می‌کنند. در این نقاط تبارها منشعب می‌شوند. داوکینز در هرکدام از این نقاط تلاش می‌کند تا با استفاده از شواهد مولکولی و فسیلی، محتمل‌ترین نوع نزدیک‌ترین نیای مشترک را توضیح دهد؛ و در میان مسیر، جانداران مدرنی که در گذشته با انسان هم‌سفر بوده‌ اند را توصیف کند. سفر کلاً از چهل «میعادگاه» تشکیل شده که از «میعادگاه صفر» آغاز می‌شود و به سوی نزدیک‌ترین نیای مشترک انسان تا میعادگاه سی و نهم که باکتری است پیش می‌رود. با این وجود که داوکینز به‌ طور کل از درخت زندگی توصیف شده اطمینان دارد، در برخی از شاخه‌ ها هشدار داده که در زمان نوشتن، از وزنه ی سنگینی از مدارک بهره نداشته‌ است. داوکینز در هر نقطه ی ملاقات در میان سفر، داستان جالبی در مورد جانداران پسرخاله حکایت می‌کند. هر نوع تازه‌ ای اعم از گونه، سرده، و خانواده داستان منحصر بفردی را برای سرگرمی خوانشگر دربردارد. این ویژگی‌های عجیب به وسیلهٔ روش‌های تازهٔ زیست‌شناسی تکاملی شناسایی شده‌ اند، و با دقت در داستان قرار گرفته‌ اند تا نشان دهند چگونه نظریه تکامل داروینی قادر به توضیح همهٔ تنوع حیات بر روی کرهٔ زمین است. در این کتاب داستان‌های شخصی داوکینز در مورد موضوعات نیز به چشم می‌خورد؛ که در آن‌ها داستان‌هایی از دوران کودکی و دانشگاه خود نیز نقل کرده‌ است. برای مثال، او شگفتی خود را از فهمیدن اینکه اسب‌های آبی نزدیک‌ترین خویشاوندان نهنگها هستند را توصیف کرده‌ است. با اینکه کتاب به ترتیب زمانی نوشته شده‌ است، می‌توان هر بخش را به صورت جداگانه هم مطالعه کرد. به‌ طور کلی می‌توان داستان نیاکان را دانشنامه ای دربارهٔ موضوعات اصلی تکامل دانست. ایشان کتاب را به دوست و استاد اسبق داوکینز، جان مینارد اسمیت تقدیم کرده‌ است. ا. شربیانی"
65,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1148633-brian-hodges,5,"This book blew my mind so many times in so many ways. It is quite simply the most fascinating thing I have ever read about life on this planet. Dawkins traces our evolution from the present day back through the very first organisms on earth. He uses various ""rendezvouses"" to show the points where we connected with other species and phyla and what those connections say about us, about our biology and about life in general. By tracing our lineage back through these various “concestors” Dawkins makes you realize just how unique and amazing your own body is… amazing in ways you probably always took for granted. From the way we gestate to the fact that we have a spinal column to the way that our own cells even work. It was never a guarantee that we would have ANY of these things. It seriously makes you wonder how everything might have turned out had different evolutionary pressures been exerted millions, or even billions of years ago. For instance, had a meteorite not wiped out the dinosaurs, “we” would probably still be little more than tiny rodents scavenging for scraps at night while the REAL rulers of the planet slept.Dawkins touches on this latter aspect in the final chapter, with a series of thought experiments about how things might go down if evolution were to “rerun” from the beginning. Which aspects of life would be likely to sprout up again? Which aspects were far-fetched happy accidents? Perhaps one of the most mind blowing statements Dawkins makes is in reference to eukaryotic cells, which comprise every form of life on this planet except for bacteria. The formation of these special and absolutely “necessary” cells was such a long shot evolutionarily speaking that Dawkins doubts it likely to have happened twice. In fact he goes so far as to say he thinks that the formation of eukaryotic cells was probably MORE unfathomable than the initial spark of life itself! Whoever said scientists strip all the magic and wonder out of the universe has obviously never read this book.Dawkins' prose, as always, is fresh, illuminating, and often humorous, explaining heavy concepts so they make perfect sense to a layman. Seriously, if you're interested in this stuff at all, add this one to the very top of your list."
66,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5431286-david,5,"6-stars[NOTE: I like to provide a 6-star rating to a book when it has been able to keep me in a state of amazement almost continuously for at least 80% of its content.]A terrific book on evolution from the vast spectrum of creatures on this planet. Truly, a lot of information has been provided. Can be a bit heavy to people who may not be from a scientific academic background. Almost every topic that I read in the book kept me in a state of awe while I learnt new things. The book is a must-read for anyone who wishes to get mesmerized by stuff that exists on Planet Earth itself! :)HEAVILY RECOMMENDED!!"
67,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14084605-pink,4,"Wow. I like Richard Dawkins. I like what he has to say in The God Delusion and I like his tweets for the same reason. Lots of people don't like his confrontational stand on religion, but don't let that put you off here. First and foremost, he is an amazing scientist. This book is so comprehensive, it is daunting just thinking about it. When I collected it from the library and saw the size, I outwardly groaned, wondering how I would tackle it. I needn't have worried. Dawkins takes us on a 'backwards' pilgrimage through time, showing how we humans joined up with all other living creatures along the way. After getting through half the book and discovering that we'd already passed mammals, birds and fish, I wondered how interested I'd actually be in cnidarians, ctenophores or choanoflagellates, but they proved to be equally as fascinating. Dawkins breaks the information into short chapters, or rendezvous points, relating things back to animals we've already encountered along the way. Yet he doesn't stop there. He shows how we link with fungi, plants and bacteria, before finally considering how the first life forms began and whether or not this could be recreated. What I particularly liked was how Dawkins doesn't make guesswork for periods that we just don't know about. Where dates are so far away that we don't have the full picture (500 million years and counting) Dawkins relates what is known, then tells us the current theories. The gaps still to be filled are not a disappointment, but an exciting prospect of things yet to learn. I don't have a scientific background at all, though I was able to understand most of what I read. I did get confused with some terms and with trying to keep track of the different classifications (kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species) or timescales (eon, era, period, epoch, age) plus all the subdivisions within these. Luckily the book was comprehensive enough that I was able to flip back to an earlier section, or refer to a chart to refamiliarise myself before moving on to the next tale. I was left feeling a little overwhelmed by the end and so I'll finish with a quote from Dawkins that encapsulates things - ""It is not pride in my book but reverence for life itself that encourages me to say, if you want a justification for the latter, open the former, anywhere at random. And reflect on the fact that although this book has been written from a human point of view, another book could have been written in parallel for any 10 million starting pilgrims. Not only is life on this plant amazing, and deeply satisfying, to all those whose senses have not become dulled by familiarity: the very fact that we have evolved the brain power to understand our evolutionary genesis redoubles the amazement and compounds the satisfaction."" "
68,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/442308-gwc,3,"Fascinating zoology but plenty of flotsam. ""The Beaver's Tale"" ""The Duckbill's Tale"" and ""The Axolotl's Tale"" are outstanding examples of modern naturalism. The classical genetics is adequate but the molecular data is explained minimally and not compelling. More details on the challenges and uncertainties inherent in genomic sequencing and cross-species comparisons would have been helpful. When Dawkins is not discussing zoology the writing is overly verbose, and suffers the professor's conceit of assuming his readers are interested in his opinions on matters beyond his expertise which are infused with the type of absolutism he criticizes elsewhere in the book. The poor, strangely moralistic mathematics and tired political rants are best left for the faculty lounge or starry-eyed students. This is a good 600-page book that could be a great 300-page book with some vigorous editing."
69,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57901-jerzy,5,"Fantastic! If I'd read this in high school I would definitely be a biologist by now.Often I agree with Dawkins' views on creationists, but usually he's an obnoxious ass about it. Thankfully, in this book he only disses them occasionally. For most of the book he sticks to his strengths, i.e., clear and exciting explanations of the beautiful yet structured diversity of the natural world.Lots of nifty thoughts about how evolution works and how mind-shatteringly cool life is. There's an interesting structure to the book, traveling backwards in time from today to the origin of life, and telling tales or lessons from each of our major ancestors along the way. It made me appreciate how much more there is to life than the small handful of mammals, fish, birds, and trees we usually think about."
70,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4788401-lee-harmon,5,"While I read different genres, I only review books with a religious content. So, if I may be excused for one of my “liberal Christian rants,” let me say this: It’s a sad day when a book about evolution earns a spot on the shelves of a religion blog. It simply astounds me that half of all Americans still do not believe in evolution. The evidence is so overwhelmingly against a young earth that if Christianity is going to survive, it must pull its head out of the sand and reinterpret the Bible’s creation story (anything but a literal interpretation!) before it alienates the coming generation, who will simply know better.This book will help. I’m not a fan of Dawkins’ anti-religion tirades, but when he sticks to his evolutionary biology, his writing is a pure delight. It’s insightful, highly intelligent, and witty. The subtitle of the book is A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution, and it’s a long journey backward in time from present-day humans to the beginnings of life four million years ago.You’ll meet Cro-Magnon man, the Neanderthals, chimpanzees and gorillas, monkeys, rodents and rabbits, reptiles, sharks, flatworms, sponges, fungi, plants, and far more, each with their own unique role and story to tell.Scientific understanding is, and ever will be, in a state of transition. As we learn, we shape our theories to fit the facts. It’s an exploration that never ends, an exciting quest for truth that Dawkins excels in sharing. He stops often along this journey back in time to introduce interesting life forms and their evolutionary sidebars, evoking wonder and appreciation for the real creation story that far exceeds any ancient tales. It’s such a treat that I’m almost envious of long-time creationists who can, by opening their minds and turning the cover of this book, open themselves up to a new world of wonder.You will see the world in a different way after reading this."
71,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"Richard Dawkins' ""the ancestor's tale"" is the story of all life on Earth told in reverse order. It starts from us ""moderns"" and goes back to our closer cousins, all the way back to the common ancestor of all life on Earth. Dawkins uses the word ""concestor"" to refer to a common ancestor. It's a fascinating tale. Even though I had to go through nearly 800 pages, I wasn't bored in one single moment. There were times, of course, when it got a little more technical, but all in all I learned so much since a wealth of information is presented in each chapter. We are all African apes. Chimpanzees are our closest cousins and we share roughly 98 percent of our genes with them. You learn that natural selection grants no possibility of foresight. In other words, evolution does not plan ahead. To Alfred Wallace and Charles Darwin, co-discoverers of natural selection, the geographical aspect of natural history gave away the fact of evolution. If species were created independently, why should a Creator choose to put 50 species of lemur on Madagascar, but nowhere else? Why should the Galapagos host a set of finches so different from species on other oceanic islands, but strikingly similar both to each other and to birds on the nearest mainland? For Darwin, peahens choose peacocks simply because, in their eyes, they are pretty (sexual selection). For Alfred Wallace, there's something more than the outward appearance. The bright feathers are a token of their underlying health and fitness. In the fruit fly tale, we learn about DNA mechanism. Textbooks of biology are wrong when they describe DNA as a blueprint. Embryos do nothing remotely like following a blueprint. DNA is not a description in any language, of what the finished body should look like. On this planet, embryos follow recipes. Creationists foolishly liken darwinian natural selection to a hurricane blowing through a junkyard and having the luck to assemble a Boeing 747. They are wrong, of course, for they completely miss the gradual, cumulative nature of natural selection."
72,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/350233-casey,4,"After finishing The Selfish Gene, I rushed out to the store to buy another of Dawkins' books. While the size of this tome was quite intimidating, I found the premise utterly fascinating. The narrative traces humans' evolutionary ancestry, from primates to ""concestor zero,"" or the beginning of life on Earth.Dawkins' knowledge of zoology shines as he gives examples of the fascinating animals that share some of our genes. Readers will undoubtedly learn about plants and animals they had never heard of before, from Australian marsupials to the strange creatures that inhabit Madagascar. The book reads like a novel, and after finishing it I feel more connected, not just to my own species, but to all the creatures around me that share in this crazy thing called life."
73,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81791013-michael-kress,4,"Dawkins was the author who made me realize how fascinating evolutionary biology is. I had read a few of his books before I started this one, but they were all around 300 to 400 pages. This one is 614 pages. It goes back in time, starting in the present moment until we finally reach the dawn of evolution. What an interesting way to write a book! It tells the stories of many species and the common ancestors that we share with them. As the book progresses, our cousins get more and more distant. Eve's Tale explains how the Y chromosome was passed down from mother to daughter through all generations and can be traced back to a hypothetical “Eve.” The Peacock's Tale explains how male peacocks evolved colorful, flashy looking feathers to attract a mate. The Dodo's Tale is a sad story about extinction. Dodos never had to deal with predators, so they never evolved any ways of escaping from them. When humans arrived on their island, they were so slow and easy to kill that they went extinct in a short period of time. There are many more stories like these in the book. The ending of the book is well written and comes around full circle in a cool way. If you've never read anything by Dawkins, I would recommend The Selfish Gene or River Out of Eden. But if you have already read a few of his books, this is a good one that goes a little more in depth."
74,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,5,"Richard Dawkins has done an astounding job producing this book. If it were not for his other great works, The Selfish Gene and The Extended Phenotype: The Long Reach of the Gene, The Ancestor's Tale would be his best work in evolutionary science. It matters not one bit that it's a summary and synthesis of others' primary work: great scientists have always been able to look out across their field of expertise and write a defining work of value for both scientists and the educated public.My only, slight, quibble with the book is that in the decade since it was published there has been significant change in many parts of the ""tree of life."" More species have been discovered, more fossils found. Most importantly, molecular analysis across species of shared genetic haplotypes and DNA from mitochondria has unleashed a tidal wave of new information allowing a more precise determination of our common ancestors, especially the most distant. Dawkins used the earlier results of this same research when writing this book in 2003, but he notes in the book itself that it would have to be revised soon with new information. That, of course, is the way of science and what makes it exciting.Thus, I'm happy to find that the second, updated, edition will be published in early 2016 (see here: The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Life) with the latest scientific developments and additional evolution-relevant species ""tales."" I hope that one of these is ""told"" by a member of the fascinating Fungi—one of the three great multicellular kingdoms—with which we share an unidentified common ancestor roughly 1.1 billion years ago. The original edition naturally includes this rendezvous along with background information, but omits the tale.Should you wait for the new edition? No, unless your a critic of fine detail. The deep time and awesome diversity of evolution will not change. Our place as a species relative to the rest of life will not shift. And Dawkins' inspiring prose will remain."
75,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"What an interesting way to look at evolution, from the present back into the past in the format of & a homage to Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales. He chose 40 major stops along the journey & told some great tales. Thankfully, these were usually from his perspective so there wasn't any foolishness, but he was entertaining.I found the backward format a really good way of cementing various relationships into my mind better. There was a lot of new (to me) & fascinating material about how evolution works. He came up with great examples & occasionally wandered into other interesting areas such as human races.“Natural selection is a beguiling counterfeiter of deliberate purpose.”“Evolution, or its driving engine natural selection, has no foresight. In every generation within every species, the individuals best equipped to survive and reproduce contribute more than their fair share of genes to the next generation. The consequence, blind as it is, is the nearest approach to foresight that nature permits."" I've read several other books on evolution by Dawkins, so there was some repetition, but he cut down on much of that himself by referencing where he originally went into detail. As an audiobook read by him & Ward, it was fantastic, as always. Highly recommended."
76,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,5,"Dawkins presents evolutionary biology in a Chaucerian format. As with the pilgrims in The Canterbury Tales, each of Dawkins tales is about pilgrims on their way to a common destination, in this case the beginning of life. Each group of species marches back in time rendezvousing where they share their most recent common ancestor, what Dawkins calls a “Concester”. The first rendezvous is six million years ago (6 Ma) where we, our Homo and Australopithecine ancestors share a Concestor with the chimpanzees, bonobos and their ancestors. Dawkins describes 40 rendezvous such as the apes meet the monkeys at 25 Ma, the primates meet the rodents and rabbits at 75 Ma, the chordates meet the echinoderms at 550 Ma and ending with bacteria. Working backwards helps eliminate hindsight, assuming that a creature evolved in a certain way because in the future it would be important. Each tale not only describes some life form but some aspect of science associated with it. For example we learn how scientists use the fossil record and genetic techniques as evaluation tools. He shows how dates and evolutionary branches are derived from genetics using mitochondrial DNA, the Y chromosome and triangulation of DNA sequences. He explains how dates are determined using dendrochronology (tree rings), paleomagnetism, and radioactive decay. As we follow the path of evolution in reverse, we learn the science behind it.I read the updated 2016 version coauthored with Yan Wang. It reflects recent discoveries such as those of the Denisovans, whose story takes the place of the Neanderthals in the earlier version. Improvements in DNA extraction and sequencing enabled scientists in 2009 to derive the entire genome of a Denisovian from a 40,000 year old fingertip. There are many other revisions and corrections to the first edition published in 2006. In another update convergent replaces related development to explain the origin of many flightless birds such as the Dodo. Genetic studies now show they are descended from pigeons that became isolated on remote islands where they thrived growing big and losing their wings. Our understanding of the tree of life is always changing. Below are other samples of Dawkins’ discussions that caught my attention.Dawkins presents evolution as a flow of groups of individuals. Species arise when intermediate creatures become extinct. But as evolution occurs there are no distinct lines. A variety of archaic Homo sapiens blurred the dividing line between Homo erectus and modern Homo sapiens. Classification can be arbitrary and is often contested. New genes work their way through the group and if the group is isolated from other groups eventually it becomes distinct. This all takes time. If closely related groups come in contact with each other there is hybridization. Modern humans apparently interbred with Neanderthals 45000 years ago even though the two lines had separated 500,000 years before that. Similarly modern humans interbred with Denisovans. Dawkins offers perspective citing the ring species. He points to California salamanders in mountains that form a circle around the Central Valley. At the southern end two distinct populations won’t interbreed, but each population interbreeds with its neighbors in the other direction. This interbreeding continues uninterrupted all around the mountains coming back to the neighbors that won’t interbreed. There is an unbroken chain between the two. Are they separate species? Similarly gulls that won’t interbreed in Britain interbreed with their neighbors to the east and west forming a continuous chain around the world ending with each other. Like the salamanders, the gulls are connected to each other through the unbroken chain until at the ends the differences seem to have become too great. Dawkins uses the ring species as an example of what happens with all species through time. There is a similar uninterrupted chain from us to our australopithecine ancestors and to the beginning of life. Only the demise of intermediaries lets us define species. Was the most recent common ancestor, Concester, of humans and chimpanzees bipedal? Some scientists believe this is the case. The chimpanzee may have reverted to knuckle walking. What drove bipedalism in the first place? Ability to see over tall grass, ability to carry food back to a mate, ability to squat feed for long periods when snails and worms were more abundant than fruit, or as Dawkins thinks, sexual selection? Even back then females may have liked their mates to stand tall. They and/or their males may also have preferred less body hair. No other ape lost its hair so sexual selection as opposed to natural selection seems reasonable. In most animals females select their mates, but Darwin thought that men selected women for less body hair. Whichever way, both sexes would be affected. A mate with a bigger brain may also have curried favor.Dawson educates us on plate tectonics and its evolutionary effects. The formation and breakup of Pangea into Laurasia and Gondwana had significant implications for the diversity of life. Subsequent breakups isolating Madagascar and Australia explain their unique animals. We get the Platypus Tale. Is the platypus primitive? It had as much time to evolve as we have. It lays eggs and has a bill but what a bill – supersensitive to movement and electric field disturbances. What other mammal can locate its prey without listening, seeing or touching it? Dawkins explores the nerve connections between bill and brain and speculates that the platypus visualizes the feedback from its bill just as we do the feedback from our eyes.Dawkins’ tale of the sea squirt shows the tongue and cheek that is sprinkled through his writing. This amazing creature starts out with a notochord and nervous system making it a chordate, a member of our phylum. It looks like a tadpole as a juvenile swimming around then in its adult stage, it lands head first on a rock and permanently attaches itself. It digests its nerve system, notochord and other parts and turns into a big bag that filters the plankton from seawater. Dawkins digresses ”A second Aldous Huxley might project fictional human longevity to the point where some super-Methuselah finally settles down on his head and metamorphoses into a giant sea squirt, fastened permanently to the sofa in front of a television.” Perhaps today we should substitute tablet or phone for TV. In either case, once settled, Dawkins notes that it “eats its brain, like an associate professor getting tenure.” We are entertained by the stories of many other bizarre creatures, behaviors and relationships. Who would, aside from a zoologist, think of the echinoderm (starfish, sea cucumber, etc.) as sharing the most recent common ancestor we have with another phylum? The starfish’s radial design means it has no front or back, left or right. It may lead with any of its five legs. Its nerve cord forms a circle. Its anus is on top and mouth on bottom. Yet the molecular biologists say its genes show it evolved from a bilateral animal just like us.What about the bdelloid rotifers? All of these tiny aquatic animals are female. There is no need for males, no shared gene pool. Each rotifer reproduces a new organism with two sets of chromosomes as do animals that reproduce sexually. Thus over the millennia as mutations accumulate the genes will become even more diverse than those in a shared pool. Millions of years of asexual reproduction have resulted in more than 450 species of these unique creatures. Then there are the animals that keep their males in place – literally. Some trigger fish females carry their diminutive males on their sides for use when and as needed. Some scale insect females carry their males as mere specs on their legs.Dawkins explores the beginning of life. He looks at RNA World theory which holds that life started with RNA as both a replicator and an enzyme, in essence a self-replicating catalyst. He points to experiments that show segments of RNA taken from viruses can replicate and evolve in water. He discusses the idea of life forming in rocks, going even further afield than theories about life starting around hydrothermal vents. He point out that cracks in rocks are teeming with bacteria that live off of chemical processes without benefit of the sun. Finally he ponders the different ways life could have evolved. If we went back to the beginning and started all over again what would life be like today? What aspects have been convergent and which contingent. Many features evolved more than once, for example eyes, echolocation, and flight. Others such as our big brains and use of language evolved only once. Perhaps most significant is the incorporation of bacteria into archaea forming mitochondria which made life for us eukaryotes possible. Nick Lane argues in his book Power, Sex, Suicide that this event would be unlikely to ever be repeated.The Ancestor’s Tale is a tour de force, a comprehensive view of evolutionary biology full of fascinating details about diverse life forms. It is packed with the latest scientific theories. Above all it demonstrates the interconnectedness of all life. This clearly is heartfelt by Dawkins. His awe and enthusiasm for his subject is infectious. Reading it was an experience. After 700 pages, I was sorry it was over. For those with a serious interest I can’t recommend it highly enough."
77,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,5,"I love this book. It's not the kind of thing I usually read, because I prefer fiction to non-fiction by far, at least when I have a choice about it. And I really, really loathe Dawkins' The God Delusion, largely because of the tone he takes toward people who are religious believers. But The Ancestor's Tale is mostly just science, and it's written in an accessible, almost conversational way. It actually has literary ancestors (ha), in the form of The Canterbury Tales, which Dawkins chose as his format to tell the tale of a pilgrimage through history to find our ancestors. He does slip in some references to his own beliefs, but here they aren't too offensive or intrusive.When I say 'accessible', I don't mean 'dumbed down'. The science and maths and the theory and the sheer detail is here. I read a couple of reviews that people found it boring once it got to a certain point because there's 'too much detail' about things like bacteria. Which I think is more of a 'your mileage may vary' attitude than anything -- I think Dawkins gave the space to the bacteria that they deserve, all things considered.There's a lot of speculation in here, too -- but so much of science is speculation. Dawkins is fairly clear about when he can and can't 'prove' things, and explains the methods by which they can be proved if they can. You don't have to have a huge knowledge of science or maths to understand -- some, and an interest in it, I suppose, but not so very very much."
78,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14115149-jaclynn,4,"Not recommended for those with a passing interest in evolution...this is heavy into the math and science realms. This is an extremely in depth, hefty tome as seen from the point of view of homo sapiens travelling backwards in time to the dawn of life. Dawkins tale is modeled after Canterbury Tales, and is about pilgrims on their way to a common destination, in this case the beginning of life. Each group of species marches back in time rendezvousing where they share their most recent common ancestor, what Dawkins calls a “Concester”. The first rendezvous is six million years ago (6 Ma) where we, our Homo and Australopithecine ancestors share a Concestor with the chimpanzees, bonobos and their ancestors. There are so many thought-provoking concepts in this book, but this is a challenging book to read, not only because it is so long, but because of the many complex concepts that are described. But the entire book is fascinating. With each species rendezvous, a fractal diagram portrays the branching, along with dates and contour lines; what a fabulous visual portrayal of the concept of evolution! I am continually amazed the genius of Dawkins...this book is so comprehensive, it is daunting just thinking about it, let alone researching and writing it!"
79,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/270879-robin,5,"This is my favorite book in the whole world. Someday it may be eclipsed by something else but for now it's this. What I love most about this book is the number of times I found myself thinking, ""Wow, I had no idea"". It makes perfect sense when you think it out, but the entire premise of the book, that every living thing on earth, from human being to plant to bacteria, shares a common ancestor, that actually existed at a point sufficiently far enough in the past. The book consists of a ""pilgrimage"" to that ancestor modeled loosely after ""The Canterbury Tales"". "
80,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44504-brian,5,"I've been a fan of Dawkins for a while solely based on interviews, but this is the first of his books I've actually read. It works its way backwards through the evolutionary tree, detailing how all living things are related - how a stranger on the street, your dog, your house plant, bacteria and you are all distant cousins. It's a fascinating read, technical enough if you're interested, but not so much so that it's threatening to the non-science minded. It's broken into various ""tales"" - ""The Howler Monkey's Tale"", ""The Hippo's Tale"", ""The Blind Cave Fish's Tale"" - a la Chaucer - which makes the size of the book a bit less daunting. Best of all, it's excellent ammunition for the next time you find yourself in a debate with someone arguing for ""intelligent design."""

With a form based loosely on Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, Dawkins marches back in time to each of humankind's ancestors. Witty, brilliant and engaging, you will learn a great deal about evolutionary biology, and a million fun and intriguing facts. Whether you agree to disagree with the facts establishing evolution as a law of science, this book is worth your time. Plus, it is so dense and rich, you will feel proud to put it on your shelf after you have finished it!! "
82,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,4,"This book is a sort of Canterbury Tales for evolutionary biology.It follows our ancestors back to the root as they merge with other branches on the tree of life.For those who know programming, this sums it up succinctly:for(Species i = humans; i.parent != null; i = i.parent) { print(i.anecdotes[rand() % i.anecdotes.length]);}Dawkins is awesome. Yep."
83,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,4,"Hefty Tome That Explains Evolution in Great DetailIf you have a hardcopy of this book, you know just how thick it is, and how dense the content is. Each chapter is another essay on the incredible mechanisms by which selective mutation, adaptation, and reproduction over millions of generations have led to the plethora of life on Earth, and how the process is not directed by a divine being waving life into existence, but rather an unfathomable number of successes and failures among individual creatures, with the only measure of success being reproduction, can lead to such a mind-boggling diversity of species.Dawkin's recurring theme as he delves further and further back to our more distant common ancestors is that evolution, while not directed from above, can often lead to convergence at similar outcomes, such as the independent development of eyes (truly a miracle of gradual evolution), sonar, poison, and various survival mechanisms in different locations and eras over hundreds of millions of years. While I think many readers, no matter how educated or knowledgeable they may be about evolutionary biology, may still struggle to accept that all this complexity and diversity is not a result of ""intelligent design"", I think Dawkins makes the case repeatedly and in great logical detail, and in the end it is we ourselves, as conscious and thinking intelligent beings, that can recognize and understand that we would not exist if it weren't for these incredible mechanisms over vast ages that have produced ourselves and all other life from microscopic life billions of years ago, our common ancestor."
84,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11331153-andy,5,"Your 30-million-greats-grandparent was a shrew. Your 270-million-greats-grandparent from over half a billion years ago looked like this worm. Did I mention that its mouth doubled as its anus? This book is filled with ways ways of making you feel very small. This is the type of book that doesn't let you ever see the world the same again, and proves that religion doesn't have a lock on the feelings of awe and the sublime.In an article from 2009 ""Growing Up in Ethology"" Dawkins describes this book as ""the largest and most demanding of my career"" noting that he almost gave up on it several times. It's understandable, apart from the contents, this book is audacious in its scope and detail. I got so deep into it that I was having recurrent dreams about its concepts and creatures.There's a lot of fascinating stories here -- too many to mention but I can't help going through many of them. When reading this I wanted to tell people how amazing this is, but I don't know too many people that are interested in science, so pardon me, this is my outlet. These are some that stuck me as particularly noteworthy.>>The Axolotl's Tale is about ""pedomorphosis"" which is where the juvenile of a species can become sexually mature without fully developing into an adult, and so it and its offspring never do. The axolotl does look like a larval-salamander hybrid which remains in the water. Many species carry within them the ""instructions"" to metamorphize through various stages (tadpoles into frogs for example), so strictly in theory, they could go backward too. This happens in newts which start as a larva, then emerge on land for some years, then return to water and regain some larval characteristics. It's speculated many species we see could be ""between stages"" like ostriches. As big as they are, they're actually juvenile chickens with their stubby wings. Some have speculated we are juvenile chimps and Dawkins doesn't entirely discount this idea.>>The Hippo's Tale was an amazing explanation of their close genetic relationship to whales, and how certain land animals returned to the water and became ""fish,"" evolving quickly because water-living took away their struggle with gravity. Likely there was a common ancestor which split into camels (and others) on one side, and hippo's/whales on the other, but we shouldn't imagine the ancestor necessarily looked like either. I also didn't know that camels originally evolved in what would have been considered North America, during a period when the position of the continents looked much different.>>The Howler Monkey's Tale explained how mammals lost their color vision due to becoming nocturnal shrew-like creatures during the age of the dinosaurs when they had to hide underground and only emerge at night. After the dinosaurs died off they re-emerged and re-gained the ability to see color which they'd retained in their genes, but this ability has been ""re-enabled"" in many independent ways.>>The Lungfish's Tale explains how we likely emerged from the water for the first time, and explores various fish today that ""walk"" on land for short periods. It is likely that our ancestor developed the ability to walk because it was attempting to get BACK into water from tide pools that left it stranded away from food sources.>>The Galapagos Finch's Tale showed in a powerful way how quickly evolution can occur due to certain ""bottlenecks"" or die-offs.>>The Fruit Fly's Tale's explanation of Hox genes and how they control the development of an embryo. This chapter takes a fairly complex concept and makes it understandable.>>The Lamprey's Tale tells about how different their haemoglobin genes (for carrying oxygen in the blood) are from ours. We split off from a common ancestor long, long ago and duplicated our genes for globin several times while lamprey's are from a very ancient ancestor, they predate this split and use much older globin genes. They independently evolved a system for oxygen carrying, as birds and bats independently evolved flight.And ""independent"" or ""convergent"" evolution is another big theme here. There are a couple of chapters that touch on how geographic distance evolves specialized species, some of which take up similar niches and roles that are found in other continents. Australia for example has evolved its version of the dog, the flying squirrel, the mole, etc. Dawkins sees the kangaroo as a sort of hopping version of the gazelle, and makes a good case for it.>>The Brine Shrimp's Tale explains how vertebrates are likely descended from worms that learned to swim on their backs, and adapted their internal organs for such. The Brine Shrimp's organs have similarly adapted so that it is no longer technically swimming ""upside down."" Some catfish today swim upside down and have started to adapt a camouflage system that is essentially the opposite of those who swim normally, i.e. their bellies are darker than their backs.>>The Rotifer's Tale explores asexual reproduction, how originally pairs of chromosomes became independent from one another by gradual mutations, whereas our pairs are copies of one another. Dawkins engages in an interesting discussion about whether sex is really necessary, and the natural selection pressure benefits it creates.>>In the Salamander's Tale Dawkins explores ""ring species."" The Central Valley of California has a section of mountains which form a ring around a valley. Salamanders live in the mountains around the valley, but do not venture into the valley itself. Those on the east side appear quite different from the western one, but in fact they are the same species and form a vast ring of gradual differentiation in coloring, those on the opposite sides are just too far from one another to interbreed. This is seen in a species of gull that forms a ring species that encircles the whole Earth! Dawkins makes the point that we humans could be a ""ring species"" too if the intermediates between us and the chimpanzees had not died off. When viewed this way it totally blurs the lines when thinking of separate species to begin with.>>The lengthy penultimate chapter ""Canterbury"" was the best thing I've read and better than any documentaries I've seen on how life theoretically began. Dawkins is honest about the many challenges, and lists a variety of scientific experiments which show how these can be overcome, at least in theory. He goes into detail about enzymes, mRNA, tRNA and ribosomes and makes it all understandable. Some textbook diagrams would have been appreciated, but the descriptions are still well-handled.There's many more examples of course. This book in the updated 2016 edition is over 700 pages and although this is the only book on evolution I've read, I imagine I'd be hard-pressed to find another that goes into this level of detail while still being this reader-friendly. Dawkins strikes a good balance.It's worth mentioning that this is a challenging read at times, primarily in the early chapters. (The chapter on Gibbon monkeys particularly so, but don't get discouraged!) At times there was more focus on methods than I probably wanted. For example, I don't need two pages of explanation of logarithmic graphing, I'll take your word for it that the graph is accurate.This book fits well with my overall ""Ligottian"" cosmic perspective on life. At one point in ""The Beaver's Tale"" Dawkins remarks, ""Do you protest that there aren’t ‘really’ any genes for behaviour; only genes for the nerves and muscles that make the behaviour? You are still wrecked among heathen dreams."" He doesn't exactly call us puppets of biology, he's subtler than that, but he makes a compelling argument. He uses the phrase ""clockwork mechanism,"" and a bit later in the same chapter he discusses how beavers held in a bare room will attempt to make dams when there's nothing at all there. That really put things in perspective.Dawkins very rarely speaks on religion or creationism in this book, he assumes the reader believes evolution is true -- which it is. But he does leave us with this, with which I wholeheartedly agree:""My objection to supernatural beliefs is precisely that they miserably fail to do justice to the sublime grandeur of the real world. They represent a narrowing-down from reality, an impoverishment of what the real world has to offer.""I've thought something like this for years, and reading this book can only open eyes to how amazing the real world is."
85,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7408040-mark-hartzer,5,"It's a shame that some people get caught up in Mr. Dawkins as a supposed spokesman for Atheism because first and foremost, he's a scientist, and this book is about the science behind life on Earth. In order to better explain evolutionary science, Dawkins metaphorically borrows Chaucer's journey to Canterbury to travel back in time. We start in the present day, and then examine our common ancestors from mammals, to birds, reptiles, etc... all the way back to bacteria and how life itself may have come to be. It's a compelling argument.The book is full of ideas to contemplate. For example, in ""The Peacock's Tale"" chapter, he addresses human bare skin and why. ""Humans don't just have bare skin on their rumps like monkeys. They have bare skin all over, except on the top of the head, under the arms and in the pubic region. When we get ectoparasites such as lice, they are often confined to these very regions. Lice need hair, and Pagel and Bodmer's first suggestion is that the benefit of losing our body hair was that it reduced the real estate available to lice. Two questions arise. Why, if losing hair is such a good idea, have other mammals who also suffer from ectoparasites kept theirs?"" (And why is it still retained on our heads, etc...?)I won't give away the answers, but the analysis is thoughtful and persuasive. This is not a beach read. It demands your attention and concentration in order to consider the themes presented. I thought the time invested in the book was time well spent. 5 stars."

He starts the journey working backwards, beginning with Homo Sapiens and then the earliest bipedal apes like Homo Habilis, then ending with the earliest replicating life, the one that would've started it all billions of years ago. Unfortunately, it didn't leave any fossils behind (soft-body creatures tend not to sadly but it has happened at a site in China) but if we work the molecular clock backwards we can deduce that somewhere in the 'primordial soup' a molecule began to copy itself, and it was really good at it.As we meet the different pilgrims Dawkins explains how evolution shaped life in the most exciting and unusual ways. Some creatures on our planet function in the most ridiculous ways. I don't wish to spoil these parts but it is awe-inspiring for sure.This was a fun and truly educating read for me. I learned so much about the different kinds of life that inhabit our planet. Human beings are just one tiny branch in the grand tree of life. We have only been here for a second in geological time, a drop in the bucket. The Ancestor's Tale is a humbling experience."

90,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39755297-fipah,4,"4 stars = I really liked itDividing the book into two digestible parts (that themselves count as books really) was what I've done and I can recommended it, yet the drawback is one does not remember very well the points he made in the first half of the book, however it was not at all disturbing - even though Dawkins makes connections, each chapter is standalone and he makes the effort to look at the key points one has learned throughout the book from various angles, which summarises the whole experience and makes the journey very well connected.This book is not only about the evolution of biodiversity, it is richly interwoven with variegated topics and scientific disciplines that underpin the interdisciplinarity of the study of the history of life such as epigenetics, the importance of logarithms in science, plate tectonics or a short chapter on what it is probably like to have a grandiose sense of smell and no eyesight. I hold Dawkins as very skillful at this - he always manages to use varied sources to unify his arguments and, moreover, this makes any text of his captivating and complete. Also, he does not shy away from making fluid ventures into social and political commentaries for example on racism, sexism or (expectedly) creationism. I mostly found these to be succinct and well connected.As a person who has read a few books about molecular biology, genetics and evolution, and studied an undergraduate degree in Ecology for one year, many ideas did not feel very fresh to me, hence the book only summarised what I have already learnt. Consequently, it felt like another TV documentary about animals for general public with the same commonplace topics and arguments - yet of course, the book was deeper indeed, this is just how it felt a bit to me. I found this to be especially true of the second half of the book, since the first dealt with humans, apes and chimpanzees, so its anthropological outlook was more novel to me. This by no means is a criticism of the book, it should only serve as a warning to prospective readers who have either studied a STEM degree (escpecially biology-related) or read many (pop) science books. This book is indeed about evolution and animals which is Dawkins' expertise, yet all the other science and theories he explains like the central dogma of molecular biology or the evolution of eucaryotic cells should already be pretty familar to such readers.Last warning: Especially in the second half of the book I found his ideas and writing to be lengthy - the length of the book no longer feflt justified. This is just a thing to keep in mind.Recommended to readers who are interested in the evolution of biodiversity and who have not read many other pop-science books about evolution, molecular biology, Earth history and archaelogy.

91,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk,3,"Non-Fiction. 4 billion years of evolution, practically in real time. To avoid any ""human-centrism,"" Dawkins -- famous for his outspoken stance against creationism -- does this backwards and models the journey on Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. Scared yet? Well, it's not in rhyme or Old English, but Dawkins does tend toward lofty language and wild, rambling digressions. It bugged me at first, but over the course of this SIX HUNDRED PAGE BOOK, I got used to it and even grew to appreciate Dawkins and his sly humor. He actually made me laugh out loud a couple times.The pilgrimage conceit holds up: we travel backwards in time to meet a series of common ancestors, starting with concestor 1 (for ""common ancestor""), where mankind splits from the chimpanzees, and ending with concestor 39, the first life on Earth. At each stop he describes what that ancestor may have looked like, where it lived, and how long ago.The Chaucer conceit never got off the ground. Most tales, like ""The Armadillo's Tale,"" don't tell you anything about the animal the tale's dedicated to. There are a few exceptions to this, though, like ""The Beaver's Tale"" or ""The Brine Shrimp's Tale."" Those actually address the qualities of the animal in question, and were some of my favorites because of it.One of the best things about this book is that Dawkins freely admits -- early and often -- that a lot of what he's talking about is based on limited data and/or guesswork and may be wrong. He goes out of his way to offer alternate theories and differing opinions, though he always singles out the position he finds most likely. I love it when scientists admit they don't know things, and Dawkins has no problem with that. He can sound arrogant and in love with his own voice (the number of times he quotes himself and his previous books!!!), but at heart I think he really loves the subject and wants to share it with people. It's a long, and sometimes difficult, book to read. It gets into genetics, math, biology, taxonomy, chemistry, pretty much everything, and at times the explanations get messy or too technical. I liked the biology parts best -- the different ways organisms evolve and why, and there was plenty of that to keep me interested. It's a lot of information, though still a very basic look at the diversity of life. I started out reading it like homework -- 10-20 pages a day -- but after I got the hang of it, I was reading 30 and 40 pages without breaking a sweat. Did I enjoy it? I think so? I definitely know a little bit about a LOT of things now, and it made me want to read more about evolution.Three stars for the book and the information it provides, and FIVE stars for me for making it through."
92,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10781757-otherwyrld,4,"I approached a book of this size and scope with some trepidation (seriously, you could kill someone if you hit them over the head with the hardback edition), how could this possibly cover the whole history of life on Earth. I also note that I have had issues in the past with the authors writing style, which can run to the overly verbose to my taste, as well as the huge hype over his anti religion stand that tends to get a lot more publicity than his actual books do.So, on the whole this monumental work succeeds admirably, notwithstanding my above mentioned misgivings. This book takes us on a journey from our most recent ancestors backwards to meet shared ancestors (or concestors as the author describes them) along the way, a la The Canterbury Tales, with the ultimate goal being the beginnings of life itself. Along the way the author tells numerous tales in the same way as Geoffrey Chaucer did to illustrate various points. In some ways these are both the best and the worst parts of the book, as this is where the authors writing style flourishes the most. The more straightforward descriptions of the species/genus (etc) that we encounter are easier to read though often quite dry and highly technical.There is a large prologue which looks at the history of hominids before it heads to the first rendezvous with Chimpanzees, then Gorillas, Orangutan and the rest of the primates in turn. This section alone takes up a third of the book, and mammals as a whole takes up half. This leaves little room for the rest of the species, with only insects taking up a large section in the rest of the book. Plants are particularly sidelined, which is a shame because it makes the book rather lopsided though I can understand racing through some sections because there really is very little to say about them. It did make the latter third of the book drag a little bit though and I slogged through to the end. The author wisely keeps his religious digs to a minimum, though he can't resist it the whole time. I can't really talk about the co-author as his voice doesn't really come through that much. The book has some nice colour plates to illustrate some of the species discussed, but the line illustrations leave a bit to be desired. mostly because they were shrunk too much to fit into the paperback edition. The overall idea of a fractal design for the various rendezvous' was a nice touch, and there is an extensive bibliography if you want to explore further. "
93,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,4,"Here's an ambitious bet: to tell the story of life on Earth as an odyssey, a pilgrimage backward in time. The approach is indeed original as, reading this book is like boarding a time machine where at each chapter we meet one of our ancestors -that Dawkins describes, showing in which ways its anatomy or way of life can serve a better understanding of why we are what we are. 40 ancestors are thus passing us by, from primates to mammals in general, vertebrates, invertebrates and, all the way until the unicellular organisms.Each encounter is also the occasion for a digression (a 'tale') on topics ranging from fossils conversation and datation, bipedalism, sex, the notion of 'race' or, again, the shaping of some organs. He even dares to defend (although not dogmatically) the 'primeval soup' hypothesis! (well...)A big book, those qualities are strangely enough also the bad points. The topic is indeed so vast that, some chapters are obviously more captivating than others, making it an hard and challenging read during the passages dealing with those ancestors that don't interest you that much. Yet, always a great populariser Dawkins delivers here one of the most thoughtful and complete story of life on Earth. Huge! "
94,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3744803-chris,5,"Richard Dawkins is the best writer on the topic of evolution that I have encountered. He is able to explain concepts in such a way as to make them easily understandable. All of the books that I have read by Dawkins have been very informative and entertaining as well. The Ancestor's Tale is a cleverly structured book in which Dawkins takes the reader on a journey chronologically back in time through our evolutionary history. Each successive chapter is the next branch of our evolutionary tree where Homo sapiens merges with our next most recent kin. The book cleverly mimics Chaucer's Canterbury Tales wherein each new member of the group tells a story. In The Ancestor's Tale, each of these ""tales"" is told by one of the species that we are joining with in the current branch. The story is always about some aspect of evolution that is pertinent in some way to the species telling the tale.  The Ancestor's Tale is the best book that I have read on evolution up to this point and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in this subject."
95,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70965168-youp,5,"Recently I've been on somewhat of a Dawkins reading-spree. He is at his best when focussing on evolutionary biology as much as possible, and on religion the least amount possible. The Ancestor's Tale consists almost exclusively of evolution and biology related content, and Dawkins does an amazing job of taking his reader on an epic journey.While I was fascinated by the concept of a journey backwards through time, meeting fellow lifeforms on the major forks of evolution, the execution could have failed in numerous ways. Fortunately, Dawkins delivers a captivating story from the very first chapter, and unfailingly continues to amaze until the last page. Not only does the author explain important branch-offs on the evolutionary tree; he describes the modern day features of our distant cousins in a way that creates a new found appreciation for the almost magical power of natural selection. The Ancestor's Tale is incredibly original, brilliantly written and covers a huge amount of terrority while providing enough depth to continually amaze."

Dawkins guides us along on the greatest pilgrimage ever to the dawn of evolution in a style reminiscent of The Canterbury Tales.

Slightly cheapened by a few brief but unnecessary political comments. Jabs at religion are to be expected with a Dawkins book, but unless directly addressing creationist claims, also unnecessary.

The several interweaving tales of our ancestor (or cousin) species -- for instance, the fascinating evolution of the whale -- provides a fresh, breathing narrative to what could have been a very dry book.

109,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84660-swankivy,4,"This doorstopper of a book was a lot more fun than you might think, considering the subject matter. Richard Dawkins has a certain way of telling stories that makes them palatable even when, like me, you aren't exactly learned in the subject. I wouldn't say I'm ignorant about the topic at hand, and I have certainly known better since middle school than to perceive evolution as if it's ""humans evolved from modern apes,"" but I learned a heck of a lot of stuff here. In between all the little stories about creatures I'd often never heard of and occasional anecdotes about Dawkins's personal experiences and relationships with other scientists, there were tales of discovery, of archaeological and biological history, and of how nature works. Even though it did feel a tad long and drawn out for me, now at the end of the road I think I appreciated that it took its time, with a leisurely feel that made every encounter with another ""concestor"" feel important enough to give time to.I would like to share some specific individual thoughts and quotes on the book here.I liked Dawkins's discussion of evolution not being a concept of other beings on their way to becoming us. They weren't unfinished when they were alive, just like modern animals today aren't unfinished because they're not us and none of us are unfinished because one day our descendants will be different from us.I enjoyed the explanation of why we all have one ancestor, as impossible as that sounds, because of DNA's existence. If there were other types of creatures before DNA's ""birth"" that replicated a different way, they left no descendants because every creature alive today has DNA, and if there were later ones coming into existence, they'd immediately be eaten by bacteria.DNA is compared to telegrams and I liked that analogy very much. It's because they have to use the same letters that make up meaningful words to also indicate pauses, like STOP, and DNA has that situation too how its codes are run end to end, with some junk here and there. A cool factoid: If you find a population that's been isolated for X years, then you know the common ancestor WE have with them can't be younger than that. An alien looking at human and gibbon genitals would think the males are more related to each other than they are to the females of their own species. If we interpret based only on physical factors that look similar, we may be making the same mistake.There's some cool info about color vision and how some old-world monkeys are primarily color blind but some females have color vision. It was all explained really neatly.Richard Dawkins had a pet bushbaby as a kid and sometimes it would pee on him from above. Just throwing that out there.I like how he discusses the uncertainty of his branches, how recently evidence he's using was developed and how accepted it is, and the fact that new evidence may change where certain creatures join the ancestor pilgrimage.There was a good discussion of the meaning of ""primitive"" with regard to whether a species is primitive in one way and therefore primitive in another (""primitive"" means ""resembling the ancestor""). A good quote that sums it up: ""There is no substance called Essence of Antiquity that pervades the blood and soaks into the bones.""There's a really good metaphor about a bobbing cork as an explanation of overall trends in evolution. If you tracked it over time and saw that it was going toward the east, you know that looking back, but if you just analyzed its movements as it bobs up and down and gets tossed around in the ocean, you couldn't necessarily say where it will end up based on such small movements.Sometimes Dawkins would just throw out a comparison that would come out of nowhere and be funny. Case in point: ""Capable of swallowing a medium-sized lawyer whole.""There's a really well-explained section on how evolution is continuous and the categories between species are pretty artificial. No parent was a different species from their child, and a time machine taking people back a thousand years at a time should result in arriving at a population each could interbreed with. Overall of course, they're evolving, but there's no distinct time where you can say ""the parent was X; the child is Y."" Kind of like when you're warming up your bath water, there's not really a specific degree where you'd say the water is no longer warm but hot. A quote: ""More than once I have seen a reference to the larval sea squirt which, when the time comes, settles down to a sedentary life and 'eats its brain, like an associate professor getting tenure.'""Starfish, by the way, are really weird. Eeuuuwww.The Grasshopper's Tale discussed human ""races"" in association with how grasshoppers kinda have races based on what their song sounds like, and how they tend not to mate with different races, but will if you do something to make their song different. I was kinda irritated with how he digressed into some oversimplified or flat-out misleading representations of how race works. First off, he claimed people are asked to check one of 5 race boxes on forms, and offered ""Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, Native American, and Other"" as the choices. If I see boxes like these, they invariably include Asian and/or Pacific Islanders. Which is weird because he mentions Asians in the same topic. But then he goes on to say that mixed-race doesn't have its own name, offering ""Blue has a name. Green has a name. Blue-green does not."" Yes it does? Lots of blue-green mixtures have names, like turquoise. He goes on to say Affirmative Action isn't FAIR because it assumes an individual is being repaid for wrongs done to his ancestors. This seems a crass oversimplification and sadly pretty typical of privileged white dudes, especially since he probably should be well aware enough of social factors to realize that the legacy of slavery and other terrible events and trends affecting people of color are still resulting in those populations experiencing prejudice and poverty on a much higher level than whites do. Affirmative Action acknowledges that to get the same opportunities, disadvantaged populations have to come a longer distance from farther away (overall, as a population; obviously there are individual white people who are more disadvantaged on some axes than individual people of color, but this deals with an overall phenomenon, not with exceptions to the trend). Affirmative Action was not invented specifically as a reparations measure. It acknowledges CURRENT disadvantages that come from living in poverty and almost definitely having decisions about your life being made by racists who don't know they're racist but make racist decisions. Those racist decisions may sound less like ""his dark skin is ugly to me, so I'm not giving him a job"" but more like ""he speaks like a typical black person, which to my white ears has become synonymous with uneducated and rough; therefore I perceive him as not being as professional, or perhaps assume my customers will conclude that and therefore I will hire a person who speaks like me."" We'll pretend it's not about race but about readiness and deservingness of the job, but if someone's natural hair or accent or style of dress automatically makes us think less of them or makes us expect them to separate themselves from norms of their community to be acceptable to ours, those are racist perspectives. Those are the kinds of things Affirmative Action is attempting to counteract. Though for the record that program helps more white women than anyone, and we women contend with prejudices surrounding our competence, our ability to do certain types of work, and our likelihood of abandoning the career to make or care for babies. Anyway.Richard Dawkins demonstrated he does not know what Affirmative Action is for. Next.A quote: ""The third school of thought is, in my opinion, bonkers. Or, to use more parliamentary language, wildly and irresponsibly unrealistic."" Haha.He made a Philip Pullman reference and that made me happy. I was thinking about mufela from The Amber Spyglass when Dawkins started discussing microscopic creatures that evolved the only known natural wheel, and then he mentioned it too.I thought it was pretty awesome that toward the end of the book Dawkins went into detail about how evolution itself can evolve--that creatures who are better at evolving may have a better chance of survival, so therefore evolution's processes themselves can be improved through evolution.A final quote to close out my review: ""This pilgrimage has been a trip, not just in the literal sense, but in the countercultural sense I met when a young man in California in the 1960s. The most potent hallucinogen on sale in Haight or Ashbury or telegraph Avenue would be tame by comparison. If it's amazement you want, the real world has it all."""
110,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4568480-giuseppe-d,5,"Not even sure where to start on this one, it was a very exciting backwards journey from our species to the very origin of life, which probably looked nothing like what we call alive nowadays but rather just a self replicating organic molecule, nothing more than that.But this book is just as much about evolution as it is about other fields in biology such as zoology, comparative anatomy, genetics, phylogenetics, embryology, neuroscience.For instance, how are new genes introduced into a genome? Well, it turns out that 'new genes aren't added to the genome out of thin air. They originate as duplicates of older genes. Then, over evolutionary time, they go to their separate ways by mutation, selection and drift.'Or other interesting facts, like that the closest living relatives of hippos are whales!Or how we sometimes forget that our way of perceiving the world is not the only one. Playtpuses, for example, 'have about 40000 electrical sensors distributed [...] over both surfaces of the bill.' They use these electrical sensors to perceive the weak electric fields generated by their prey (while the prey use its muscles to move around).We also discover how many times gliding and flight have separately evolved as examples of convergent evolution. And how places like Australia and New Zeland, due to their historic isolation, provide cases for explaining how the evolution of species there is quite analogous to what happened in other parts of the world with each one occupying their own niche.I want to end this review with a citation that sums up why you should read this book: 'not only is life on this planet amazing, and deeply satisfying to all whose senes have not become dulled by familiarity: the very fact that we have evolved the brain power to understand our evolutionary genesis redoubles this amazement and compounds the satisfaction.' "
111,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4551268-sara-g,5,"This beautiful book was really captivating. I like Dawkins a lot, but I know he comes off as really abrasive to many people. In this book, though, rather than constantly being on the attack, he's describing the beauties and wonders of the natural world. I like his softer side.It's written in the form of a pilgrimage (like the Canterbury Tales), back to our most distant ancestors. It's human-centric for no reason other than relatability. Dawkins takes pains to mention that a similar pilgrimage could be focused on any living species today. He pauses at key moments in our evolutionary history to discuss our relationship with what he calls ""concestors"" - shared ancestors with other species on Earth. It's fascinating stuff, but very dense in places. My favorite part was the discussion about how life may have arisen on Earth and the ""RNA World"" origin theory, which I was previously unfamiliar with. This is why I read good popular science. The science I learned in school is painfully outdated. I've added quite a few books to my TBR based on Dawkins's recommendations and references here. This book isn't for everyone, but for someone with a decent scientific background, I think you could gain a lot.End note - I keep going back to the description of a Douglas Adams Doctor Who script mentioned in this book, where a time traveler keeps going back in time to weep for the dodos before they became extinct. I love this imagery."
112,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/362402-snehal-bhagat,5,"Political economy basics are often explained with the help of an analogy: we imagine a beach in summer with people sun-bathing; for the sake of simplicity, we assume that the beach is one-dimensional- a straight line running from left to right- and that the people are distributed approximately equidistant from each other. An enterprising ice-cream vendor comes along with his cart and sets up shop - where should he position himself if he desires to maximize his sales?Clearly, anywhere; for as long as he has a monopoly, people will walk from all over the beach to buy his product. For purposes of illustration, we imagine him settling somewhere near the extreme right of the beach. Now, should a second vendor selling ice-cream come onto the scene, and discover that people will buy ice-cream from the vendor closest to them, where must she position herself? Obviously she should set shop adjacent to the first vendor, but slightly to his left; she can then maximize her sales by cornering the bulk of the market. The loss of sales then forces the first vendor to move his cart to the left of vendor two and the jostling continues; it is straightforward to see that in a few iterations, both vendors end up next to each other close to the center of the beach in their bid to maximize their sales. The fictitious beach, of course represents a political issue, the bathers are the voters and the vendors the political parties; the goal is to maximize votes instead of sales (1). The first case represents a dictatorship, the second the two-party democracy; in the latter, over time, both parties grow to resemble each other as they take up near-identical stances on most issues, often differing only in semantics. Unless, that is, the two parties vary in their assessment of how voter preferences are distributed on an issue - if one party believes they are clumped more to the left, while the other believes the majority leans to the right, sharp divisions can occur, as is the case here in Australia where our (effectively) two-party system in federal politics is now polarized over a proposed carbon ETS.Exit political economy, enter evolutionary biology; for this is where the analogy ends. Whereas ice-cream vendors and political parties are prepared to move to maximize sales and votes on the basis of their assumptions about the distribution of bodies and voters, creationists and evolutionists are camped firmly on either end of the belief scale; both sides preach only to their respective choirs, and it is not clear why. The distribution of people with regards to their belief varies, but it is safe to say that most are either mildly agnostic or mild believers; and yet, it is the strong views that color the debate and polarize opinions - for the creationists the evolutionists shall join Darwin in hell and pay for their lack of faith, and for the evolutionists, creationism is good for a laugh, or two, but for little else. Dawkins appears to be at the forefront of the rather acrimonious debate and draws more than his fair share of the creationists' ire (2). Which is a shame, really, for just as Chomsky's political writings have the unfortunate consequence of discounting - or at least distracting from - his brilliant work as a linguist, so too do Dawkins' views on God and religion prevent many from acknowledging his stellar contribution to our understanding of nature, and of our place in it. It may seem surprising that there even is a debate, in light of all the evidence, but the problem is that in a game-theoretic sense, religion 'plays' first, during the early formative years of children and thus enjoys a distinctive first-mover advantage, because science, to which the child is exposed only in school, plays a late second; nor do the oft-dull and dreary textbook treatments of science help advance its cause. This is precisely where leading scientific intellectuals such as Dawkins have so much to offer, and which he does admirably here, as always.To the premise of the book then: we may not all have descendants, but we all have an unbroken line of ancestors - each of whom survived long enough to reach child-bearing age and pass on their genes - fighting off predators, battling disease and natural disasters in the process; which is a fascinating thought, made even more so to consider that all that adventure does not lie merely in the human part of our evolutionary history. The journey Dawkins undertakes in this book then, is to track our shared ancestry - not merely that of every human being, but that of every single living creature - all the way back to four billion years to build a family tree that extends over hundreds of millions of great-grandparents. And yet by no means is this a Handbuch of sorts on speciation, rather, it is a delightful elucidation on the workings of evolution, a 'Who do you think you are?' on a scale that has absolutely no parallel: This is the book of life.(1) Establishing themselves close to the median of the voter preferences on just one axis does not of itself translate into votes- for that the voter preference on each issue and the weight of importance attached to it by the voter needs to be aggregated. (2) This polarization manifests itself in unexpected ways; in a recent ABC interview of Dawkins by Andrew Denton, for instance. Mindful, perhaps, of the consequences of appearing empathetic to his subject's views and alienating the conservatives among his viewers, the otherwise immensely capable Denton was unable to set a consistent tone for the program by committing himself to either a friendly or hostile line of questioning, which made for some extremely uneasy viewing. "
113,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"A tour de force by a great teacherThe conceit here is to imagine that we can go backward in time to when our linage split off from some other branch, say to when the evolutionary line that has led to Homo sapiens split off from the line that has led to chimpanzees. That would be Dawkins's Rendezvous point #1 on page 100 which took place about six million years ago.Like the characters in Chaucer's ""Canterbury Tales,"" we are pilgrims traveling toward a spot, not in geography, but in time; and along the way we meet up with other pilgrims, eventually with all of life's creatures until we are gathered together in Rendezvous #39 where we meet our most distant relatives, the eubacteria. At each rendezvous point there is a ""concestor,"" the common ancestor of all the lines of creatures that are now joined. Thus Concestor 1 was the ""250,000-greats-grandparent"" of both humans and chimpanzees. What Dawkins does at each point is to imagine what the concestor might have been like. Thus Concestor 1 would be an ape probably more like a chimpanzee than a human, a hairy ape that probably didn't walk upright, etc.Prior to Rendezvous 1 there is Rendezvous 0 in which all of humankind meets together with the humans that went out of Africa 30,000(?) years ago.At each of the rendezvous points there are tales, as in Chaucer's work. There is ""The Tasmanian's Tale"" in which it is related how the Tasmanian people were slaughtered. There is ""Eve's Tale"" in which we learn about mitochondrial DNA which is passed exclusively from mother to daughter. And later there are tales from the duckbilled platypus, the lungfish, the grasshopper, the redwood tree, etc. In each of these tales Dawkins, in his inimitable manner, focuses on some aspect of evolutionary biology and illuminates it for the reader. Some of the tales are difficult, but most are easy to read and fascinating to follow.One of the strengths of this book is in the clear and engaging way that Dawkins presents the material and his forthright expression, and his honest way of separating what is his informed opinion from that of a scientific consensus. One thing I have always admired about Dawkins is his ability to be candid about what he knows and what he doesn't, and his courage in expressing unpopular opinions.The question is, should the general reader buy this book and invest the time and effort in following Dawkins's pilgrimage? For those familiar with the great evolutionary biologist's work, this question answers itself. A new book by Richard Dawkins is an event to be celebrated. For others who want to learn something about evolution from one of its foremost experts (and celebrities, by the way) this book is highly recommended. The sheer expanse of Mr. Dawkins's knowledge and his infectious enthusiasm will inform and delight the reader. I suspect that most readers will learn more about how evolution works from this single book than from almost any other that I have read, and that includes works by such illuminati as Stephen Jay Gould, Ernst Mayr, and Edward O. Wilson. Incidentally, I believe that The Ancestor's Tale is a better read for most people than Gould's monumental The Structure of Evolutionary Theory (2002) if only because it is more accessible and less technical--not to mention about 750 pages shorter!Some quibbles: I think Dawkins overrates sexual selection in bringing about evolutionary change in some cases, e.g., in bipedalism, and in the growth of the human brain (cf. Geoffrey Miller in The Mating Mind (2000)). It seems to me that natural selection had to be the driving force in something so felicitous as freeing our arms to carry and to work, and in the development of something so expensive and radical as a greatly oversized brain.I also think that his idea to identify the lake, for example, created by the beaver, as part of the extended phenotype of the beaver is going a bit too far. I prefer to think of the lake as part of the beaver's ""culture,"" and the behavior that created the lake as part of the phenotype of the beaver. Our airplanes and computers are part of our culture. Our ability to make them is part of our phenotype. (For Dawkins's full expression on this topic see The Extended Phenotype (1982).)Here are a couple of examples of Dawkins's entertaining and elegant style: Referring to the fall of the dinosaurs, he facetiously imagines that Shelley's celebrated poem, ""Ozymandias,"" which mocked the vainglorious works of kings, was entitled ""Ode to a Dinosaur."" Indeed, how the mighty have fallen. (p. 255) Talking about a sea squirt larva which gives up its mobile life to become sedentary (with attendant changes in neurological form), Dawkins remarks, ""...when the time comes, [it] settles down to a sedentary life and 'eats its brain, like an associate professor getting tenure.'"" (p. 370) One of the best parts of the book, not to be missed, is the concluding chapter, ""The Host's Return"" in which Dawkins talks about re-running evolution. He speculates on which adaptations might and might not be returned. Certainly flight, which has evolved independently some 40 to 50 times would be seen again. But would the ""swollen"" human brain and the development of syntactic language evolve again?Although Dawkins has addressed the so-called argument from design many times, I don't think he has ever demonstrated its paucity more eloquently and succinctly than he does beginning on page 549 where he calls it the ""Argument from Personal Incredulity."" His point is that to say something must have been designed because it is so complex really says ""less about nature than about the poverty...[of the speaker's] imagination."" On page 602 he adds, ""Ultimately design cannot explain anything because there is an inevitable regression to the problem of the origin of the designer.""And finally I have a question for Professor Dawkins: why are there no viruses among the pilgrims? --Dennis Littrell, author of “Understanding Evolution and Ourselves”"
114,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85772714-wil-c-fry,5,"Bottom line: I learned from this book, and that's the primary reason I read non-fiction. Additionally, I was fascinated, engaged, and in a few cases blown away. With apologies to Richard Dawkins (and Geoffrey Chaucer), I didn't much enjoy the format, but this is a minor complaint. It just felt forced and artificial the way Dawkins attempted to squeeze his story into the series of ""tales"" as an homage to The Canterbury Tales. Otherwise, the entire book was enjoyable.Beginning at the present, renowned scientist Dawkins takes the reader on a reverse journey through time, tracing humanity's evolutionary past through a series of ""rendezvous"" with other animal species (and larger groups). For the most part ignoring extinct species, the tale looks for branching-off points (speciation events); for example, the most recent about 6 million years ago when we last shared an ancestor with chimpanzees. Each rendezvous is accompanied by a helpful graphic showing how far back the story has gone, which animal groups are ""joining"" us on our ""pilgrimage"", and which geological eras/epochs are involved.The Selfish Gene remains my favorite Dawkins book, but this one is powerful in its own right."
115,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30987-justine,5,"I don't get to use the word masterpiece much, but The Ancestor's Tale really was a masterpiece and a love letter to life on earth, the study of it, and evolution. Dawkins mirrors the Canterbury Tales framework*, with us as a species going on a pilgrimage back in time to meet the common ancestors we share with each of the other species on earth, all the way back to the first life form that came out of some kind of primordial soup. Along the way, each pilgrim we meet tells a story that elucidates the process, theories, and methods of study behind evolution. It was a dense and aggressive read, but also one that brims with Dawkins' fascination and love for his subject. His ability to communicate his wonder for the world and the scientific process through which we understand it is full of self-reflection, candor, and optimism. I feel better about humanity knowing he is in it. I try to read one ambitious book a year, and this is it***Christ (haha) he is such a genius **Or a carry over from last year.... because I suck at reading hard things right now."

Wilson (to name a few) will revel in the way that Dawkins journeys from the tip of the branch (modern man) to the trunk of the tree at the beginning of all life on earth. Each waypoint in the journey is a junction at which another branch of life rejoins ours on the way to the trunk at life's earliest moment, and is an opportunity for Dawkins to explore nearly every aspect of the way science has categorized, discovered, studied and theorized upon the vast diversity of beings that do and have inhabited our planet. It's an amazing contrast to The Sixth Extinction that I finished just prior."

The book hit a point which must be on when one reads ""web""/""online"" articles about some scientific discovery... it underlines respect and awareness what a science means!I read about the author (and his colleague) that he is a modern pit-bull of Darwin ideas, and I can understand why. This is not meant in a pejorative way, rather as his way of approaching and interpreting (biological) evolution. His skills have amazed me, I learnt and understood a lot. He did not only describe processes but he also offered and presented methodologies how scientists look for/check (possible) answers, so it is an insight into their work - to remind the ones who might say: ""what they know/how they can know it!?"" - so now, I know. The mere size of a book (around 700 pages) tells you that this is not for ""fastfood"" thinkers, that it requires your attention and dedication to know, however its content is magnificent as well. How can I know it? I got to R. Dawkins through various sources and channels which prize him pretty much. Plus, I am aware that when he touches uncharted areas it is his challenge how to try to answer difficult questions - however not based on ""emotional"" and ""opinion"" ground but on facts and data (this comment is more for people who know a bit how science/scientists work)... So, if you want to challenge your imagination, if you want to learn and know something fabulous and fascinating about life, open this book and read it thoroughly! The book has been my extraordinary experience.The book is still in mind mind consuming my attention. It behaves as a Siren anchor bringing me back to its topic, it has showed me the life and lives. "
118,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56609924-flaviu-vescan,5,Sadly the audiobook can only be found in an abridged version which finished way too fast. Dawkins never disappoints! I loved the book and will read it again unabridged when I do a second read of all his books. Hearing him talk about RNA and natural selection arms races are quickly becoming my favorite go-to intellectual pass time while going about my daily routines. I'm recommending it to any biology enthusiast out there.
119,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41127452-steven-wetter,5,Reverse revolution.An interest way of observing the process of evolution. Richard Dawkins takes you down the road in reverse. Kind of the devolution of the life all the way back to the first signs of ancestral life to all living thing here in planet earth. A bit of an homage to the Canterbury tales throughout. I truly enjoyed this.
120,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39755297-fipah,4,"4 stars = I really liked itDividing the book into two digestible parts (that themselves count as books really) was what I've done and I can recommended it, yet the drawback is one does not remember very well the points he made in the first half of the book, however it was not at all disturbing - even though Dawkins makes connections, each chapter is standalone and he makes the effort to look at the key points one has learned throughout the book from various angles, which summarises the whole experience and makes the journey very well connected.This book is not only about the evolution of biodiversity, it is richly interwoven with variegated topics and scientific disciplines that underpin the interdisciplinarity of the study of the history of life such as epigenetics, the importance of logarithms in science, plate tectonics or a short chapter on what it is probably like to have a grandiose sense of smell and no eyesight. I hold Dawkins as very skillful at this - he always manages to use varied sources to unify his arguments and, moreover, this makes any text of his captivating and complete. Also, he does not shy away from making fluid ventures into social and political commentaries for example on racism, sexism or (expectedly) creationism. I mostly found these to be succinct and well connected.As a person who has read a few books about molecular biology, genetics and evolution, and studied an undergraduate degree in Ecology for one year, many ideas did not feel very fresh to me, hence the book only summarised what I have already learnt. Consequently, it felt like another TV documentary about animals for general public with the same commonplace topics and arguments - yet of course, the book was deeper indeed, this is just how it felt a bit to me. I found this to be especially true of the second half of the book, since the first dealt with humans, apes and chimpanzees, so its anthropological outlook was more novel to me. This by no means is a criticism of the book, it should only serve as a warning to prospective readers who have either studied a STEM degree (escpecially biology-related) or read many (pop) science books. This book is indeed about evolution and animals which is Dawkins' expertise, yet all the other science and theories he explains like the central dogma of molecular biology or the evolution of eucaryotic cells should already be pretty familar to such readers.Last warning: Especially in the second half of the book I found his ideas and writing to be lengthy - the length of the book no longer feflt justified. This is just a thing to keep in mind.Recommended to readers who are interested in the evolution of biodiversity and who have not read many other pop-science books about evolution, molecular biology, Earth history and archaelogy.

121,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk,3,"Non-Fiction. 4 billion years of evolution, practically in real time. To avoid any ""human-centrism,"" Dawkins -- famous for his outspoken stance against creationism -- does this backwards and models the journey on Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. Scared yet? Well, it's not in rhyme or Old English, but Dawkins does tend toward lofty language and wild, rambling digressions. It bugged me at first, but over the course of this SIX HUNDRED PAGE BOOK, I got used to it and even grew to appreciate Dawkins and his sly humor. He actually made me laugh out loud a couple times.The pilgrimage conceit holds up: we travel backwards in time to meet a series of common ancestors, starting with concestor 1 (for ""common ancestor""), where mankind splits from the chimpanzees, and ending with concestor 39, the first life on Earth. At each stop he describes what that ancestor may have looked like, where it lived, and how long ago.The Chaucer conceit never got off the ground. Most tales, like ""The Armadillo's Tale,"" don't tell you anything about the animal the tale's dedicated to. There are a few exceptions to this, though, like ""The Beaver's Tale"" or ""The Brine Shrimp's Tale."" Those actually address the qualities of the animal in question, and were some of my favorites because of it.One of the best things about this book is that Dawkins freely admits -- early and often -- that a lot of what he's talking about is based on limited data and/or guesswork and may be wrong. He goes out of his way to offer alternate theories and differing opinions, though he always singles out the position he finds most likely. I love it when scientists admit they don't know things, and Dawkins has no problem with that. He can sound arrogant and in love with his own voice (the number of times he quotes himself and his previous books!!!), but at heart I think he really loves the subject and wants to share it with people. It's a long, and sometimes difficult, book to read. It gets into genetics, math, biology, taxonomy, chemistry, pretty much everything, and at times the explanations get messy or too technical. I liked the biology parts best -- the different ways organisms evolve and why, and there was plenty of that to keep me interested. It's a lot of information, though still a very basic look at the diversity of life. I started out reading it like homework -- 10-20 pages a day -- but after I got the hang of it, I was reading 30 and 40 pages without breaking a sweat. Did I enjoy it? I think so? I definitely know a little bit about a LOT of things now, and it made me want to read more about evolution.Three stars for the book and the information it provides, and FIVE stars for me for making it through."
122,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10781757-otherwyrld,4,"I approached a book of this size and scope with some trepidation (seriously, you could kill someone if you hit them over the head with the hardback edition), how could this possibly cover the whole history of life on Earth. I also note that I have had issues in the past with the authors writing style, which can run to the overly verbose to my taste, as well as the huge hype over his anti religion stand that tends to get a lot more publicity than his actual books do.So, on the whole this monumental work succeeds admirably, notwithstanding my above mentioned misgivings. This book takes us on a journey from our most recent ancestors backwards to meet shared ancestors (or concestors as the author describes them) along the way, a la The Canterbury Tales, with the ultimate goal being the beginnings of life itself. Along the way the author tells numerous tales in the same way as Geoffrey Chaucer did to illustrate various points. In some ways these are both the best and the worst parts of the book, as this is where the authors writing style flourishes the most. The more straightforward descriptions of the species/genus (etc) that we encounter are easier to read though often quite dry and highly technical.There is a large prologue which looks at the history of hominids before it heads to the first rendezvous with Chimpanzees, then Gorillas, Orangutan and the rest of the primates in turn. This section alone takes up a third of the book, and mammals as a whole takes up half. This leaves little room for the rest of the species, with only insects taking up a large section in the rest of the book. Plants are particularly sidelined, which is a shame because it makes the book rather lopsided though I can understand racing through some sections because there really is very little to say about them. It did make the latter third of the book drag a little bit though and I slogged through to the end. The author wisely keeps his religious digs to a minimum, though he can't resist it the whole time. I can't really talk about the co-author as his voice doesn't really come through that much. The book has some nice colour plates to illustrate some of the species discussed, but the line illustrations leave a bit to be desired. mostly because they were shrunk too much to fit into the paperback edition. The overall idea of a fractal design for the various rendezvous' was a nice touch, and there is an extensive bibliography if you want to explore further. "
123,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,4,"Here's an ambitious bet: to tell the story of life on Earth as an odyssey, a pilgrimage backward in time. The approach is indeed original as, reading this book is like boarding a time machine where at each chapter we meet one of our ancestors -that Dawkins describes, showing in which ways its anatomy or way of life can serve a better understanding of why we are what we are. 40 ancestors are thus passing us by, from primates to mammals in general, vertebrates, invertebrates and, all the way until the unicellular organisms.Each encounter is also the occasion for a digression (a 'tale') on topics ranging from fossils conversation and datation, bipedalism, sex, the notion of 'race' or, again, the shaping of some organs. He even dares to defend (although not dogmatically) the 'primeval soup' hypothesis! (well...)A big book, those qualities are strangely enough also the bad points. The topic is indeed so vast that, some chapters are obviously more captivating than others, making it an hard and challenging read during the passages dealing with those ancestors that don't interest you that much. Yet, always a great populariser Dawkins delivers here one of the most thoughtful and complete story of life on Earth. Huge! "
124,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3744803-chris,5,"Richard Dawkins is the best writer on the topic of evolution that I have encountered. He is able to explain concepts in such a way as to make them easily understandable. All of the books that I have read by Dawkins have been very informative and entertaining as well. The Ancestor's Tale is a cleverly structured book in which Dawkins takes the reader on a journey chronologically back in time through our evolutionary history. Each successive chapter is the next branch of our evolutionary tree where Homo sapiens merges with our next most recent kin. The book cleverly mimics Chaucer's Canterbury Tales wherein each new member of the group tells a story. In The Ancestor's Tale, each of these ""tales"" is told by one of the species that we are joining with in the current branch. The story is always about some aspect of evolution that is pertinent in some way to the species telling the tale.  The Ancestor's Tale is the best book that I have read on evolution up to this point and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in this subject."

He is at his best when focussing on evolutionary biology as much as possible, and on religion the least amount possible. The Ancestor's Tale consists almost exclusively of evolution and biology related content, and Dawkins does an amazing job of taking his reader on an epic journey.While I was fascinated by the concept of a journey backwards through time, meeting fellow lifeforms on the major forks of evolution, the execution could have failed in numerous ways. Fortunately, Dawkins delivers a captivating story from the very first chapter, and unfailingly continues to amaze until the last page. Not only does the author explain important branch-offs on the evolutionary tree; he describes the modern day features of our distant cousins in a way that creates a new found appreciation for the almost magical power of natural selection. The Ancestor's Tale is incredibly original, brilliantly written and covers a huge amount of terrority while providing enough depth to continually amaze."

Dawkins guides us along on the greatest pilgrimage ever to the dawn of evolution in a style reminiscent of The Canterbury Tales. Through different tales told by organisms we rendezvous along the way, he manages to introduce a plethora of biological wonders, ethical considerations, scientific thinking and philosophy. A must, must read for everyone- especially those with a passion for nature and life sciences. "

Slightly cheapened by a few brief but unnecessary political comments. Jabs at religion are to be expected with a Dawkins book, but unless directly addressing creationist claims, also unnecessary. Particularly poignant passages regarding uncertainties of molecular dating issues. Historical perspective on how our understandings of various organisms & their phylogenies are the masterstroke - neither too in-depth nor superficial. "

139,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84660-swankivy,4,"This doorstopper of a book was a lot more fun than you might think, considering the subject matter. Richard Dawkins has a certain way of telling stories that makes them palatable even when, like me, you aren't exactly learned in the subject. I wouldn't say I'm ignorant about the topic at hand, and I have certainly known better since middle school than to perceive evolution as if it's ""humans evolved from modern apes,"" but I learned a heck of a lot of stuff here. In between all the little stories about creatures I'd often never heard of and occasional anecdotes about Dawkins's personal experiences and relationships with other scientists, there were tales of discovery, of archaeological and biological history, and of how nature works. Even though it did feel a tad long and drawn out for me, now at the end of the road I think I appreciated that it took its time, with a leisurely feel that made every encounter with another ""concestor"" feel important enough to give time to.I would like to share some specific individual thoughts and quotes on the book here.I liked Dawkins's discussion of evolution not being a concept of other beings on their way to becoming us. They weren't unfinished when they were alive, just like modern animals today aren't unfinished because they're not us and none of us are unfinished because one day our descendants will be different from us.I enjoyed the explanation of why we all have one ancestor, as impossible as that sounds, because of DNA's existence. If there were other types of creatures before DNA's ""birth"" that replicated a different way, they left no descendants because every creature alive today has DNA, and if there were later ones coming into existence, they'd immediately be eaten by bacteria.DNA is compared to telegrams and I liked that analogy very much. It's because they have to use the same letters that make up meaningful words to also indicate pauses, like STOP, and DNA has that situation too how its codes are run end to end, with some junk here and there. A cool factoid: If you find a population that's been isolated for X years, then you know the common ancestor WE have with them can't be younger than that. An alien looking at human and gibbon genitals would think the males are more related to each other than they are to the females of their own species. If we interpret based only on physical factors that look similar, we may be making the same mistake.There's some cool info about color vision and how some old-world monkeys are primarily color blind but some females have color vision. It was all explained really neatly.Richard Dawkins had a pet bushbaby as a kid and sometimes it would pee on him from above. Just throwing that out there.I like how he discusses the uncertainty of his branches, how recently evidence he's using was developed and how accepted it is, and the fact that new evidence may change where certain creatures join the ancestor pilgrimage.There was a good discussion of the meaning of ""primitive"" with regard to whether a species is primitive in one way and therefore primitive in another (""primitive"" means ""resembling the ancestor""). A good quote that sums it up: ""There is no substance called Essence of Antiquity that pervades the blood and soaks into the bones.""There's a really good metaphor about a bobbing cork as an explanation of overall trends in evolution. If you tracked it over time and saw that it was going toward the east, you know that looking back, but if you just analyzed its movements as it bobs up and down and gets tossed around in the ocean, you couldn't necessarily say where it will end up based on such small movements.Sometimes Dawkins would just throw out a comparison that would come out of nowhere and be funny. Case in point: ""Capable of swallowing a medium-sized lawyer whole.""There's a really well-explained section on how evolution is continuous and the categories between species are pretty artificial. No parent was a different species from their child, and a time machine taking people back a thousand years at a time should result in arriving at a population each could interbreed with. Overall of course, they're evolving, but there's no distinct time where you can say ""the parent was X; the child is Y."" Kind of like when you're warming up your bath water, there's not really a specific degree where you'd say the water is no longer warm but hot. A quote: ""More than once I have seen a reference to the larval sea squirt which, when the time comes, settles down to a sedentary life and 'eats its brain, like an associate professor getting tenure.'""Starfish, by the way, are really weird. Eeuuuwww.The Grasshopper's Tale discussed human ""races"" in association with how grasshoppers kinda have races based on what their song sounds like, and how they tend not to mate with different races, but will if you do something to make their song different. I was kinda irritated with how he digressed into some oversimplified or flat-out misleading representations of how race works. First off, he claimed people are asked to check one of 5 race boxes on forms, and offered ""Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, Native American, and Other"" as the choices. If I see boxes like these, they invariably include Asian and/or Pacific Islanders. Which is weird because he mentions Asians in the same topic. But then he goes on to say that mixed-race doesn't have its own name, offering ""Blue has a name. Green has a name. Blue-green does not."" Yes it does? Lots of blue-green mixtures have names, like turquoise. He goes on to say Affirmative Action isn't FAIR because it assumes an individual is being repaid for wrongs done to his ancestors. This seems a crass oversimplification and sadly pretty typical of privileged white dudes, especially since he probably should be well aware enough of social factors to realize that the legacy of slavery and other terrible events and trends affecting people of color are still resulting in those populations experiencing prejudice and poverty on a much higher level than whites do. Affirmative Action acknowledges that to get the same opportunities, disadvantaged populations have to come a longer distance from farther away (overall, as a population; obviously there are individual white people who are more disadvantaged on some axes than individual people of color, but this deals with an overall phenomenon, not with exceptions to the trend). Affirmative Action was not invented specifically as a reparations measure. It acknowledges CURRENT disadvantages that come from living in poverty and almost definitely having decisions about your life being made by racists who don't know they're racist but make racist decisions. Those racist decisions may sound less like ""his dark skin is ugly to me, so I'm not giving him a job"" but more like ""he speaks like a typical black person, which to my white ears has become synonymous with uneducated and rough; therefore I perceive him as not being as professional, or perhaps assume my customers will conclude that and therefore I will hire a person who speaks like me."" We'll pretend it's not about race but about readiness and deservingness of the job, but if someone's natural hair or accent or style of dress automatically makes us think less of them or makes us expect them to separate themselves from norms of their community to be acceptable to ours, those are racist perspectives. Those are the kinds of things Affirmative Action is attempting to counteract. Though for the record that program helps more white women than anyone, and we women contend with prejudices surrounding our competence, our ability to do certain types of work, and our likelihood of abandoning the career to make or care for babies. Anyway.Richard Dawkins demonstrated he does not know what Affirmative Action is for. Next.A quote: ""The third school of thought is, in my opinion, bonkers. Or, to use more parliamentary language, wildly and irresponsibly unrealistic."" Haha.He made a Philip Pullman reference and that made me happy. I was thinking about mufela from The Amber Spyglass when Dawkins started discussing microscopic creatures that evolved the only known natural wheel, and then he mentioned it too.I thought it was pretty awesome that toward the end of the book Dawkins went into detail about how evolution itself can evolve--that creatures who are better at evolving may have a better chance of survival, so therefore evolution's processes themselves can be improved through evolution.A final quote to close out my review: ""This pilgrimage has been a trip, not just in the literal sense, but in the countercultural sense I met when a young man in California in the 1960s. The most potent hallucinogen on sale in Haight or Ashbury or telegraph Avenue would be tame by comparison. If it's amazement you want, the real world has it all."""
140,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4568480-giuseppe-d,5,"Not even sure where to start on this one, it was a very exciting backwards journey from our species to the very origin of life, which probably looked nothing like what we call alive nowadays but rather just a self replicating organic molecule, nothing more than that.But this book is just as much about evolution as it is about other fields in biology such as zoology, comparative anatomy, genetics, phylogenetics, embryology, neuroscience.For instance, how are new genes introduced into a genome? Well, it turns out that 'new genes aren't added to the genome out of thin air. They originate as duplicates of older genes. Then, over evolutionary time, they go to their separate ways by mutation, selection and drift.'Or other interesting facts, like that the closest living relatives of hippos are whales!Or how we sometimes forget that our way of perceiving the world is not the only one. Playtpuses, for example, 'have about 40000 electrical sensors distributed [...] over both surfaces of the bill.' They use these electrical sensors to perceive the weak electric fields generated by their prey (while the prey use its muscles to move around).We also discover how many times gliding and flight have separately evolved as examples of convergent evolution. And how places like Australia and New Zeland, due to their historic isolation, provide cases for explaining how the evolution of species there is quite analogous to what happened in other parts of the world with each one occupying their own niche.I want to end this review with a citation that sums up why you should read this book: 'not only is life on this planet amazing, and deeply satisfying to all whose senes have not become dulled by familiarity: the very fact that we have evolved the brain power to understand our evolutionary genesis redoubles this amazement and compounds the satisfaction.'

141,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4551268-sara-g,5,"This beautiful book was really captivating. I like Dawkins a lot, but I know he comes off as really abrasive to many people. In this book, though, rather than constantly being on the attack, he's describing the beauties and wonders of the natural world. I like his softer side.It's written in the form of a pilgrimage (like the Canterbury Tales), back to our most distant ancestors. It's human-centric for no reason other than relatability. Dawkins takes pains to mention that a similar pilgrimage could be focused on any living species today. He pauses at key moments in our evolutionary history to discuss our relationship with what he calls ""concestors"" - shared ancestors with other species on Earth. It's fascinating stuff, but very dense in places. My favorite part was the discussion about how life may have arisen on Earth and the ""RNA World"" origin theory, which I was previously unfamiliar with. This is why I read good popular science. The science I learned in school is painfully outdated. I've added quite a few books to my TBR based on Dawkins's recommendations and references here. This book isn't for everyone, but for someone with a decent scientific background, I think you could gain a lot.End note - I keep going back to the description of a Douglas Adams Doctor Who script mentioned in this book, where a time traveler keeps going back in time to weep for the dodos before they became extinct.

An enterprising ice-cream vendor comes along with his cart and sets up shop - where should he position himself if he desires to maximize his sales?Clearly, anywhere; for as long as he has a monopoly, people will walk from all over the beach to buy his product. For purposes of illustration, we imagine him settling somewhere near the extreme right of the beach. Now, should a second vendor selling ice-cream come onto the scene, and discover that people will buy ice-cream from the vendor closest to them, where must she position herself? Obviously she should set shop adjacent to the first vendor, but slightly to his left; she can then maximize her sales by cornering the bulk of the market. The loss of sales then forces the first vendor to move his cart to the left of vendor two and the jostling continues; it is straightforward to see that in a few iterations, both vendors end up next to each other close to the center of the beach in their bid to maximize their sales. The fictitious beach, of course represents a political issue, the bathers are the voters and the vendors the political parties; the goal is to maximize votes instead of sales (1). The first case represents a dictatorship, the second the two-party democracy; in the latter, over time, both parties grow to resemble each other as they take up near-identical stances on most issues, often differing only in semantics. Unless, that is, the two parties vary in their assessment of how voter preferences are distributed on an issue - if one party believes they are clumped more to the left, while the other believes the majority leans to the right, sharp divisions can occur, as is the case here in Australia where our (effectively) two-party system in federal politics is now polarized over a proposed carbon ETS.Exit political economy, enter evolutionary biology; for this is where the analogy ends. Whereas ice-cream vendors and political parties are prepared to move to maximize sales and votes on the basis of their assumptions about the distribution of bodies and voters, creationists and evolutionists are camped firmly on either end of the belief scale; both sides preach only to their respective choirs, and it is not clear why. The distribution of people with regards to their belief varies, but it is safe to say that most are either mildly agnostic or mild believers; and yet, it is the strong views that color the debate and polarize opinions - for the creationists the evolutionists shall join Darwin in hell and pay for their lack of faith, and for the evolutionists, creationism is good for a laugh, or two, but for little else. Dawkins appears to be at the forefront of the rather acrimonious debate and draws more than his fair share of the creationists' ire (2). Which is a shame, really, for just as Chomsky's political writings have the unfortunate consequence of discounting - or at least distracting from - his brilliant work as a linguist, so too do Dawkins' views on God and religion prevent many from acknowledging his stellar contribution to our understanding of nature, and of our place in it. It may seem surprising that there even is a debate, in light of all the evidence, but the problem is that in a game-theoretic sense, religion 'plays' first, during the early formative years of children and thus enjoys a distinctive first-mover advantage, because science, to which the child is exposed only in school, plays a late second; nor do the oft-dull and dreary textbook treatments of science help advance its cause. This is precisely where leading scientific intellectuals such as Dawkins have so much to offer, and which he does admirably here, as always.To the premise of the book then: we may not all have descendants, but we all have an unbroken line of ancestors - each of whom survived long enough to reach child-bearing age and pass on their genes - fighting off predators, battling disease and natural disasters in the process; which is a fascinating thought, made even more so to consider that all that adventure does not lie merely in the human part of our evolutionary history. The journey Dawkins undertakes in this book then, is to track our shared ancestry - not merely that of every human being, but that of every single living creature - all the way back to four billion years to build a family tree that extends over hundreds of millions of great-grandparents. And yet by no means is this a Handbuch of sorts on speciation, rather, it is a delightful elucidation on the workings of evolution, a 'Who do you think you are?' on a scale that has absolutely no parallel: This is the book of life.(1) Establishing themselves close to the median of the voter preferences on just one axis does not of itself translate into votes- for that the voter preference on each issue and the weight of importance attached to it by the voter needs to be aggregated. (2) This polarization manifests itself in unexpected ways; in a recent ABC interview of Dawkins by Andrew Denton, for instance. Mindful, perhaps, of the consequences of appearing empathetic to his subject's views and alienating the conservatives among his viewers, the otherwise immensely capable Denton was unable to set a consistent tone for the program by committing himself to either a friendly or hostile line of questioning, which made for some extremely uneasy viewing.

That would be Dawkins's Rendezvous point #1 on page 100 which took place about six million years ago.Like the characters in Chaucer's ""Canterbury Tales,"" we are pilgrims traveling toward a spot, not in geography, but in time; and along the way we meet up with other pilgrims, eventually with all of life's creatures until we are gathered together in Rendezvous #39 where we meet our most distant relatives, the eubacteria. At each rendezvous point there is a ""concestor,"" the common ancestor of all the lines of creatures that are now joined. Thus Concestor 1 was the ""250,000-greats-grandparent"" of both humans and chimpanzees. What Dawkins does at each point is to imagine what the concestor might have been like. Thus Concestor 1 would be an ape probably more like a chimpanzee than a human, a hairy ape that probably didn't walk upright, etc.Prior to Rendezvous 1 there is Rendezvous 0 in which all of humankind meets together with the humans that went out of Africa 30,000(?) years ago.At each of the rendezvous points there are tales, as in Chaucer's work. There is ""The Tasmanian's Tale"" in which it is related how the Tasmanian people were slaughtered. There is ""Eve's Tale"" in which we learn about mitochondrial DNA which is passed exclusively from mother to daughter. And later there are tales from the duckbilled platypus, the lungfish, the grasshopper, the redwood tree, etc. In each of these tales Dawkins, in his inimitable manner, focuses on some aspect of evolutionary biology and illuminates it for the reader. Some of the tales are difficult, but most are easy to read and fascinating to follow.One of the strengths of this book is in the clear and engaging way that Dawkins presents the material and his forthright expression, and his honest way of separating what is his informed opinion from that of a scientific consensus. One thing I have always admired about Dawkins is his ability to be candid about what he knows and what he doesn't, and his courage in expressing unpopular opinions.The question is, should the general reader buy this book and invest the time and effort in following Dawkins's pilgrimage? For those familiar with the great evolutionary biologist's work, this question answers itself. A new book by Richard Dawkins is an event to be celebrated. For others who want to learn something about evolution from one of its foremost experts (and celebrities, by the way) this book is highly recommended. The sheer expanse of Mr. Dawkins's knowledge and his infectious enthusiasm will inform and delight the reader. I suspect that most readers will learn more about how evolution works from this single book than from almost any other that I have read, and that includes works by such illuminati as Stephen Jay Gould, Ernst Mayr, and Edward O. Wilson. Incidentally, I believe that The Ancestor's Tale is a better read for most people than Gould's monumental The Structure of Evolutionary Theory (2002) if only because it is more accessible and less technical--not to mention about 750 pages shorter!Some quibbles: I think Dawkins overrates sexual selection in bringing about evolutionary change in some cases, e.g., in bipedalism, and in the growth of the human brain (cf. Geoffrey Miller in The Mating Mind (2000)). It seems to me that natural selection had to be the driving force in something so felicitous as freeing our arms to carry and to work, and in the development of something so expensive and radical as a greatly oversized brain.I also think that his idea to identify the lake, for example, created by the beaver, as part of the extended phenotype of the beaver is going a bit too far. I prefer to think of the lake as part of the beaver's ""culture,"" and the behavior that created the lake as part of the phenotype of the beaver. Our airplanes and computers are part of our culture. Our ability to make them is part of our phenotype. (For Dawkins's full expression on this topic see The Extended Phenotype (1982).)Here are a couple of examples of Dawkins's entertaining and elegant style: Referring to the fall of the dinosaurs, he facetiously imagines that Shelley's celebrated poem, ""Ozymandias,"" which mocked the vainglorious works of kings, was entitled ""Ode to a Dinosaur."" Indeed, how the mighty have fallen. (p. 255) Talking about a sea squirt larva which gives up its mobile life to become sedentary (with attendant changes in neurological form), Dawkins remarks, ""...when the time comes, [it] settles down to a sedentary life and 'eats its brain, like an associate professor getting tenure.'"" (p. 370) One of the best parts of the book, not to be missed, is the concluding chapter, ""The Host's Return"" in which Dawkins talks about re-running evolution. He speculates on which adaptations might and might not be returned. Certainly flight, which has evolved independently some 40 to 50 times would be seen again. But would the ""swollen"" human brain and the development of syntactic language evolve again?Although Dawkins has addressed the so-called argument from design many times, I don't think he has ever demonstrated its paucity more eloquently and succinctly than he does beginning on page 549 where he calls it the ""Argument from Personal Incredulity."" His point is that to say something must have been designed because it is so complex really says ""less about nature than about the poverty...[of the speaker's] imagination."" On page 602 he adds, ""Ultimately design cannot explain anything because there is an inevitable regression to the problem of the origin of the designer.""And finally I have a question for Professor Dawkins: why are there no viruses among the pilgrims? --Dennis Littrell, author of “Understanding Evolution and Ourselves”"
144,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85772714-wil-c-fry,5,"Bottom line: I learned from this book, and that's the primary reason I read non-fiction. Additionally, I was fascinated, engaged, and in a few cases blown away. With apologies to Richard Dawkins (and Geoffrey Chaucer), I didn't much enjoy the format, but this is a minor complaint. It just felt forced and artificial the way Dawkins attempted to squeeze his story into the series of ""tales"" as an homage to The Canterbury Tales. Otherwise, the entire book was enjoyable.Beginning at the present, renowned scientist Dawkins takes the reader on a reverse journey through time, tracing humanity's evolutionary past through a series of ""rendezvous"" with other animal species (and larger groups). For the most part ignoring extinct species, the tale looks for branching-off points (speciation events); for example, the most recent about 6 million years ago when we last shared an ancestor with chimpanzees. Each rendezvous is accompanied by a helpful graphic showing how far back the story has gone, which animal groups are ""joining"" us on our ""pilgrimage"", and which geological eras/epochs are involved.The Selfish Gene remains my favorite Dawkins book, but this one is powerful in its own right."
145,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30987-justine,5,"I don't get to use the word masterpiece much, but The Ancestor's Tale really was a masterpiece and a love letter to life on earth, the study of it, and evolution. Dawkins mirrors the Canterbury Tales framework*, with us as a species going on a pilgrimage back in time to meet the common ancestors we share with each of the other species on earth, all the way back to the first life form that came out of some kind of primordial soup. Along the way, each pilgrim we meet tells a story that elucidates the process, theories, and methods of study behind evolution. It was a dense and aggressive read, but also one that brims with Dawkins' fascination and love for his subject. His ability to communicate his wonder for the world and the scientific process through which we understand it is full of self-reflection, candor, and optimism. I feel better about humanity knowing he is in it. I try to read one ambitious book a year, and this is it***Christ (haha) he is such a genius **Or a carry over from last year.... because I suck at reading hard things right now."
146,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3749108-ohenrypacey,5,"The sheer amount of information packed into this book would have to be daunting to a reader not initiated into the language of biology, but any fan of Darwin, Stephen Jay Gould or E.O. Wilson (to name a few) will revel in the way that Dawkins journeys from the tip of the branch (modern man) to the trunk of the tree at the beginning of all life on earth. Each waypoint in the journey is a junction at which another branch of life rejoins ours on the way to the trunk at life's earliest moment, and is an opportunity for Dawkins to explore nearly every aspect of the way science has categorized, discovered, studied and theorized upon the vast diversity of beings that do and have inhabited our planet. It's an amazing contrast to The Sixth Extinction that I finished just prior."
147,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54757979-krocht-ehlundovi,5,"This is one of the books which add you another perspective of life (in its pure scientific form), the one which is like a wall against bullshit of conspiracies, vampires, mystery medicament and spiritual blindness. While I was reading the book my mouth was open with surprise and fascination. The book hit a point which must be on when one reads ""web""/""online"" articles about some scientific discovery... it underlines respect and awareness what a science means!I read about the author (and his colleague) that he is a modern pit-bull of Darwin ideas, and I can understand why. This is not meant in a pejorative way, rather as his way of approaching and interpreting (biological) evolution. His skills have amazed me, I learnt and understood a lot. He did not only describe processes but he also offered and presented methodologies how scientists look for/check (possible) answers, so it is an insight into their work - to remind the ones who might say: ""what they know/how they can know it!?"" - so now, I know. The mere size of a book (around 700 pages) tells you that this is not for ""fastfood"" thinkers, that it requires your attention and dedication to know, however its content is magnificent as well. How can I know it? I got to R. Dawkins through various sources and channels which prize him pretty much. Plus, I am aware that when he touches uncharted areas it is his challenge how to try to answer difficult questions - however not based on ""emotional"" and ""opinion"" ground but on facts and data (this comment is more for people who know a bit how science/scientists work)... So, if you want to challenge your imagination, if you want to learn and know something fabulous and fascinating about life, open this book and read it thoroughly! The book has been my extraordinary experience.The book is still in mind mind consuming my attention. It behaves as a Siren anchor bringing me back to its topic, it has showed me the life and lives. "
148,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56609924-flaviu-vescan,5,Sadly the audiobook can only be found in an abridged version which finished way too fast. Dawkins never disappoints! I loved the book and will read it again unabridged when I do a second read of all his books.

I'm recommending it to any biology enthusiast out there.

Kind of the devolution of the life all the way back to the first signs of ancestral life to all living thing here in planet earth. A bit of an homage to the Canterbury tales throughout. I truly enjoyed this.
150,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39755297-fipah,4,"4 stars = I really liked itDividing the book into two digestible parts (that themselves count as books really) was what I've done and I can recommended it, yet the drawback is one does not remember very well the points he made in the first half of the book, however it was not at all disturbing - even though Dawkins makes connections, each chapter is standalone and he makes the effort to look at the key points one has learned throughout the book from various angles, which summarises the whole experience and makes the journey very well connected.This book is not only about the evolution of biodiversity, it is richly interwoven with variegated topics and scientific disciplines that underpin the interdisciplinarity of the study of the history of life such as epigenetics, the importance of logarithms in science, plate tectonics or a short chapter on what it is probably like to have a grandiose sense of smell and no eyesight. I hold Dawkins as very skillful at this - he always manages to use varied sources to unify his arguments and, moreover, this makes any text of his captivating and complete. Also, he does not shy away from making fluid ventures into social and political commentaries for example on racism, sexism or (expectedly) creationism. I mostly found these to be succinct and well connected.As a person who has read a few books about molecular biology, genetics and evolution, and studied an undergraduate degree in Ecology for one year, many ideas did not feel very fresh to me, hence the book only summarised what I have already learnt. Consequently, it felt like another TV documentary about animals for general public with the same commonplace topics and arguments - yet of course, the book was deeper indeed, this is just how it felt a bit to me. I found this to be especially true of the second half of the book, since the first dealt with humans, apes and chimpanzees, so its anthropological outlook was more novel to me. This by no means is a criticism of the book, it should only serve as a warning to prospective readers who have either studied a STEM degree (escpecially biology-related) or read many (pop) science books. This book is indeed about evolution and animals which is Dawkins' expertise, yet all the other science and theories he explains like the central dogma of molecular biology or the evolution of eucaryotic cells should already be pretty familar to such readers.Last warning: Especially in the second half of the book I found his ideas and writing to be lengthy - the length of the book no longer feflt justified. This is just a thing to keep in mind.Recommended to readers who are interested in the evolution of biodiversity and who have not read many other pop-science books about evolution, molecular biology, Earth history and archaelogy.

151,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk,3,"Non-Fiction. 4 billion years of evolution, practically in real time. To avoid any ""human-centrism,"" Dawkins -- famous for his outspoken stance against creationism -- does this backwards and models the journey on Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. Scared yet? Well, it's not in rhyme or Old English, but Dawkins does tend toward lofty language and wild, rambling digressions. It bugged me at first, but over the course of this SIX HUNDRED PAGE BOOK, I got used to it and even grew to appreciate Dawkins and his sly humor. He actually made me laugh out loud a couple times.The pilgrimage conceit holds up: we travel backwards in time to meet a series of common ancestors, starting with concestor 1 (for ""common ancestor""), where mankind splits from the chimpanzees, and ending with concestor 39, the first life on Earth. At each stop he describes what that ancestor may have looked like, where it lived, and how long ago.The Chaucer conceit never got off the ground. Most tales, like ""The Armadillo's Tale,"" don't tell you anything about the animal the tale's dedicated to. There are a few exceptions to this, though, like ""The Beaver's Tale"" or ""The Brine Shrimp's Tale."" Those actually address the qualities of the animal in question, and were some of my favorites because of it.One of the best things about this book is that Dawkins freely admits -- early and often -- that a lot of what he's talking about is based on limited data and/or guesswork and may be wrong. He goes out of his way to offer alternate theories and differing opinions, though he always singles out the position he finds most likely. I love it when scientists admit they don't know things, and Dawkins has no problem with that. He can sound arrogant and in love with his own voice (the number of times he quotes himself and his previous books!!!), but at heart I think he really loves the subject and wants to share it with people. It's a long, and sometimes difficult, book to read. It gets into genetics, math, biology, taxonomy, chemistry, pretty much everything, and at times the explanations get messy or too technical. I liked the biology parts best -- the different ways organisms evolve and why, and there was plenty of that to keep me interested. It's a lot of information, though still a very basic look at the diversity of life. I started out reading it like homework -- 10-20 pages a day -- but after I got the hang of it, I was reading 30 and 40 pages without breaking a sweat. Did I enjoy it? I think so? I definitely know a little bit about a LOT of things now, and it made me want to read more about evolution.Three stars for the book and the information it provides, and FIVE stars for me for making it through."
152,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10781757-otherwyrld,4,"I approached a book of this size and scope with some trepidation (seriously, you could kill someone if you hit them over the head with the hardback edition), how could this possibly cover the whole history of life on Earth. I also note that I have had issues in the past with the authors writing style, which can run to the overly verbose to my taste, as well as the huge hype over his anti religion stand that tends to get a lot more publicity than his actual books do.So, on the whole this monumental work succeeds admirably, notwithstanding my above mentioned misgivings. This book takes us on a journey from our most recent ancestors backwards to meet shared ancestors (or concestors as the author describes them) along the way, a la The Canterbury Tales, with the ultimate goal being the beginnings of life itself. Along the way the author tells numerous tales in the same way as Geoffrey Chaucer did to illustrate various points. In some ways these are both the best and the worst parts of the book, as this is where the authors writing style flourishes the most. The more straightforward descriptions of the species/genus (etc) that we encounter are easier to read though often quite dry and highly technical.There is a large prologue which looks at the history of hominids before it heads to the first rendezvous with Chimpanzees, then Gorillas, Orangutan and the rest of the primates in turn. This section alone takes up a third of the book, and mammals as a whole takes up half. This leaves little room for the rest of the species, with only insects taking up a large section in the rest of the book. Plants are particularly sidelined, which is a shame because it makes the book rather lopsided though I can understand racing through some sections because there really is very little to say about them. It did make the latter third of the book drag a little bit though and I slogged through to the end. The author wisely keeps his religious digs to a minimum, though he can't resist it the whole time. I can't really talk about the co-author as his voice doesn't really come through that much. The book has some nice colour plates to illustrate some of the species discussed, but the line illustrations leave a bit to be desired. mostly because they were shrunk too much to fit into the paperback edition. The overall idea of a fractal design for the various rendezvous' was a nice touch, and there is an extensive bibliography if you want to explore further. "

The approach is indeed original as, reading this book is like boarding a time machine where at each chapter we meet one of our ancestors -that Dawkins describes, showing in which ways its anatomy or way of life can serve a better understanding of why we are what we are. 40 ancestors are thus passing us by, from primates to mammals in general, vertebrates, invertebrates and, all the way until the unicellular organisms.Each encounter is also the occasion for a digression (a 'tale') on topics ranging from fossils conversation and datation, bipedalism, sex, the notion of 'race' or, again, the shaping of some organs. He even dares to defend (although not dogmatically) the 'primeval soup' hypothesis! (well...)A big book, those qualities are strangely enough also the bad points. The topic is indeed so vast that, some chapters are obviously more captivating than others, making it an hard and challenging read during the passages dealing with those ancestors that don't interest you that much. Yet, always a great populariser Dawkins delivers here one of the most thoughtful and complete story of life on Earth. Huge! "

He is able to explain concepts in such a way as to make them easily understandable. All of the books that I have read by Dawkins have been very informative and entertaining as well. The Ancestor's Tale is a cleverly structured book in which Dawkins takes the reader on a journey chronologically back in time through our evolutionary history. Each successive chapter is the next branch of our evolutionary tree where Homo sapiens merges with our next most recent kin. The book cleverly mimics Chaucer's Canterbury Tales wherein each new member of the group tells a story. In The Ancestor's Tale, each of these ""tales"" is told by one of the species that we are joining with in the current branch. The story is always about some aspect of evolution that is pertinent in some way to the species telling the tale.  The Ancestor's Tale is the best book that I have read on evolution up to this point and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in this subject."

He is at his best when focussing on evolutionary biology as much as possible, and on religion the least amount possible. The Ancestor's Tale consists almost exclusively of evolution and biology related content, and Dawkins does an amazing job of taking his reader on an epic journey.While I was fascinated by the concept of a journey backwards through time, meeting fellow lifeforms on the major forks of evolution, the execution could have failed in numerous ways. Fortunately, Dawkins delivers a captivating story from the very first chapter, and unfailingly continues to amaze until the last page. Not only does the author explain important branch-offs on the evolutionary tree; he describes the modern day features of our distant cousins in a way that creates a new found appreciation for the almost magical power of natural selection. The Ancestor's Tale is incredibly original, brilliantly written and covers a huge amount of terrority while providing enough depth to continually amaze."

166,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14247078-maitrey,5,"A great guide to modern evolutionary thinking. Dawkins uses a reverse journey through time to better explain genes, clades, and natural selection. If you've not read Dawkins before and don't know where to start, this is a good book to begin with."

169,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84660-swankivy,4,"This doorstopper of a book was a lot more fun than you might think, considering the subject matter. Richard Dawkins has a certain way of telling stories that makes them palatable even when, like me, you aren't exactly learned in the subject. I wouldn't say I'm ignorant about the topic at hand, and I have certainly known better since middle school than to perceive evolution as if it's ""humans evolved from modern apes,"" but I learned a heck of a lot of stuff here. In between all the little stories about creatures I'd often never heard of and occasional anecdotes about Dawkins's personal experiences and relationships with other scientists, there were tales of discovery, of archaeological and biological history, and of how nature works. Even though it did feel a tad long and drawn out for me, now at the end of the road I think I appreciated that it took its time, with a leisurely feel that made every encounter with another ""concestor"" feel important enough to give time to.I would like to share some specific individual thoughts and quotes on the book here.I liked Dawkins's discussion of evolution not being a concept of other beings on their way to becoming us. They weren't unfinished when they were alive, just like modern animals today aren't unfinished because they're not us and none of us are unfinished because one day our descendants will be different from us.I enjoyed the explanation of why we all have one ancestor, as impossible as that sounds, because of DNA's existence. If there were other types of creatures before DNA's ""birth"" that replicated a different way, they left no descendants because every creature alive today has DNA, and if there were later ones coming into existence, they'd immediately be eaten by bacteria.DNA is compared to telegrams and I liked that analogy very much. It's because they have to use the same letters that make up meaningful words to also indicate pauses, like STOP, and DNA has that situation too how its codes are run end to end, with some junk here and there. A cool factoid: If you find a population that's been isolated for X years, then you know the common ancestor WE have with them can't be younger than that. An alien looking at human and gibbon genitals would think the males are more related to each other than they are to the females of their own species. If we interpret based only on physical factors that look similar, we may be making the same mistake.There's some cool info about color vision and how some old-world monkeys are primarily color blind but some females have color vision. It was all explained really neatly.Richard Dawkins had a pet bushbaby as a kid and sometimes it would pee on him from above. Just throwing that out there.I like how he discusses the uncertainty of his branches, how recently evidence he's using was developed and how accepted it is, and the fact that new evidence may change where certain creatures join the ancestor pilgrimage.There was a good discussion of the meaning of ""primitive"" with regard to whether a species is primitive in one way and therefore primitive in another (""primitive"" means ""resembling the ancestor""). A good quote that sums it up: ""There is no substance called Essence of Antiquity that pervades the blood and soaks into the bones.""There's a really good metaphor about a bobbing cork as an explanation of overall trends in evolution. If you tracked it over time and saw that it was going toward the east, you know that looking back, but if you just analyzed its movements as it bobs up and down and gets tossed around in the ocean, you couldn't necessarily say where it will end up based on such small movements.Sometimes Dawkins would just throw out a comparison that would come out of nowhere and be funny. Case in point: ""Capable of swallowing a medium-sized lawyer whole.""There's a really well-explained section on how evolution is continuous and the categories between species are pretty artificial. No parent was a different species from their child, and a time machine taking people back a thousand years at a time should result in arriving at a population each could interbreed with. Overall of course, they're evolving, but there's no distinct time where you can say ""the parent was X; the child is Y."" Kind of like when you're warming up your bath water, there's not really a specific degree where you'd say the water is no longer warm but hot. A quote: ""More than once I have seen a reference to the larval sea squirt which, when the time comes, settles down to a sedentary life and 'eats its brain, like an associate professor getting tenure.'""Starfish, by the way, are really weird. Eeuuuwww.The Grasshopper's Tale discussed human ""races"" in association with how grasshoppers kinda have races based on what their song sounds like, and how they tend not to mate with different races, but will if you do something to make their song different. I was kinda irritated with how he digressed into some oversimplified or flat-out misleading representations of how race works. First off, he claimed people are asked to check one of 5 race boxes on forms, and offered ""Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, Native American, and Other"" as the choices. If I see boxes like these, they invariably include Asian and/or Pacific Islanders. Which is weird because he mentions Asians in the same topic. But then he goes on to say that mixed-race doesn't have its own name, offering ""Blue has a name. Green has a name. Blue-green does not."" Yes it does? Lots of blue-green mixtures have names, like turquoise. He goes on to say Affirmative Action isn't FAIR because it assumes an individual is being repaid for wrongs done to his ancestors. This seems a crass oversimplification and sadly pretty typical of privileged white dudes, especially since he probably should be well aware enough of social factors to realize that the legacy of slavery and other terrible events and trends affecting people of color are still resulting in those populations experiencing prejudice and poverty on a much higher level than whites do. Affirmative Action acknowledges that to get the same opportunities, disadvantaged populations have to come a longer distance from farther away (overall, as a population; obviously there are individual white people who are more disadvantaged on some axes than individual people of color, but this deals with an overall phenomenon, not with exceptions to the trend). Affirmative Action was not invented specifically as a reparations measure. It acknowledges CURRENT disadvantages that come from living in poverty and almost definitely having decisions about your life being made by racists who don't know they're racist but make racist decisions. Those racist decisions may sound less like ""his dark skin is ugly to me, so I'm not giving him a job"" but more like ""he speaks like a typical black person, which to my white ears has become synonymous with uneducated and rough; therefore I perceive him as not being as professional, or perhaps assume my customers will conclude that and therefore I will hire a person who speaks like me."" We'll pretend it's not about race but about readiness and deservingness of the job, but if someone's natural hair or accent or style of dress automatically makes us think less of them or makes us expect them to separate themselves from norms of their community to be acceptable to ours, those are racist perspectives. Those are the kinds of things Affirmative Action is attempting to counteract. Though for the record that program helps more white women than anyone, and we women contend with prejudices surrounding our competence, our ability to do certain types of work, and our likelihood of abandoning the career to make or care for babies. Anyway.Richard Dawkins demonstrated he does not know what Affirmative Action is for. Next.A quote: ""The third school of thought is, in my opinion, bonkers. Or, to use more parliamentary language, wildly and irresponsibly unrealistic."" Haha.He made a Philip Pullman reference and that made me happy. I was thinking about mufela from The Amber Spyglass when Dawkins started discussing microscopic creatures that evolved the only known natural wheel, and then he mentioned it too.I thought it was pretty awesome that toward the end of the book Dawkins went into detail about how evolution itself can evolve--that creatures who are better at evolving may have a better chance of survival, so therefore evolution's processes themselves can be improved through evolution.A final quote to close out my review: ""This pilgrimage has been a trip, not just in the literal sense, but in the countercultural sense I met when a young man in California in the 1960s. The most potent hallucinogen on sale in Haight or Ashbury or telegraph Avenue would be tame by comparison. If it's amazement you want, the real world has it all."""
170,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4568480-giuseppe-d,5,"Not even sure where to start on this one, it was a very exciting backwards journey from our species to the very origin of life, which probably looked nothing like what we call alive nowadays but rather just a self replicating organic molecule, nothing more than that.But this book is just as much about evolution as it is about other fields in biology such as zoology, comparative anatomy, genetics, phylogenetics, embryology, neuroscience.For instance, how are new genes introduced into a genome? Well, it turns out that 'new genes aren't added to the genome out of thin air. They originate as duplicates of older genes. Then, over evolutionary time, they go to their separate ways by mutation, selection and drift.'Or other interesting facts, like that the closest living relatives of hippos are whales!Or how we sometimes forget that our way of perceiving the world is not the only one. Playtpuses, for example, 'have about 40000 electrical sensors distributed [...] over both surfaces of the bill.' They use these electrical sensors to perceive the weak electric fields generated by their prey (while the prey use its muscles to move around).We also discover how many times gliding and flight have separately evolved as examples of convergent evolution. And how places like Australia and New Zeland, due to their historic isolation, provide cases for explaining how the evolution of species there is quite analogous to what happened in other parts of the world with each one occupying their own niche.I want to end this review with a citation that sums up why you should read this book: 'not only is life on this planet amazing, and deeply satisfying to all whose senes have not become dulled by familiarity: the very fact that we have evolved the brain power to understand our evolutionary genesis redoubles this amazement and compounds the satisfaction.' "
171,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4551268-sara-g,5,"This beautiful book was really captivating. I like Dawkins a lot, but I know he comes off as really abrasive to many people. In this book, though, rather than constantly being on the attack, he's describing the beauties and wonders of the natural world. I like his softer side.It's written in the form of a pilgrimage (like the Canterbury Tales), back to our most distant ancestors. It's human-centric for no reason other than relatability. Dawkins takes pains to mention that a similar pilgrimage could be focused on any living species today. He pauses at key moments in our evolutionary history to discuss our relationship with what he calls ""concestors"" - shared ancestors with other species on Earth. It's fascinating stuff, but very dense in places. My favorite part was the discussion about how life may have arisen on Earth and the ""RNA World"" origin theory, which I was previously unfamiliar with. This is why I read good popular science. The science I learned in school is painfully outdated. I've added quite a few books to my TBR based on Dawkins's recommendations and references here. This book isn't for everyone, but for someone with a decent scientific background, I think you could gain a lot.End note - I keep going back to the description of a Douglas Adams Doctor Who script mentioned in this book, where a time traveler keeps going back in time to weep for the dodos before they became extinct. I love this imagery."
172,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/362402-snehal-bhagat,5,"Political economy basics are often explained with the help of an analogy: we imagine a beach in summer with people sun-bathing; for the sake of simplicity, we assume that the beach is one-dimensional- a straight line running from left to right- and that the people are distributed approximately equidistant from each other. An enterprising ice-cream vendor comes along with his cart and sets up shop - where should he position himself if he desires to maximize his sales?Clearly, anywhere; for as long as he has a monopoly, people will walk from all over the beach to buy his product. For purposes of illustration, we imagine him settling somewhere near the extreme right of the beach. Now, should a second vendor selling ice-cream come onto the scene, and discover that people will buy ice-cream from the vendor closest to them, where must she position herself? Obviously she should set shop adjacent to the first vendor, but slightly to his left; she can then maximize her sales by cornering the bulk of the market. The loss of sales then forces the first vendor to move his cart to the left of vendor two and the jostling continues; it is straightforward to see that in a few iterations, both vendors end up next to each other close to the center of the beach in their bid to maximize their sales. The fictitious beach, of course represents a political issue, the bathers are the voters and the vendors the political parties; the goal is to maximize votes instead of sales (1). The first case represents a dictatorship, the second the two-party democracy; in the latter, over time, both parties grow to resemble each other as they take up near-identical stances on most issues, often differing only in semantics. Unless, that is, the two parties vary in their assessment of how voter preferences are distributed on an issue - if one party believes they are clumped more to the left, while the other believes the majority leans to the right, sharp divisions can occur, as is the case here in Australia where our (effectively) two-party system in federal politics is now polarized over a proposed carbon ETS.Exit political economy, enter evolutionary biology; for this is where the analogy ends. Whereas ice-cream vendors and political parties are prepared to move to maximize sales and votes on the basis of their assumptions about the distribution of bodies and voters, creationists and evolutionists are camped firmly on either end of the belief scale; both sides preach only to their respective choirs, and it is not clear why. The distribution of people with regards to their belief varies, but it is safe to say that most are either mildly agnostic or mild believers; and yet, it is the strong views that color the debate and polarize opinions - for the creationists the evolutionists shall join Darwin in hell and pay for their lack of faith, and for the evolutionists, creationism is good for a laugh, or two, but for little else. Dawkins appears to be at the forefront of the rather acrimonious debate and draws more than his fair share of the creationists' ire (2). Which is a shame, really, for just as Chomsky's political writings have the unfortunate consequence of discounting - or at least distracting from - his brilliant work as a linguist, so too do Dawkins' views on God and religion prevent many from acknowledging his stellar contribution to our understanding of nature, and of our place in it. It may seem surprising that there even is a debate, in light of all the evidence, but the problem is that in a game-theoretic sense, religion 'plays' first, during the early formative years of children and thus enjoys a distinctive first-mover advantage, because science, to which the child is exposed only in school, plays a late second; nor do the oft-dull and dreary textbook treatments of science help advance its cause. This is precisely where leading scientific intellectuals such as Dawkins have so much to offer, and which he does admirably here, as always.To the premise of the book then: we may not all have descendants, but we all have an unbroken line of ancestors - each of whom survived long enough to reach child-bearing age and pass on their genes - fighting off predators, battling disease and natural disasters in the process; which is a fascinating thought, made even more so to consider that all that adventure does not lie merely in the human part of our evolutionary history. The journey Dawkins undertakes in this book then, is to track our shared ancestry - not merely that of every human being, but that of every single living creature - all the way back to four billion years to build a family tree that extends over hundreds of millions of great-grandparents. And yet by no means is this a Handbuch of sorts on speciation, rather, it is a delightful elucidation on the workings of evolution, a 'Who do you think you are?' on a scale that has absolutely no parallel: This is the book of life.(1) Establishing themselves close to the median of the voter preferences on just one axis does not of itself translate into votes- for that the voter preference on each issue and the weight of importance attached to it by the voter needs to be aggregated. (2) This polarization manifests itself in unexpected ways; in a recent ABC interview of Dawkins by Andrew Denton, for instance. Mindful, perhaps, of the consequences of appearing empathetic to his subject's views and alienating the conservatives among his viewers, the otherwise immensely capable Denton was unable to set a consistent tone for the program by committing himself to either a friendly or hostile line of questioning, which made for some extremely uneasy viewing. "
173,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"A tour de force by a great teacherThe conceit here is to imagine that we can go backward in time to when our linage split off from some other branch, say to when the evolutionary line that has led to Homo sapiens split off from the line that has led to chimpanzees. That would be Dawkins's Rendezvous point #1 on page 100 which took place about six million years ago.Like the characters in Chaucer's ""Canterbury Tales,"" we are pilgrims traveling toward a spot, not in geography, but in time; and along the way we meet up with other pilgrims, eventually with all of life's creatures until we are gathered together in Rendezvous #39 where we meet our most distant relatives, the eubacteria. At each rendezvous point there is a ""concestor,"" the common ancestor of all the lines of creatures that are now joined. Thus Concestor 1 was the ""250,000-greats-grandparent"" of both humans and chimpanzees. What Dawkins does at each point is to imagine what the concestor might have been like. Thus Concestor 1 would be an ape probably more like a chimpanzee than a human, a hairy ape that probably didn't walk upright, etc.Prior to Rendezvous 1 there is Rendezvous 0 in which all of humankind meets together with the humans that went out of Africa 30,000(?) years ago.At each of the rendezvous points there are tales, as in Chaucer's work. There is ""The Tasmanian's Tale"" in which it is related how the Tasmanian people were slaughtered. There is ""Eve's Tale"" in which we learn about mitochondrial DNA which is passed exclusively from mother to daughter. And later there are tales from the duckbilled platypus, the lungfish, the grasshopper, the redwood tree, etc. In each of these tales Dawkins, in his inimitable manner, focuses on some aspect of evolutionary biology and illuminates it for the reader. Some of the tales are difficult, but most are easy to read and fascinating to follow.One of the strengths of this book is in the clear and engaging way that Dawkins presents the material and his forthright expression, and his honest way of separating what is his informed opinion from that of a scientific consensus. One thing I have always admired about Dawkins is his ability to be candid about what he knows and what he doesn't, and his courage in expressing unpopular opinions.The question is, should the general reader buy this book and invest the time and effort in following Dawkins's pilgrimage? For those familiar with the great evolutionary biologist's work, this question answers itself. A new book by Richard Dawkins is an event to be celebrated. For others who want to learn something about evolution from one of its foremost experts (and celebrities, by the way) this book is highly recommended. The sheer expanse of Mr. Dawkins's knowledge and his infectious enthusiasm will inform and delight the reader. I suspect that most readers will learn more about how evolution works from this single book than from almost any other that I have read, and that includes works by such illuminati as Stephen Jay Gould, Ernst Mayr, and Edward O. Wilson. Incidentally, I believe that The Ancestor's Tale is a better read for most people than Gould's monumental The Structure of Evolutionary Theory (2002) if only because it is more accessible and less technical--not to mention about 750 pages shorter!Some quibbles: I think Dawkins overrates sexual selection in bringing about evolutionary change in some cases, e.g., in bipedalism, and in the growth of the human brain (cf. Geoffrey Miller in The Mating Mind (2000)). It seems to me that natural selection had to be the driving force in something so felicitous as freeing our arms to carry and to work, and in the development of something so expensive and radical as a greatly oversized brain.I also think that his idea to identify the lake, for example, created by the beaver, as part of the extended phenotype of the beaver is going a bit too far. I prefer to think of the lake as part of the beaver's ""culture,"" and the behavior that created the lake as part of the phenotype of the beaver. Our airplanes and computers are part of our culture. Our ability to make them is part of our phenotype. (For Dawkins's full expression on this topic see The Extended Phenotype (1982).)Here are a couple of examples of Dawkins's entertaining and elegant style: Referring to the fall of the dinosaurs, he facetiously imagines that Shelley's celebrated poem, ""Ozymandias,"" which mocked the vainglorious works of kings, was entitled ""Ode to a Dinosaur."" Indeed, how the mighty have fallen. (p. 255) Talking about a sea squirt larva which gives up its mobile life to become sedentary (with attendant changes in neurological form), Dawkins remarks, ""...when the time comes, [it] settles down to a sedentary life and 'eats its brain, like an associate professor getting tenure.'"" (p. 370) One of the best parts of the book, not to be missed, is the concluding chapter, ""The Host's Return"" in which Dawkins talks about re-running evolution. He speculates on which adaptations might and might not be returned. Certainly flight, which has evolved independently some 40 to 50 times would be seen again. But would the ""swollen"" human brain and the development of syntactic language evolve again?Although Dawkins has addressed the so-called argument from design many times, I don't think he has ever demonstrated its paucity more eloquently and succinctly than he does beginning on page 549 where he calls it the ""Argument from Personal Incredulity."" His point is that to say something must have been designed because it is so complex really says ""less about nature than about the poverty...[of the speaker's] imagination."" On page 602 he adds, ""Ultimately design cannot explain anything because there is an inevitable regression to the problem of the origin of the designer.""And finally I have a question for Professor Dawkins: why are there no viruses among the pilgrims? --Dennis Littrell, author of “Understanding Evolution and Ourselves”"
174,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85772714-wil-c-fry,5,"Bottom line: I learned from this book, and that's the primary reason I read non-fiction. Additionally, I was fascinated, engaged, and in a few cases blown away. With apologies to Richard Dawkins (and Geoffrey Chaucer), I didn't much enjoy the format, but this is a minor complaint. It just felt forced and artificial the way Dawkins attempted to squeeze his story into the series of ""tales"" as an homage to The Canterbury Tales. Otherwise, the entire book was enjoyable.Beginning at the present, renowned scientist Dawkins takes the reader on a reverse journey through time, tracing humanity's evolutionary past through a series of ""rendezvous"" with other animal species (and larger groups). For the most part ignoring extinct species, the tale looks for branching-off points (speciation events); for example, the most recent about 6 million years ago when we last shared an ancestor with chimpanzees. Each rendezvous is accompanied by a helpful graphic showing how far back the story has gone, which animal groups are ""joining"" us on our ""pilgrimage"", and which geological eras/epochs are involved.The Selfish Gene remains my favorite Dawkins book, but this one is powerful in its own right."
175,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30987-justine,5,"I don't get to use the word masterpiece much, but The Ancestor's Tale really was a masterpiece and a love letter to life on earth, the study of it, and evolution. Dawkins mirrors the Canterbury Tales framework*, with us as a species going on a pilgrimage back in time to meet the common ancestors we share with each of the other species on earth, all the way back to the first life form that came out of some kind of primordial soup. Along the way, each pilgrim we meet tells a story that elucidates the process, theories, and methods of study behind evolution. It was a dense and aggressive read, but also one that brims with Dawkins' fascination and love for his subject. His ability to communicate his wonder for the world and the scientific process through which we understand it is full of self-reflection, candor, and optimism. I feel better about humanity knowing he is in it. I try to read one ambitious book a year, and this is it***Christ (haha) he is such a genius **Or a carry over from last year.... because I suck at reading hard things right now."

Wilson (to name a few) will revel in the way that Dawkins journeys from the tip of the branch (modern man) to the trunk of the tree at the beginning of all life on earth. Each waypoint in the journey is a junction at which another branch of life rejoins ours on the way to the trunk at life's earliest moment, and is an opportunity for Dawkins to explore nearly every aspect of the way science has categorized, discovered, studied and theorized upon the vast diversity of beings that do and have inhabited our planet. It's an amazing contrast to The Sixth Extinction that I finished just prior."
177,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54757979-krocht-ehlundovi,5,"This is one of the books which add you another perspective of life (in its pure scientific form), the one which is like a wall against bullshit of conspiracies, vampires, mystery medicament and spiritual blindness. While I was reading the book my mouth was open with surprise and fascination. The book hit a point which must be on when one reads ""web""/""online"" articles about some scientific discovery... it underlines respect and awareness what a science means!I read about the author (and his colleague) that he is a modern pit-bull of Darwin ideas, and I can understand why. This is not meant in a pejorative way, rather as his way of approaching and interpreting (biological) evolution. His skills have amazed me, I learnt and understood a lot. He did not only describe processes but he also offered and presented methodologies how scientists look for/check (possible) answers, so it is an insight into their work - to remind the ones who might say: ""what they know/how they can know it!?"" - so now, I know. The mere size of a book (around 700 pages) tells you that this is not for ""fastfood"" thinkers, that it requires your attention and dedication to know, however its content is magnificent as well. How can I know it? I got to R. Dawkins through various sources and channels which prize him pretty much. Plus, I am aware that when he touches uncharted areas it is his challenge how to try to answer difficult questions - however not based on ""emotional"" and ""opinion"" ground but on facts and data (this comment is more for people who know a bit how science/scientists work)... So, if you want to challenge your imagination, if you want to learn and know something fabulous and fascinating about life, open this book and read it thoroughly! The book has been my extraordinary experience.The book is still in mind mind consuming my attention. It behaves as a Siren anchor bringing me back to its topic, it has showed me the life and lives. "

I loved the book and will read it again unabridged when I do a second read of all his books. Hearing him talk about RNA and natural selection arms races are quickly becoming my favorite go-to intellectual pass time while going about my daily routines. I'm recommending it to any biology enthusiast out there.

Kind of the devolution of the life all the way back to the first signs of ancestral life to all living thing here in planet earth. A bit of an homage to the Canterbury tales throughout. I truly enjoyed this.
180,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39755297-fipah,4,"4 stars = I really liked itDividing the book into two digestible parts (that themselves count as books really) was what I've done and I can recommended it, yet the drawback is one does not remember very well the points he made in the first half of the book, however it was not at all disturbing - even though Dawkins makes connections, each chapter is standalone and he makes the effort to look at the key points one has learned throughout the book from various angles, which summarises the whole experience and makes the journey very well connected.This book is not only about the evolution of biodiversity, it is richly interwoven with variegated topics and scientific disciplines that underpin the interdisciplinarity of the study of the history of life such as epigenetics, the importance of logarithms in science, plate tectonics or a short chapter on what it is probably like to have a grandiose sense of smell and no eyesight. I hold Dawkins as very skillful at this - he always manages to use varied sources to unify his arguments and, moreover, this makes any text of his captivating and complete. Also, he does not shy away from making fluid ventures into social and political commentaries for example on racism, sexism or (expectedly) creationism. I mostly found these to be succinct and well connected.As a person who has read a few books about molecular biology, genetics and evolution, and studied an undergraduate degree in Ecology for one year, many ideas did not feel very fresh to me, hence the book only summarised what I have already learnt. Consequently, it felt like another TV documentary about animals for general public with the same commonplace topics and arguments - yet of course, the book was deeper indeed, this is just how it felt a bit to me. I found this to be especially true of the second half of the book, since the first dealt with humans, apes and chimpanzees, so its anthropological outlook was more novel to me. This by no means is a criticism of the book, it should only serve as a warning to prospective readers who have either studied a STEM degree (escpecially biology-related) or read many (pop) science books. This book is indeed about evolution and animals which is Dawkins' expertise, yet all the other science and theories he explains like the central dogma of molecular biology or the evolution of eucaryotic cells should already be pretty familar to such readers.Last warning: Especially in the second half of the book I found his ideas and writing to be lengthy - the length of the book no longer feflt justified. This is just a thing to keep in mind.Recommended to readers who are interested in the evolution of biodiversity and who have not read many other pop-science books about evolution, molecular biology, Earth history and archaelogy.

181,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk,3,"Non-Fiction. 4 billion years of evolution, practically in real time. To avoid any ""human-centrism,"" Dawkins -- famous for his outspoken stance against creationism -- does this backwards and models the journey on Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. Scared yet? Well, it's not in rhyme or Old English, but Dawkins does tend toward lofty language and wild, rambling digressions. It bugged me at first, but over the course of this SIX HUNDRED PAGE BOOK, I got used to it and even grew to appreciate Dawkins and his sly humor. He actually made me laugh out loud a couple times.The pilgrimage conceit holds up: we travel backwards in time to meet a series of common ancestors, starting with concestor 1 (for ""common ancestor""), where mankind splits from the chimpanzees, and ending with concestor 39, the first life on Earth. At each stop he describes what that ancestor may have looked like, where it lived, and how long ago.The Chaucer conceit never got off the ground. Most tales, like ""The Armadillo's Tale,"" don't tell you anything about the animal the tale's dedicated to. There are a few exceptions to this, though, like ""The Beaver's Tale"" or ""The Brine Shrimp's Tale."" Those actually address the qualities of the animal in question, and were some of my favorites because of it.One of the best things about this book is that Dawkins freely admits -- early and often -- that a lot of what he's talking about is based on limited data and/or guesswork and may be wrong. He goes out of his way to offer alternate theories and differing opinions, though he always singles out the position he finds most likely. I love it when scientists admit they don't know things, and Dawkins has no problem with that. He can sound arrogant and in love with his own voice (the number of times he quotes himself and his previous books!!!), but at heart I think he really loves the subject and wants to share it with people. It's a long, and sometimes difficult, book to read. It gets into genetics, math, biology, taxonomy, chemistry, pretty much everything, and at times the explanations get messy or too technical. I liked the biology parts best -- the different ways organisms evolve and why, and there was plenty of that to keep me interested. It's a lot of information, though still a very basic look at the diversity of life. I started out reading it like homework -- 10-20 pages a day -- but after I got the hang of it, I was reading 30 and 40 pages without breaking a sweat. Did I enjoy it? I think so? I definitely know a little bit about a LOT of things now, and it made me want to read more about evolution.Three stars for the book and the information it provides, and FIVE stars for me for making it through."
182,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10781757-otherwyrld,4,"I approached a book of this size and scope with some trepidation (seriously, you could kill someone if you hit them over the head with the hardback edition), how could this possibly cover the whole history of life on Earth. I also note that I have had issues in the past with the authors writing style, which can run to the overly verbose to my taste, as well as the huge hype over his anti religion stand that tends to get a lot more publicity than his actual books do.So, on the whole this monumental work succeeds admirably, notwithstanding my above mentioned misgivings. This book takes us on a journey from our most recent ancestors backwards to meet shared ancestors (or concestors as the author describes them) along the way, a la The Canterbury Tales, with the ultimate goal being the beginnings of life itself. Along the way the author tells numerous tales in the same way as Geoffrey Chaucer did to illustrate various points. In some ways these are both the best and the worst parts of the book, as this is where the authors writing style flourishes the most. The more straightforward descriptions of the species/genus (etc) that we encounter are easier to read though often quite dry and highly technical.There is a large prologue which looks at the history of hominids before it heads to the first rendezvous with Chimpanzees, then Gorillas, Orangutan and the rest of the primates in turn. This section alone takes up a third of the book, and mammals as a whole takes up half. This leaves little room for the rest of the species, with only insects taking up a large section in the rest of the book. Plants are particularly sidelined, which is a shame because it makes the book rather lopsided though I can understand racing through some sections because there really is very little to say about them. It did make the latter third of the book drag a little bit though and I slogged through to the end. The author wisely keeps his religious digs to a minimum, though he can't resist it the whole time. I can't really talk about the co-author as his voice doesn't really come through that much. The book has some nice colour plates to illustrate some of the species discussed, but the line illustrations leave a bit to be desired. mostly because they were shrunk too much to fit into the paperback edition. The overall idea of a fractal design for the various rendezvous' was a nice touch, and there is an extensive bibliography if you want to explore further. "
183,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,4,"Here's an ambitious bet: to tell the story of life on Earth as an odyssey, a pilgrimage backward in time. The approach is indeed original as, reading this book is like boarding a time machine where at each chapter we meet one of our ancestors -that Dawkins describes, showing in which ways its anatomy or way of life can serve a better understanding of why we are what we are. 40 ancestors are thus passing us by, from primates to mammals in general, vertebrates, invertebrates and, all the way until the unicellular organisms.Each encounter is also the occasion for a digression (a 'tale') on topics ranging from fossils conversation and datation, bipedalism, sex, the notion of 'race' or, again, the shaping of some organs. He even dares to defend (although not dogmatically) the 'primeval soup' hypothesis! (well...)A big book, those qualities are strangely enough also the bad points. The topic is indeed so vast that, some chapters are obviously more captivating than others, making it an hard and challenging read during the passages dealing with those ancestors that don't interest you that much. Yet, always a great populariser Dawkins delivers here one of the most thoughtful and complete story of life on Earth. Huge! "
184,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3744803-chris,5,"Richard Dawkins is the best writer on the topic of evolution that I have encountered. He is able to explain concepts in such a way as to make them easily understandable. All of the books that I have read by Dawkins have been very informative and entertaining as well. The Ancestor's Tale is a cleverly structured book in which Dawkins takes the reader on a journey chronologically back in time through our evolutionary history. Each successive chapter is the next branch of our evolutionary tree where Homo sapiens merges with our next most recent kin. The book cleverly mimics Chaucer's Canterbury Tales wherein each new member of the group tells a story. In The Ancestor's Tale, each of these ""tales"" is told by one of the species that we are joining with in the current branch. The story is always about some aspect of evolution that is pertinent in some way to the species telling the tale.  The Ancestor's Tale is the best book that I have read on evolution up to this point and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in this subject."

He is at his best when focussing on evolutionary biology as much as possible, and on religion the least amount possible. The Ancestor's Tale consists almost exclusively of evolution and biology related content, and Dawkins does an amazing job of taking his reader on an epic journey.While I was fascinated by the concept of a journey backwards through time, meeting fellow lifeforms on the major forks of evolution, the execution could have failed in numerous ways. Fortunately, Dawkins delivers a captivating story from the very first chapter, and unfailingly continues to amaze until the last page. Not only does the author explain important branch-offs on the evolutionary tree; he describes the modern day features of our distant cousins in a way that creates a new found appreciation for the almost magical power of natural selection. The Ancestor's Tale is incredibly original, brilliantly written and covers a huge amount of terrority while providing enough depth to continually amaze."

Dawkins guides us along on the greatest pilgrimage ever to the dawn of evolution in a style reminiscent of The Canterbury Tales.

A must, must read for everyone- especially those with a passion for nature and life sciences. "

199,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84660-swankivy,4,"This doorstopper of a book was a lot more fun than you might think, considering the subject matter. Richard Dawkins has a certain way of telling stories that makes them palatable even when, like me, you aren't exactly learned in the subject. I wouldn't say I'm ignorant about the topic at hand, and I have certainly known better since middle school than to perceive evolution as if it's ""humans evolved from modern apes,"" but I learned a heck of a lot of stuff here. In between all the little stories about creatures I'd often never heard of and occasional anecdotes about Dawkins's personal experiences and relationships with other scientists, there were tales of discovery, of archaeological and biological history, and of how nature works. Even though it did feel a tad long and drawn out for me, now at the end of the road I think I appreciated that it took its time, with a leisurely feel that made every encounter with another ""concestor"" feel important enough to give time to.I would like to share some specific individual thoughts and quotes on the book here.I liked Dawkins's discussion of evolution not being a concept of other beings on their way to becoming us. They weren't unfinished when they were alive, just like modern animals today aren't unfinished because they're not us and none of us are unfinished because one day our descendants will be different from us.I enjoyed the explanation of why we all have one ancestor, as impossible as that sounds, because of DNA's existence. If there were other types of creatures before DNA's ""birth"" that replicated a different way, they left no descendants because every creature alive today has DNA, and if there were later ones coming into existence, they'd immediately be eaten by bacteria.DNA is compared to telegrams and I liked that analogy very much. It's because they have to use the same letters that make up meaningful words to also indicate pauses, like STOP, and DNA has that situation too how its codes are run end to end, with some junk here and there. A cool factoid: If you find a population that's been isolated for X years, then you know the common ancestor WE have with them can't be younger than that. An alien looking at human and gibbon genitals would think the males are more related to each other than they are to the females of their own species. If we interpret based only on physical factors that look similar, we may be making the same mistake.There's some cool info about color vision and how some old-world monkeys are primarily color blind but some females have color vision. It was all explained really neatly.Richard Dawkins had a pet bushbaby as a kid and sometimes it would pee on him from above. Just throwing that out there.I like how he discusses the uncertainty of his branches, how recently evidence he's using was developed and how accepted it is, and the fact that new evidence may change where certain creatures join the ancestor pilgrimage.There was a good discussion of the meaning of ""primitive"" with regard to whether a species is primitive in one way and therefore primitive in another (""primitive"" means ""resembling the ancestor""). A good quote that sums it up: ""There is no substance called Essence of Antiquity that pervades the blood and soaks into the bones.""There's a really good metaphor about a bobbing cork as an explanation of overall trends in evolution. If you tracked it over time and saw that it was going toward the east, you know that looking back, but if you just analyzed its movements as it bobs up and down and gets tossed around in the ocean, you couldn't necessarily say where it will end up based on such small movements.Sometimes Dawkins would just throw out a comparison that would come out of nowhere and be funny. Case in point: ""Capable of swallowing a medium-sized lawyer whole.""There's a really well-explained section on how evolution is continuous and the categories between species are pretty artificial. No parent was a different species from their child, and a time machine taking people back a thousand years at a time should result in arriving at a population each could interbreed with. Overall of course, they're evolving, but there's no distinct time where you can say ""the parent was X; the child is Y."" Kind of like when you're warming up your bath water, there's not really a specific degree where you'd say the water is no longer warm but hot. A quote: ""More than once I have seen a reference to the larval sea squirt which, when the time comes, settles down to a sedentary life and 'eats its brain, like an associate professor getting tenure.'""Starfish, by the way, are really weird. Eeuuuwww.The Grasshopper's Tale discussed human ""races"" in association with how grasshoppers kinda have races based on what their song sounds like, and how they tend not to mate with different races, but will if you do something to make their song different. I was kinda irritated with how he digressed into some oversimplified or flat-out misleading representations of how race works. First off, he claimed people are asked to check one of 5 race boxes on forms, and offered ""Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, Native American, and Other"" as the choices. If I see boxes like these, they invariably include Asian and/or Pacific Islanders. Which is weird because he mentions Asians in the same topic. But then he goes on to say that mixed-race doesn't have its own name, offering ""Blue has a name. Green has a name. Blue-green does not."" Yes it does? Lots of blue-green mixtures have names, like turquoise. He goes on to say Affirmative Action isn't FAIR because it assumes an individual is being repaid for wrongs done to his ancestors. This seems a crass oversimplification and sadly pretty typical of privileged white dudes, especially since he probably should be well aware enough of social factors to realize that the legacy of slavery and other terrible events and trends affecting people of color are still resulting in those populations experiencing prejudice and poverty on a much higher level than whites do. Affirmative Action acknowledges that to get the same opportunities, disadvantaged populations have to come a longer distance from farther away (overall, as a population; obviously there are individual white people who are more disadvantaged on some axes than individual people of color, but this deals with an overall phenomenon, not with exceptions to the trend). Affirmative Action was not invented specifically as a reparations measure. It acknowledges CURRENT disadvantages that come from living in poverty and almost definitely having decisions about your life being made by racists who don't know they're racist but make racist decisions. Those racist decisions may sound less like ""his dark skin is ugly to me, so I'm not giving him a job"" but more like ""he speaks like a typical black person, which to my white ears has become synonymous with uneducated and rough; therefore I perceive him as not being as professional, or perhaps assume my customers will conclude that and therefore I will hire a person who speaks like me."" We'll pretend it's not about race but about readiness and deservingness of the job, but if someone's natural hair or accent or style of dress automatically makes us think less of them or makes us expect them to separate themselves from norms of their community to be acceptable to ours, those are racist perspectives. Those are the kinds of things Affirmative Action is attempting to counteract. Though for the record that program helps more white women than anyone, and we women contend with prejudices surrounding our competence, our ability to do certain types of work, and our likelihood of abandoning the career to make or care for babies. Anyway.Richard Dawkins demonstrated he does not know what Affirmative Action is for. Next.A quote: ""The third school of thought is, in my opinion, bonkers. Or, to use more parliamentary language, wildly and irresponsibly unrealistic."" Haha.He made a Philip Pullman reference and that made me happy. I was thinking about mufela from The Amber Spyglass when Dawkins started discussing microscopic creatures that evolved the only known natural wheel, and then he mentioned it too.I thought it was pretty awesome that toward the end of the book Dawkins went into detail about how evolution itself can evolve--that creatures who are better at evolving may have a better chance of survival, so therefore evolution's processes themselves can be improved through evolution.A final quote to close out my review: ""This pilgrimage has been a trip, not just in the literal sense, but in the countercultural sense I met when a young man in California in the 1960s. The most potent hallucinogen on sale in Haight or Ashbury or telegraph Avenue would be tame by comparison. If it's amazement you want, the real world has it all."""
200,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4568480-giuseppe-d,5,"Not even sure where to start on this one, it was a very exciting backwards journey from our species to the very origin of life, which probably looked nothing like what we call alive nowadays but rather just a self replicating organic molecule, nothing more than that.But this book is just as much about evolution as it is about other fields in biology such as zoology, comparative anatomy, genetics, phylogenetics, embryology, neuroscience.For instance, how are new genes introduced into a genome? Well, it turns out that 'new genes aren't added to the genome out of thin air. They originate as duplicates of older genes. Then, over evolutionary time, they go to their separate ways by mutation, selection and drift.'Or other interesting facts, like that the closest living relatives of hippos are whales!Or how we sometimes forget that our way of perceiving the world is not the only one. Playtpuses, for example, 'have about 40000 electrical sensors distributed [...] over both surfaces of the bill.' They use these electrical sensors to perceive the weak electric fields generated by their prey (while the prey use its muscles to move around).We also discover how many times gliding and flight have separately evolved as examples of convergent evolution. And how places like Australia and New Zeland, due to their historic isolation, provide cases for explaining how the evolution of species there is quite analogous to what happened in other parts of the world with each one occupying their own niche.I want to end this review with a citation that sums up why you should read this book: 'not only is life on this planet amazing, and deeply satisfying to all whose senes have not become dulled by familiarity: the very fact that we have evolved the brain power to understand our evolutionary genesis redoubles this amazement and compounds the satisfaction.' "
201,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4551268-sara-g,5,"This beautiful book was really captivating. I like Dawkins a lot, but I know he comes off as really abrasive to many people. In this book, though, rather than constantly being on the attack, he's describing the beauties and wonders of the natural world. I like his softer side.It's written in the form of a pilgrimage (like the Canterbury Tales), back to our most distant ancestors. It's human-centric for no reason other than relatability. Dawkins takes pains to mention that a similar pilgrimage could be focused on any living species today. He pauses at key moments in our evolutionary history to discuss our relationship with what he calls ""concestors"" - shared ancestors with other species on Earth. It's fascinating stuff, but very dense in places. My favorite part was the discussion about how life may have arisen on Earth and the ""RNA World"" origin theory, which I was previously unfamiliar with. This is why I read good popular science. The science I learned in school is painfully outdated. I've added quite a few books to my TBR based on Dawkins's recommendations and references here. This book isn't for everyone, but for someone with a decent scientific background, I think you could gain a lot.End note - I keep going back to the description of a Douglas Adams Doctor Who script mentioned in this book, where a time traveler keeps going back in time to weep for the dodos before they became extinct. I love this imagery."
202,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/362402-snehal-bhagat,5,"Political economy basics are often explained with the help of an analogy: we imagine a beach in summer with people sun-bathing; for the sake of simplicity, we assume that the beach is one-dimensional- a straight line running from left to right- and that the people are distributed approximately equidistant from each other. An enterprising ice-cream vendor comes along with his cart and sets up shop - where should he position himself if he desires to maximize his sales?Clearly, anywhere; for as long as he has a monopoly, people will walk from all over the beach to buy his product. For purposes of illustration, we imagine him settling somewhere near the extreme right of the beach. Now, should a second vendor selling ice-cream come onto the scene, and discover that people will buy ice-cream from the vendor closest to them, where must she position herself? Obviously she should set shop adjacent to the first vendor, but slightly to his left; she can then maximize her sales by cornering the bulk of the market. The loss of sales then forces the first vendor to move his cart to the left of vendor two and the jostling continues; it is straightforward to see that in a few iterations, both vendors end up next to each other close to the center of the beach in their bid to maximize their sales. The fictitious beach, of course represents a political issue, the bathers are the voters and the vendors the political parties; the goal is to maximize votes instead of sales (1). The first case represents a dictatorship, the second the two-party democracy; in the latter, over time, both parties grow to resemble each other as they take up near-identical stances on most issues, often differing only in semantics. Unless, that is, the two parties vary in their assessment of how voter preferences are distributed on an issue - if one party believes they are clumped more to the left, while the other believes the majority leans to the right, sharp divisions can occur, as is the case here in Australia where our (effectively) two-party system in federal politics is now polarized over a proposed carbon ETS.Exit political economy, enter evolutionary biology; for this is where the analogy ends. Whereas ice-cream vendors and political parties are prepared to move to maximize sales and votes on the basis of their assumptions about the distribution of bodies and voters, creationists and evolutionists are camped firmly on either end of the belief scale; both sides preach only to their respective choirs, and it is not clear why. The distribution of people with regards to their belief varies, but it is safe to say that most are either mildly agnostic or mild believers; and yet, it is the strong views that color the debate and polarize opinions - for the creationists the evolutionists shall join Darwin in hell and pay for their lack of faith, and for the evolutionists, creationism is good for a laugh, or two, but for little else. Dawkins appears to be at the forefront of the rather acrimonious debate and draws more than his fair share of the creationists' ire (2). Which is a shame, really, for just as Chomsky's political writings have the unfortunate consequence of discounting - or at least distracting from - his brilliant work as a linguist, so too do Dawkins' views on God and religion prevent many from acknowledging his stellar contribution to our understanding of nature, and of our place in it. It may seem surprising that there even is a debate, in light of all the evidence, but the problem is that in a game-theoretic sense, religion 'plays' first, during the early formative years of children and thus enjoys a distinctive first-mover advantage, because science, to which the child is exposed only in school, plays a late second; nor do the oft-dull and dreary textbook treatments of science help advance its cause. This is precisely where leading scientific intellectuals such as Dawkins have so much to offer, and which he does admirably here, as always.To the premise of the book then: we may not all have descendants, but we all have an unbroken line of ancestors - each of whom survived long enough to reach child-bearing age and pass on their genes - fighting off predators, battling disease and natural disasters in the process; which is a fascinating thought, made even more so to consider that all that adventure does not lie merely in the human part of our evolutionary history. The journey Dawkins undertakes in this book then, is to track our shared ancestry - not merely that of every human being, but that of every single living creature - all the way back to four billion years to build a family tree that extends over hundreds of millions of great-grandparents. And yet by no means is this a Handbuch of sorts on speciation, rather, it is a delightful elucidation on the workings of evolution, a 'Who do you think you are?' on a scale that has absolutely no parallel: This is the book of life.(1) Establishing themselves close to the median of the voter preferences on just one axis does not of itself translate into votes- for that the voter preference on each issue and the weight of importance attached to it by the voter needs to be aggregated. (2) This polarization manifests itself in unexpected ways; in a recent ABC interview of Dawkins by Andrew Denton, for instance. Mindful, perhaps, of the consequences of appearing empathetic to his subject's views and alienating the conservatives among his viewers, the otherwise immensely capable Denton was unable to set a consistent tone for the program by committing himself to either a friendly or hostile line of questioning, which made for some extremely uneasy viewing. "
203,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"A tour de force by a great teacherThe conceit here is to imagine that we can go backward in time to when our linage split off from some other branch, say to when the evolutionary line that has led to Homo sapiens split off from the line that has led to chimpanzees. That would be Dawkins's Rendezvous point #1 on page 100 which took place about six million years ago.Like the characters in Chaucer's ""Canterbury Tales,"" we are pilgrims traveling toward a spot, not in geography, but in time; and along the way we meet up with other pilgrims, eventually with all of life's creatures until we are gathered together in Rendezvous #39 where we meet our most distant relatives, the eubacteria. At each rendezvous point there is a ""concestor,"" the common ancestor of all the lines of creatures that are now joined. Thus Concestor 1 was the ""250,000-greats-grandparent"" of both humans and chimpanzees. What Dawkins does at each point is to imagine what the concestor might have been like. Thus Concestor 1 would be an ape probably more like a chimpanzee than a human, a hairy ape that probably didn't walk upright, etc.Prior to Rendezvous 1 there is Rendezvous 0 in which all of humankind meets together with the humans that went out of Africa 30,000(?) years ago.At each of the rendezvous points there are tales, as in Chaucer's work. There is ""The Tasmanian's Tale"" in which it is related how the Tasmanian people were slaughtered. There is ""Eve's Tale"" in which we learn about mitochondrial DNA which is passed exclusively from mother to daughter. And later there are tales from the duckbilled platypus, the lungfish, the grasshopper, the redwood tree, etc. In each of these tales Dawkins, in his inimitable manner, focuses on some aspect of evolutionary biology and illuminates it for the reader. Some of the tales are difficult, but most are easy to read and fascinating to follow.One of the strengths of this book is in the clear and engaging way that Dawkins presents the material and his forthright expression, and his honest way of separating what is his informed opinion from that of a scientific consensus. One thing I have always admired about Dawkins is his ability to be candid about what he knows and what he doesn't, and his courage in expressing unpopular opinions.The question is, should the general reader buy this book and invest the time and effort in following Dawkins's pilgrimage? For those familiar with the great evolutionary biologist's work, this question answers itself. A new book by Richard Dawkins is an event to be celebrated. For others who want to learn something about evolution from one of its foremost experts (and celebrities, by the way) this book is highly recommended. The sheer expanse of Mr. Dawkins's knowledge and his infectious enthusiasm will inform and delight the reader. I suspect that most readers will learn more about how evolution works from this single book than from almost any other that I have read, and that includes works by such illuminati as Stephen Jay Gould, Ernst Mayr, and Edward O. Wilson. Incidentally, I believe that The Ancestor's Tale is a better read for most people than Gould's monumental The Structure of Evolutionary Theory (2002) if only because it is more accessible and less technical--not to mention about 750 pages shorter!Some quibbles: I think Dawkins overrates sexual selection in bringing about evolutionary change in some cases, e.g., in bipedalism, and in the growth of the human brain (cf. Geoffrey Miller in The Mating Mind (2000)). It seems to me that natural selection had to be the driving force in something so felicitous as freeing our arms to carry and to work, and in the development of something so expensive and radical as a greatly oversized brain.I also think that his idea to identify the lake, for example, created by the beaver, as part of the extended phenotype of the beaver is going a bit too far. I prefer to think of the lake as part of the beaver's ""culture,"" and the behavior that created the lake as part of the phenotype of the beaver. Our airplanes and computers are part of our culture. Our ability to make them is part of our phenotype. (For Dawkins's full expression on this topic see The Extended Phenotype (1982).)Here are a couple of examples of Dawkins's entertaining and elegant style: Referring to the fall of the dinosaurs, he facetiously imagines that Shelley's celebrated poem, ""Ozymandias,"" which mocked the vainglorious works of kings, was entitled ""Ode to a Dinosaur."" Indeed, how the mighty have fallen. (p. 255) Talking about a sea squirt larva which gives up its mobile life to become sedentary (with attendant changes in neurological form), Dawkins remarks, ""...when the time comes, [it] settles down to a sedentary life and 'eats its brain, like an associate professor getting tenure.'"" (p. 370) One of the best parts of the book, not to be missed, is the concluding chapter, ""The Host's Return"" in which Dawkins talks about re-running evolution. He speculates on which adaptations might and might not be returned. Certainly flight, which has evolved independently some 40 to 50 times would be seen again. But would the ""swollen"" human brain and the development of syntactic language evolve again?Although Dawkins has addressed the so-called argument from design many times, I don't think he has ever demonstrated its paucity more eloquently and succinctly than he does beginning on page 549 where he calls it the ""Argument from Personal Incredulity."" His point is that to say something must have been designed because it is so complex really says ""less about nature than about the poverty...[of the speaker's] imagination."" On page 602 he adds, ""Ultimately design cannot explain anything because there is an inevitable regression to the problem of the origin of the designer.""And finally I have a question for Professor Dawkins: why are there no viruses among the pilgrims? --Dennis Littrell, author of “Understanding Evolution and Ourselves”"
204,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85772714-wil-c-fry,5,"Bottom line: I learned from this book, and that's the primary reason I read non-fiction. Additionally, I was fascinated, engaged, and in a few cases blown away. With apologies to Richard Dawkins (and Geoffrey Chaucer), I didn't much enjoy the format, but this is a minor complaint. It just felt forced and artificial the way Dawkins attempted to squeeze his story into the series of ""tales"" as an homage to The Canterbury Tales. Otherwise, the entire book was enjoyable.Beginning at the present, renowned scientist Dawkins takes the reader on a reverse journey through time, tracing humanity's evolutionary past through a series of ""rendezvous"" with other animal species (and larger groups). For the most part ignoring extinct species, the tale looks for branching-off points (speciation events); for example, the most recent about 6 million years ago when we last shared an ancestor with chimpanzees. Each rendezvous is accompanied by a helpful graphic showing how far back the story has gone, which animal groups are ""joining"" us on our ""pilgrimage"", and which geological eras/epochs are involved.The Selfish Gene remains my favorite Dawkins book, but this one is powerful in its own right."
205,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30987-justine,5,"I don't get to use the word masterpiece much, but The Ancestor's Tale really was a masterpiece and a love letter to life on earth, the study of it, and evolution. Dawkins mirrors the Canterbury Tales framework*, with us as a species going on a pilgrimage back in time to meet the common ancestors we share with each of the other species on earth, all the way back to the first life form that came out of some kind of primordial soup. Along the way, each pilgrim we meet tells a story that elucidates the process, theories, and methods of study behind evolution. It was a dense and aggressive read, but also one that brims with Dawkins' fascination and love for his subject. His ability to communicate his wonder for the world and the scientific process through which we understand it is full of self-reflection, candor, and optimism. I feel better about humanity knowing he is in it. I try to read one ambitious book a year, and this is it***Christ (haha) he is such a genius **Or a carry over from last year.... because I suck at reading hard things right now."
206,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3749108-ohenrypacey,5,"The sheer amount of information packed into this book would have to be daunting to a reader not initiated into the language of biology, but any fan of Darwin, Stephen Jay Gould or E.O. Wilson (to name a few) will revel in the way that Dawkins journeys from the tip of the branch (modern man) to the trunk of the tree at the beginning of all life on earth. Each waypoint in the journey is a junction at which another branch of life rejoins ours on the way to the trunk at life's earliest moment, and is an opportunity for Dawkins to explore nearly every aspect of the way science has categorized, discovered, studied and theorized upon the vast diversity of beings that do and have inhabited our planet. It's an amazing contrast to The Sixth Extinction that I finished just prior."
207,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54757979-krocht-ehlundovi,5,"This is one of the books which add you another perspective of life (in its pure scientific form), the one which is like a wall against bullshit of conspiracies, vampires, mystery medicament and spiritual blindness. While I was reading the book my mouth was open with surprise and fascination. The book hit a point which must be on when one reads ""web""/""online"" articles about some scientific discovery... it underlines respect and awareness what a science means!I read about the author (and his colleague) that he is a modern pit-bull of Darwin ideas, and I can understand why. This is not meant in a pejorative way, rather as his way of approaching and interpreting (biological) evolution. His skills have amazed me, I learnt and understood a lot. He did not only describe processes but he also offered and presented methodologies how scientists look for/check (possible) answers, so it is an insight into their work - to remind the ones who might say: ""what they know/how they can know it!?"" - so now, I know. The mere size of a book (around 700 pages) tells you that this is not for ""fastfood"" thinkers, that it requires your attention and dedication to know, however its content is magnificent as well. How can I know it? I got to R. Dawkins through various sources and channels which prize him pretty much. Plus, I am aware that when he touches uncharted areas it is his challenge how to try to answer difficult questions - however not based on ""emotional"" and ""opinion"" ground but on facts and data (this comment is more for people who know a bit how science/scientists work)... So, if you want to challenge your imagination, if you want to learn and know something fabulous and fascinating about life, open this book and read it thoroughly! The book has been my extraordinary experience.The book is still in mind mind consuming my attention. It behaves as a Siren anchor bringing me back to its topic, it has showed me the life and lives. "
208,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56609924-flaviu-vescan,5,Sadly the audiobook can only be found in an abridged version which finished way too fast. Dawkins never disappoints! I loved the book and will read it again unabridged when I do a second read of all his books. Hearing him talk about RNA and natural selection arms races are quickly becoming my favorite go-to intellectual pass time while going about my daily routines. I'm recommending it to any biology enthusiast out there.

Kind of the devolution of the life all the way back to the first signs of ancestral life to all living thing here in planet earth. A bit of an homage to the Canterbury tales throughout. I truly enjoyed this.
210,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39755297-fipah,4,"4 stars = I really liked itDividing the book into two digestible parts (that themselves count as books really) was what I've done and I can recommended it, yet the drawback is one does not remember very well the points he made in the first half of the book, however it was not at all disturbing - even though Dawkins makes connections, each chapter is standalone and he makes the effort to look at the key points one has learned throughout the book from various angles, which summarises the whole experience and makes the journey very well connected.This book is not only about the evolution of biodiversity, it is richly interwoven with variegated topics and scientific disciplines that underpin the interdisciplinarity of the study of the history of life such as epigenetics, the importance of logarithms in science, plate tectonics or a short chapter on what it is probably like to have a grandiose sense of smell and no eyesight. I hold Dawkins as very skillful at this - he always manages to use varied sources to unify his arguments and, moreover, this makes any text of his captivating and complete. Also, he does not shy away from making fluid ventures into social and political commentaries for example on racism, sexism or (expectedly) creationism. I mostly found these to be succinct and well connected.As a person who has read a few books about molecular biology, genetics and evolution, and studied an undergraduate degree in Ecology for one year, many ideas did not feel very fresh to me, hence the book only summarised what I have already learnt. Consequently, it felt like another TV documentary about animals for general public with the same commonplace topics and arguments - yet of course, the book was deeper indeed, this is just how it felt a bit to me. I found this to be especially true of the second half of the book, since the first dealt with humans, apes and chimpanzees, so its anthropological outlook was more novel to me. This by no means is a criticism of the book, it should only serve as a warning to prospective readers who have either studied a STEM degree (escpecially biology-related) or read many (pop) science books. This book is indeed about evolution and animals which is Dawkins' expertise, yet all the other science and theories he explains like the central dogma of molecular biology or the evolution of eucaryotic cells should already be pretty familar to such readers.Last warning: Especially in the second half of the book I found his ideas and writing to be lengthy - the length of the book no longer feflt justified. This is just a thing to keep in mind.Recommended to readers who are interested in the evolution of biodiversity and who have not read many other pop-science books about evolution, molecular biology, Earth history and archaelogy.

211,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk,3,"Non-Fiction. 4 billion years of evolution, practically in real time. To avoid any ""human-centrism,"" Dawkins -- famous for his outspoken stance against creationism -- does this backwards and models the journey on Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. Scared yet? Well, it's not in rhyme or Old English, but Dawkins does tend toward lofty language and wild, rambling digressions. It bugged me at first, but over the course of this SIX HUNDRED PAGE BOOK, I got used to it and even grew to appreciate Dawkins and his sly humor. He actually made me laugh out loud a couple times.The pilgrimage conceit holds up: we travel backwards in time to meet a series of common ancestors, starting with concestor 1 (for ""common ancestor""), where mankind splits from the chimpanzees, and ending with concestor 39, the first life on Earth. At each stop he describes what that ancestor may have looked like, where it lived, and how long ago.The Chaucer conceit never got off the ground. Most tales, like ""The Armadillo's Tale,"" don't tell you anything about the animal the tale's dedicated to. There are a few exceptions to this, though, like ""The Beaver's Tale"" or ""The Brine Shrimp's Tale."" Those actually address the qualities of the animal in question, and were some of my favorites because of it.One of the best things about this book is that Dawkins freely admits -- early and often -- that a lot of what he's talking about is based on limited data and/or guesswork and may be wrong. He goes out of his way to offer alternate theories and differing opinions, though he always singles out the position he finds most likely. I love it when scientists admit they don't know things, and Dawkins has no problem with that. He can sound arrogant and in love with his own voice (the number of times he quotes himself and his previous books!!!), but at heart I think he really loves the subject and wants to share it with people. It's a long, and sometimes difficult, book to read. It gets into genetics, math, biology, taxonomy, chemistry, pretty much everything, and at times the explanations get messy or too technical. I liked the biology parts best -- the different ways organisms evolve and why, and there was plenty of that to keep me interested. It's a lot of information, though still a very basic look at the diversity of life. I started out reading it like homework -- 10-20 pages a day -- but after I got the hang of it, I was reading 30 and 40 pages without breaking a sweat. Did I enjoy it? I think so? I definitely know a little bit about a LOT of things now, and it made me want to read more about evolution.Three stars for the book and the information it provides, and FIVE stars for me for making it through."
212,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10781757-otherwyrld,4,"I approached a book of this size and scope with some trepidation (seriously, you could kill someone if you hit them over the head with the hardback edition), how could this possibly cover the whole history of life on Earth. I also note that I have had issues in the past with the authors writing style, which can run to the overly verbose to my taste, as well as the huge hype over his anti religion stand that tends to get a lot more publicity than his actual books do.So, on the whole this monumental work succeeds admirably, notwithstanding my above mentioned misgivings. This book takes us on a journey from our most recent ancestors backwards to meet shared ancestors (or concestors as the author describes them) along the way, a la The Canterbury Tales, with the ultimate goal being the beginnings of life itself. Along the way the author tells numerous tales in the same way as Geoffrey Chaucer did to illustrate various points. In some ways these are both the best and the worst parts of the book, as this is where the authors writing style flourishes the most. The more straightforward descriptions of the species/genus (etc) that we encounter are easier to read though often quite dry and highly technical.There is a large prologue which looks at the history of hominids before it heads to the first rendezvous with Chimpanzees, then Gorillas, Orangutan and the rest of the primates in turn. This section alone takes up a third of the book, and mammals as a whole takes up half. This leaves little room for the rest of the species, with only insects taking up a large section in the rest of the book. Plants are particularly sidelined, which is a shame because it makes the book rather lopsided though I can understand racing through some sections because there really is very little to say about them. It did make the latter third of the book drag a little bit though and I slogged through to the end. The author wisely keeps his religious digs to a minimum, though he can't resist it the whole time. I can't really talk about the co-author as his voice doesn't really come through that much. The book has some nice colour plates to illustrate some of the species discussed, but the line illustrations leave a bit to be desired. mostly because they were shrunk too much to fit into the paperback edition. The overall idea of a fractal design for the various rendezvous' was a nice touch, and there is an extensive bibliography if you want to explore further. "
213,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,4,"Here's an ambitious bet: to tell the story of life on Earth as an odyssey, a pilgrimage backward in time. The approach is indeed original as, reading this book is like boarding a time machine where at each chapter we meet one of our ancestors -that Dawkins describes, showing in which ways its anatomy or way of life can serve a better understanding of why we are what we are. 40 ancestors are thus passing us by, from primates to mammals in general, vertebrates, invertebrates and, all the way until the unicellular organisms.Each encounter is also the occasion for a digression (a 'tale') on topics ranging from fossils conversation and datation, bipedalism, sex, the notion of 'race' or, again, the shaping of some organs. He even dares to defend (although not dogmatically) the 'primeval soup' hypothesis! (well...)A big book, those qualities are strangely enough also the bad points. The topic is indeed so vast that, some chapters are obviously more captivating than others, making it an hard and challenging read during the passages dealing with those ancestors that don't interest you that much. Yet, always a great populariser Dawkins delivers here one of the most thoughtful and complete story of life on Earth. Huge! "
214,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3744803-chris,5,"Richard Dawkins is the best writer on the topic of evolution that I have encountered. He is able to explain concepts in such a way as to make them easily understandable. All of the books that I have read by Dawkins have been very informative and entertaining as well. The Ancestor's Tale is a cleverly structured book in which Dawkins takes the reader on a journey chronologically back in time through our evolutionary history. Each successive chapter is the next branch of our evolutionary tree where Homo sapiens merges with our next most recent kin. The book cleverly mimics Chaucer's Canterbury Tales wherein each new member of the group tells a story. In The Ancestor's Tale, each of these ""tales"" is told by one of the species that we are joining with in the current branch. The story is always about some aspect of evolution that is pertinent in some way to the species telling the tale.  The Ancestor's Tale is the best book that I have read on evolution up to this point and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in this subject."
215,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70965168-youp,5,"Recently I've been on somewhat of a Dawkins reading-spree. He is at his best when focussing on evolutionary biology as much as possible, and on religion the least amount possible. The Ancestor's Tale consists almost exclusively of evolution and biology related content, and Dawkins does an amazing job of taking his reader on an epic journey.While I was fascinated by the concept of a journey backwards through time, meeting fellow lifeforms on the major forks of evolution, the execution could have failed in numerous ways. Fortunately, Dawkins delivers a captivating story from the very first chapter, and unfailingly continues to amaze until the last page. Not only does the author explain important branch-offs on the evolutionary tree; he describes the modern day features of our distant cousins in a way that creates a new found appreciation for the almost magical power of natural selection. The Ancestor's Tale is incredibly original, brilliantly written and covers a huge amount of terrority while providing enough depth to continually amaze."

Dawkins guides us along on the greatest pilgrimage ever to the dawn of evolution in a style reminiscent of The Canterbury Tales.

229,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84660-swankivy,4,"This doorstopper of a book was a lot more fun than you might think, considering the subject matter. Richard Dawkins has a certain way of telling stories that makes them palatable even when, like me, you aren't exactly learned in the subject. I wouldn't say I'm ignorant about the topic at hand, and I have certainly known better since middle school than to perceive evolution as if it's ""humans evolved from modern apes,"" but I learned a heck of a lot of stuff here. In between all the little stories about creatures I'd often never heard of and occasional anecdotes about Dawkins's personal experiences and relationships with other scientists, there were tales of discovery, of archaeological and biological history, and of how nature works. Even though it did feel a tad long and drawn out for me, now at the end of the road I think I appreciated that it took its time, with a leisurely feel that made every encounter with another ""concestor"" feel important enough to give time to.I would like to share some specific individual thoughts and quotes on the book here.I liked Dawkins's discussion of evolution not being a concept of other beings on their way to becoming us. They weren't unfinished when they were alive, just like modern animals today aren't unfinished because they're not us and none of us are unfinished because one day our descendants will be different from us.I enjoyed the explanation of why we all have one ancestor, as impossible as that sounds, because of DNA's existence. If there were other types of creatures before DNA's ""birth"" that replicated a different way, they left no descendants because every creature alive today has DNA, and if there were later ones coming into existence, they'd immediately be eaten by bacteria.DNA is compared to telegrams and I liked that analogy very much. It's because they have to use the same letters that make up meaningful words to also indicate pauses, like STOP, and DNA has that situation too how its codes are run end to end, with some junk here and there. A cool factoid: If you find a population that's been isolated for X years, then you know the common ancestor WE have with them can't be younger than that. An alien looking at human and gibbon genitals would think the males are more related to each other than they are to the females of their own species. If we interpret based only on physical factors that look similar, we may be making the same mistake.There's some cool info about color vision and how some old-world monkeys are primarily color blind but some females have color vision. It was all explained really neatly.Richard Dawkins had a pet bushbaby as a kid and sometimes it would pee on him from above. Just throwing that out there.I like how he discusses the uncertainty of his branches, how recently evidence he's using was developed and how accepted it is, and the fact that new evidence may change where certain creatures join the ancestor pilgrimage.There was a good discussion of the meaning of ""primitive"" with regard to whether a species is primitive in one way and therefore primitive in another (""primitive"" means ""resembling the ancestor""). A good quote that sums it up: ""There is no substance called Essence of Antiquity that pervades the blood and soaks into the bones.""There's a really good metaphor about a bobbing cork as an explanation of overall trends in evolution. If you tracked it over time and saw that it was going toward the east, you know that looking back, but if you just analyzed its movements as it bobs up and down and gets tossed around in the ocean, you couldn't necessarily say where it will end up based on such small movements.Sometimes Dawkins would just throw out a comparison that would come out of nowhere and be funny. Case in point: ""Capable of swallowing a medium-sized lawyer whole.""There's a really well-explained section on how evolution is continuous and the categories between species are pretty artificial. No parent was a different species from their child, and a time machine taking people back a thousand years at a time should result in arriving at a population each could interbreed with. Overall of course, they're evolving, but there's no distinct time where you can say ""the parent was X; the child is Y."" Kind of like when you're warming up your bath water, there's not really a specific degree where you'd say the water is no longer warm but hot. A quote: ""More than once I have seen a reference to the larval sea squirt which, when the time comes, settles down to a sedentary life and 'eats its brain, like an associate professor getting tenure.'""Starfish, by the way, are really weird. Eeuuuwww.The Grasshopper's Tale discussed human ""races"" in association with how grasshoppers kinda have races based on what their song sounds like, and how they tend not to mate with different races, but will if you do something to make their song different. I was kinda irritated with how he digressed into some oversimplified or flat-out misleading representations of how race works. First off, he claimed people are asked to check one of 5 race boxes on forms, and offered ""Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, Native American, and Other"" as the choices. If I see boxes like these, they invariably include Asian and/or Pacific Islanders. Which is weird because he mentions Asians in the same topic. But then he goes on to say that mixed-race doesn't have its own name, offering ""Blue has a name. Green has a name. Blue-green does not."" Yes it does? Lots of blue-green mixtures have names, like turquoise. He goes on to say Affirmative Action isn't FAIR because it assumes an individual is being repaid for wrongs done to his ancestors. This seems a crass oversimplification and sadly pretty typical of privileged white dudes, especially since he probably should be well aware enough of social factors to realize that the legacy of slavery and other terrible events and trends affecting people of color are still resulting in those populations experiencing prejudice and poverty on a much higher level than whites do. Affirmative Action acknowledges that to get the same opportunities, disadvantaged populations have to come a longer distance from farther away (overall, as a population; obviously there are individual white people who are more disadvantaged on some axes than individual people of color, but this deals with an overall phenomenon, not with exceptions to the trend). Affirmative Action was not invented specifically as a reparations measure. It acknowledges CURRENT disadvantages that come from living in poverty and almost definitely having decisions about your life being made by racists who don't know they're racist but make racist decisions. Those racist decisions may sound less like ""his dark skin is ugly to me, so I'm not giving him a job"" but more like ""he speaks like a typical black person, which to my white ears has become synonymous with uneducated and rough; therefore I perceive him as not being as professional, or perhaps assume my customers will conclude that and therefore I will hire a person who speaks like me."" We'll pretend it's not about race but about readiness and deservingness of the job, but if someone's natural hair or accent or style of dress automatically makes us think less of them or makes us expect them to separate themselves from norms of their community to be acceptable to ours, those are racist perspectives. Those are the kinds of things Affirmative Action is attempting to counteract. Though for the record that program helps more white women than anyone, and we women contend with prejudices surrounding our competence, our ability to do certain types of work, and our likelihood of abandoning the career to make or care for babies. Anyway.Richard Dawkins demonstrated he does not know what Affirmative Action is for. Next.A quote: ""The third school of thought is, in my opinion, bonkers. Or, to use more parliamentary language, wildly and irresponsibly unrealistic."" Haha.He made a Philip Pullman reference and that made me happy. I was thinking about mufela from The Amber Spyglass when Dawkins started discussing microscopic creatures that evolved the only known natural wheel, and then he mentioned it too.I thought it was pretty awesome that toward the end of the book Dawkins went into detail about how evolution itself can evolve--that creatures who are better at evolving may have a better chance of survival, so therefore evolution's processes themselves can be improved through evolution.A final quote to close out my review: ""This pilgrimage has been a trip, not just in the literal sense, but in the countercultural sense I met when a young man in California in the 1960s. The most potent hallucinogen on sale in Haight or Ashbury or telegraph Avenue would be tame by comparison. If it's amazement you want, the real world has it all."""

Well, it turns out that 'new genes aren't added to the genome out of thin air. They originate as duplicates of older genes. Then, over evolutionary time, they go to their separate ways by mutation, selection and drift.'Or other interesting facts, like that the closest living relatives of hippos are whales!Or how we sometimes forget that our way of perceiving the world is not the only one. Playtpuses, for example, 'have about 40000 electrical sensors distributed [...] over both surfaces of the bill.' They use these electrical sensors to perceive the weak electric fields generated by their prey (while the prey use its muscles to move around).We also discover how many times gliding and flight have separately evolved as examples of convergent evolution. And how places like Australia and New Zeland, due to their historic isolation, provide cases for explaining how the evolution of species there is quite analogous to what happened in other parts of the world with each one occupying their own niche.I want to end this review with a citation that sums up why you should read this book: 'not only is life on this planet amazing, and deeply satisfying to all whose senes have not become dulled by familiarity: the very fact that we have evolved the brain power to understand our evolutionary genesis redoubles this amazement and compounds the satisfaction.' "
231,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4551268-sara-g,5,"This beautiful book was really captivating. I like Dawkins a lot, but I know he comes off as really abrasive to many people. In this book, though, rather than constantly being on the attack, he's describing the beauties and wonders of the natural world. I like his softer side.It's written in the form of a pilgrimage (like the Canterbury Tales), back to our most distant ancestors. It's human-centric for no reason other than relatability. Dawkins takes pains to mention that a similar pilgrimage could be focused on any living species today. He pauses at key moments in our evolutionary history to discuss our relationship with what he calls ""concestors"" - shared ancestors with other species on Earth. It's fascinating stuff, but very dense in places. My favorite part was the discussion about how life may have arisen on Earth and the ""RNA World"" origin theory, which I was previously unfamiliar with. This is why I read good popular science. The science I learned in school is painfully outdated. I've added quite a few books to my TBR based on Dawkins's recommendations and references here. This book isn't for everyone, but for someone with a decent scientific background, I think you could gain a lot.End note - I keep going back to the description of a Douglas Adams Doctor Who script mentioned in this book, where a time traveler keeps going back in time to weep for the dodos before they became extinct. I love this imagery."
232,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/362402-snehal-bhagat,5,"Political economy basics are often explained with the help of an analogy: we imagine a beach in summer with people sun-bathing; for the sake of simplicity, we assume that the beach is one-dimensional- a straight line running from left to right- and that the people are distributed approximately equidistant from each other. An enterprising ice-cream vendor comes along with his cart and sets up shop - where should he position himself if he desires to maximize his sales?Clearly, anywhere; for as long as he has a monopoly, people will walk from all over the beach to buy his product. For purposes of illustration, we imagine him settling somewhere near the extreme right of the beach. Now, should a second vendor selling ice-cream come onto the scene, and discover that people will buy ice-cream from the vendor closest to them, where must she position herself? Obviously she should set shop adjacent to the first vendor, but slightly to his left; she can then maximize her sales by cornering the bulk of the market. The loss of sales then forces the first vendor to move his cart to the left of vendor two and the jostling continues; it is straightforward to see that in a few iterations, both vendors end up next to each other close to the center of the beach in their bid to maximize their sales. The fictitious beach, of course represents a political issue, the bathers are the voters and the vendors the political parties; the goal is to maximize votes instead of sales (1). The first case represents a dictatorship, the second the two-party democracy; in the latter, over time, both parties grow to resemble each other as they take up near-identical stances on most issues, often differing only in semantics. Unless, that is, the two parties vary in their assessment of how voter preferences are distributed on an issue - if one party believes they are clumped more to the left, while the other believes the majority leans to the right, sharp divisions can occur, as is the case here in Australia where our (effectively) two-party system in federal politics is now polarized over a proposed carbon ETS.Exit political economy, enter evolutionary biology; for this is where the analogy ends. Whereas ice-cream vendors and political parties are prepared to move to maximize sales and votes on the basis of their assumptions about the distribution of bodies and voters, creationists and evolutionists are camped firmly on either end of the belief scale; both sides preach only to their respective choirs, and it is not clear why. The distribution of people with regards to their belief varies, but it is safe to say that most are either mildly agnostic or mild believers; and yet, it is the strong views that color the debate and polarize opinions - for the creationists the evolutionists shall join Darwin in hell and pay for their lack of faith, and for the evolutionists, creationism is good for a laugh, or two, but for little else. Dawkins appears to be at the forefront of the rather acrimonious debate and draws more than his fair share of the creationists' ire (2). Which is a shame, really, for just as Chomsky's political writings have the unfortunate consequence of discounting - or at least distracting from - his brilliant work as a linguist, so too do Dawkins' views on God and religion prevent many from acknowledging his stellar contribution to our understanding of nature, and of our place in it. It may seem surprising that there even is a debate, in light of all the evidence, but the problem is that in a game-theoretic sense, religion 'plays' first, during the early formative years of children and thus enjoys a distinctive first-mover advantage, because science, to which the child is exposed only in school, plays a late second; nor do the oft-dull and dreary textbook treatments of science help advance its cause. This is precisely where leading scientific intellectuals such as Dawkins have so much to offer, and which he does admirably here, as always.To the premise of the book then: we may not all have descendants, but we all have an unbroken line of ancestors - each of whom survived long enough to reach child-bearing age and pass on their genes - fighting off predators, battling disease and natural disasters in the process; which is a fascinating thought, made even more so to consider that all that adventure does not lie merely in the human part of our evolutionary history. The journey Dawkins undertakes in this book then, is to track our shared ancestry - not merely that of every human being, but that of every single living creature - all the way back to four billion years to build a family tree that extends over hundreds of millions of great-grandparents. And yet by no means is this a Handbuch of sorts on speciation, rather, it is a delightful elucidation on the workings of evolution, a 'Who do you think you are?' on a scale that has absolutely no parallel: This is the book of life.(1) Establishing themselves close to the median of the voter preferences on just one axis does not of itself translate into votes- for that the voter preference on each issue and the weight of importance attached to it by the voter needs to be aggregated. (2) This polarization manifests itself in unexpected ways; in a recent ABC interview of Dawkins by Andrew Denton, for instance. Mindful, perhaps, of the consequences of appearing empathetic to his subject's views and alienating the conservatives among his viewers, the otherwise immensely capable Denton was unable to set a consistent tone for the program by committing himself to either a friendly or hostile line of questioning, which made for some extremely uneasy viewing. "
233,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"A tour de force by a great teacherThe conceit here is to imagine that we can go backward in time to when our linage split off from some other branch, say to when the evolutionary line that has led to Homo sapiens split off from the line that has led to chimpanzees. That would be Dawkins's Rendezvous point #1 on page 100 which took place about six million years ago.Like the characters in Chaucer's ""Canterbury Tales,"" we are pilgrims traveling toward a spot, not in geography, but in time; and along the way we meet up with other pilgrims, eventually with all of life's creatures until we are gathered together in Rendezvous #39 where we meet our most distant relatives, the eubacteria. At each rendezvous point there is a ""concestor,"" the common ancestor of all the lines of creatures that are now joined. Thus Concestor 1 was the ""250,000-greats-grandparent"" of both humans and chimpanzees. What Dawkins does at each point is to imagine what the concestor might have been like. Thus Concestor 1 would be an ape probably more like a chimpanzee than a human, a hairy ape that probably didn't walk upright, etc.Prior to Rendezvous 1 there is Rendezvous 0 in which all of humankind meets together with the humans that went out of Africa 30,000(?) years ago.At each of the rendezvous points there are tales, as in Chaucer's work. There is ""The Tasmanian's Tale"" in which it is related how the Tasmanian people were slaughtered. There is ""Eve's Tale"" in which we learn about mitochondrial DNA which is passed exclusively from mother to daughter. And later there are tales from the duckbilled platypus, the lungfish, the grasshopper, the redwood tree, etc. In each of these tales Dawkins, in his inimitable manner, focuses on some aspect of evolutionary biology and illuminates it for the reader. Some of the tales are difficult, but most are easy to read and fascinating to follow.One of the strengths of this book is in the clear and engaging way that Dawkins presents the material and his forthright expression, and his honest way of separating what is his informed opinion from that of a scientific consensus. One thing I have always admired about Dawkins is his ability to be candid about what he knows and what he doesn't, and his courage in expressing unpopular opinions.The question is, should the general reader buy this book and invest the time and effort in following Dawkins's pilgrimage? For those familiar with the great evolutionary biologist's work, this question answers itself. A new book by Richard Dawkins is an event to be celebrated. For others who want to learn something about evolution from one of its foremost experts (and celebrities, by the way) this book is highly recommended. The sheer expanse of Mr. Dawkins's knowledge and his infectious enthusiasm will inform and delight the reader. I suspect that most readers will learn more about how evolution works from this single book than from almost any other that I have read, and that includes works by such illuminati as Stephen Jay Gould, Ernst Mayr, and Edward O. Wilson. Incidentally, I believe that The Ancestor's Tale is a better read for most people than Gould's monumental The Structure of Evolutionary Theory (2002) if only because it is more accessible and less technical--not to mention about 750 pages shorter!Some quibbles: I think Dawkins overrates sexual selection in bringing about evolutionary change in some cases, e.g., in bipedalism, and in the growth of the human brain (cf. Geoffrey Miller in The Mating Mind (2000)). It seems to me that natural selection had to be the driving force in something so felicitous as freeing our arms to carry and to work, and in the development of something so expensive and radical as a greatly oversized brain.I also think that his idea to identify the lake, for example, created by the beaver, as part of the extended phenotype of the beaver is going a bit too far. I prefer to think of the lake as part of the beaver's ""culture,"" and the behavior that created the lake as part of the phenotype of the beaver. Our airplanes and computers are part of our culture. Our ability to make them is part of our phenotype. (For Dawkins's full expression on this topic see The Extended Phenotype (1982).)Here are a couple of examples of Dawkins's entertaining and elegant style: Referring to the fall of the dinosaurs, he facetiously imagines that Shelley's celebrated poem, ""Ozymandias,"" which mocked the vainglorious works of kings, was entitled ""Ode to a Dinosaur."" Indeed, how the mighty have fallen. (p. 255) Talking about a sea squirt larva which gives up its mobile life to become sedentary (with attendant changes in neurological form), Dawkins remarks, ""...when the time comes, [it] settles down to a sedentary life and 'eats its brain, like an associate professor getting tenure.'"" (p. 370) One of the best parts of the book, not to be missed, is the concluding chapter, ""The Host's Return"" in which Dawkins talks about re-running evolution. He speculates on which adaptations might and might not be returned. Certainly flight, which has evolved independently some 40 to 50 times would be seen again. But would the ""swollen"" human brain and the development of syntactic language evolve again?Although Dawkins has addressed the so-called argument from design many times, I don't think he has ever demonstrated its paucity more eloquently and succinctly than he does beginning on page 549 where he calls it the ""Argument from Personal Incredulity."" His point is that to say something must have been designed because it is so complex really says ""less about nature than about the poverty...[of the speaker's] imagination."" On page 602 he adds, ""Ultimately design cannot explain anything because there is an inevitable regression to the problem of the origin of the designer.""And finally I have a question for Professor Dawkins: why are there no viruses among the pilgrims? --Dennis Littrell, author of “Understanding Evolution and Ourselves”"
234,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85772714-wil-c-fry,5,"Bottom line: I learned from this book, and that's the primary reason I read non-fiction. Additionally, I was fascinated, engaged, and in a few cases blown away. With apologies to Richard Dawkins (and Geoffrey Chaucer), I didn't much enjoy the format, but this is a minor complaint. It just felt forced and artificial the way Dawkins attempted to squeeze his story into the series of ""tales"" as an homage to The Canterbury Tales. Otherwise, the entire book was enjoyable.Beginning at the present, renowned scientist Dawkins takes the reader on a reverse journey through time, tracing humanity's evolutionary past through a series of ""rendezvous"" with other animal species (and larger groups). For the most part ignoring extinct species, the tale looks for branching-off points (speciation events); for example, the most recent about 6 million years ago when we last shared an ancestor with chimpanzees. Each rendezvous is accompanied by a helpful graphic showing how far back the story has gone, which animal groups are ""joining"" us on our ""pilgrimage"", and which geological eras/epochs are involved.The Selfish Gene remains my favorite Dawkins book, but this one is powerful in its own right."
235,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30987-justine,5,"I don't get to use the word masterpiece much, but The Ancestor's Tale really was a masterpiece and a love letter to life on earth, the study of it, and evolution. Dawkins mirrors the Canterbury Tales framework*, with us as a species going on a pilgrimage back in time to meet the common ancestors we share with each of the other species on earth, all the way back to the first life form that came out of some kind of primordial soup. Along the way, each pilgrim we meet tells a story that elucidates the process, theories, and methods of study behind evolution. It was a dense and aggressive read, but also one that brims with Dawkins' fascination and love for his subject. His ability to communicate his wonder for the world and the scientific process through which we understand it is full of self-reflection, candor, and optimism. I feel better about humanity knowing he is in it. I try to read one ambitious book a year, and this is it***Christ (haha) he is such a genius **Or a carry over from last year.... because I suck at reading hard things right now."
236,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3749108-ohenrypacey,5,"The sheer amount of information packed into this book would have to be daunting to a reader not initiated into the language of biology, but any fan of Darwin, Stephen Jay Gould or E.O. Wilson (to name a few) will revel in the way that Dawkins journeys from the tip of the branch (modern man) to the trunk of the tree at the beginning of all life on earth. Each waypoint in the journey is a junction at which another branch of life rejoins ours on the way to the trunk at life's earliest moment, and is an opportunity for Dawkins to explore nearly every aspect of the way science has categorized, discovered, studied and theorized upon the vast diversity of beings that do and have inhabited our planet. It's an amazing contrast to The Sixth Extinction that I finished just prior."
237,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54757979-krocht-ehlundovi,5,"This is one of the books which add you another perspective of life (in its pure scientific form), the one which is like a wall against bullshit of conspiracies, vampires, mystery medicament and spiritual blindness. While I was reading the book my mouth was open with surprise and fascination. The book hit a point which must be on when one reads ""web""/""online"" articles about some scientific discovery... it underlines respect and awareness what a science means!I read about the author (and his colleague) that he is a modern pit-bull of Darwin ideas, and I can understand why. This is not meant in a pejorative way, rather as his way of approaching and interpreting (biological) evolution. His skills have amazed me, I learnt and understood a lot. He did not only describe processes but he also offered and presented methodologies how scientists look for/check (possible) answers, so it is an insight into their work - to remind the ones who might say: ""what they know/how they can know it!?"" - so now, I know. The mere size of a book (around 700 pages) tells you that this is not for ""fastfood"" thinkers, that it requires your attention and dedication to know, however its content is magnificent as well. How can I know it? I got to R. Dawkins through various sources and channels which prize him pretty much. Plus, I am aware that when he touches uncharted areas it is his challenge how to try to answer difficult questions - however not based on ""emotional"" and ""opinion"" ground but on facts and data (this comment is more for people who know a bit how science/scientists work)... So, if you want to challenge your imagination, if you want to learn and know something fabulous and fascinating about life, open this book and read it thoroughly! The book has been my extraordinary experience.The book is still in mind mind consuming my attention. It behaves as a Siren anchor bringing me back to its topic, it has showed me the life and lives. "
238,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56609924-flaviu-vescan,5,Sadly the audiobook can only be found in an abridged version which finished way too fast. Dawkins never disappoints! I loved the book and will read it again unabridged when I do a second read of all his books. Hearing him talk about RNA and natural selection arms races are quickly becoming my favorite go-to intellectual pass time while going about my daily routines. I'm recommending it to any biology enthusiast out there.

Kind of the devolution of the life all the way back to the first signs of ancestral life to all living thing here in planet earth. A bit of an homage to the Canterbury tales throughout. I truly enjoyed this.
240,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39755297-fipah,4,"4 stars = I really liked itDividing the book into two digestible parts (that themselves count as books really) was what I've done and I can recommended it, yet the drawback is one does not remember very well the points he made in the first half of the book, however it was not at all disturbing - even though Dawkins makes connections, each chapter is standalone and he makes the effort to look at the key points one has learned throughout the book from various angles, which summarises the whole experience and makes the journey very well connected.This book is not only about the evolution of biodiversity, it is richly interwoven with variegated topics and scientific disciplines that underpin the interdisciplinarity of the study of the history of life such as epigenetics, the importance of logarithms in science, plate tectonics or a short chapter on what it is probably like to have a grandiose sense of smell and no eyesight. I hold Dawkins as very skillful at this - he always manages to use varied sources to unify his arguments and, moreover, this makes any text of his captivating and complete. Also, he does not shy away from making fluid ventures into social and political commentaries for example on racism, sexism or (expectedly) creationism. I mostly found these to be succinct and well connected.As a person who has read a few books about molecular biology, genetics and evolution, and studied an undergraduate degree in Ecology for one year, many ideas did not feel very fresh to me, hence the book only summarised what I have already learnt. Consequently, it felt like another TV documentary about animals for general public with the same commonplace topics and arguments - yet of course, the book was deeper indeed, this is just how it felt a bit to me. I found this to be especially true of the second half of the book, since the first dealt with humans, apes and chimpanzees, so its anthropological outlook was more novel to me. This by no means is a criticism of the book, it should only serve as a warning to prospective readers who have either studied a STEM degree (escpecially biology-related) or read many (pop) science books. This book is indeed about evolution and animals which is Dawkins' expertise, yet all the other science and theories he explains like the central dogma of molecular biology or the evolution of eucaryotic cells should already be pretty familar to such readers.Last warning: Especially in the second half of the book I found his ideas and writing to be lengthy - the length of the book no longer feflt justified. This is just a thing to keep in mind.Recommended to readers who are interested in the evolution of biodiversity and who have not read many other pop-science books about evolution, molecular biology, Earth history and archaelogy.

241,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116652-punk,3,"Non-Fiction. 4 billion years of evolution, practically in real time. To avoid any ""human-centrism,"" Dawkins -- famous for his outspoken stance against creationism -- does this backwards and models the journey on Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. Scared yet? Well, it's not in rhyme or Old English, but Dawkins does tend toward lofty language and wild, rambling digressions. It bugged me at first, but over the course of this SIX HUNDRED PAGE BOOK, I got used to it and even grew to appreciate Dawkins and his sly humor. He actually made me laugh out loud a couple times.The pilgrimage conceit holds up: we travel backwards in time to meet a series of common ancestors, starting with concestor 1 (for ""common ancestor""), where mankind splits from the chimpanzees, and ending with concestor 39, the first life on Earth. At each stop he describes what that ancestor may have looked like, where it lived, and how long ago.The Chaucer conceit never got off the ground. Most tales, like ""The Armadillo's Tale,"" don't tell you anything about the animal the tale's dedicated to. There are a few exceptions to this, though, like ""The Beaver's Tale"" or ""The Brine Shrimp's Tale."" Those actually address the qualities of the animal in question, and were some of my favorites because of it.One of the best things about this book is that Dawkins freely admits -- early and often -- that a lot of what he's talking about is based on limited data and/or guesswork and may be wrong. He goes out of his way to offer alternate theories and differing opinions, though he always singles out the position he finds most likely. I love it when scientists admit they don't know things, and Dawkins has no problem with that. He can sound arrogant and in love with his own voice (the number of times he quotes himself and his previous books!!!), but at heart I think he really loves the subject and wants to share it with people. It's a long, and sometimes difficult, book to read. It gets into genetics, math, biology, taxonomy, chemistry, pretty much everything, and at times the explanations get messy or too technical. I liked the biology parts best -- the different ways organisms evolve and why, and there was plenty of that to keep me interested. It's a lot of information, though still a very basic look at the diversity of life. I started out reading it like homework -- 10-20 pages a day -- but after I got the hang of it, I was reading 30 and 40 pages without breaking a sweat. Did I enjoy it? I think so? I definitely know a little bit about a LOT of things now, and it made me want to read more about evolution.Three stars for the book and the information it provides, and FIVE stars for me for making it through."
242,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10781757-otherwyrld,4,"I approached a book of this size and scope with some trepidation (seriously, you could kill someone if you hit them over the head with the hardback edition), how could this possibly cover the whole history of life on Earth. I also note that I have had issues in the past with the authors writing style, which can run to the overly verbose to my taste, as well as the huge hype over his anti religion stand that tends to get a lot more publicity than his actual books do.So, on the whole this monumental work succeeds admirably, notwithstanding my above mentioned misgivings. This book takes us on a journey from our most recent ancestors backwards to meet shared ancestors (or concestors as the author describes them) along the way, a la The Canterbury Tales, with the ultimate goal being the beginnings of life itself. Along the way the author tells numerous tales in the same way as Geoffrey Chaucer did to illustrate various points. In some ways these are both the best and the worst parts of the book, as this is where the authors writing style flourishes the most. The more straightforward descriptions of the species/genus (etc) that we encounter are easier to read though often quite dry and highly technical.There is a large prologue which looks at the history of hominids before it heads to the first rendezvous with Chimpanzees, then Gorillas, Orangutan and the rest of the primates in turn. This section alone takes up a third of the book, and mammals as a whole takes up half. This leaves little room for the rest of the species, with only insects taking up a large section in the rest of the book. Plants are particularly sidelined, which is a shame because it makes the book rather lopsided though I can understand racing through some sections because there really is very little to say about them. It did make the latter third of the book drag a little bit though and I slogged through to the end. The author wisely keeps his religious digs to a minimum, though he can't resist it the whole time. I can't really talk about the co-author as his voice doesn't really come through that much. The book has some nice colour plates to illustrate some of the species discussed, but the line illustrations leave a bit to be desired. mostly because they were shrunk too much to fit into the paperback edition. The overall idea of a fractal design for the various rendezvous' was a nice touch, and there is an extensive bibliography if you want to explore further. "
243,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,4,"Here's an ambitious bet: to tell the story of life on Earth as an odyssey, a pilgrimage backward in time. The approach is indeed original as, reading this book is like boarding a time machine where at each chapter we meet one of our ancestors -that Dawkins describes, showing in which ways its anatomy or way of life can serve a better understanding of why we are what we are. 40 ancestors are thus passing us by, from primates to mammals in general, vertebrates, invertebrates and, all the way until the unicellular organisms.Each encounter is also the occasion for a digression (a 'tale') on topics ranging from fossils conversation and datation, bipedalism, sex, the notion of 'race' or, again, the shaping of some organs. He even dares to defend (although not dogmatically) the 'primeval soup' hypothesis! (well...)A big book, those qualities are strangely enough also the bad points. The topic is indeed so vast that, some chapters are obviously more captivating than others, making it an hard and challenging read during the passages dealing with those ancestors that don't interest you that much. Yet, always a great populariser Dawkins delivers here one of the most thoughtful and complete story of life on Earth. Huge! "
244,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3744803-chris,5,"Richard Dawkins is the best writer on the topic of evolution that I have encountered. He is able to explain concepts in such a way as to make them easily understandable. All of the books that I have read by Dawkins have been very informative and entertaining as well. The Ancestor's Tale is a cleverly structured book in which Dawkins takes the reader on a journey chronologically back in time through our evolutionary history. Each successive chapter is the next branch of our evolutionary tree where Homo sapiens merges with our next most recent kin. The book cleverly mimics Chaucer's Canterbury Tales wherein each new member of the group tells a story. In The Ancestor's Tale, each of these ""tales"" is told by one of the species that we are joining with in the current branch. The story is always about some aspect of evolution that is pertinent in some way to the species telling the tale.  The Ancestor's Tale is the best book that I have read on evolution up to this point and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in this subject."
245,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70965168-youp,5,"Recently I've been on somewhat of a Dawkins reading-spree. He is at his best when focussing on evolutionary biology as much as possible, and on religion the least amount possible. The Ancestor's Tale consists almost exclusively of evolution and biology related content, and Dawkins does an amazing job of taking his reader on an epic journey.While I was fascinated by the concept of a journey backwards through time, meeting fellow lifeforms on the major forks of evolution, the execution could have failed in numerous ways. Fortunately, Dawkins delivers a captivating story from the very first chapter, and unfailingly continues to amaze until the last page. Not only does the author explain important branch-offs on the evolutionary tree; he describes the modern day features of our distant cousins in a way that creates a new found appreciation for the almost magical power of natural selection. The Ancestor's Tale is incredibly original, brilliantly written and covers a huge amount of terrority while providing enough depth to continually amaze."

Dawkins guides us along on the greatest pilgrimage ever to the dawn of evolution in a style reminiscent of The Canterbury Tales. Through different tales told by organisms we rendezvous along the way, he manages to introduce a plethora of biological wonders, ethical considerations, scientific thinking and philosophy. A must, must read for everyone- especially those with a passion for nature and life sciences. "

Slightly cheapened by a few brief but unnecessary political comments. Jabs at religion are to be expected with a Dawkins book, but unless directly addressing creationist claims, also unnecessary.

The several interweaving tales of our ancestor (or cousin) species -- for instance, the fascinating evolution of the whale -- provides a fresh, breathing narrative to what could have been a very dry book.

259,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84660-swankivy,4,"This doorstopper of a book was a lot more fun than you might think, considering the subject matter. Richard Dawkins has a certain way of telling stories that makes them palatable even when, like me, you aren't exactly learned in the subject. I wouldn't say I'm ignorant about the topic at hand, and I have certainly known better since middle school than to perceive evolution as if it's ""humans evolved from modern apes,"" but I learned a heck of a lot of stuff here. In between all the little stories about creatures I'd often never heard of and occasional anecdotes about Dawkins's personal experiences and relationships with other scientists, there were tales of discovery, of archaeological and biological history, and of how nature works. Even though it did feel a tad long and drawn out for me, now at the end of the road I think I appreciated that it took its time, with a leisurely feel that made every encounter with another ""concestor"" feel important enough to give time to.I would like to share some specific individual thoughts and quotes on the book here.I liked Dawkins's discussion of evolution not being a concept of other beings on their way to becoming us. They weren't unfinished when they were alive, just like modern animals today aren't unfinished because they're not us and none of us are unfinished because one day our descendants will be different from us.I enjoyed the explanation of why we all have one ancestor, as impossible as that sounds, because of DNA's existence. If there were other types of creatures before DNA's ""birth"" that replicated a different way, they left no descendants because every creature alive today has DNA, and if there were later ones coming into existence, they'd immediately be eaten by bacteria.DNA is compared to telegrams and I liked that analogy very much. It's because they have to use the same letters that make up meaningful words to also indicate pauses, like STOP, and DNA has that situation too how its codes are run end to end, with some junk here and there. A cool factoid: If you find a population that's been isolated for X years, then you know the common ancestor WE have with them can't be younger than that. An alien looking at human and gibbon genitals would think the males are more related to each other than they are to the females of their own species. If we interpret based only on physical factors that look similar, we may be making the same mistake.There's some cool info about color vision and how some old-world monkeys are primarily color blind but some females have color vision. It was all explained really neatly.Richard Dawkins had a pet bushbaby as a kid and sometimes it would pee on him from above. Just throwing that out there.I like how he discusses the uncertainty of his branches, how recently evidence he's using was developed and how accepted it is, and the fact that new evidence may change where certain creatures join the ancestor pilgrimage.There was a good discussion of the meaning of ""primitive"" with regard to whether a species is primitive in one way and therefore primitive in another (""primitive"" means ""resembling the ancestor""). A good quote that sums it up: ""There is no substance called Essence of Antiquity that pervades the blood and soaks into the bones.""There's a really good metaphor about a bobbing cork as an explanation of overall trends in evolution. If you tracked it over time and saw that it was going toward the east, you know that looking back, but if you just analyzed its movements as it bobs up and down and gets tossed around in the ocean, you couldn't necessarily say where it will end up based on such small movements.Sometimes Dawkins would just throw out a comparison that would come out of nowhere and be funny. Case in point: ""Capable of swallowing a medium-sized lawyer whole.""There's a really well-explained section on how evolution is continuous and the categories between species are pretty artificial. No parent was a different species from their child, and a time machine taking people back a thousand years at a time should result in arriving at a population each could interbreed with. Overall of course, they're evolving, but there's no distinct time where you can say ""the parent was X; the child is Y."" Kind of like when you're warming up your bath water, there's not really a specific degree where you'd say the water is no longer warm but hot. A quote: ""More than once I have seen a reference to the larval sea squirt which, when the time comes, settles down to a sedentary life and 'eats its brain, like an associate professor getting tenure.'""Starfish, by the way, are really weird. Eeuuuwww.The Grasshopper's Tale discussed human ""races"" in association with how grasshoppers kinda have races based on what their song sounds like, and how they tend not to mate with different races, but will if you do something to make their song different. I was kinda irritated with how he digressed into some oversimplified or flat-out misleading representations of how race works. First off, he claimed people are asked to check one of 5 race boxes on forms, and offered ""Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, Native American, and Other"" as the choices. If I see boxes like these, they invariably include Asian and/or Pacific Islanders. Which is weird because he mentions Asians in the same topic. But then he goes on to say that mixed-race doesn't have its own name, offering ""Blue has a name. Green has a name. Blue-green does not."" Yes it does? Lots of blue-green mixtures have names, like turquoise. He goes on to say Affirmative Action isn't FAIR because it assumes an individual is being repaid for wrongs done to his ancestors. This seems a crass oversimplification and sadly pretty typical of privileged white dudes, especially since he probably should be well aware enough of social factors to realize that the legacy of slavery and other terrible events and trends affecting people of color are still resulting in those populations experiencing prejudice and poverty on a much higher level than whites do. Affirmative Action acknowledges that to get the same opportunities, disadvantaged populations have to come a longer distance from farther away (overall, as a population; obviously there are individual white people who are more disadvantaged on some axes than individual people of color, but this deals with an overall phenomenon, not with exceptions to the trend). Affirmative Action was not invented specifically as a reparations measure. It acknowledges CURRENT disadvantages that come from living in poverty and almost definitely having decisions about your life being made by racists who don't know they're racist but make racist decisions. Those racist decisions may sound less like ""his dark skin is ugly to me, so I'm not giving him a job"" but more like ""he speaks like a typical black person, which to my white ears has become synonymous with uneducated and rough; therefore I perceive him as not being as professional, or perhaps assume my customers will conclude that and therefore I will hire a person who speaks like me."" We'll pretend it's not about race but about readiness and deservingness of the job, but if someone's natural hair or accent or style of dress automatically makes us think less of them or makes us expect them to separate themselves from norms of their community to be acceptable to ours, those are racist perspectives. Those are the kinds of things Affirmative Action is attempting to counteract. Though for the record that program helps more white women than anyone, and we women contend with prejudices surrounding our competence, our ability to do certain types of work, and our likelihood of abandoning the career to make or care for babies. Anyway.Richard Dawkins demonstrated he does not know what Affirmative Action is for. Next.A quote: ""The third school of thought is, in my opinion, bonkers. Or, to use more parliamentary language, wildly and irresponsibly unrealistic."" Haha.He made a Philip Pullman reference and that made me happy. I was thinking about mufela from The Amber Spyglass when Dawkins started discussing microscopic creatures that evolved the only known natural wheel, and then he mentioned it too.I thought it was pretty awesome that toward the end of the book Dawkins went into detail about how evolution itself can evolve--that creatures who are better at evolving may have a better chance of survival, so therefore evolution's processes themselves can be improved through evolution.A final quote to close out my review: ""This pilgrimage has been a trip, not just in the literal sense, but in the countercultural sense I met when a young man in California in the 1960s. The most potent hallucinogen on sale in Haight or Ashbury or telegraph Avenue would be tame by comparison. If it's amazement you want, the real world has it all."""
260,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4568480-giuseppe-d,5,"Not even sure where to start on this one, it was a very exciting backwards journey from our species to the very origin of life, which probably looked nothing like what we call alive nowadays but rather just a self replicating organic molecule, nothing more than that.But this book is just as much about evolution as it is about other fields in biology such as zoology, comparative anatomy, genetics, phylogenetics, embryology, neuroscience.For instance, how are new genes introduced into a genome? Well, it turns out that 'new genes aren't added to the genome out of thin air. They originate as duplicates of older genes. Then, over evolutionary time, they go to their separate ways by mutation, selection and drift.'Or other interesting facts, like that the closest living relatives of hippos are whales!Or how we sometimes forget that our way of perceiving the world is not the only one. Playtpuses, for example, 'have about 40000 electrical sensors distributed [...] over both surfaces of the bill.' They use these electrical sensors to perceive the weak electric fields generated by their prey (while the prey use its muscles to move around).We also discover how many times gliding and flight have separately evolved as examples of convergent evolution. And how places like Australia and New Zeland, due to their historic isolation, provide cases for explaining how the evolution of species there is quite analogous to what happened in other parts of the world with each one occupying their own niche.I want to end this review with a citation that sums up why you should read this book: 'not only is life on this planet amazing, and deeply satisfying to all whose senes have not become dulled by familiarity: the very fact that we have evolved the brain power to understand our evolutionary genesis redoubles this amazement and compounds the satisfaction.' "
261,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4551268-sara-g,5,"This beautiful book was really captivating. I like Dawkins a lot, but I know he comes off as really abrasive to many people. In this book, though, rather than constantly being on the attack, he's describing the beauties and wonders of the natural world. I like his softer side.It's written in the form of a pilgrimage (like the Canterbury Tales), back to our most distant ancestors. It's human-centric for no reason other than relatability. Dawkins takes pains to mention that a similar pilgrimage could be focused on any living species today. He pauses at key moments in our evolutionary history to discuss our relationship with what he calls ""concestors"" - shared ancestors with other species on Earth. It's fascinating stuff, but very dense in places. My favorite part was the discussion about how life may have arisen on Earth and the ""RNA World"" origin theory, which I was previously unfamiliar with. This is why I read good popular science. The science I learned in school is painfully outdated. I've added quite a few books to my TBR based on Dawkins's recommendations and references here. This book isn't for everyone, but for someone with a decent scientific background, I think you could gain a lot.End note - I keep going back to the description of a Douglas Adams Doctor Who script mentioned in this book, where a time traveler keeps going back in time to weep for the dodos before they became extinct. I love this imagery."
262,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/362402-snehal-bhagat,5,"Political economy basics are often explained with the help of an analogy: we imagine a beach in summer with people sun-bathing; for the sake of simplicity, we assume that the beach is one-dimensional- a straight line running from left to right- and that the people are distributed approximately equidistant from each other. An enterprising ice-cream vendor comes along with his cart and sets up shop - where should he position himself if he desires to maximize his sales?Clearly, anywhere; for as long as he has a monopoly, people will walk from all over the beach to buy his product. For purposes of illustration, we imagine him settling somewhere near the extreme right of the beach. Now, should a second vendor selling ice-cream come onto the scene, and discover that people will buy ice-cream from the vendor closest to them, where must she position herself? Obviously she should set shop adjacent to the first vendor, but slightly to his left; she can then maximize her sales by cornering the bulk of the market. The loss of sales then forces the first vendor to move his cart to the left of vendor two and the jostling continues; it is straightforward to see that in a few iterations, both vendors end up next to each other close to the center of the beach in their bid to maximize their sales. The fictitious beach, of course represents a political issue, the bathers are the voters and the vendors the political parties; the goal is to maximize votes instead of sales (1). The first case represents a dictatorship, the second the two-party democracy; in the latter, over time, both parties grow to resemble each other as they take up near-identical stances on most issues, often differing only in semantics. Unless, that is, the two parties vary in their assessment of how voter preferences are distributed on an issue - if one party believes they are clumped more to the left, while the other believes the majority leans to the right, sharp divisions can occur, as is the case here in Australia where our (effectively) two-party system in federal politics is now polarized over a proposed carbon ETS.Exit political economy, enter evolutionary biology; for this is where the analogy ends. Whereas ice-cream vendors and political parties are prepared to move to maximize sales and votes on the basis of their assumptions about the distribution of bodies and voters, creationists and evolutionists are camped firmly on either end of the belief scale; both sides preach only to their respective choirs, and it is not clear why. The distribution of people with regards to their belief varies, but it is safe to say that most are either mildly agnostic or mild believers; and yet, it is the strong views that color the debate and polarize opinions - for the creationists the evolutionists shall join Darwin in hell and pay for their lack of faith, and for the evolutionists, creationism is good for a laugh, or two, but for little else. Dawkins appears to be at the forefront of the rather acrimonious debate and draws more than his fair share of the creationists' ire (2). Which is a shame, really, for just as Chomsky's political writings have the unfortunate consequence of discounting - or at least distracting from - his brilliant work as a linguist, so too do Dawkins' views on God and religion prevent many from acknowledging his stellar contribution to our understanding of nature, and of our place in it. It may seem surprising that there even is a debate, in light of all the evidence, but the problem is that in a game-theoretic sense, religion 'plays' first, during the early formative years of children and thus enjoys a distinctive first-mover advantage, because science, to which the child is exposed only in school, plays a late second; nor do the oft-dull and dreary textbook treatments of science help advance its cause. This is precisely where leading scientific intellectuals such as Dawkins have so much to offer, and which he does admirably here, as always.To the premise of the book then: we may not all have descendants, but we all have an unbroken line of ancestors - each of whom survived long enough to reach child-bearing age and pass on their genes - fighting off predators, battling disease and natural disasters in the process; which is a fascinating thought, made even more so to consider that all that adventure does not lie merely in the human part of our evolutionary history. The journey Dawkins undertakes in this book then, is to track our shared ancestry - not merely that of every human being, but that of every single living creature - all the way back to four billion years to build a family tree that extends over hundreds of millions of great-grandparents. And yet by no means is this a Handbuch of sorts on speciation, rather, it is a delightful elucidation on the workings of evolution, a 'Who do you think you are?' on a scale that has absolutely no parallel: This is the book of life.(1) Establishing themselves close to the median of the voter preferences on just one axis does not of itself translate into votes- for that the voter preference on each issue and the weight of importance attached to it by the voter needs to be aggregated. (2) This polarization manifests itself in unexpected ways; in a recent ABC interview of Dawkins by Andrew Denton, for instance. Mindful, perhaps, of the consequences of appearing empathetic to his subject's views and alienating the conservatives among his viewers, the otherwise immensely capable Denton was unable to set a consistent tone for the program by committing himself to either a friendly or hostile line of questioning, which made for some extremely uneasy viewing. "
263,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,5,"A tour de force by a great teacherThe conceit here is to imagine that we can go backward in time to when our linage split off from some other branch, say to when the evolutionary line that has led to Homo sapiens split off from the line that has led to chimpanzees. That would be Dawkins's Rendezvous point #1 on page 100 which took place about six million years ago.Like the characters in Chaucer's ""Canterbury Tales,"" we are pilgrims traveling toward a spot, not in geography, but in time; and along the way we meet up with other pilgrims, eventually with all of life's creatures until we are gathered together in Rendezvous #39 where we meet our most distant relatives, the eubacteria. At each rendezvous point there is a ""concestor,"" the common ancestor of all the lines of creatures that are now joined. Thus Concestor 1 was the ""250,000-greats-grandparent"" of both humans and chimpanzees. What Dawkins does at each point is to imagine what the concestor might have been like. Thus Concestor 1 would be an ape probably more like a chimpanzee than a human, a hairy ape that probably didn't walk upright, etc.Prior to Rendezvous 1 there is Rendezvous 0 in which all of humankind meets together with the humans that went out of Africa 30,000(?) years ago.At each of the rendezvous points there are tales, as in Chaucer's work. There is ""The Tasmanian's Tale"" in which it is related how the Tasmanian people were slaughtered. There is ""Eve's Tale"" in which we learn about mitochondrial DNA which is passed exclusively from mother to daughter. And later there are tales from the duckbilled platypus, the lungfish, the grasshopper, the redwood tree, etc. In each of these tales Dawkins, in his inimitable manner, focuses on some aspect of evolutionary biology and illuminates it for the reader. Some of the tales are difficult, but most are easy to read and fascinating to follow.One of the strengths of this book is in the clear and engaging way that Dawkins presents the material and his forthright expression, and his honest way of separating what is his informed opinion from that of a scientific consensus. One thing I have always admired about Dawkins is his ability to be candid about what he knows and what he doesn't, and his courage in expressing unpopular opinions.The question is, should the general reader buy this book and invest the time and effort in following Dawkins's pilgrimage? For those familiar with the great evolutionary biologist's work, this question answers itself. A new book by Richard Dawkins is an event to be celebrated. For others who want to learn something about evolution from one of its foremost experts (and celebrities, by the way) this book is highly recommended. The sheer expanse of Mr. Dawkins's knowledge and his infectious enthusiasm will inform and delight the reader. I suspect that most readers will learn more about how evolution works from this single book than from almost any other that I have read, and that includes works by such illuminati as Stephen Jay Gould, Ernst Mayr, and Edward O. Wilson. Incidentally, I believe that The Ancestor's Tale is a better read for most people than Gould's monumental The Structure of Evolutionary Theory (2002) if only because it is more accessible and less technical--not to mention about 750 pages shorter!Some quibbles: I think Dawkins overrates sexual selection in bringing about evolutionary change in some cases, e.g., in bipedalism, and in the growth of the human brain (cf. Geoffrey Miller in The Mating Mind (2000)). It seems to me that natural selection had to be the driving force in something so felicitous as freeing our arms to carry and to work, and in the development of something so expensive and radical as a greatly oversized brain.I also think that his idea to identify the lake, for example, created by the beaver, as part of the extended phenotype of the beaver is going a bit too far. I prefer to think of the lake as part of the beaver's ""culture,"" and the behavior that created the lake as part of the phenotype of the beaver. Our airplanes and computers are part of our culture. Our ability to make them is part of our phenotype. (For Dawkins's full expression on this topic see The Extended Phenotype (1982).)Here are a couple of examples of Dawkins's entertaining and elegant style: Referring to the fall of the dinosaurs, he facetiously imagines that Shelley's celebrated poem, ""Ozymandias,"" which mocked the vainglorious works of kings, was entitled ""Ode to a Dinosaur."" Indeed, how the mighty have fallen. (p. 255) Talking about a sea squirt larva which gives up its mobile life to become sedentary (with attendant changes in neurological form), Dawkins remarks, ""...when the time comes, [it] settles down to a sedentary life and 'eats its brain, like an associate professor getting tenure.'"" (p. 370) One of the best parts of the book, not to be missed, is the concluding chapter, ""The Host's Return"" in which Dawkins talks about re-running evolution. He speculates on which adaptations might and might not be returned. Certainly flight, which has evolved independently some 40 to 50 times would be seen again. But would the ""swollen"" human brain and the development of syntactic language evolve again?Although Dawkins has addressed the so-called argument from design many times, I don't think he has ever demonstrated its paucity more eloquently and succinctly than he does beginning on page 549 where he calls it the ""Argument from Personal Incredulity."" His point is that to say something must have been designed because it is so complex really says ""less about nature than about the poverty...[of the speaker's] imagination."" On page 602 he adds, ""Ultimately design cannot explain anything because there is an inevitable regression to the problem of the origin of the designer.""And finally I have a question for Professor Dawkins: why are there no viruses among the pilgrims? --Dennis Littrell, author of “Understanding Evolution and Ourselves”"
264,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85772714-wil-c-fry,5,"Bottom line: I learned from this book, and that's the primary reason I read non-fiction. Additionally, I was fascinated, engaged, and in a few cases blown away. With apologies to Richard Dawkins (and Geoffrey Chaucer), I didn't much enjoy the format, but this is a minor complaint. It just felt forced and artificial the way Dawkins attempted to squeeze his story into the series of ""tales"" as an homage to The Canterbury Tales. Otherwise, the entire book was enjoyable.Beginning at the present, renowned scientist Dawkins takes the reader on a reverse journey through time, tracing humanity's evolutionary past through a series of ""rendezvous"" with other animal species (and larger groups). For the most part ignoring extinct species, the tale looks for branching-off points (speciation events); for example, the most recent about 6 million years ago when we last shared an ancestor with chimpanzees. Each rendezvous is accompanied by a helpful graphic showing how far back the story has gone, which animal groups are ""joining"" us on our ""pilgrimage"", and which geological eras/epochs are involved.The Selfish Gene remains my favorite Dawkins book, but this one is powerful in its own right."
265,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30987-justine,5,"I don't get to use the word masterpiece much, but The Ancestor's Tale really was a masterpiece and a love letter to life on earth, the study of it, and evolution. Dawkins mirrors the Canterbury Tales framework*, with us as a species going on a pilgrimage back in time to meet the common ancestors we share with each of the other species on earth, all the way back to the first life form that came out of some kind of primordial soup. Along the way, each pilgrim we meet tells a story that elucidates the process, theories, and methods of study behind evolution. It was a dense and aggressive read, but also one that brims with Dawkins' fascination and love for his subject. His ability to communicate his wonder for the world and the scientific process through which we understand it is full of self-reflection, candor, and optimism. I feel better about humanity knowing he is in it. I try to read one ambitious book a year, and this is it***Christ (haha) he is such a genius **Or a carry over from last year.... because I suck at reading hard things right now."

Wilson (to name a few) will revel in the way that Dawkins journeys from the tip of the branch (modern man) to the trunk of the tree at the beginning of all life on earth. Each waypoint in the journey is a junction at which another branch of life rejoins ours on the way to the trunk at life's earliest moment, and is an opportunity for Dawkins to explore nearly every aspect of the way science has categorized, discovered, studied and theorized upon the vast diversity of beings that do and have inhabited our planet.

This is not meant in a pejorative way, rather as his way of approaching and interpreting (biological) evolution. His skills have amazed me, I learnt and understood a lot. He did not only describe processes but he also offered and presented methodologies how scientists look for/check (possible) answers, so it is an insight into their work - to remind the ones who might say: ""what they know/how they can know it!?"" - so now, I know. The mere size of a book (around 700 pages) tells you that this is not for ""fastfood"" thinkers, that it requires your attention and dedication to know, however its content is magnificent as well. How can I know it? I got to R. Dawkins through various sources and channels which prize him pretty much. Plus, I am aware that when he touches uncharted areas it is his challenge how to try to answer difficult questions - however not based on ""emotional"" and ""opinion"" ground but on facts and data (this comment is more for people who know a bit how science/scientists work)... So, if you want to challenge your imagination, if you want to learn and know something fabulous and fascinating about life, open this book and read it thoroughly! The book has been my extraordinary experience.The book is still in mind mind consuming my attention. It behaves as a Siren anchor bringing me back to its topic, it has showed me the life and lives. "

278,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324264-john,5,"""The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution"" is a beguiling literary trek through the taxonomy and history of life on Planet Earth; one that's led with ample eloquence by eminent evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins. In this vast tome Dawkins has crafted what is indeed the popular scientific equivalent of Chaucer's ""The Canterbury Tales"", taking us along a long journey back to the dawn of life itself, approximately 4 billion years ago, via a molecular phylogeny designed by his former undergraduate student Yan Wong. But it's a long, long trek that's quite unlikely to be viewed as tedious by the reader. Here, Dawkins is truly at his most expansive, using this taxonomy to discuss the compelling issues of contemporary evolutionary theory and history, in which he covers everything from genetics, speciation, convergent evolution and mass extinctions to microevolution, sexual selection, biogeography, and the relevance of plate tectonics to past and current biogeographic distributions of organisms. Relying on Wong's intricate molecular phylogeny, Dawkins takes us along to forty branching points - previous geological moments - in that phylogeny, where we meet the ""concestor"" - the last common ancestor - of all organisms at that very point. It is a quite compelling, often insightful, narrative that Dawkins admits does owe much to Chaucer's legendary ""The Canterbury Tales"". Dawkins doesn't hesitate to interrupt the relentless ebb and flow of his narrative in a series of individual ""tales"", that are designed illustrate some unique trait of a given species, and then, by mere extension, serve as the jumping off point(s) for riveting discussions on some aspect(s) of modern evolutionary biology. A classic example is the section that he devotes to the sauropsids, which consists of lizard-like and dinosaur-like (archosaurs, including birds) reptiles in the chapter entitled ""Rendezvous 16"". In the first of these tales, ""The Galapagos Finch's Tale"", Dawkins recounts the decades-long fieldwork of ecologists Peter and Rosemary Grant who have been studying microevolution in the Galapagos Finches. He focuses upon the aftermath of a severe drought in 1977 that led inevitably to sharp declines in the populations of several species, observing that those individuals in the dominant species, Geospiza fortis, who were only 5 percent larger than their peers, were the ones who survived; a classic example of ""a small episode of natural selection in action, during a single year."" Within the same species, the Grants and their coworkers observed selection pressures resulting not only in larger body size, but also in larger beak size too. In the chapter's next tale, ""The Peacock's Tale"", Dawkins emphasizes the importance of sexual selection, arguing persuasively that it may have had a role in shaping the course of human evolution, perhaps via preferential selection of females for ""smarter"" males. That is followed, in turn, by ""The Dodo's Tale"", in which Dawkins discusses not only the Dodo's extinction, but also the tendency towards flightlessness in bird species inhabiting remote oceanic islands. While Dawkins has crafted a most compelling narrative in this vast book, ""The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution"", is far from perfect, especially in its depiction of the fossil record. Much to my amazement, he doesn't discuss the existence of long-term stasis in the fossil record, predicted by the theory of punctuated equilibria, which has been substantiated by decades of extensive fieldwork by paleobiologists, ever since the publication of the classic 1972 paper coauthored by noted American paleobiologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould (This is a rather peculiar omission since Dawkins has been a staunch critic of punctuated equilibria.). Nor does he discuss, except only in passing, the diverse, radical differences in the compositions of marine faunas during, respectively, the Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras, which have been noted for decades due to excellent fieldwork, and more recently, by excellent statistical modeling done by paleontologist Jack Sepkoski and his colleagues at the University of Chicago. And he also misses the important history of predator-prey interactions that form much of coevolution, which has been discussed admirably elsewehere by noted marine ecologist Geerat Vermeij. But, in retrospect, my criticisms of Dawkins' omissions are relatively minor, simply because he has accomplished successfully, the arduous task of making both the taxonomy and history of life a most beguiling tale. Without question, ""The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution"", should be regarded for a long time as one of the classics of popular evolutionary biology literature.

279,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28305884-maryann-glotzer,3,"I've always been interested in evolution and thought it would be interesting to read a book that could catch me up on all the new information since my last Anthro class 50 years ago. This book actually did a good job of that. Unfortunately, the author does use footnotes but he also has to tell you how he knows the scientist. The discovered was the author's student, professor, mentor, fishing buddy! There is lots of information if you can handle the pretentious tone."
280,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45815668-jordan-penney,2,"Dawkins does a good job of summarizing basic college Biology and the concept of natural selection. He generally oversteps his bounds in critiquing religion, and he also adheres to plenty of beliefs that could easily be used to give credit to religion, obviously something he was not trying to do. In general, I would say that Dawkins' attempt at Logos was often very rocky, but it is easy to see his love of Darwin, whom he so desperately clings to as his main source of Ethos legitimacy. The whole thing was only slightly more entertaining than a textbook, and I fell asleep many times trying to finish it. I won't be reading it again, that's for certain, I want to keep my sanity."
281,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100956678-jon-golan,5,"A visionary title - I wrote many essays on its various subjects. The premise is clever and executed flawlessly. A great introduction to zoology and bio as a whole (if you know bio, you may skip some parts)."
282,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9199325-stefan-matei,5,"Geneticists tell us that every single person on Earth is at the least 50th cousins with every other person on Earth. On a broader scale two closely related species can be considered cousins; and it is this broad sense of the word ""cousin"" I'd like to make use of below.Throughout his tales Dawkins exposes the attempts to coexist between cousins in an ever changing habitat. As it turns out, these involuntary attempts sometimes succeed, resulting in complex symbiotic relationships, and sometimes they end up taking whole species out of existence. But they are always an evolutionary arms race for survival. As our pilgrimage advances back in time, we meet more and more cousins converging at each rendezvous point. I call it ""our"" pilgrimage although, as Dawkins puts it, this journey could have started from the point of view of any other existing species. At Rendezvous Point 1 we, human pilgrims, join our evolutionary cousins, chimpanzees and bonobos. We shall later meet other mammals, followed by the other vertebrates, invertebrates, all the way back to meeting our chlorophyll dependent cousins, the plants. Although the journey back in time will have many stops with unfamiliar Latin sounding names, Dawkins does a great job of always keeping you updated and clear about where you are along the pilgrimage -- you know... just in case you don't have a doctorate in zoology. At each rendezvous point, the author recounts interesting tales concerning the cousin animals which are about to join the band of pilgrims. Every newly recruited species, genus or family has its own peculiar features, often ones that are relevant to our human anatomy or otherwise interesting for humans.After a total of 40 Rendezvous Points our pilgrimage culminates with the eubacteria, the ancestor of all surviving organisms. ""The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Life"" is a history of life, a history of life going backwards in the form of an epic pilgrimage. Along the way, any of our cousin pilgrims can tell a tale. And it's those tales that form the main substance of the book. "
283,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4803593-alisia,5,"Finally!!I think I spent more time with this book than any other in recent years...a solid six weeks. That's not to say it was boring or hard to get through, quite the opposite. I enjoyed slowly savoring the massive amount of information up for offer in this tome. Richard Dawkins' is a prolific author, and it took me a while to decide which of his books to read first. This one has been sitting on my shelf for about a year, and I finally picked it up to read concurrently with a Genetics and Evolution class that I am taking via Coursera. It was a splendid idea.Dawkins tends to go on and on about the craziness of religion, but thankfully that was mostly absent in this book. I like to focus on the topic at hand, without the jests and jeers at those with a different view. And the topic at hand in The Ancestor's Tale is an over-arching tale of evolution on this planet, going backwards in time (from a human perspective), all the way back to the origin of life. More than anything, Dawkin's vast knowledge of zoology shines, and I learned more than I ever thought I could in one month about the variety of life on this planet, and how they have evolved to be so darn interesting. His modeling of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales lends itself very well to the subject, and was a great method of (non-fiction) storytelling.As it was written ten years previously, one thought must accompany the reader. Evolutionary biology, genetics, molecular studies....these fields are constantly changing, with on-going innovations and new developments. Therefore, you must read a book like this with an eye to the present, and new research. For example, since Ancestor's Tale was published, a complete Neandertal genome was sequenced, and a few of Dawkins' statements are somewhat out-dated and not supported by recent findings. The same holds true for the molecular clock, and calculating the rendezvous points with various ancestors. I would love to see an updated edition of The Ancestor's Tale published at some point."
284,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3277375-charles-bond,5,"Great History of evolution! My favorite of Dawkins' books, because it processes every little peice of information, leaving no rock unturned. Being 700 or so pages it took me a while to finish it, but my hours were not wasted. It goes through every known evolutionary split from us now, to billions of years ago with some of the first life on earth. It covers the full spread of biological diversity and the different inventions of nature, like how a Platypus uses electromagnetic waves to detect small animals, or how much brain power the nose of a mole uses, with it's powerful sense of smell and touch. It covers sensitive concepts like race, gender, religion, and politics. Not claiming that science has power over all those things, but stating that there are biological advantages and disadvantages to things like sexual dimorphism,race, arms races, and religion. For those who turn down this book due to a motivation from their religion, I will let you know now this is not a religion bashing book. If your looking for that kind of thing this isn't it, it simply states the long history of life as we know it, while in the sidelines having small lessons about carbon dating, DNA, and sexual and asexual reproduction. This is a must read for anyone who pursues knowledge in the field of biology and who has ever pondered on the order in which life has diversified, although being so incredibly long I will suggest that you don't start reading until you have a lot of spare time, as it is best not to space out your reads as I did, so that you can retain more of the information."
285,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11678700-johan,4,"While parts of this book boil down to the long list of older and older latin ancestor names and some of their traits that is the premise of the book, some of its little forays into random tangents still make it a pretty inspiring read.An interesting factoid that never occurred to me, for instance: if we'd ever manage to burn all the fossil fuels and other biomass that did not get fully decomposed and recycled, we would no longer have an oxygen atmosphere, but revert to the reducing carbon-dioxide atmosphere we had prior to the advent of cyanobacteria.It's kind of fascinating that every breath of oxygen you or anyone else ever took has been manufactured from other materials by a plant somewhere, not just once, but once for each time it was ever burned in the metabolism of whatever animal breathed it in. Like pretty much all of Dawkins books, these little parentheticals pop up every now and then. Also, which may be the main draw of his books, he helps you think and reason about science and facts, pursue thought experiments, highlight thought traps and dead-ends, slips and over-simplifications, rather than just serve you fully packaged and pre-digested data."
286,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15711196-cesare-borgia,3,"I only give this extremely long winded book a three star rating 'cause out of all of Richard Dawkins' books I've read so far, this has some educational value. I find him extremely tedious, arrogant, pretentious and the fact that when pressed on the question of creation he'll negate the concept of God but will embrace some weird ""Alien genetic intervention"" just rubs me the wrong way. Great poster boy for atheism and anti-theism, scientifically speaking he's got the lingo down and at times he can be mildly amusing, but much like Charles Darwin before him, too quick to dismiss the spiritual aggressively and that pretty much makes his works indigestible for the most part. This book, so far, being the one exception to the usual reaction I have had with his books which was to bin them as soon as I finished reading them! How books like ""The God Delusion"" and ""The Blind Watchmaker"" get the publicity and acclaim they do get, I'll never really understand! "
287,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10309395-james-badger,5,"This book does for evolution what Carl Sagan's ""Cosmos"" did for astrophysics, which is to say that it makes the topic both interesting and palatable for the non-scientific public. The book highlights a number of interesting confluences in the evolutionary record which tell the tale of how human beings came to be the way we are today, biologically speaking. In this book the long-dead evolutionary progenitors of our species are given a voice. Over the course of this book, I found myself constantly surprised at the many creatures, big and small, who contributed in meaningful ways to my very existence. I feel this whole journey can be summed up with one quotation from the brine shrimp's tale: ""We are modified worms swimming on our backs, descended from an early equivalent of a brine shrimp which, for some long-forgotten reason, turned over."""
288,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,5,"In the ""Ancestor's Tale"" Richard Dawkins takes a unique approach to the evolutionary pathway which ultimately resulted in humans. Given that evolution does not proceed linearly and the fact that 'humans' were never an inevitable outcome of the evolutionary process, Dawkins begins his story with homo sapiens then runs the tape in reverse to discuss each branching of the evolutionary tree going back in time to our earliest ancestors. At each junction (for example the divergent branch that led to apes and humans) he discusses the common ancestors of each branch (which he terms 'comcestors'). With a clear writing style, the use of thoughtful metaphors and unique insights, Dawkins demonstrates why he is one of the very best writers of popular science today."
289,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1163337-joe,4,"This book reminded me of all the reasons why I love science, biology and life on this planet. Dawkins' use of the frame story style of ""The Canterbury Tales"" made for a very entertaining and enlightening read for a layman like me. My mind was really blown by the paradox of why asexual reproduction is not the norm for evolution. I love how weird life and how strange evolution makes us and other creatures. I also love how in biology like many other scientific areas it seems every rule/law has an exception and in nature there are many exceptions to the taxonomy and other boxes we like to impose on the world. It's amazing how much we know about our common ancestors and ancient life and it's equally amazing how little we know about all kinds of other things at the same time."

Ancestor’s Tale, which is the story of evolution told in the format of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, makes for an accessable, occasionally pleasant read (which, in my experience, is rare with science books). Different animals are shuffled out to tell “tales” throughout the book (their evolutionary traits are explained), and the book is extremely informative without being too terribly academic and dry. Just beyond halfway through I did lose interest, however. While the sections on hominids and continental drift had been fascinating, going back more than 100 million years got ...maybe a bit alien for me. Clearly there's no accounting for taste."

Relying on Wong's intricate molecular phylogeny, Dawkins takes us along to forty branching points - previous geological moments - in that phylogeny, where we meet the ""concestor"" - the last common ancestor - of all organisms at that very point. It is a quite compelling, often insightful, narrative that Dawkins admits does owe much to Chaucer's legendary ""The Canterbury Tales"". Dawkins doesn't hesitate to interrupt the relentless ebb and flow of his narrative in a series of individual ""tales"", that are designed illustrate some unique trait of a given species, and then, by mere extension, serve as the jumping off point(s) for riveting discussions on some aspect(s) of modern evolutionary biology. A classic example is the section that he devotes to the sauropsids, which consists of lizard-like and dinosaur-like (archosaurs, including birds) reptiles in the chapter entitled ""Rendezvous 16"". In the first of these tales, ""The Galapagos Finch's Tale"", Dawkins recounts the decades-long fieldwork of ecologists Peter and Rosemary Grant who have been studying microevolution in the Galapagos Finches. He focuses upon the aftermath of a severe drought in 1977 that led inevitably to sharp declines in the populations of several species, observing that those individuals in the dominant species, Geospiza fortis, who were only 5 percent larger than their peers, were the ones who survived; a classic example of ""a small episode of natural selection in action, during a single year."" Within the same species, the Grants and their coworkers observed selection pressures resulting not only in larger body size, but also in larger beak size too. In the chapter's next tale, ""The Peacock's Tale"", Dawkins emphasizes the importance of sexual selection, arguing persuasively that it may have had a role in shaping the course of human evolution, perhaps via preferential selection of females for ""smarter"" males. That is followed, in turn, by ""The Dodo's Tale"", in which Dawkins discusses not only the Dodo's extinction, but also the tendency towards flightlessness in bird species inhabiting remote oceanic islands. While Dawkins has crafted a most compelling narrative in this vast book, ""The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution"", is far from perfect, especially in its depiction of the fossil record. Much to my amazement, he doesn't discuss the existence of long-term stasis in the fossil record, predicted by the theory of punctuated equilibria, which has been substantiated by decades of extensive fieldwork by paleobiologists, ever since the publication of the classic 1972 paper coauthored by noted American paleobiologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould (This is a rather peculiar omission since Dawkins has been a staunch critic of punctuated equilibria.). Nor does he discuss, except only in passing, the diverse, radical differences in the compositions of marine faunas during, respectively, the Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras, which have been noted for decades due to excellent fieldwork, and more recently, by excellent statistical modeling done by paleontologist Jack Sepkoski and his colleagues at the University of Chicago. And he also misses the important history of predator-prey interactions that form much of coevolution, which has been discussed admirably elsewehere by noted marine ecologist Geerat Vermeij. But, in retrospect, my criticisms of Dawkins' omissions are relatively minor, simply because he has accomplished successfully, the arduous task of making both the taxonomy and history of life a most beguiling tale. Without question, ""The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution"", should be regarded for a long time as one of the classics of popular evolutionary biology literature.

313,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4803593-alisia,5,"Finally!!I think I spent more time with this book than any other in recent years...a solid six weeks. That's not to say it was boring or hard to get through, quite the opposite. I enjoyed slowly savoring the massive amount of information up for offer in this tome. Richard Dawkins' is a prolific author, and it took me a while to decide which of his books to read first. This one has been sitting on my shelf for about a year, and I finally picked it up to read concurrently with a Genetics and Evolution class that I am taking via Coursera. It was a splendid idea.Dawkins tends to go on and on about the craziness of religion, but thankfully that was mostly absent in this book. I like to focus on the topic at hand, without the jests and jeers at those with a different view. And the topic at hand in The Ancestor's Tale is an over-arching tale of evolution on this planet, going backwards in time (from a human perspective), all the way back to the origin of life. More than anything, Dawkin's vast knowledge of zoology shines, and I learned more than I ever thought I could in one month about the variety of life on this planet, and how they have evolved to be so darn interesting. His modeling of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales lends itself very well to the subject, and was a great method of (non-fiction) storytelling.As it was written ten years previously, one thought must accompany the reader. Evolutionary biology, genetics, molecular studies....these fields are constantly changing, with on-going innovations and new developments. Therefore, you must read a book like this with an eye to the present, and new research. For example, since Ancestor's Tale was published, a complete Neandertal genome was sequenced, and a few of Dawkins' statements are somewhat out-dated and not supported by recent findings. The same holds true for the molecular clock, and calculating the rendezvous points with various ancestors. I would love to see an updated edition of The Ancestor's Tale published at some point."
314,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3277375-charles-bond,5,"Great History of evolution! My favorite of Dawkins' books, because it processes every little peice of information, leaving no rock unturned. Being 700 or so pages it took me a while to finish it, but my hours were not wasted. It goes through every known evolutionary split from us now, to billions of years ago with some of the first life on earth. It covers the full spread of biological diversity and the different inventions of nature, like how a Platypus uses electromagnetic waves to detect small animals, or how much brain power the nose of a mole uses, with it's powerful sense of smell and touch. It covers sensitive concepts like race, gender, religion, and politics. Not claiming that science has power over all those things, but stating that there are biological advantages and disadvantages to things like sexual dimorphism,race, arms races, and religion. For those who turn down this book due to a motivation from their religion, I will let you know now this is not a religion bashing book. If your looking for that kind of thing this isn't it, it simply states the long history of life as we know it, while in the sidelines having small lessons about carbon dating, DNA, and sexual and asexual reproduction. This is a must read for anyone who pursues knowledge in the field of biology and who has ever pondered on the order in which life has diversified, although being so incredibly long I will suggest that you don't start reading until you have a lot of spare time, as it is best not to space out your reads as I did, so that you can retain more of the information."
315,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11678700-johan,4,"While parts of this book boil down to the long list of older and older latin ancestor names and some of their traits that is the premise of the book, some of its little forays into random tangents still make it a pretty inspiring read.An interesting factoid that never occurred to me, for instance: if we'd ever manage to burn all the fossil fuels and other biomass that did not get fully decomposed and recycled, we would no longer have an oxygen atmosphere, but revert to the reducing carbon-dioxide atmosphere we had prior to the advent of cyanobacteria.It's kind of fascinating that every breath of oxygen you or anyone else ever took has been manufactured from other materials by a plant somewhere, not just once, but once for each time it was ever burned in the metabolism of whatever animal breathed it in. Like pretty much all of Dawkins books, these little parentheticals pop up every now and then. Also, which may be the main draw of his books, he helps you think and reason about science and facts, pursue thought experiments, highlight thought traps and dead-ends, slips and over-simplifications, rather than just serve you fully packaged and pre-digested data."
316,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15711196-cesare-borgia,3,"I only give this extremely long winded book a three star rating 'cause out of all of Richard Dawkins' books I've read so far, this has some educational value. I find him extremely tedious, arrogant, pretentious and the fact that when pressed on the question of creation he'll negate the concept of God but will embrace some weird ""Alien genetic intervention"" just rubs me the wrong way. Great poster boy for atheism and anti-theism, scientifically speaking he's got the lingo down and at times he can be mildly amusing, but much like Charles Darwin before him, too quick to dismiss the spiritual aggressively and that pretty much makes his works indigestible for the most part. This book, so far, being the one exception to the usual reaction I have had with his books which was to bin them as soon as I finished reading them! How books like ""The God Delusion"" and ""The Blind Watchmaker"" get the publicity and acclaim they do get, I'll never really understand! "
317,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10309395-james-badger,5,"This book does for evolution what Carl Sagan's ""Cosmos"" did for astrophysics, which is to say that it makes the topic both interesting and palatable for the non-scientific public. The book highlights a number of interesting confluences in the evolutionary record which tell the tale of how human beings came to be the way we are today, biologically speaking. In this book the long-dead evolutionary progenitors of our species are given a voice. Over the course of this book, I found myself constantly surprised at the many creatures, big and small, who contributed in meaningful ways to my very existence. I feel this whole journey can be summed up with one quotation from the brine shrimp's tale: ""We are modified worms swimming on our backs, descended from an early equivalent of a brine shrimp which, for some long-forgotten reason, turned over."""
318,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,5,"In the ""Ancestor's Tale"" Richard Dawkins takes a unique approach to the evolutionary pathway which ultimately resulted in humans. Given that evolution does not proceed linearly and the fact that 'humans' were never an inevitable outcome of the evolutionary process, Dawkins begins his story with homo sapiens then runs the tape in reverse to discuss each branching of the evolutionary tree going back in time to our earliest ancestors. At each junction (for example the divergent branch that led to apes and humans) he discusses the common ancestors of each branch (which he terms 'comcestors'). With a clear writing style, the use of thoughtful metaphors and unique insights, Dawkins demonstrates why he is one of the very best writers of popular science today."

Dawkins' use of the frame story style of ""The Canterbury Tales"" made for a very entertaining and enlightening read for a layman like me. My mind was really blown by the paradox of why asexual reproduction is not the norm for evolution. I love how weird life and how strange evolution makes us and other creatures. I also love how in biology like many other scientific areas it seems every rule/law has an exception and in nature there are many exceptions to the taxonomy and other boxes we like to impose on the world. It's amazing how much we know about our common ancestors and ancient life and it's equally amazing how little we know about all kinds of other things at the same time."

Ancestor’s Tale, which is the story of evolution told in the format of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, makes for an accessable, occasionally pleasant read (which, in my experience, is rare with science books). Different animals are shuffled out to tell “tales” throughout the book (their evolutionary traits are explained), and the book is extremely informative without being too terribly academic and dry. Just beyond halfway through I did lose interest, however. While the sections on hominids and continental drift had been fascinating, going back more than 100 million years got ...maybe a bit alien for me. Clearly there's no accounting for taste."

In this vast tome Dawkins has crafted what is indeed the popular scientific equivalent of Chaucer's ""The Canterbury Tales"", taking us along a long journey back to the dawn of life itself, approximately 4 billion years ago, via a molecular phylogeny designed by his former undergraduate student Yan Wong. But it's a long, long trek that's quite unlikely to be viewed as tedious by the reader. Here, Dawkins is truly at his most expansive, using this taxonomy to discuss the compelling issues of contemporary evolutionary theory and history, in which he covers everything from genetics, speciation, convergent evolution and mass extinctions to microevolution, sexual selection, biogeography, and the relevance of plate tectonics to past and current biogeographic distributions of organisms. Relying on Wong's intricate molecular phylogeny, Dawkins takes us along to forty branching points - previous geological moments - in that phylogeny, where we meet the ""concestor"" - the last common ancestor - of all organisms at that very point. It is a quite compelling, often insightful, narrative that Dawkins admits does owe much to Chaucer's legendary ""The Canterbury Tales"". Dawkins doesn't hesitate to interrupt the relentless ebb and flow of his narrative in a series of individual ""tales"", that are designed illustrate some unique trait of a given species, and then, by mere extension, serve as the jumping off point(s) for riveting discussions on some aspect(s) of modern evolutionary biology. A classic example is the section that he devotes to the sauropsids, which consists of lizard-like and dinosaur-like (archosaurs, including birds) reptiles in the chapter entitled ""Rendezvous 16"". In the first of these tales, ""The Galapagos Finch's Tale"", Dawkins recounts the decades-long fieldwork of ecologists Peter and Rosemary Grant who have been studying microevolution in the Galapagos Finches. He focuses upon the aftermath of a severe drought in 1977 that led inevitably to sharp declines in the populations of several species, observing that those individuals in the dominant species, Geospiza fortis, who were only 5 percent larger than their peers, were the ones who survived; a classic example of ""a small episode of natural selection in action, during a single year."" Within the same species, the Grants and their coworkers observed selection pressures resulting not only in larger body size, but also in larger beak size too. In the chapter's next tale, ""The Peacock's Tale"", Dawkins emphasizes the importance of sexual selection, arguing persuasively that it may have had a role in shaping the course of human evolution, perhaps via preferential selection of females for ""smarter"" males. That is followed, in turn, by ""The Dodo's Tale"", in which Dawkins discusses not only the Dodo's extinction, but also the tendency towards flightlessness in bird species inhabiting remote oceanic islands. While Dawkins has crafted a most compelling narrative in this vast book, ""The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution"", is far from perfect, especially in its depiction of the fossil record.

Given that evolution does not proceed linearly and the fact that 'humans' were never an inevitable outcome of the evolutionary process, Dawkins begins his story with homo sapiens then runs the tape in reverse to discuss each branching of the evolutionary tree going back in time to our earliest ancestors. At each junction (for example the divergent branch that led to apes and humans) he discusses the common ancestors of each branch (which he terms 'comcestors').

I also love how in biology like many other scientific areas it seems every rule/law has an exception and in nature there are many exceptions to the taxonomy and other boxes we like to impose on the world.

Different animals are shuffled out to tell “tales” throughout the book (their evolutionary traits are explained), and the book is extremely informative without being too terribly academic and dry.

368,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324264-john,5,"""The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution"" is a beguiling literary trek through the taxonomy and history of life on Planet Earth; one that's led with ample eloquence by eminent evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins. In this vast tome Dawkins has crafted what is indeed the popular scientific equivalent of Chaucer's ""The Canterbury Tales"", taking us along a long journey back to the dawn of life itself, approximately 4 billion years ago, via a molecular phylogeny designed by his former undergraduate student Yan Wong. But it's a long, long trek that's quite unlikely to be viewed as tedious by the reader. Here, Dawkins is truly at his most expansive, using this taxonomy to discuss the compelling issues of contemporary evolutionary theory and history, in which he covers everything from genetics, speciation, convergent evolution and mass extinctions to microevolution, sexual selection, biogeography, and the relevance of plate tectonics to past and current biogeographic distributions of organisms. Relying on Wong's intricate molecular phylogeny, Dawkins takes us along to forty branching points - previous geological moments - in that phylogeny, where we meet the ""concestor"" - the last common ancestor - of all organisms at that very point. It is a quite compelling, often insightful, narrative that Dawkins admits does owe much to Chaucer's legendary ""The Canterbury Tales"". Dawkins doesn't hesitate to interrupt the relentless ebb and flow of his narrative in a series of individual ""tales"", that are designed illustrate some unique trait of a given species, and then, by mere extension, serve as the jumping off point(s) for riveting discussions on some aspect(s) of modern evolutionary biology. A classic example is the section that he devotes to the sauropsids, which consists of lizard-like and dinosaur-like (archosaurs, including birds) reptiles in the chapter entitled ""Rendezvous 16"". In the first of these tales, ""The Galapagos Finch's Tale"", Dawkins recounts the decades-long fieldwork of ecologists Peter and Rosemary Grant who have been studying microevolution in the Galapagos Finches. He focuses upon the aftermath of a severe drought in 1977 that led inevitably to sharp declines in the populations of several species, observing that those individuals in the dominant species, Geospiza fortis, who were only 5 percent larger than their peers, were the ones who survived; a classic example of ""a small episode of natural selection in action, during a single year."" Within the same species, the Grants and their coworkers observed selection pressures resulting not only in larger body size, but also in larger beak size too. In the chapter's next tale, ""The Peacock's Tale"", Dawkins emphasizes the importance of sexual selection, arguing persuasively that it may have had a role in shaping the course of human evolution, perhaps via preferential selection of females for ""smarter"" males. That is followed, in turn, by ""The Dodo's Tale"", in which Dawkins discusses not only the Dodo's extinction, but also the tendency towards flightlessness in bird species inhabiting remote oceanic islands. While Dawkins has crafted a most compelling narrative in this vast book, ""The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution"", is far from perfect, especially in its depiction of the fossil record. Much to my amazement, he doesn't discuss the existence of long-term stasis in the fossil record, predicted by the theory of punctuated equilibria, which has been substantiated by decades of extensive fieldwork by paleobiologists, ever since the publication of the classic 1972 paper coauthored by noted American paleobiologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould (This is a rather peculiar omission since Dawkins has been a staunch critic of punctuated equilibria.). Nor does he discuss, except only in passing, the diverse, radical differences in the compositions of marine faunas during, respectively, the Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras, which have been noted for decades due to excellent fieldwork, and more recently, by excellent statistical modeling done by paleontologist Jack Sepkoski and his colleagues at the University of Chicago. And he also misses the important history of predator-prey interactions that form much of coevolution, which has been discussed admirably elsewehere by noted marine ecologist Geerat Vermeij. But, in retrospect, my criticisms of Dawkins' omissions are relatively minor, simply because he has accomplished successfully, the arduous task of making both the taxonomy and history of life a most beguiling tale. Without question, ""The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution"", should be regarded for a long time as one of the classics of popular evolutionary biology literature.

As it turns out, these involuntary attempts sometimes succeed, resulting in complex symbiotic relationships, and sometimes they end up taking whole species out of existence. But they are always an evolutionary arms race for survival. As our pilgrimage advances back in time, we meet more and more cousins converging at each rendezvous point. I call it ""our"" pilgrimage although, as Dawkins puts it, this journey could have started from the point of view of any other existing species. At Rendezvous Point 1 we, human pilgrims, join our evolutionary cousins, chimpanzees and bonobos. We shall later meet other mammals, followed by the other vertebrates, invertebrates, all the way back to meeting our chlorophyll dependent cousins, the plants.

398,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324264-john,5,"""The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution"" is a beguiling literary trek through the taxonomy and history of life on Planet Earth; one that's led with ample eloquence by eminent evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins. In this vast tome Dawkins has crafted what is indeed the popular scientific equivalent of Chaucer's ""The Canterbury Tales"", taking us along a long journey back to the dawn of life itself, approximately 4 billion years ago, via a molecular phylogeny designed by his former undergraduate student Yan Wong. But it's a long, long trek that's quite unlikely to be viewed as tedious by the reader. Here, Dawkins is truly at his most expansive, using this taxonomy to discuss the compelling issues of contemporary evolutionary theory and history, in which he covers everything from genetics, speciation, convergent evolution and mass extinctions to microevolution, sexual selection, biogeography, and the relevance of plate tectonics to past and current biogeographic distributions of organisms. Relying on Wong's intricate molecular phylogeny, Dawkins takes us along to forty branching points - previous geological moments - in that phylogeny, where we meet the ""concestor"" - the last common ancestor - of all organisms at that very point. It is a quite compelling, often insightful, narrative that Dawkins admits does owe much to Chaucer's legendary ""The Canterbury Tales"". Dawkins doesn't hesitate to interrupt the relentless ebb and flow of his narrative in a series of individual ""tales"", that are designed illustrate some unique trait of a given species, and then, by mere extension, serve as the jumping off point(s) for riveting discussions on some aspect(s) of modern evolutionary biology. A classic example is the section that he devotes to the sauropsids, which consists of lizard-like and dinosaur-like (archosaurs, including birds) reptiles in the chapter entitled ""Rendezvous 16"". In the first of these tales, ""The Galapagos Finch's Tale"", Dawkins recounts the decades-long fieldwork of ecologists Peter and Rosemary Grant who have been studying microevolution in the Galapagos Finches. He focuses upon the aftermath of a severe drought in 1977 that led inevitably to sharp declines in the populations of several species, observing that those individuals in the dominant species, Geospiza fortis, who were only 5 percent larger than their peers, were the ones who survived; a classic example of ""a small episode of natural selection in action, during a single year."" Within the same species, the Grants and their coworkers observed selection pressures resulting not only in larger body size, but also in larger beak size too. In the chapter's next tale, ""The Peacock's Tale"", Dawkins emphasizes the importance of sexual selection, arguing persuasively that it may have had a role in shaping the course of human evolution, perhaps via preferential selection of females for ""smarter"" males. That is followed, in turn, by ""The Dodo's Tale"", in which Dawkins discusses not only the Dodo's extinction, but also the tendency towards flightlessness in bird species inhabiting remote oceanic islands. While Dawkins has crafted a most compelling narrative in this vast book, ""The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution"", is far from perfect, especially in its depiction of the fossil record. Much to my amazement, he doesn't discuss the existence of long-term stasis in the fossil record, predicted by the theory of punctuated equilibria, which has been substantiated by decades of extensive fieldwork by paleobiologists, ever since the publication of the classic 1972 paper coauthored by noted American paleobiologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould (This is a rather peculiar omission since Dawkins has been a staunch critic of punctuated equilibria.). Nor does he discuss, except only in passing, the diverse, radical differences in the compositions of marine faunas during, respectively, the Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras, which have been noted for decades due to excellent fieldwork, and more recently, by excellent statistical modeling done by paleontologist Jack Sepkoski and his colleagues at the University of Chicago. And he also misses the important history of predator-prey interactions that form much of coevolution, which has been discussed admirably elsewehere by noted marine ecologist Geerat Vermeij. But, in retrospect, my criticisms of Dawkins' omissions are relatively minor, simply because he has accomplished successfully, the arduous task of making both the taxonomy and history of life a most beguiling tale. Without question, ""The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution"", should be regarded for a long time as one of the classics of popular evolutionary biology literature.

400,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45815668-jordan-penney,2,"Dawkins does a good job of summarizing basic college Biology and the concept of natural selection. He generally oversteps his bounds in critiquing religion, and he also adheres to plenty of beliefs that could easily be used to give credit to religion, obviously something he was not trying to do. In general, I would say that Dawkins' attempt at Logos was often very rocky, but it is easy to see his love of Darwin, whom he so desperately clings to as his main source of Ethos legitimacy. The whole thing was only slightly more entertaining than a textbook, and I fell asleep many times trying to finish it. I won't be reading it again, that's for certain, I want to keep my sanity."

402,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9199325-stefan-matei,5,"Geneticists tell us that every single person on Earth is at the least 50th cousins with every other person on Earth. On a broader scale two closely related species can be considered cousins; and it is this broad sense of the word ""cousin"" I'd like to make use of below.Throughout his tales Dawkins exposes the attempts to coexist between cousins in an ever changing habitat. As it turns out, these involuntary attempts sometimes succeed, resulting in complex symbiotic relationships, and sometimes they end up taking whole species out of existence. But they are always an evolutionary arms race for survival. As our pilgrimage advances back in time, we meet more and more cousins converging at each rendezvous point. I call it ""our"" pilgrimage although, as Dawkins puts it, this journey could have started from the point of view of any other existing species. At Rendezvous Point 1 we, human pilgrims, join our evolutionary cousins, chimpanzees and bonobos. We shall later meet other mammals, followed by the other vertebrates, invertebrates, all the way back to meeting our chlorophyll dependent cousins, the plants. Although the journey back in time will have many stops with unfamiliar Latin sounding names, Dawkins does a great job of always keeping you updated and clear about where you are along the pilgrimage -- you know... just in case you don't have a doctorate in zoology. At each rendezvous point, the author recounts interesting tales concerning the cousin animals which are about to join the band of pilgrims. Every newly recruited species, genus or family has its own peculiar features, often ones that are relevant to our human anatomy or otherwise interesting for humans.After a total of 40 Rendezvous Points our pilgrimage culminates with the eubacteria, the ancestor of all surviving organisms. ""The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Life"" is a history of life, a history of life going backwards in the form of an epic pilgrimage. Along the way, any of our cousin pilgrims can tell a tale. And it's those tales that form the main substance of the book. "
403,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4803593-alisia,5,"Finally!!I think I spent more time with this book than any other in recent years...a solid six weeks. That's not to say it was boring or hard to get through, quite the opposite. I enjoyed slowly savoring the massive amount of information up for offer in this tome. Richard Dawkins' is a prolific author, and it took me a while to decide which of his books to read first. This one has been sitting on my shelf for about a year, and I finally picked it up to read concurrently with a Genetics and Evolution class that I am taking via Coursera. It was a splendid idea.Dawkins tends to go on and on about the craziness of religion, but thankfully that was mostly absent in this book. I like to focus on the topic at hand, without the jests and jeers at those with a different view. And the topic at hand in The Ancestor's Tale is an over-arching tale of evolution on this planet, going backwards in time (from a human perspective), all the way back to the origin of life. More than anything, Dawkin's vast knowledge of zoology shines, and I learned more than I ever thought I could in one month about the variety of life on this planet, and how they have evolved to be so darn interesting. His modeling of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales lends itself very well to the subject, and was a great method of (non-fiction) storytelling.As it was written ten years previously, one thought must accompany the reader. Evolutionary biology, genetics, molecular studies....these fields are constantly changing, with on-going innovations and new developments. Therefore, you must read a book like this with an eye to the present, and new research. For example, since Ancestor's Tale was published, a complete Neandertal genome was sequenced, and a few of Dawkins' statements are somewhat out-dated and not supported by recent findings. The same holds true for the molecular clock, and calculating the rendezvous points with various ancestors. I would love to see an updated edition of The Ancestor's Tale published at some point."

My favorite of Dawkins' books, because it processes every little peice of information, leaving no rock unturned. Being 700 or so pages it took me a while to finish it, but my hours were not wasted. It goes through every known evolutionary split from us now, to billions of years ago with some of the first life on earth. It covers the full spread of biological diversity and the different inventions of nature, like how a Platypus uses electromagnetic waves to detect small animals, or how much brain power the nose of a mole uses, with it's powerful sense of smell and touch. It covers sensitive concepts like race, gender, religion, and politics. Not claiming that science has power over all those things, but stating that there are biological advantages and disadvantages to things like sexual dimorphism,race, arms races, and religion. For those who turn down this book due to a motivation from their religion, I will let you know now this is not a religion bashing book. If your looking for that kind of thing this isn't it, it simply states the long history of life as we know it, while in the sidelines having small lessons about carbon dating, DNA, and sexual and asexual reproduction. This is a must read for anyone who pursues knowledge in the field of biology and who has ever pondered on the order in which life has diversified, although being so incredibly long I will suggest that you don't start reading until you have a lot of spare time, as it is best not to space out your reads as I did, so that you can retain more of the information."

Like pretty much all of Dawkins books, these little parentheticals pop up every now and then. Also, which may be the main draw of his books, he helps you think and reason about science and facts, pursue thought experiments, highlight thought traps and dead-ends, slips and over-simplifications, rather than just serve you fully packaged and pre-digested data."

428,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7324264-john,5,"""The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution"" is a beguiling literary trek through the taxonomy and history of life on Planet Earth; one that's led with ample eloquence by eminent evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins. In this vast tome Dawkins has crafted what is indeed the popular scientific equivalent of Chaucer's ""The Canterbury Tales"", taking us along a long journey back to the dawn of life itself, approximately 4 billion years ago, via a molecular phylogeny designed by his former undergraduate student Yan Wong. But it's a long, long trek that's quite unlikely to be viewed as tedious by the reader. Here, Dawkins is truly at his most expansive, using this taxonomy to discuss the compelling issues of contemporary evolutionary theory and history, in which he covers everything from genetics, speciation, convergent evolution and mass extinctions to microevolution, sexual selection, biogeography, and the relevance of plate tectonics to past and current biogeographic distributions of organisms. Relying on Wong's intricate molecular phylogeny, Dawkins takes us along to forty branching points - previous geological moments - in that phylogeny, where we meet the ""concestor"" - the last common ancestor - of all organisms at that very point. It is a quite compelling, often insightful, narrative that Dawkins admits does owe much to Chaucer's legendary ""The Canterbury Tales"". Dawkins doesn't hesitate to interrupt the relentless ebb and flow of his narrative in a series of individual ""tales"", that are designed illustrate some unique trait of a given species, and then, by mere extension, serve as the jumping off point(s) for riveting discussions on some aspect(s) of modern evolutionary biology. A classic example is the section that he devotes to the sauropsids, which consists of lizard-like and dinosaur-like (archosaurs, including birds) reptiles in the chapter entitled ""Rendezvous 16"". In the first of these tales, ""The Galapagos Finch's Tale"", Dawkins recounts the decades-long fieldwork of ecologists Peter and Rosemary Grant who have been studying microevolution in the Galapagos Finches. He focuses upon the aftermath of a severe drought in 1977 that led inevitably to sharp declines in the populations of several species, observing that those individuals in the dominant species, Geospiza fortis, who were only 5 percent larger than their peers, were the ones who survived; a classic example of ""a small episode of natural selection in action, during a single year."" Within the same species, the Grants and their coworkers observed selection pressures resulting not only in larger body size, but also in larger beak size too. In the chapter's next tale, ""The Peacock's Tale"", Dawkins emphasizes the importance of sexual selection, arguing persuasively that it may have had a role in shaping the course of human evolution, perhaps via preferential selection of females for ""smarter"" males. That is followed, in turn, by ""The Dodo's Tale"", in which Dawkins discusses not only the Dodo's extinction, but also the tendency towards flightlessness in bird species inhabiting remote oceanic islands. While Dawkins has crafted a most compelling narrative in this vast book, ""The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution"", is far from perfect, especially in its depiction of the fossil record. Much to my amazement, he doesn't discuss the existence of long-term stasis in the fossil record, predicted by the theory of punctuated equilibria, which has been substantiated by decades of extensive fieldwork by paleobiologists, ever since the publication of the classic 1972 paper coauthored by noted American paleobiologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould (This is a rather peculiar omission since Dawkins has been a staunch critic of punctuated equilibria.). Nor does he discuss, except only in passing, the diverse, radical differences in the compositions of marine faunas during, respectively, the Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras, which have been noted for decades due to excellent fieldwork, and more recently, by excellent statistical modeling done by paleontologist Jack Sepkoski and his colleagues at the University of Chicago. And he also misses the important history of predator-prey interactions that form much of coevolution, which has been discussed admirably elsewehere by noted marine ecologist Geerat Vermeij. But, in retrospect, my criticisms of Dawkins' omissions are relatively minor, simply because he has accomplished successfully, the arduous task of making both the taxonomy and history of life a most beguiling tale. Without question, ""The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution"", should be regarded for a long time as one of the classics of popular evolutionary biology literature. (Reposted from my Amazon review)"
429,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28305884-maryann-glotzer,3,"I've always been interested in evolution and thought it would be interesting to read a book that could catch me up on all the new information since my last Anthro class 50 years ago. This book actually did a good job of that. Unfortunately, the author does use footnotes but he also has to tell you how he knows the scientist. The discovered was the author's student, professor, mentor, fishing buddy! There is lots of information if you can handle the pretentious tone."
430,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45815668-jordan-penney,2,"Dawkins does a good job of summarizing basic college Biology and the concept of natural selection. He generally oversteps his bounds in critiquing religion, and he also adheres to plenty of beliefs that could easily be used to give credit to religion, obviously something he was not trying to do. In general, I would say that Dawkins' attempt at Logos was often very rocky, but it is easy to see his love of Darwin, whom he so desperately clings to as his main source of Ethos legitimacy. The whole thing was only slightly more entertaining than a textbook, and I fell asleep many times trying to finish it. I won't be reading it again, that's for certain, I want to keep my sanity."
431,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100956678-jon-golan,5,"A visionary title - I wrote many essays on its various subjects. The premise is clever and executed flawlessly. A great introduction to zoology and bio as a whole (if you know bio, you may skip some parts)."
432,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9199325-stefan-matei,5,"Geneticists tell us that every single person on Earth is at the least 50th cousins with every other person on Earth. On a broader scale two closely related species can be considered cousins; and it is this broad sense of the word ""cousin"" I'd like to make use of below.Throughout his tales Dawkins exposes the attempts to coexist between cousins in an ever changing habitat. As it turns out, these involuntary attempts sometimes succeed, resulting in complex symbiotic relationships, and sometimes they end up taking whole species out of existence. But they are always an evolutionary arms race for survival. As our pilgrimage advances back in time, we meet more and more cousins converging at each rendezvous point. I call it ""our"" pilgrimage although, as Dawkins puts it, this journey could have started from the point of view of any other existing species. At Rendezvous Point 1 we, human pilgrims, join our evolutionary cousins, chimpanzees and bonobos. We shall later meet other mammals, followed by the other vertebrates, invertebrates, all the way back to meeting our chlorophyll dependent cousins, the plants. Although the journey back in time will have many stops with unfamiliar Latin sounding names, Dawkins does a great job of always keeping you updated and clear about where you are along the pilgrimage -- you know... just in case you don't have a doctorate in zoology. At each rendezvous point, the author recounts interesting tales concerning the cousin animals which are about to join the band of pilgrims. Every newly recruited species, genus or family has its own peculiar features, often ones that are relevant to our human anatomy or otherwise interesting for humans.After a total of 40 Rendezvous Points our pilgrimage culminates with the eubacteria, the ancestor of all surviving organisms. ""The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Life"" is a history of life, a history of life going backwards in the form of an epic pilgrimage. Along the way, any of our cousin pilgrims can tell a tale. And it's those tales that form the main substance of the book. "
433,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4803593-alisia,5,"Finally!!I think I spent more time with this book than any other in recent years...a solid six weeks. That's not to say it was boring or hard to get through, quite the opposite. I enjoyed slowly savoring the massive amount of information up for offer in this tome. Richard Dawkins' is a prolific author, and it took me a while to decide which of his books to read first. This one has been sitting on my shelf for about a year, and I finally picked it up to read concurrently with a Genetics and Evolution class that I am taking via Coursera. It was a splendid idea.Dawkins tends to go on and on about the craziness of religion, but thankfully that was mostly absent in this book. I like to focus on the topic at hand, without the jests and jeers at those with a different view. And the topic at hand in The Ancestor's Tale is an over-arching tale of evolution on this planet, going backwards in time (from a human perspective), all the way back to the origin of life. More than anything, Dawkin's vast knowledge of zoology shines, and I learned more than I ever thought I could in one month about the variety of life on this planet, and how they have evolved to be so darn interesting. His modeling of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales lends itself very well to the subject, and was a great method of (non-fiction) storytelling.As it was written ten years previously, one thought must accompany the reader. Evolutionary biology, genetics, molecular studies....these fields are constantly changing, with on-going innovations and new developments. Therefore, you must read a book like this with an eye to the present, and new research. For example, since Ancestor's Tale was published, a complete Neandertal genome was sequenced, and a few of Dawkins' statements are somewhat out-dated and not supported by recent findings. The same holds true for the molecular clock, and calculating the rendezvous points with various ancestors. I would love to see an updated edition of The Ancestor's Tale published at some point."
434,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3277375-charles-bond,5,"Great History of evolution! My favorite of Dawkins' books, because it processes every little peice of information, leaving no rock unturned. Being 700 or so pages it took me a while to finish it, but my hours were not wasted. It goes through every known evolutionary split from us now, to billions of years ago with some of the first life on earth. It covers the full spread of biological diversity and the different inventions of nature, like how a Platypus uses electromagnetic waves to detect small animals, or how much brain power the nose of a mole uses, with it's powerful sense of smell and touch. It covers sensitive concepts like race, gender, religion, and politics. Not claiming that science has power over all those things, but stating that there are biological advantages and disadvantages to things like sexual dimorphism,race, arms races, and religion. For those who turn down this book due to a motivation from their religion, I will let you know now this is not a religion bashing book. If your looking for that kind of thing this isn't it, it simply states the long history of life as we know it, while in the sidelines having small lessons about carbon dating, DNA, and sexual and asexual reproduction. This is a must read for anyone who pursues knowledge in the field of biology and who has ever pondered on the order in which life has diversified, although being so incredibly long I will suggest that you don't start reading until you have a lot of spare time, as it is best not to space out your reads as I did, so that you can retain more of the information."
435,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11678700-johan,4,"While parts of this book boil down to the long list of older and older latin ancestor names and some of their traits that is the premise of the book, some of its little forays into random tangents still make it a pretty inspiring read.An interesting factoid that never occurred to me, for instance: if we'd ever manage to burn all the fossil fuels and other biomass that did not get fully decomposed and recycled, we would no longer have an oxygen atmosphere, but revert to the reducing carbon-dioxide atmosphere we had prior to the advent of cyanobacteria.It's kind of fascinating that every breath of oxygen you or anyone else ever took has been manufactured from other materials by a plant somewhere, not just once, but once for each time it was ever burned in the metabolism of whatever animal breathed it in. Like pretty much all of Dawkins books, these little parentheticals pop up every now and then. Also, which may be the main draw of his books, he helps you think and reason about science and facts, pursue thought experiments, highlight thought traps and dead-ends, slips and over-simplifications, rather than just serve you fully packaged and pre-digested data."
436,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15711196-cesare-borgia,3,"I only give this extremely long winded book a three star rating 'cause out of all of Richard Dawkins' books I've read so far, this has some educational value. I find him extremely tedious, arrogant, pretentious and the fact that when pressed on the question of creation he'll negate the concept of God but will embrace some weird ""Alien genetic intervention"" just rubs me the wrong way. Great poster boy for atheism and anti-theism, scientifically speaking he's got the lingo down and at times he can be mildly amusing, but much like Charles Darwin before him, too quick to dismiss the spiritual aggressively and that pretty much makes his works indigestible for the most part. This book, so far, being the one exception to the usual reaction I have had with his books which was to bin them as soon as I finished reading them! How books like ""The God Delusion"" and ""The Blind Watchmaker"" get the publicity and acclaim they do get, I'll never really understand! "
437,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10309395-james-badger,5,"This book does for evolution what Carl Sagan's ""Cosmos"" did for astrophysics, which is to say that it makes the topic both interesting and palatable for the non-scientific public. The book highlights a number of interesting confluences in the evolutionary record which tell the tale of how human beings came to be the way we are today, biologically speaking. In this book the long-dead evolutionary progenitors of our species are given a voice. Over the course of this book, I found myself constantly surprised at the many creatures, big and small, who contributed in meaningful ways to my very existence. I feel this whole journey can be summed up with one quotation from the brine shrimp's tale: ""We are modified worms swimming on our backs, descended from an early equivalent of a brine shrimp which, for some long-forgotten reason, turned over."""
438,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,5,"In the ""Ancestor's Tale"" Richard Dawkins takes a unique approach to the evolutionary pathway which ultimately resulted in humans. Given that evolution does not proceed linearly and the fact that 'humans' were never an inevitable outcome of the evolutionary process, Dawkins begins his story with homo sapiens then runs the tape in reverse to discuss each branching of the evolutionary tree going back in time to our earliest ancestors. At each junction (for example the divergent branch that led to apes and humans) he discusses the common ancestors of each branch (which he terms 'comcestors'). With a clear writing style, the use of thoughtful metaphors and unique insights, Dawkins demonstrates why he is one of the very best writers of popular science today."
439,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1163337-joe,4,"This book reminded me of all the reasons why I love science, biology and life on this planet. Dawkins' use of the frame story style of ""The Canterbury Tales"" made for a very entertaining and enlightening read for a layman like me. My mind was really blown by the paradox of why asexual reproduction is not the norm for evolution. I love how weird life and how strange evolution makes us and other creatures. I also love how in biology like many other scientific areas it seems every rule/law has an exception and in nature there are many exceptions to the taxonomy and other boxes we like to impose on the world. It's amazing how much we know about our common ancestors and ancient life and it's equally amazing how little we know about all kinds of other things at the same time."

Ancestor’s Tale, which is the story of evolution told in the format of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, makes for an accessable, occasionally pleasant read (which, in my experience, is rare with science books). Different animals are shuffled out to tell “tales” throughout the book (their evolutionary traits are explained), and the book is extremely informative without being too terribly academic and dry. Just beyond halfway through I did lose interest, however. While the sections on hominids and continental drift had been fascinating, going back more than 100 million years got ...maybe a bit alien for me. Clearly there's no accounting for taste."

But it's a long, long trek that's quite unlikely to be viewed as tedious by the reader. Here, Dawkins is truly at his most expansive, using this taxonomy to discuss the compelling issues of contemporary evolutionary theory and history, in which he covers everything from genetics, speciation, convergent evolution and mass extinctions to microevolution, sexual selection, biogeography, and the relevance of plate tectonics to past and current biogeographic distributions of organisms. Relying on Wong's intricate molecular phylogeny, Dawkins takes us along to forty branching points - previous geological moments - in that phylogeny, where we meet the ""concestor"" - the last common ancestor - of all organisms at that very point. It is a quite compelling, often insightful, narrative that Dawkins admits does owe much to Chaucer's legendary ""The Canterbury Tales"". Dawkins doesn't hesitate to interrupt the relentless ebb and flow of his narrative in a series of individual ""tales"", that are designed illustrate some unique trait of a given species, and then, by mere extension, serve as the jumping off point(s) for riveting discussions on some aspect(s) of modern evolutionary biology. A classic example is the section that he devotes to the sauropsids, which consists of lizard-like and dinosaur-like (archosaurs, including birds) reptiles in the chapter entitled ""Rendezvous 16"". In the first of these tales, ""The Galapagos Finch's Tale"", Dawkins recounts the decades-long fieldwork of ecologists Peter and Rosemary Grant who have been studying microevolution in the Galapagos Finches. He focuses upon the aftermath of a severe drought in 1977 that led inevitably to sharp declines in the populations of several species, observing that those individuals in the dominant species, Geospiza fortis, who were only 5 percent larger than their peers, were the ones who survived; a classic example of ""a small episode of natural selection in action, during a single year."" Within the same species, the Grants and their coworkers observed selection pressures resulting not only in larger body size, but also in larger beak size too. In the chapter's next tale, ""The Peacock's Tale"", Dawkins emphasizes the importance of sexual selection, arguing persuasively that it may have had a role in shaping the course of human evolution, perhaps via preferential selection of females for ""smarter"" males. That is followed, in turn, by ""The Dodo's Tale"", in which Dawkins discusses not only the Dodo's extinction, but also the tendency towards flightlessness in bird species inhabiting remote oceanic islands. While Dawkins has crafted a most compelling narrative in this vast book, ""The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution"", is far from perfect, especially in its depiction of the fossil record. Much to my amazement, he doesn't discuss the existence of long-term stasis in the fossil record, predicted by the theory of punctuated equilibria, which has been substantiated by decades of extensive fieldwork by paleobiologists, ever since the publication of the classic 1972 paper coauthored by noted American paleobiologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould (This is a rather peculiar omission since Dawkins has been a staunch critic of punctuated equilibria.). Nor does he discuss, except only in passing, the diverse, radical differences in the compositions of marine faunas during, respectively, the Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras, which have been noted for decades due to excellent fieldwork, and more recently, by excellent statistical modeling done by paleontologist Jack Sepkoski and his colleagues at the University of Chicago. And he also misses the important history of predator-prey interactions that form much of coevolution, which has been discussed admirably elsewehere by noted marine ecologist Geerat Vermeij. But, in retrospect, my criticisms of Dawkins' omissions are relatively minor, simply because he has accomplished successfully, the arduous task of making both the taxonomy and history of life a most beguiling tale. Without question, ""The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution"", should be regarded for a long time as one of the classics of popular evolutionary biology literature.

459,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28305884-maryann-glotzer,3,"I've always been interested in evolution and thought it would be interesting to read a book that could catch me up on all the new information since my last Anthro class 50 years ago. This book actually did a good job of that. Unfortunately, the author does use footnotes but he also has to tell you how he knows the scientist. The discovered was the author's student, professor, mentor, fishing buddy! There is lots of information if you can handle the pretentious tone."
460,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45815668-jordan-penney,2,"Dawkins does a good job of summarizing basic college Biology and the concept of natural selection. He generally oversteps his bounds in critiquing religion, and he also adheres to plenty of beliefs that could easily be used to give credit to religion, obviously something he was not trying to do. In general, I would say that Dawkins' attempt at Logos was often very rocky, but it is easy to see his love of Darwin, whom he so desperately clings to as his main source of Ethos legitimacy. The whole thing was only slightly more entertaining than a textbook, and I fell asleep many times trying to finish it. I won't be reading it again, that's for certain, I want to keep my sanity."
461,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/100956678-jon-golan,5,"A visionary title - I wrote many essays on its various subjects. The premise is clever and executed flawlessly. A great introduction to zoology and bio as a whole (if you know bio, you may skip some parts)."
462,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9199325-stefan-matei,5,"Geneticists tell us that every single person on Earth is at the least 50th cousins with every other person on Earth. On a broader scale two closely related species can be considered cousins; and it is this broad sense of the word ""cousin"" I'd like to make use of below.Throughout his tales Dawkins exposes the attempts to coexist between cousins in an ever changing habitat. As it turns out, these involuntary attempts sometimes succeed, resulting in complex symbiotic relationships, and sometimes they end up taking whole species out of existence. But they are always an evolutionary arms race for survival. As our pilgrimage advances back in time, we meet more and more cousins converging at each rendezvous point. I call it ""our"" pilgrimage although, as Dawkins puts it, this journey could have started from the point of view of any other existing species. At Rendezvous Point 1 we, human pilgrims, join our evolutionary cousins, chimpanzees and bonobos. We shall later meet other mammals, followed by the other vertebrates, invertebrates, all the way back to meeting our chlorophyll dependent cousins, the plants. Although the journey back in time will have many stops with unfamiliar Latin sounding names, Dawkins does a great job of always keeping you updated and clear about where you are along the pilgrimage -- you know... just in case you don't have a doctorate in zoology. At each rendezvous point, the author recounts interesting tales concerning the cousin animals which are about to join the band of pilgrims. Every newly recruited species, genus or family has its own peculiar features, often ones that are relevant to our human anatomy or otherwise interesting for humans.After a total of 40 Rendezvous Points our pilgrimage culminates with the eubacteria, the ancestor of all surviving organisms. ""The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Life"" is a history of life, a history of life going backwards in the form of an epic pilgrimage. Along the way, any of our cousin pilgrims can tell a tale. And it's those tales that form the main substance of the book. "
463,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4803593-alisia,5,"Finally!!I think I spent more time with this book than any other in recent years...a solid six weeks. That's not to say it was boring or hard to get through, quite the opposite. I enjoyed slowly savoring the massive amount of information up for offer in this tome. Richard Dawkins' is a prolific author, and it took me a while to decide which of his books to read first. This one has been sitting on my shelf for about a year, and I finally picked it up to read concurrently with a Genetics and Evolution class that I am taking via Coursera. It was a splendid idea.Dawkins tends to go on and on about the craziness of religion, but thankfully that was mostly absent in this book. I like to focus on the topic at hand, without the jests and jeers at those with a different view. And the topic at hand in The Ancestor's Tale is an over-arching tale of evolution on this planet, going backwards in time (from a human perspective), all the way back to the origin of life. More than anything, Dawkin's vast knowledge of zoology shines, and I learned more than I ever thought I could in one month about the variety of life on this planet, and how they have evolved to be so darn interesting. His modeling of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales lends itself very well to the subject, and was a great method of (non-fiction) storytelling.As it was written ten years previously, one thought must accompany the reader. Evolutionary biology, genetics, molecular studies....these fields are constantly changing, with on-going innovations and new developments. Therefore, you must read a book like this with an eye to the present, and new research. For example, since Ancestor's Tale was published, a complete Neandertal genome was sequenced, and a few of Dawkins' statements are somewhat out-dated and not supported by recent findings. The same holds true for the molecular clock, and calculating the rendezvous points with various ancestors. I would love to see an updated edition of The Ancestor's Tale published at some point."
464,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3277375-charles-bond,5,"Great History of evolution! My favorite of Dawkins' books, because it processes every little peice of information, leaving no rock unturned. Being 700 or so pages it took me a while to finish it, but my hours were not wasted. It goes through every known evolutionary split from us now, to billions of years ago with some of the first life on earth. It covers the full spread of biological diversity and the different inventions of nature, like how a Platypus uses electromagnetic waves to detect small animals, or how much brain power the nose of a mole uses, with it's powerful sense of smell and touch. It covers sensitive concepts like race, gender, religion, and politics. Not claiming that science has power over all those things, but stating that there are biological advantages and disadvantages to things like sexual dimorphism,race, arms races, and religion. For those who turn down this book due to a motivation from their religion, I will let you know now this is not a religion bashing book. If your looking for that kind of thing this isn't it, it simply states the long history of life as we know it, while in the sidelines having small lessons about carbon dating, DNA, and sexual and asexual reproduction. This is a must read for anyone who pursues knowledge in the field of biology and who has ever pondered on the order in which life has diversified, although being so incredibly long I will suggest that you don't start reading until you have a lot of spare time, as it is best not to space out your reads as I did, so that you can retain more of the information."
465,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11678700-johan,4,"While parts of this book boil down to the long list of older and older latin ancestor names and some of their traits that is the premise of the book, some of its little forays into random tangents still make it a pretty inspiring read.An interesting factoid that never occurred to me, for instance: if we'd ever manage to burn all the fossil fuels and other biomass that did not get fully decomposed and recycled, we would no longer have an oxygen atmosphere, but revert to the reducing carbon-dioxide atmosphere we had prior to the advent of cyanobacteria.It's kind of fascinating that every breath of oxygen you or anyone else ever took has been manufactured from other materials by a plant somewhere, not just once, but once for each time it was ever burned in the metabolism of whatever animal breathed it in. Like pretty much all of Dawkins books, these little parentheticals pop up every now and then. Also, which may be the main draw of his books, he helps you think and reason about science and facts, pursue thought experiments, highlight thought traps and dead-ends, slips and over-simplifications, rather than just serve you fully packaged and pre-digested data."
466,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15711196-cesare-borgia,3,"I only give this extremely long winded book a three star rating 'cause out of all of Richard Dawkins' books I've read so far, this has some educational value. I find him extremely tedious, arrogant, pretentious and the fact that when pressed on the question of creation he'll negate the concept of God but will embrace some weird ""Alien genetic intervention"" just rubs me the wrong way. Great poster boy for atheism and anti-theism, scientifically speaking he's got the lingo down and at times he can be mildly amusing, but much like Charles Darwin before him, too quick to dismiss the spiritual aggressively and that pretty much makes his works indigestible for the most part. This book, so far, being the one exception to the usual reaction I have had with his books which was to bin them as soon as I finished reading them! How books like ""The God Delusion"" and ""The Blind Watchmaker"" get the publicity and acclaim they do get, I'll never really understand! "
467,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10309395-james-badger,5,"This book does for evolution what Carl Sagan's ""Cosmos"" did for astrophysics, which is to say that it makes the topic both interesting and palatable for the non-scientific public. The book highlights a number of interesting confluences in the evolutionary record which tell the tale of how human beings came to be the way we are today, biologically speaking. In this book the long-dead evolutionary progenitors of our species are given a voice. Over the course of this book, I found myself constantly surprised at the many creatures, big and small, who contributed in meaningful ways to my very existence. I feel this whole journey can be summed up with one quotation from the brine shrimp's tale: ""We are modified worms swimming on our backs, descended from an early equivalent of a brine shrimp which, for some long-forgotten reason, turned over."""
468,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,5,"In the ""Ancestor's Tale"" Richard Dawkins takes a unique approach to the evolutionary pathway which ultimately resulted in humans. Given that evolution does not proceed linearly and the fact that 'humans' were never an inevitable outcome of the evolutionary process, Dawkins begins his story with homo sapiens then runs the tape in reverse to discuss each branching of the evolutionary tree going back in time to our earliest ancestors. At each junction (for example the divergent branch that led to apes and humans) he discusses the common ancestors of each branch (which he terms 'comcestors'). With a clear writing style, the use of thoughtful metaphors and unique insights, Dawkins demonstrates why he is one of the very best writers of popular science today."
469,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1163337-joe,4,"This book reminded me of all the reasons why I love science, biology and life on this planet. Dawkins' use of the frame story style of ""The Canterbury Tales"" made for a very entertaining and enlightening read for a layman like me. My mind was really blown by the paradox of why asexual reproduction is not the norm for evolution. I love how weird life and how strange evolution makes us and other creatures. I also love how in biology like many other scientific areas it seems every rule/law has an exception and in nature there are many exceptions to the taxonomy and other boxes we like to impose on the world. It's amazing how much we know about our common ancestors and ancient life and it's equally amazing how little we know about all kinds of other things at the same time."
470,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3609226-jaybird-rex,0,"I came to this book from Dawkins’ book on atheism, not consciously expecting the same, but still probably expecting it a bit anyhow. Ancestor’s Tale, which is the story of evolution told in the format of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, makes for an accessable, occasionally pleasant read (which, in my experience, is rare with science books). Different animals are shuffled out to tell “tales” throughout the book (their evolutionary traits are explained), and the book is extremely informative without being too terribly academic and dry. Just beyond halfway through I did lose interest, however. While the sections on hominids and continental drift had been fascinating, going back more than 100 million years got ...maybe a bit alien for me. Clearly there's no accounting for taste."

For the first time I could really picture clearly in my mind how exactly an animal would evolve, as opposed to the vague concept I've always had in my mind. Really good read!"

In The Ancestor's Tale, Dawkins takes the reader on a pilgrimage ala The Canterbury Tales to discover the origins of man. As one of the world's most renowned evolutionary biologist, Dawkins has an encyclopedic knowledge of the topic. He is not shy about sharing his opinions not only about evolution, but also about conflicting theories, particularly those that are based in religion.

Also, through the many nagging question we're still left asking, and the methods of answering.It's a fascinating read. However, I found myself sometimes annoyed by Dawkins's self-references and his jabs at certain questionable belief systems. (We get it, Richard, creationists undermine the grandness of nature, and are generally utterly wrong, and very - very - frustrating, and you've dedicated yourself to ranting at them. Enough already.

Now I tend to agree with Dawkins politically but it really was incongruous and should have been edited out. Regardless, it was a very interesting book. "

The book's structure is original, and the message, as usual, highly relevant, but the repetitiveness that results from the coalescences gets annoying. Also, Dawkins has not gone to great lengths to make the book accessible. The level of the text is rather uneven.

They represent a narrowing-down from reality, an impoverishment of what the real world has to offer. I suspect that many who call themselves religious would find themselves agreeing with me. To them I would only quote a favourite remark that I overheard at a scientific conference. A distinguished elder statesman of my subject was having a long argument with a colleague. As the altercation came to an end, he twinkled and said, 'You know, we really do agree. It's just that you say it wrong!' I feel I have returned from a true pilgrimage.'And so I have been through my own pilgrimage. I am a solid supporter of evolution because it is based on facts and is more beautiful than anyone can imagine. Dawkins has outdone himself in this book, each chapter was an adventure, a mix of recalling my own knowledge and learning more. Some facts shook the very foundations of what I understood and others cemented what I knew but every single chapter was exciting and food for thought. I cannot think of a time where I did not close the book and spend time thinking about what I had learned. At times this book was full of too much information and I felt like a glass that was overflowing with water (knowledge) but I did not hesitate to keep reading. To learn and strive to understand the fascinating nuances of evolution and life. This book traces human evolution, from man to the smallest microbe, and along the way we met our 'cousins', and my what a strange family we have. But surely none of us would ever change it. From the biggest mammals to the smallest microbe, we are blessed with such a vast and amazing family. And at the very end of it all we learn one important thing. We are simply hosts, intricate and beautifully made, but simply tools to carry DNA. Although in truth even this explanation is too simple. Dawkins says it much better than I and certainly knows more than I can ever claim to know. But what I can say is simply this, for those willing to learn and embrace what Dawkins has to say, you will not be disappointed by the sheer amount evolution encompasses. But more importantly Dawkins has humbled me. The concept of ‘primitive’ life living today is an insult to the creatures we call primitive. They may have retained what we consider to be ‘primitive’ body shapes but as Dawkins explains, our cousins would not have kept these ‘primitive’ shapes and natures if they weren’t useful and actually ‘advanced’. An example is sharks, these creatures have barely changed their shapes for millions of years and yet they are not ‘primitive’ at all but clearly physiologically advanced killing machines. Although this is an insult too, sharks kill to eat, men kill more men than a shark kills. So, I will certainly make an effort to call any lifeform living today ‘primitive’. The one thing the book has left me with is a fascination for microbial life. To think bacteria may have invented a ‘wheel’ billions of years before us and yet we consider ourselves more advanced. We, ourselves, are nothing more than a collection of microbes and bacterium. Was order made from chaos as we believe or were microbes and bacteria similar to us before we built New York City, the Pyramids, the leaning tower of Pisa and other grand structures. Are we simply a landmark of microbial engineering? A tribute to the ingenuity of nature and the product of small lifeforms making grand marks on the world? These thoughts are both fascinating and humbling. I am certain there are some who see my wandering thoughts as silly or take them to think I have not truly absorbed the content of this book. But I have learned much, this book has much to teach should one choose to open the cover and read its pages. I will certainly not look at the world the same way again. 5/5. Would definitely recommend this book!"
500,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66376950-alyssa-tidwell,5," This book, The Ancestor’s Tale, takes a meandering stroll backward through our ancestry, from our current position in evolution to “concestor 0”, the common ancestor of all living things. Many factors were included in the text that help to explain the reasons that certain evolutionary theories exist, describe the evidence supporting them, and methods and experiments used to draw conclusions. The way in which this information was presented helps the reader to dive in and get into a scientific mindset.  Dawkins attentively wrote from a broad, philosophical perspective that I think is critical for understanding and paying due respect to evolution. One example of this that comes immediately to mind is the thought that evolution is not teleological; humans are not the apex of an evolution that has been striving towards humanity as a goal. We are not necessarily more complex and more evolved than any other creature. Different ways of living aren’t necessarily “primitive” because an organism's individual functions may be more or less complex than our own.  Later in the book, Dawkins also writes on the likelihood of physical characteristics evolving independently, and speculates on whether those traits would re-occur if we were to hit the reset button. This repeats the overarching theme that we are not special- our eyes, our ears, and our intelligence would evolve again. We can’t be so vain to think we’re special in comparison.Dawkins makes it all too clear that we organisms are all related, and presents myriad evidence for that stance- not only by tracking the ancestral lineage, but through evidence such as eukaryotic cellularity being so unlikely to happen, that it probably only happened once. In fact, he claims that it was more unlikely than the first spark of life itself. Another broad and encompassing idea that I feel was helpful in visualizing the larger scale of evolution is that similar species are connected by “rings” of intermediates. Gulls and salamanders are ideal examples of “ring species” in the spatial dimension, one phenotypic trait fading into the other over a given area, with the two extremes at either end so dissimilar that they are considered different species, even though intermediates between them are interbreeding. This is speculated to have occurred in all species throughout history, and is the way in which evolution occurs. I understood the swirled “map” through the concestor history as a visual representation of this interconnectedness; the spiraling branches cleverly representing the mathematical infinitude of genetic variation in a mandala-like fashion.  This book came jam-packed with little surprises and relatable stories. Some of these surprises included descriptions of how certain traits evolved, and how the animal with that trait lives or, like in the case of pterosaurs potentially using echolocation, lived. I enjoyed these little visits to the different animals, learning things like how the Platypus and the Star-Nosed Mole may perceive the world by mapping their spaces as we do visually, but using alternative sensory input. Relatable stories like how a fish expert reacted to a not-so-extinct coelacanth made the experiences human, making the stories memorable and relatable.  As a fan of the Hitchhiker’s Guide series, I was also surprised (and happy) to see Douglas Adams mentioned, and to learn new things about him. After learning that he and Dawkins were friends, I had to read Lament for Douglas. This was a wholly terrible idea as I became absurdly emotional while reading it. D’awwkins! Then again, I should have noticed his pithy writing style. I should have noticed the thought, appreciation, and respect that he afforded each creature throughout this book. This eloquent attention definitely showed his squishy side. I will be reading this again, and already sent a copy to my mom."
501,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13459886-yhc,5,"This book is definitely unlike all other Dawkins' book, or i should said maybe we can see very rarely a book so fully of information in a very well structured way. I would consider it as a book close to encyclopedia. A tool book that you could come back and forth to consult the chapters that interest you.So many to learn but the brain can not absorb all at once. I read in Chinese version, which many other readers complain about the translation not quite smooth, I got same feeling but it after all pretty academic book.39 rendez-vous( tales) with branch shape structure, here is the greatest show on earth. I enjoy a lot and will read it over and over. “Evolution, or its driving engine natural selection, has no foresight. In every generation within every species, the individuals best equipped to survive and reproduce contribute more than their fair share of genes to the next generation. The consequence, blind as it is, is the nearest approach to foresight that nature permits. [...] That’s the kind of thing natural selection does all the time. It is always tinkering: here shrinking a bit, there expanding a bit, constantly adjusting, putting on and taking off, optimising immediate reproductive success. Survival in future centuries doesn’t enter into the calculation, for the good reason that it isn’t really a calculation at all. It all happens automatically, as some genes survive in the gene pool and others don’t.” "
502,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57518342-krish-sanghvi,5,"So I will start by saying that this is the best natural history book I've ever read. It starts with Dawkins describing lee smolin's hypothesis of cosmic Darwinism, in which he explains how the universe itself could be formed by evolution through natural selection. This book is not only an ode to evolution and ecology, but also to human history, and explains various concepts in theses subjects wonderfully. Dawkins has taken the diversity of life that exists today, and through them, explained some excellent natural history theories, like sexual selection, molecular clocks, behaviour, drift, evolution of multicellularity, domestication, speciation, paedomorphosis, selfish genes etc. This book derives its style from chaucer's the Canterbury tales, which he has stated explicitly, multiple times. He treats each organism as a character, which has some story to tell us about itself, and about life in general. Most of these organisms have some weird and wonderful story to tell about their own life history, anatomy, or behaviour. He uses these stories to extrapolate what the common ancestor of these organisms and ourselves would be like, in what sort of world would that organism have lived, and what would cause it to evolve in such a way. I especially loved this style of writing, of using time as a theme, on scales of a couple billion years, and gradually describing time itself, by explaining events that happened then. Dawkins takes two approaches to describe this journey of ancestry- the gene's view and the individual's view, showing us how these two journeys can be extremely different and equally fascinating, and re-emphasising the point we often see him make: that we are just machines of our selfish genes, phenotypes for our genes to multiply, and we shouldn't look at it with contempt, but with wonder. In the end, he also talks about how one can differentiate between intelligent design and evolution via self assembly, natural selection, and heredity, and shows how it's impossible that an omnipotent creator exists, coz that poses the question of who created the creator (till ad infinitum). I loved how this form of reductionism under special phenomenon has been explained. This book is an amalgamation of ecology, geology, biology, palaeontology, biochemistry, genetics, and even cosmology and particle physics, showing how all these subjects eventually come together to create the world we live in today! And it showcases the rarely seen romanticist side of Dawkins.It's a really fun read, and a thorough review of biodiversity in general (for those interested in a slightly more academic reading).Dawkins also describes some major geological events in great detail, like the K-Pg extinction, oxygenation, and Cambrian explosion, providing alternative hypotheses to some mainstream theories. The book is very well researched, and I would highly recommend it to anyone with the slightest interest in natural sciences, or wants to cherish, understand, and be fascinated by, the diversity of life on Earth and its origins. P.S.- for whoever has read Dawkins before and has been fascinated by his works, but thinks that he is a condescending intellectual asshole (I was one of them), this book is a must read and will change your views about him. He always talk about how humbling nature can be, and how insignificant we are, but at the same time, we have the ability to question, understand and be fascinated by nature. It is really difficult to even imagine writing a book which has such depth, and covers such a vast spatial and temporal scale (from the beginning of life, to the vastness of the cosmos), and it's such a commendable effort on the writers part, to have given the readers this incredibly rich, profound, and accessible source of knowledge, even truth, if I may say, and I really hope that people will appreciate the profundity that this book is.P.P.S.- I especially liked the parts when Dawkins has spoken about some core concepts in ecology and evolution, and some times even metaphysics (meaning of life, definition of life and all that jazz) from organisms we see [usually ignore] around us. I also loved the last few rendezvous, and Canterbury and the host's return, in which he shows how complex and fascinating bacteria and archaea can be, and how they have invented everything before us, using their chemical prowess, hence showing us the beauty of biochemistry, and molecular evolution, and making us question how such beautiful and complex things could arise, and making us think about our origins and that of everything else. I also enjoyed the early primordial earth part, in which he talks about oxygenation, replicators and life existing at a very biochemical level, and the conditions that were required for this primordial life to evolve into what we see today. He also speaks about the course of evolution, providing alternate hypothesis to discuss whether evolution has preferences, which will always cause life to converge upon something similar to that on earth, or whether evolution is truly random, and requires some major events (formation of cells, extinctions etc.) to converge. He also talks about a concept which was completely new to me: evolvability, which is the ability of evolution itself to evolve to allow 'better' evolution. P.P.P.S.- this book took me about 6 months to complete and is a really long undertaking, which requires lots of commitment and thinking on the readers part. It also bombards you with tons of information, and non biologists may find unfamiliar terms and concepts quite intimidating, and I'll suggest one reads other books on evolution (the greatest show on earth would be a great start), before they start with this one.Also, in this book, Dawkins has cited a great number of people and books, who have produced many of the fundamental theories we use today, and it has really helped me expand my bookshelves and wish list""My objection to supernatural beliefs is precisely because they miserably fail to do justice to the sublime grandeur of the real world"" - the ancestor's tale; it's been such a wonderful journey.!I've always been amazed by the fact that the universe, and all life in it, is a product of something so beautiful, elegant, and simple. There really IS grandeur In this view of life."
503,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17460041-hal-sitt,4,"This is my 2nd Dawkins book after Selfish Gene. Selfish Gene was fantastic in its dizzying array of super cool examples from nature. I really finished that book with a renewed appreciation of how much evolutionary biology was at work in the world around me.Ancestor's Tale is an equally illuminating book but differs from Selfish Gene in its scope and depth. It has a much wider scope but also definitely has less depth. In Ancestor's Dawkins takes us from modern humans to the ancestors of all living things and along the way he uses the ""pilgrims"" on this journey to teach us about things like gene duplication, geographical isolation, tectonic shifts, convergent evolution, etc. Since he sets out on such a long journey, he cannot without adding pages to this already 700 page tome, stop for too long at any one stop. The result is that he sometimes has to sacrifice depth for scope. By no means is this a bad thing. It is simply the nature of a book of large scope. My favorite examples of this are the duplication history of the hemoglobin genes and the effect of plate tectonics on evolution. I wanted to hear more about these but had to move on. Ancestor's really gives an excellent big picture and opened my eyes to so many areas that I want to read more about. I think this is always a sign of a great book"
504,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24009998-julie-decker,4,"Richard Dawkins, whose work in biology is among the most famous of contemporary scientists, pens a tale here loosely based on the format of the Canterbury Tales, taking us back in time through branches of evolution to show us our ancestors. Beginning with humans and rewinding, we take a journey to ""meet"" creatures with whom we share a common ancestor, with explanations of when our timelines ""join"" and what we have in common, along with various trivia and anecdotes about what makes each one special. Much like evolution itself, the small stories create a big picture to help us understand how the evolutionary process works. It's long-winded and thick to get through, but the spots of information were often delightfully interesting and lightheartedly told, and to be fair I'm not exactly the perfect audience for the book. I can follow what's happening like any textbook in a subject I don't specialize in, but as a layperson the terminology and experimental methodology sometimes went over my head. I enjoyed both the content and the telling, even though it took me over a month of bus-ride reads to finally get to the end."
505,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64464797-heather,3,"This book certainly contains an abundance of incredibly interesting information. The whole structure of his ""pilgrimage"" is very engaging, and he seems (mostly) capable of synthesizing complicated information for a less scientifically-literate audience. These qualities are what saves this book from the otherwise poisonously obnoxious attitude of Dawkins that tends to waft from the pages. I really wanted to like all of this book, but WAY too much of Richard Dawkins came through. Actually, what let me to even go for this book was the dual authorship. I mean, Dawkins is a smart guy, but all this anti-God stuff just seems too basic for him. Bashing religion is cheap, low-hanging fruit and it's obvious to anyone as smart as Dawkins that the whole set-up of the atheism/theism debate makes it fundamentally unsettle-able.You'll have pages of WAY too much detail (almost an arrogant level of detail, in places) followed by a casual swipe directly at creationists, as if they are reading this book. Really. Dawkins is a really smart guy, with brilliant knowledge and imaginative ideas (I think he would enthusiastically agree with this), but he just can't help himself."
506,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68316850-gavin,4,"Loads of lovely examples and vivid analogies. The sidebar on races is surprisingly careful and illuminating - that portion of the phenomenon that's genetic is more straightforward than I’d thought, in my Arts student way. (Though his placid definitiveness about the social interpretation is obvs controversial as hell. He’s a strict philosophical eliminativist, implying that the harm resulting from reifying race totally outweighs all gains from positive discrimination. This is unclear to say the least.) I hadn’t heard of the ‘two-fold cost’ of sex before, super-interesting. Not as snarky as you’d expect, and full of alternative perspectives so long as they’re other evolutionists’ perspectives. "
507,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36297846-wing,4,"Reading this updated edition ten years after reading the first is a true delight. Most of the updates are based on interval advancements in molecular genetics. This tome debunks misunderstandings of how evolution actually works and demonstrates why concepts that have been simplified can be misleading. It demands abstract reasoning from the reader and allows the beauty of the underpinning mathematics to shine out elegantly. As promised, it de-anthropocentrises our ill-conceived “preeminence” by tracing the history of the Tree of Life backwards. Even though “individuals are temporary meeting points on the crisscrossing routes that gene takes through history”, the whole story actually very subtly suggests, I believe, that sentience is an evolutionary convergence. A sense of serendipity and inevitability permeates the whole account. Interspersed by the authors' quips, musings, and dry humour, the book comprehensively clarifies the science of evolution through a plethora of insights and a pastiche of intellectual exercises. After reading it, it is hard not to end up being awed by the elegant complexity that colours Life on Earth. Four stars."
508,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81221576-diogenescfg,5,"Five stars seems unfair for a book so well written as The Ancestors Tale.Richard Dawkins takes us in a trip thousands or millions of years into the past, were we meet the common ancestors of current species, which he calls concestors. Starting with the humans, our closest relatives are chimpanzees and bonobos (concestor 1), followed by the common concestor between humans, chimpanzees and gorillas, who join in at concestor two.so on, several concestors meet our journey, from placental mammals, to marsupials, all the way down to starfish, molluscs, jellyfish, eubacteria and, finally, the first life form on earth.Sure, we can only speculate what this concestors could have looked like, based on the fossil record (when available), and triangulation techniques. However, much is said as to why we diverged from the rest of the populatoonat each concestor's rendez vouz, how natural selection pressure might have taken species in different directions, and what that tells us about ourselves as humans (hlmo sapiens).Be prepared for a long book, but full with interesting information that blows your mind at every page turn (if, like me, you are no biologist, nor anything close)"
509,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1190645-andrew-walter,5,"In classic 90's UK comedy programme Bottom there is a great moment when perspiring, lank haired comedy genius Rik Mayall, in the character of perspiring, lank haired pervy virgin Richie postulates:""I could have been a chess champion you know. If I'd spent my whole life learning how to play chess better than anyone else in the world I could have been a chess champion. And I look a bit slavic, don't you think?""Slavic countenances aside, this touches on how a reading of Dawkins' monumental work  The Ancestor's Tale made me feel. Yes, it is a tracing from all of the flora and fauna of the present day back into the origin of life on this planet, and so is at least a little daunting to those that don't make their living in the biological sciences. However Dawkins presents it to us in such a way as to ensure it is understood by the lay reader, and does so in such a way that you really feel as if you get it. Another reviewer on this site wonders if reading this book when they were at school would have turned them on to a career in biology, and I know exactly what they mean. You are a staggered by the awesome diversity of life throughout time but also by the awesomely succinct and economical nature of it all. I could have been an evolutionary biologist, you know.This is my first experience with the man's work, and as a sort of ""wannabe snob"", not to mention an athiest who is given to rolling his eyes in what he thinks is a droll manner every time the media seize on topics of ""hot debate"", I was fairly sick of hearing about The God Delusion, which I will probably read in about two decades if I ever do at all. Blithering dunderhead that I am, I actually didn't realise that he had written so many books about the science of life, but I'll lazily use the media as a scapegoat to explain how I'd pigeonholed him as a waffling antagonist endlessly stating what I consider to be the obvious (that creationism is nonsense). A brief conversation with my flat-mate about evolution and extremely intelligent men doing their reputations no favours, and a brief flick through of this book was enough to make me interested-I was sold on the idea alone.As other reviews on the site will no doubt make clear, the idea is at least in theory a reverse pilgrimage in the style of The Canterbury Tales, with different life forms used for ""tales"" demonstrating evolutionary theory in all of its glory. Many have remarked that this theme is somewhat clumsily applied, and that the ""tales"" diverge into areas not concerning the titular animal at all-I would remind these readers that it is at base book about EVOLUTION rather than anything else, so in depth discussions of the way that particular creatures live is only used to bolster certain points. Chapter headings aside, the Canterbury Tales metaphor is really used as nothing more than a framework throughout, with even the author poking fun at the potentially slightly twee nature of the ""pilgrimage"".There is nothing here I couldn't understand on a couple of re-readings, even with the atrophied knowledge furnished by a distant D grade in A-level biology (I blame sex in various guises for this, meeting a a girlfriend in my class on the one hand, and my Biology teacher getting my English Language teacher pregnant on the other) The writing is extremely informative, infectiously enthusiastic and at all times, careful not to patronise. A brief run through on the extreme basics of the structure of atoms and atomic decay in order to explain carbon dating is just one example; I know I needed reminding. The great level of detail presented does, admittedly, mean that it may not all stick at once, and you may find yourself turning back to refresh yourself on some points, but on the whole it is as much of a ""page-turner"" as a scientific work will ever be.It did take me a good six weeks to read, and a large part of this was I was anxious not to skim anything. I'll admit that this is a bad habit of mine if I am not fully engaged with a subject-mainly due to the inherent laziness of my mind, but here it wasn't even an issue, nothing felt slow or a drag. It is an incredibly rich piece of popular science writing (which I suppose you could say is sort of inevitable given the subject matter of ""every living thing on the face of the planet and where they sprung from"") , and is not afraid to present concepts that will make you stretch slightly to understand them, as well as the odd quirky aside ( eg: Anteaters utilise the fomic acid present in the ants they eat rather than bother to produce their own stomach acids ) that manage to be relevant as well as fully primed for use in awkward moments at parties.My one criticism here is that some of the demonstrations of how various methods of research are undertaken are left until right near the end of the book. We are given a brief summing up of ways in which prehistoric flora and fauna can be categorised and dated before the ""pilgrimage"" begins, but I was itching to know just how carbon dating and the dating of tree rings worked, and in particular how the ""molecular clock"" is calibrated and used. Findings using these methods are presented in every chapter of the book, but you don't have a really precise idea of HOW they work until you have read The Gibbon's Tale, The Redwood's Tale, and the Epilogue to the Velvet Worm's Tale. This was probably done to avoid overwhelming the reader, as these three chapters are definitely the heaviest in the book, but I did find it mildly frustrating to have to wait that long. Some readers may want to read these chapters first.In all though, it's an incredible read, and truly mind expanding for anyone that has questions about just how it all (or at least a hell of a lot of it) fits together. This is the work of a man who loves life and living forms with every eukaryotic organelle in his body, who is feverishly anxious to impart some of this passion to an interested lay audience. Sublime."

They represent a narrowing-down from reality, an impoverishment of what the real world has to offer. I suspect that many who call themselves religious would find themselves agreeing with me. To them I would only quote a favourite remark that I overheard at a scientific conference. A distinguished elder statesman of my subject was having a long argument with a colleague. As the altercation came to an end, he twinkled and said, 'You know, we really do agree. It's just that you say it wrong!' I feel I have returned from a true pilgrimage.'And so I have been through my own pilgrimage. I am a solid supporter of evolution because it is based on facts and is more beautiful than anyone can imagine. Dawkins has outdone himself in this book, each chapter was an adventure, a mix of recalling my own knowledge and learning more. Some facts shook the very foundations of what I understood and others cemented what I knew but every single chapter was exciting and food for thought. I cannot think of a time where I did not close the book and spend time thinking about what I had learned. At times this book was full of too much information and I felt like a glass that was overflowing with water (knowledge) but I did not hesitate to keep reading. To learn and strive to understand the fascinating nuances of evolution and life. This book traces human evolution, from man to the smallest microbe, and along the way we met our 'cousins', and my what a strange family we have. But surely none of us would ever change it. From the biggest mammals to the smallest microbe, we are blessed with such a vast and amazing family. And at the very end of it all we learn one important thing. We are simply hosts, intricate and beautifully made, but simply tools to carry DNA. Although in truth even this explanation is too simple. Dawkins says it much better than I and certainly knows more than I can ever claim to know. But what I can say is simply this, for those willing to learn and embrace what Dawkins has to say, you will not be disappointed by the sheer amount evolution encompasses. But more importantly Dawkins has humbled me. The concept of ‘primitive’ life living today is an insult to the creatures we call primitive. They may have retained what we consider to be ‘primitive’ body shapes but as Dawkins explains, our cousins would not have kept these ‘primitive’ shapes and natures if they weren’t useful and actually ‘advanced’. An example is sharks, these creatures have barely changed their shapes for millions of years and yet they are not ‘primitive’ at all but clearly physiologically advanced killing machines. Although this is an insult too, sharks kill to eat, men kill more men than a shark kills. So, I will certainly make an effort to call any lifeform living today ‘primitive’. The one thing the book has left me with is a fascination for microbial life. To think bacteria may have invented a ‘wheel’ billions of years before us and yet we consider ourselves more advanced. We, ourselves, are nothing more than a collection of microbes and bacterium. Was order made from chaos as we believe or were microbes and bacteria similar to us before we built New York City, the Pyramids, the leaning tower of Pisa and other grand structures. Are we simply a landmark of microbial engineering? A tribute to the ingenuity of nature and the product of small lifeforms making grand marks on the world? These thoughts are both fascinating and humbling. I am certain there are some who see my wandering thoughts as silly or take them to think I have not truly absorbed the content of this book. But I have learned much, this book has much to teach should one choose to open the cover and read its pages. I will certainly not look at the world the same way again. 5/5. Would definitely recommend this book!"
530,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66376950-alyssa-tidwell,5," This book, The Ancestor’s Tale, takes a meandering stroll backward through our ancestry, from our current position in evolution to “concestor 0”, the common ancestor of all living things. Many factors were included in the text that help to explain the reasons that certain evolutionary theories exist, describe the evidence supporting them, and methods and experiments used to draw conclusions. The way in which this information was presented helps the reader to dive in and get into a scientific mindset.  Dawkins attentively wrote from a broad, philosophical perspective that I think is critical for understanding and paying due respect to evolution. One example of this that comes immediately to mind is the thought that evolution is not teleological; humans are not the apex of an evolution that has been striving towards humanity as a goal. We are not necessarily more complex and more evolved than any other creature. Different ways of living aren’t necessarily “primitive” because an organism's individual functions may be more or less complex than our own.  Later in the book, Dawkins also writes on the likelihood of physical characteristics evolving independently, and speculates on whether those traits would re-occur if we were to hit the reset button. This repeats the overarching theme that we are not special- our eyes, our ears, and our intelligence would evolve again. We can’t be so vain to think we’re special in comparison.Dawkins makes it all too clear that we organisms are all related, and presents myriad evidence for that stance- not only by tracking the ancestral lineage, but through evidence such as eukaryotic cellularity being so unlikely to happen, that it probably only happened once. In fact, he claims that it was more unlikely than the first spark of life itself. Another broad and encompassing idea that I feel was helpful in visualizing the larger scale of evolution is that similar species are connected by “rings” of intermediates. Gulls and salamanders are ideal examples of “ring species” in the spatial dimension, one phenotypic trait fading into the other over a given area, with the two extremes at either end so dissimilar that they are considered different species, even though intermediates between them are interbreeding. This is speculated to have occurred in all species throughout history, and is the way in which evolution occurs. I understood the swirled “map” through the concestor history as a visual representation of this interconnectedness; the spiraling branches cleverly representing the mathematical infinitude of genetic variation in a mandala-like fashion.  This book came jam-packed with little surprises and relatable stories. Some of these surprises included descriptions of how certain traits evolved, and how the animal with that trait lives or, like in the case of pterosaurs potentially using echolocation, lived. I enjoyed these little visits to the different animals, learning things like how the Platypus and the Star-Nosed Mole may perceive the world by mapping their spaces as we do visually, but using alternative sensory input. Relatable stories like how a fish expert reacted to a not-so-extinct coelacanth made the experiences human, making the stories memorable and relatable.  As a fan of the Hitchhiker’s Guide series, I was also surprised (and happy) to see Douglas Adams mentioned, and to learn new things about him. After learning that he and Dawkins were friends, I had to read Lament for Douglas. This was a wholly terrible idea as I became absurdly emotional while reading it. D’awwkins! Then again, I should have noticed his pithy writing style. I should have noticed the thought, appreciation, and respect that he afforded each creature throughout this book. This eloquent attention definitely showed his squishy side. I will be reading this again, and already sent a copy to my mom."
531,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13459886-yhc,5,"This book is definitely unlike all other Dawkins' book, or i should said maybe we can see very rarely a book so fully of information in a very well structured way. I would consider it as a book close to encyclopedia. A tool book that you could come back and forth to consult the chapters that interest you.So many to learn but the brain can not absorb all at once. I read in Chinese version, which many other readers complain about the translation not quite smooth, I got same feeling but it after all pretty academic book.39 rendez-vous( tales) with branch shape structure, here is the greatest show on earth. I enjoy a lot and will read it over and over. “Evolution, or its driving engine natural selection, has no foresight. In every generation within every species, the individuals best equipped to survive and reproduce contribute more than their fair share of genes to the next generation. The consequence, blind as it is, is the nearest approach to foresight that nature permits. [...] That’s the kind of thing natural selection does all the time. It is always tinkering: here shrinking a bit, there expanding a bit, constantly adjusting, putting on and taking off, optimising immediate reproductive success. Survival in future centuries doesn’t enter into the calculation, for the good reason that it isn’t really a calculation at all. It all happens automatically, as some genes survive in the gene pool and others don’t.” "
532,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57518342-krish-sanghvi,5,"So I will start by saying that this is the best natural history book I've ever read. It starts with Dawkins describing lee smolin's hypothesis of cosmic Darwinism, in which he explains how the universe itself could be formed by evolution through natural selection. This book is not only an ode to evolution and ecology, but also to human history, and explains various concepts in theses subjects wonderfully. Dawkins has taken the diversity of life that exists today, and through them, explained some excellent natural history theories, like sexual selection, molecular clocks, behaviour, drift, evolution of multicellularity, domestication, speciation, paedomorphosis, selfish genes etc. This book derives its style from chaucer's the Canterbury tales, which he has stated explicitly, multiple times. He treats each organism as a character, which has some story to tell us about itself, and about life in general. Most of these organisms have some weird and wonderful story to tell about their own life history, anatomy, or behaviour. He uses these stories to extrapolate what the common ancestor of these organisms and ourselves would be like, in what sort of world would that organism have lived, and what would cause it to evolve in such a way. I especially loved this style of writing, of using time as a theme, on scales of a couple billion years, and gradually describing time itself, by explaining events that happened then. Dawkins takes two approaches to describe this journey of ancestry- the gene's view and the individual's view, showing us how these two journeys can be extremely different and equally fascinating, and re-emphasising the point we often see him make: that we are just machines of our selfish genes, phenotypes for our genes to multiply, and we shouldn't look at it with contempt, but with wonder. In the end, he also talks about how one can differentiate between intelligent design and evolution via self assembly, natural selection, and heredity, and shows how it's impossible that an omnipotent creator exists, coz that poses the question of who created the creator (till ad infinitum). I loved how this form of reductionism under special phenomenon has been explained. This book is an amalgamation of ecology, geology, biology, palaeontology, biochemistry, genetics, and even cosmology and particle physics, showing how all these subjects eventually come together to create the world we live in today! And it showcases the rarely seen romanticist side of Dawkins.It's a really fun read, and a thorough review of biodiversity in general (for those interested in a slightly more academic reading).Dawkins also describes some major geological events in great detail, like the K-Pg extinction, oxygenation, and Cambrian explosion, providing alternative hypotheses to some mainstream theories. The book is very well researched, and I would highly recommend it to anyone with the slightest interest in natural sciences, or wants to cherish, understand, and be fascinated by, the diversity of life on Earth and its origins. P.S.- for whoever has read Dawkins before and has been fascinated by his works, but thinks that he is a condescending intellectual asshole (I was one of them), this book is a must read and will change your views about him. He always talk about how humbling nature can be, and how insignificant we are, but at the same time, we have the ability to question, understand and be fascinated by nature. It is really difficult to even imagine writing a book which has such depth, and covers such a vast spatial and temporal scale (from the beginning of life, to the vastness of the cosmos), and it's such a commendable effort on the writers part, to have given the readers this incredibly rich, profound, and accessible source of knowledge, even truth, if I may say, and I really hope that people will appreciate the profundity that this book is.P.P.S.- I especially liked the parts when Dawkins has spoken about some core concepts in ecology and evolution, and some times even metaphysics (meaning of life, definition of life and all that jazz) from organisms we see [usually ignore] around us. I also loved the last few rendezvous, and Canterbury and the host's return, in which he shows how complex and fascinating bacteria and archaea can be, and how they have invented everything before us, using their chemical prowess, hence showing us the beauty of biochemistry, and molecular evolution, and making us question how such beautiful and complex things could arise, and making us think about our origins and that of everything else. I also enjoyed the early primordial earth part, in which he talks about oxygenation, replicators and life existing at a very biochemical level, and the conditions that were required for this primordial life to evolve into what we see today. He also speaks about the course of evolution, providing alternate hypothesis to discuss whether evolution has preferences, which will always cause life to converge upon something similar to that on earth, or whether evolution is truly random, and requires some major events (formation of cells, extinctions etc.) to converge. He also talks about a concept which was completely new to me: evolvability, which is the ability of evolution itself to evolve to allow 'better' evolution. P.P.P.S.- this book took me about 6 months to complete and is a really long undertaking, which requires lots of commitment and thinking on the readers part. It also bombards you with tons of information, and non biologists may find unfamiliar terms and concepts quite intimidating, and I'll suggest one reads other books on evolution (the greatest show on earth would be a great start), before they start with this one.Also, in this book, Dawkins has cited a great number of people and books, who have produced many of the fundamental theories we use today, and it has really helped me expand my bookshelves and wish list""My objection to supernatural beliefs is precisely because they miserably fail to do justice to the sublime grandeur of the real world"" - the ancestor's tale; it's been such a wonderful journey.!I've always been amazed by the fact that the universe, and all life in it, is a product of something so beautiful, elegant, and simple. There really IS grandeur In this view of life."
533,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17460041-hal-sitt,4,"This is my 2nd Dawkins book after Selfish Gene. Selfish Gene was fantastic in its dizzying array of super cool examples from nature. I really finished that book with a renewed appreciation of how much evolutionary biology was at work in the world around me.Ancestor's Tale is an equally illuminating book but differs from Selfish Gene in its scope and depth. It has a much wider scope but also definitely has less depth. In Ancestor's Dawkins takes us from modern humans to the ancestors of all living things and along the way he uses the ""pilgrims"" on this journey to teach us about things like gene duplication, geographical isolation, tectonic shifts, convergent evolution, etc. Since he sets out on such a long journey, he cannot without adding pages to this already 700 page tome, stop for too long at any one stop. The result is that he sometimes has to sacrifice depth for scope. By no means is this a bad thing. It is simply the nature of a book of large scope. My favorite examples of this are the duplication history of the hemoglobin genes and the effect of plate tectonics on evolution. I wanted to hear more about these but had to move on. Ancestor's really gives an excellent big picture and opened my eyes to so many areas that I want to read more about. I think this is always a sign of a great book"
534,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24009998-julie-decker,4,"Richard Dawkins, whose work in biology is among the most famous of contemporary scientists, pens a tale here loosely based on the format of the Canterbury Tales, taking us back in time through branches of evolution to show us our ancestors. Beginning with humans and rewinding, we take a journey to ""meet"" creatures with whom we share a common ancestor, with explanations of when our timelines ""join"" and what we have in common, along with various trivia and anecdotes about what makes each one special. Much like evolution itself, the small stories create a big picture to help us understand how the evolutionary process works. It's long-winded and thick to get through, but the spots of information were often delightfully interesting and lightheartedly told, and to be fair I'm not exactly the perfect audience for the book. I can follow what's happening like any textbook in a subject I don't specialize in, but as a layperson the terminology and experimental methodology sometimes went over my head. I enjoyed both the content and the telling, even though it took me over a month of bus-ride reads to finally get to the end."
535,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64464797-heather,3,"This book certainly contains an abundance of incredibly interesting information. The whole structure of his ""pilgrimage"" is very engaging, and he seems (mostly) capable of synthesizing complicated information for a less scientifically-literate audience. These qualities are what saves this book from the otherwise poisonously obnoxious attitude of Dawkins that tends to waft from the pages. I really wanted to like all of this book, but WAY too much of Richard Dawkins came through. Actually, what let me to even go for this book was the dual authorship. I mean, Dawkins is a smart guy, but all this anti-God stuff just seems too basic for him. Bashing religion is cheap, low-hanging fruit and it's obvious to anyone as smart as Dawkins that the whole set-up of the atheism/theism debate makes it fundamentally unsettle-able.You'll have pages of WAY too much detail (almost an arrogant level of detail, in places) followed by a casual swipe directly at creationists, as if they are reading this book. Really. Dawkins is a really smart guy, with brilliant knowledge and imaginative ideas (I think he would enthusiastically agree with this), but he just can't help himself."
536,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68316850-gavin,4,"Loads of lovely examples and vivid analogies. The sidebar on races is surprisingly careful and illuminating - that portion of the phenomenon that's genetic is more straightforward than I’d thought, in my Arts student way. (Though his placid definitiveness about the social interpretation is obvs controversial as hell. He’s a strict philosophical eliminativist, implying that the harm resulting from reifying race totally outweighs all gains from positive discrimination. This is unclear to say the least.) I hadn’t heard of the ‘two-fold cost’ of sex before, super-interesting. Not as snarky as you’d expect, and full of alternative perspectives so long as they’re other evolutionists’ perspectives. "
537,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36297846-wing,4,"Reading this updated edition ten years after reading the first is a true delight. Most of the updates are based on interval advancements in molecular genetics. This tome debunks misunderstandings of how evolution actually works and demonstrates why concepts that have been simplified can be misleading. It demands abstract reasoning from the reader and allows the beauty of the underpinning mathematics to shine out elegantly. As promised, it de-anthropocentrises our ill-conceived “preeminence” by tracing the history of the Tree of Life backwards. Even though “individuals are temporary meeting points on the crisscrossing routes that gene takes through history”, the whole story actually very subtly suggests, I believe, that sentience is an evolutionary convergence. A sense of serendipity and inevitability permeates the whole account. Interspersed by the authors' quips, musings, and dry humour, the book comprehensively clarifies the science of evolution through a plethora of insights and a pastiche of intellectual exercises. After reading it, it is hard not to end up being awed by the elegant complexity that colours Life on Earth. Four stars."

Starting with the humans, our closest relatives are chimpanzees and bonobos (concestor 1), followed by the common concestor between humans, chimpanzees and gorillas, who join in at concestor two.so on, several concestors meet our journey, from placental mammals, to marsupials, all the way down to starfish, molluscs, jellyfish, eubacteria and, finally, the first life form on earth.Sure, we can only speculate what this concestors could have looked like, based on the fossil record (when available), and triangulation techniques. However, much is said as to why we diverged from the rest of the populatoonat each concestor's rendez vouz, how natural selection pressure might have taken species in different directions, and what that tells us about ourselves as humans (hlmo sapiens).Be prepared for a long book, but full with interesting information that blows your mind at every page turn (if, like me, you are no biologist, nor anything close)"
539,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1190645-andrew-walter,5,"In classic 90's UK comedy programme Bottom there is a great moment when perspiring, lank haired comedy genius Rik Mayall, in the character of perspiring, lank haired pervy virgin Richie postulates:""I could have been a chess champion you know. If I'd spent my whole life learning how to play chess better than anyone else in the world I could have been a chess champion. And I look a bit slavic, don't you think?""Slavic countenances aside, this touches on how a reading of Dawkins' monumental work  The Ancestor's Tale made me feel. Yes, it is a tracing from all of the flora and fauna of the present day back into the origin of life on this planet, and so is at least a little daunting to those that don't make their living in the biological sciences. However Dawkins presents it to us in such a way as to ensure it is understood by the lay reader, and does so in such a way that you really feel as if you get it. Another reviewer on this site wonders if reading this book when they were at school would have turned them on to a career in biology, and I know exactly what they mean. You are a staggered by the awesome diversity of life throughout time but also by the awesomely succinct and economical nature of it all. I could have been an evolutionary biologist, you know.This is my first experience with the man's work, and as a sort of ""wannabe snob"", not to mention an athiest who is given to rolling his eyes in what he thinks is a droll manner every time the media seize on topics of ""hot debate"", I was fairly sick of hearing about The God Delusion, which I will probably read in about two decades if I ever do at all. Blithering dunderhead that I am, I actually didn't realise that he had written so many books about the science of life, but I'll lazily use the media as a scapegoat to explain how I'd pigeonholed him as a waffling antagonist endlessly stating what I consider to be the obvious (that creationism is nonsense). A brief conversation with my flat-mate about evolution and extremely intelligent men doing their reputations no favours, and a brief flick through of this book was enough to make me interested-I was sold on the idea alone.As other reviews on the site will no doubt make clear, the idea is at least in theory a reverse pilgrimage in the style of The Canterbury Tales, with different life forms used for ""tales"" demonstrating evolutionary theory in all of its glory. Many have remarked that this theme is somewhat clumsily applied, and that the ""tales"" diverge into areas not concerning the titular animal at all-I would remind these readers that it is at base book about EVOLUTION rather than anything else, so in depth discussions of the way that particular creatures live is only used to bolster certain points. Chapter headings aside, the Canterbury Tales metaphor is really used as nothing more than a framework throughout, with even the author poking fun at the potentially slightly twee nature of the ""pilgrimage"".There is nothing here I couldn't understand on a couple of re-readings, even with the atrophied knowledge furnished by a distant D grade in A-level biology (I blame sex in various guises for this, meeting a a girlfriend in my class on the one hand, and my Biology teacher getting my English Language teacher pregnant on the other) The writing is extremely informative, infectiously enthusiastic and at all times, careful not to patronise. A brief run through on the extreme basics of the structure of atoms and atomic decay in order to explain carbon dating is just one example; I know I needed reminding. The great level of detail presented does, admittedly, mean that it may not all stick at once, and you may find yourself turning back to refresh yourself on some points, but on the whole it is as much of a ""page-turner"" as a scientific work will ever be.It did take me a good six weeks to read, and a large part of this was I was anxious not to skim anything. I'll admit that this is a bad habit of mine if I am not fully engaged with a subject-mainly due to the inherent laziness of my mind, but here it wasn't even an issue, nothing felt slow or a drag. It is an incredibly rich piece of popular science writing (which I suppose you could say is sort of inevitable given the subject matter of ""every living thing on the face of the planet and where they sprung from"") , and is not afraid to present concepts that will make you stretch slightly to understand them, as well as the odd quirky aside ( eg: Anteaters utilise the fomic acid present in the ants they eat rather than bother to produce their own stomach acids ) that manage to be relevant as well as fully primed for use in awkward moments at parties.My one criticism here is that some of the demonstrations of how various methods of research are undertaken are left until right near the end of the book. We are given a brief summing up of ways in which prehistoric flora and fauna can be categorised and dated before the ""pilgrimage"" begins, but I was itching to know just how carbon dating and the dating of tree rings worked, and in particular how the ""molecular clock"" is calibrated and used. Findings using these methods are presented in every chapter of the book, but you don't have a really precise idea of HOW they work until you have read The Gibbon's Tale, The Redwood's Tale, and the Epilogue to the Velvet Worm's Tale. This was probably done to avoid overwhelming the reader, as these three chapters are definitely the heaviest in the book, but I did find it mildly frustrating to have to wait that long. Some readers may want to read these chapters first.In all though, it's an incredible read, and truly mind expanding for anyone that has questions about just how it all (or at least a hell of a lot of it) fits together. This is the work of a man who loves life and living forms with every eukaryotic organelle in his body, who is feverishly anxious to impart some of this passion to an interested lay audience. Sublime."

They represent a narrowing-down from reality, an impoverishment of what the real world has to offer. I suspect that many who call themselves religious would find themselves agreeing with me. To them I would only quote a favourite remark that I overheard at a scientific conference. A distinguished elder statesman of my subject was having a long argument with a colleague. As the altercation came to an end, he twinkled and said, 'You know, we really do agree. It's just that you say it wrong!' I feel I have returned from a true pilgrimage.'And so I have been through my own pilgrimage. I am a solid supporter of evolution because it is based on facts and is more beautiful than anyone can imagine. Dawkins has outdone himself in this book, each chapter was an adventure, a mix of recalling my own knowledge and learning more. Some facts shook the very foundations of what I understood and others cemented what I knew but every single chapter was exciting and food for thought. I cannot think of a time where I did not close the book and spend time thinking about what I had learned. At times this book was full of too much information and I felt like a glass that was overflowing with water (knowledge) but I did not hesitate to keep reading. To learn and strive to understand the fascinating nuances of evolution and life. This book traces human evolution, from man to the smallest microbe, and along the way we met our 'cousins', and my what a strange family we have. But surely none of us would ever change it. From the biggest mammals to the smallest microbe, we are blessed with such a vast and amazing family. And at the very end of it all we learn one important thing. We are simply hosts, intricate and beautifully made, but simply tools to carry DNA. Although in truth even this explanation is too simple. Dawkins says it much better than I and certainly knows more than I can ever claim to know. But what I can say is simply this, for those willing to learn and embrace what Dawkins has to say, you will not be disappointed by the sheer amount evolution encompasses. But more importantly Dawkins has humbled me. The concept of ‘primitive’ life living today is an insult to the creatures we call primitive. They may have retained what we consider to be ‘primitive’ body shapes but as Dawkins explains, our cousins would not have kept these ‘primitive’ shapes and natures if they weren’t useful and actually ‘advanced’. An example is sharks, these creatures have barely changed their shapes for millions of years and yet they are not ‘primitive’ at all but clearly physiologically advanced killing machines. Although this is an insult too, sharks kill to eat, men kill more men than a shark kills. So, I will certainly make an effort to call any lifeform living today ‘primitive’. The one thing the book has left me with is a fascination for microbial life. To think bacteria may have invented a ‘wheel’ billions of years before us and yet we consider ourselves more advanced. We, ourselves, are nothing more than a collection of microbes and bacterium. Was order made from chaos as we believe or were microbes and bacteria similar to us before we built New York City, the Pyramids, the leaning tower of Pisa and other grand structures. Are we simply a landmark of microbial engineering? A tribute to the ingenuity of nature and the product of small lifeforms making grand marks on the world? These thoughts are both fascinating and humbling. I am certain there are some who see my wandering thoughts as silly or take them to think I have not truly absorbed the content of this book. But I have learned much, this book has much to teach should one choose to open the cover and read its pages. I will certainly not look at the world the same way again. 5/5. Would definitely recommend this book!"
560,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66376950-alyssa-tidwell,5," This book, The Ancestor’s Tale, takes a meandering stroll backward through our ancestry, from our current position in evolution to “concestor 0”, the common ancestor of all living things. Many factors were included in the text that help to explain the reasons that certain evolutionary theories exist, describe the evidence supporting them, and methods and experiments used to draw conclusions. The way in which this information was presented helps the reader to dive in and get into a scientific mindset.  Dawkins attentively wrote from a broad, philosophical perspective that I think is critical for understanding and paying due respect to evolution. One example of this that comes immediately to mind is the thought that evolution is not teleological; humans are not the apex of an evolution that has been striving towards humanity as a goal. We are not necessarily more complex and more evolved than any other creature. Different ways of living aren’t necessarily “primitive” because an organism's individual functions may be more or less complex than our own.  Later in the book, Dawkins also writes on the likelihood of physical characteristics evolving independently, and speculates on whether those traits would re-occur if we were to hit the reset button. This repeats the overarching theme that we are not special- our eyes, our ears, and our intelligence would evolve again. We can’t be so vain to think we’re special in comparison.Dawkins makes it all too clear that we organisms are all related, and presents myriad evidence for that stance- not only by tracking the ancestral lineage, but through evidence such as eukaryotic cellularity being so unlikely to happen, that it probably only happened once. In fact, he claims that it was more unlikely than the first spark of life itself. Another broad and encompassing idea that I feel was helpful in visualizing the larger scale of evolution is that similar species are connected by “rings” of intermediates. Gulls and salamanders are ideal examples of “ring species” in the spatial dimension, one phenotypic trait fading into the other over a given area, with the two extremes at either end so dissimilar that they are considered different species, even though intermediates between them are interbreeding. This is speculated to have occurred in all species throughout history, and is the way in which evolution occurs. I understood the swirled “map” through the concestor history as a visual representation of this interconnectedness; the spiraling branches cleverly representing the mathematical infinitude of genetic variation in a mandala-like fashion.  This book came jam-packed with little surprises and relatable stories. Some of these surprises included descriptions of how certain traits evolved, and how the animal with that trait lives or, like in the case of pterosaurs potentially using echolocation, lived. I enjoyed these little visits to the different animals, learning things like how the Platypus and the Star-Nosed Mole may perceive the world by mapping their spaces as we do visually, but using alternative sensory input. Relatable stories like how a fish expert reacted to a not-so-extinct coelacanth made the experiences human, making the stories memorable and relatable.  As a fan of the Hitchhiker’s Guide series, I was also surprised (and happy) to see Douglas Adams mentioned, and to learn new things about him. After learning that he and Dawkins were friends, I had to read Lament for Douglas. This was a wholly terrible idea as I became absurdly emotional while reading it. D’awwkins! Then again, I should have noticed his pithy writing style. I should have noticed the thought, appreciation, and respect that he afforded each creature throughout this book. This eloquent attention definitely showed his squishy side. I will be reading this again, and already sent a copy to my mom."
561,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13459886-yhc,5,"This book is definitely unlike all other Dawkins' book, or i should said maybe we can see very rarely a book so fully of information in a very well structured way. I would consider it as a book close to encyclopedia. A tool book that you could come back and forth to consult the chapters that interest you.So many to learn but the brain can not absorb all at once. I read in Chinese version, which many other readers complain about the translation not quite smooth, I got same feeling but it after all pretty academic book.39 rendez-vous( tales) with branch shape structure, here is the greatest show on earth. I enjoy a lot and will read it over and over. “Evolution, or its driving engine natural selection, has no foresight. In every generation within every species, the individuals best equipped to survive and reproduce contribute more than their fair share of genes to the next generation. The consequence, blind as it is, is the nearest approach to foresight that nature permits. [...] That’s the kind of thing natural selection does all the time. It is always tinkering: here shrinking a bit, there expanding a bit, constantly adjusting, putting on and taking off, optimising immediate reproductive success. Survival in future centuries doesn’t enter into the calculation, for the good reason that it isn’t really a calculation at all. It all happens automatically, as some genes survive in the gene pool and others don’t.” "
562,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57518342-krish-sanghvi,5,"So I will start by saying that this is the best natural history book I've ever read. It starts with Dawkins describing lee smolin's hypothesis of cosmic Darwinism, in which he explains how the universe itself could be formed by evolution through natural selection. This book is not only an ode to evolution and ecology, but also to human history, and explains various concepts in theses subjects wonderfully. Dawkins has taken the diversity of life that exists today, and through them, explained some excellent natural history theories, like sexual selection, molecular clocks, behaviour, drift, evolution of multicellularity, domestication, speciation, paedomorphosis, selfish genes etc. This book derives its style from chaucer's the Canterbury tales, which he has stated explicitly, multiple times. He treats each organism as a character, which has some story to tell us about itself, and about life in general. Most of these organisms have some weird and wonderful story to tell about their own life history, anatomy, or behaviour. He uses these stories to extrapolate what the common ancestor of these organisms and ourselves would be like, in what sort of world would that organism have lived, and what would cause it to evolve in such a way. I especially loved this style of writing, of using time as a theme, on scales of a couple billion years, and gradually describing time itself, by explaining events that happened then. Dawkins takes two approaches to describe this journey of ancestry- the gene's view and the individual's view, showing us how these two journeys can be extremely different and equally fascinating, and re-emphasising the point we often see him make: that we are just machines of our selfish genes, phenotypes for our genes to multiply, and we shouldn't look at it with contempt, but with wonder. In the end, he also talks about how one can differentiate between intelligent design and evolution via self assembly, natural selection, and heredity, and shows how it's impossible that an omnipotent creator exists, coz that poses the question of who created the creator (till ad infinitum). I loved how this form of reductionism under special phenomenon has been explained. This book is an amalgamation of ecology, geology, biology, palaeontology, biochemistry, genetics, and even cosmology and particle physics, showing how all these subjects eventually come together to create the world we live in today! And it showcases the rarely seen romanticist side of Dawkins.It's a really fun read, and a thorough review of biodiversity in general (for those interested in a slightly more academic reading).Dawkins also describes some major geological events in great detail, like the K-Pg extinction, oxygenation, and Cambrian explosion, providing alternative hypotheses to some mainstream theories. The book is very well researched, and I would highly recommend it to anyone with the slightest interest in natural sciences, or wants to cherish, understand, and be fascinated by, the diversity of life on Earth and its origins. P.S.- for whoever has read Dawkins before and has been fascinated by his works, but thinks that he is a condescending intellectual asshole (I was one of them), this book is a must read and will change your views about him. He always talk about how humbling nature can be, and how insignificant we are, but at the same time, we have the ability to question, understand and be fascinated by nature. It is really difficult to even imagine writing a book which has such depth, and covers such a vast spatial and temporal scale (from the beginning of life, to the vastness of the cosmos), and it's such a commendable effort on the writers part, to have given the readers this incredibly rich, profound, and accessible source of knowledge, even truth, if I may say, and I really hope that people will appreciate the profundity that this book is.P.P.S.- I especially liked the parts when Dawkins has spoken about some core concepts in ecology and evolution, and some times even metaphysics (meaning of life, definition of life and all that jazz) from organisms we see [usually ignore] around us. I also loved the last few rendezvous, and Canterbury and the host's return, in which he shows how complex and fascinating bacteria and archaea can be, and how they have invented everything before us, using their chemical prowess, hence showing us the beauty of biochemistry, and molecular evolution, and making us question how such beautiful and complex things could arise, and making us think about our origins and that of everything else. I also enjoyed the early primordial earth part, in which he talks about oxygenation, replicators and life existing at a very biochemical level, and the conditions that were required for this primordial life to evolve into what we see today. He also speaks about the course of evolution, providing alternate hypothesis to discuss whether evolution has preferences, which will always cause life to converge upon something similar to that on earth, or whether evolution is truly random, and requires some major events (formation of cells, extinctions etc.) to converge. He also talks about a concept which was completely new to me: evolvability, which is the ability of evolution itself to evolve to allow 'better' evolution. P.P.P.S.- this book took me about 6 months to complete and is a really long undertaking, which requires lots of commitment and thinking on the readers part. It also bombards you with tons of information, and non biologists may find unfamiliar terms and concepts quite intimidating, and I'll suggest one reads other books on evolution (the greatest show on earth would be a great start), before they start with this one.Also, in this book, Dawkins has cited a great number of people and books, who have produced many of the fundamental theories we use today, and it has really helped me expand my bookshelves and wish list""My objection to supernatural beliefs is precisely because they miserably fail to do justice to the sublime grandeur of the real world"" - the ancestor's tale; it's been such a wonderful journey.!I've always been amazed by the fact that the universe, and all life in it, is a product of something so beautiful, elegant, and simple. There really IS grandeur In this view of life."
563,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17460041-hal-sitt,4,"This is my 2nd Dawkins book after Selfish Gene. Selfish Gene was fantastic in its dizzying array of super cool examples from nature. I really finished that book with a renewed appreciation of how much evolutionary biology was at work in the world around me.Ancestor's Tale is an equally illuminating book but differs from Selfish Gene in its scope and depth. It has a much wider scope but also definitely has less depth. In Ancestor's Dawkins takes us from modern humans to the ancestors of all living things and along the way he uses the ""pilgrims"" on this journey to teach us about things like gene duplication, geographical isolation, tectonic shifts, convergent evolution, etc. Since he sets out on such a long journey, he cannot without adding pages to this already 700 page tome, stop for too long at any one stop. The result is that he sometimes has to sacrifice depth for scope. By no means is this a bad thing. It is simply the nature of a book of large scope. My favorite examples of this are the duplication history of the hemoglobin genes and the effect of plate tectonics on evolution. I wanted to hear more about these but had to move on. Ancestor's really gives an excellent big picture and opened my eyes to so many areas that I want to read more about. I think this is always a sign of a great book"
564,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24009998-julie-decker,4,"Richard Dawkins, whose work in biology is among the most famous of contemporary scientists, pens a tale here loosely based on the format of the Canterbury Tales, taking us back in time through branches of evolution to show us our ancestors. Beginning with humans and rewinding, we take a journey to ""meet"" creatures with whom we share a common ancestor, with explanations of when our timelines ""join"" and what we have in common, along with various trivia and anecdotes about what makes each one special. Much like evolution itself, the small stories create a big picture to help us understand how the evolutionary process works. It's long-winded and thick to get through, but the spots of information were often delightfully interesting and lightheartedly told, and to be fair I'm not exactly the perfect audience for the book. I can follow what's happening like any textbook in a subject I don't specialize in, but as a layperson the terminology and experimental methodology sometimes went over my head. I enjoyed both the content and the telling, even though it took me over a month of bus-ride reads to finally get to the end."
565,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64464797-heather,3,"This book certainly contains an abundance of incredibly interesting information. The whole structure of his ""pilgrimage"" is very engaging, and he seems (mostly) capable of synthesizing complicated information for a less scientifically-literate audience. These qualities are what saves this book from the otherwise poisonously obnoxious attitude of Dawkins that tends to waft from the pages. I really wanted to like all of this book, but WAY too much of Richard Dawkins came through. Actually, what let me to even go for this book was the dual authorship. I mean, Dawkins is a smart guy, but all this anti-God stuff just seems too basic for him. Bashing religion is cheap, low-hanging fruit and it's obvious to anyone as smart as Dawkins that the whole set-up of the atheism/theism debate makes it fundamentally unsettle-able.You'll have pages of WAY too much detail (almost an arrogant level of detail, in places) followed by a casual swipe directly at creationists, as if they are reading this book. Really. Dawkins is a really smart guy, with brilliant knowledge and imaginative ideas (I think he would enthusiastically agree with this), but he just can't help himself."
566,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68316850-gavin,4,"Loads of lovely examples and vivid analogies. The sidebar on races is surprisingly careful and illuminating - that portion of the phenomenon that's genetic is more straightforward than I’d thought, in my Arts student way. (Though his placid definitiveness about the social interpretation is obvs controversial as hell. He’s a strict philosophical eliminativist, implying that the harm resulting from reifying race totally outweighs all gains from positive discrimination. This is unclear to say the least.) I hadn’t heard of the ‘two-fold cost’ of sex before, super-interesting. Not as snarky as you’d expect, and full of alternative perspectives so long as they’re other evolutionists’ perspectives. "
567,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36297846-wing,4,"Reading this updated edition ten years after reading the first is a true delight. Most of the updates are based on interval advancements in molecular genetics. This tome debunks misunderstandings of how evolution actually works and demonstrates why concepts that have been simplified can be misleading. It demands abstract reasoning from the reader and allows the beauty of the underpinning mathematics to shine out elegantly. As promised, it de-anthropocentrises our ill-conceived “preeminence” by tracing the history of the Tree of Life backwards. Even though “individuals are temporary meeting points on the crisscrossing routes that gene takes through history”, the whole story actually very subtly suggests, I believe, that sentience is an evolutionary convergence. A sense of serendipity and inevitability permeates the whole account. Interspersed by the authors' quips, musings, and dry humour, the book comprehensively clarifies the science of evolution through a plethora of insights and a pastiche of intellectual exercises. After reading it, it is hard not to end up being awed by the elegant complexity that colours Life on Earth. Four stars."

Starting with the humans, our closest relatives are chimpanzees and bonobos (concestor 1), followed by the common concestor between humans, chimpanzees and gorillas, who join in at concestor two.so on, several concestors meet our journey, from placental mammals, to marsupials, all the way down to starfish, molluscs, jellyfish, eubacteria and, finally, the first life form on earth.Sure, we can only speculate what this concestors could have looked like, based on the fossil record (when available), and triangulation techniques. However, much is said as to why we diverged from the rest of the populatoonat each concestor's rendez vouz, how natural selection pressure might have taken species in different directions, and what that tells us about ourselves as humans (hlmo sapiens).Be prepared for a long book, but full with interesting information that blows your mind at every page turn (if, like me, you are no biologist, nor anything close)"
569,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1190645-andrew-walter,5,"In classic 90's UK comedy programme Bottom there is a great moment when perspiring, lank haired comedy genius Rik Mayall, in the character of perspiring, lank haired pervy virgin Richie postulates:""I could have been a chess champion you know. If I'd spent my whole life learning how to play chess better than anyone else in the world I could have been a chess champion. And I look a bit slavic, don't you think?""Slavic countenances aside, this touches on how a reading of Dawkins' monumental work  The Ancestor's Tale made me feel. Yes, it is a tracing from all of the flora and fauna of the present day back into the origin of life on this planet, and so is at least a little daunting to those that don't make their living in the biological sciences. However Dawkins presents it to us in such a way as to ensure it is understood by the lay reader, and does so in such a way that you really feel as if you get it. Another reviewer on this site wonders if reading this book when they were at school would have turned them on to a career in biology, and I know exactly what they mean. You are a staggered by the awesome diversity of life throughout time but also by the awesomely succinct and economical nature of it all. I could have been an evolutionary biologist, you know.This is my first experience with the man's work, and as a sort of ""wannabe snob"", not to mention an athiest who is given to rolling his eyes in what he thinks is a droll manner every time the media seize on topics of ""hot debate"", I was fairly sick of hearing about The God Delusion, which I will probably read in about two decades if I ever do at all. Blithering dunderhead that I am, I actually didn't realise that he had written so many books about the science of life, but I'll lazily use the media as a scapegoat to explain how I'd pigeonholed him as a waffling antagonist endlessly stating what I consider to be the obvious (that creationism is nonsense). A brief conversation with my flat-mate about evolution and extremely intelligent men doing their reputations no favours, and a brief flick through of this book was enough to make me interested-I was sold on the idea alone.As other reviews on the site will no doubt make clear, the idea is at least in theory a reverse pilgrimage in the style of The Canterbury Tales, with different life forms used for ""tales"" demonstrating evolutionary theory in all of its glory. Many have remarked that this theme is somewhat clumsily applied, and that the ""tales"" diverge into areas not concerning the titular animal at all-I would remind these readers that it is at base book about EVOLUTION rather than anything else, so in depth discussions of the way that particular creatures live is only used to bolster certain points. Chapter headings aside, the Canterbury Tales metaphor is really used as nothing more than a framework throughout, with even the author poking fun at the potentially slightly twee nature of the ""pilgrimage"".There is nothing here I couldn't understand on a couple of re-readings, even with the atrophied knowledge furnished by a distant D grade in A-level biology (I blame sex in various guises for this, meeting a a girlfriend in my class on the one hand, and my Biology teacher getting my English Language teacher pregnant on the other) The writing is extremely informative, infectiously enthusiastic and at all times, careful not to patronise. A brief run through on the extreme basics of the structure of atoms and atomic decay in order to explain carbon dating is just one example; I know I needed reminding. The great level of detail presented does, admittedly, mean that it may not all stick at once, and you may find yourself turning back to refresh yourself on some points, but on the whole it is as much of a ""page-turner"" as a scientific work will ever be.It did take me a good six weeks to read, and a large part of this was I was anxious not to skim anything. I'll admit that this is a bad habit of mine if I am not fully engaged with a subject-mainly due to the inherent laziness of my mind, but here it wasn't even an issue, nothing felt slow or a drag. It is an incredibly rich piece of popular science writing (which I suppose you could say is sort of inevitable given the subject matter of ""every living thing on the face of the planet and where they sprung from"") , and is not afraid to present concepts that will make you stretch slightly to understand them, as well as the odd quirky aside ( eg: Anteaters utilise the fomic acid present in the ants they eat rather than bother to produce their own stomach acids ) that manage to be relevant as well as fully primed for use in awkward moments at parties.My one criticism here is that some of the demonstrations of how various methods of research are undertaken are left until right near the end of the book. We are given a brief summing up of ways in which prehistoric flora and fauna can be categorised and dated before the ""pilgrimage"" begins, but I was itching to know just how carbon dating and the dating of tree rings worked, and in particular how the ""molecular clock"" is calibrated and used. Findings using these methods are presented in every chapter of the book, but you don't have a really precise idea of HOW they work until you have read The Gibbon's Tale, The Redwood's Tale, and the Epilogue to the Velvet Worm's Tale. This was probably done to avoid overwhelming the reader, as these three chapters are definitely the heaviest in the book, but I did find it mildly frustrating to have to wait that long. Some readers may want to read these chapters first.In all though, it's an incredible read, and truly mind expanding for anyone that has questions about just how it all (or at least a hell of a lot of it) fits together. This is the work of a man who loves life and living forms with every eukaryotic organelle in his body, who is feverishly anxious to impart some of this passion to an interested lay audience. Sublime."

They represent a narrowing-down from reality, an impoverishment of what the real world has to offer. I suspect that many who call themselves religious would find themselves agreeing with me. To them I would only quote a favourite remark that I overheard at a scientific conference. A distinguished elder statesman of my subject was having a long argument with a colleague. As the altercation came to an end, he twinkled and said, 'You know, we really do agree. It's just that you say it wrong!' I feel I have returned from a true pilgrimage.'And so I have been through my own pilgrimage. I am a solid supporter of evolution because it is based on facts and is more beautiful than anyone can imagine. Dawkins has outdone himself in this book, each chapter was an adventure, a mix of recalling my own knowledge and learning more. Some facts shook the very foundations of what I understood and others cemented what I knew but every single chapter was exciting and food for thought. I cannot think of a time where I did not close the book and spend time thinking about what I had learned. At times this book was full of too much information and I felt like a glass that was overflowing with water (knowledge) but I did not hesitate to keep reading. To learn and strive to understand the fascinating nuances of evolution and life. This book traces human evolution, from man to the smallest microbe, and along the way we met our 'cousins', and my what a strange family we have. But surely none of us would ever change it. From the biggest mammals to the smallest microbe, we are blessed with such a vast and amazing family. And at the very end of it all we learn one important thing. We are simply hosts, intricate and beautifully made, but simply tools to carry DNA. Although in truth even this explanation is too simple. Dawkins says it much better than I and certainly knows more than I can ever claim to know. But what I can say is simply this, for those willing to learn and embrace what Dawkins has to say, you will not be disappointed by the sheer amount evolution encompasses. But more importantly Dawkins has humbled me. The concept of ‘primitive’ life living today is an insult to the creatures we call primitive. They may have retained what we consider to be ‘primitive’ body shapes but as Dawkins explains, our cousins would not have kept these ‘primitive’ shapes and natures if they weren’t useful and actually ‘advanced’. An example is sharks, these creatures have barely changed their shapes for millions of years and yet they are not ‘primitive’ at all but clearly physiologically advanced killing machines. Although this is an insult too, sharks kill to eat, men kill more men than a shark kills. So, I will certainly make an effort to call any lifeform living today ‘primitive’. The one thing the book has left me with is a fascination for microbial life. To think bacteria may have invented a ‘wheel’ billions of years before us and yet we consider ourselves more advanced. We, ourselves, are nothing more than a collection of microbes and bacterium. Was order made from chaos as we believe or were microbes and bacteria similar to us before we built New York City, the Pyramids, the leaning tower of Pisa and other grand structures. Are we simply a landmark of microbial engineering? A tribute to the ingenuity of nature and the product of small lifeforms making grand marks on the world? These thoughts are both fascinating and humbling. I am certain there are some who see my wandering thoughts as silly or take them to think I have not truly absorbed the content of this book. But I have learned much, this book has much to teach should one choose to open the cover and read its pages. I will certainly not look at the world the same way again. 5/5. Would definitely recommend this book!"
590,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66376950-alyssa-tidwell,5," This book, The Ancestor’s Tale, takes a meandering stroll backward through our ancestry, from our current position in evolution to “concestor 0”, the common ancestor of all living things. Many factors were included in the text that help to explain the reasons that certain evolutionary theories exist, describe the evidence supporting them, and methods and experiments used to draw conclusions. The way in which this information was presented helps the reader to dive in and get into a scientific mindset.  Dawkins attentively wrote from a broad, philosophical perspective that I think is critical for understanding and paying due respect to evolution. One example of this that comes immediately to mind is the thought that evolution is not teleological; humans are not the apex of an evolution that has been striving towards humanity as a goal. We are not necessarily more complex and more evolved than any other creature. Different ways of living aren’t necessarily “primitive” because an organism's individual functions may be more or less complex than our own.  Later in the book, Dawkins also writes on the likelihood of physical characteristics evolving independently, and speculates on whether those traits would re-occur if we were to hit the reset button. This repeats the overarching theme that we are not special- our eyes, our ears, and our intelligence would evolve again. We can’t be so vain to think we’re special in comparison.Dawkins makes it all too clear that we organisms are all related, and presents myriad evidence for that stance- not only by tracking the ancestral lineage, but through evidence such as eukaryotic cellularity being so unlikely to happen, that it probably only happened once. In fact, he claims that it was more unlikely than the first spark of life itself. Another broad and encompassing idea that I feel was helpful in visualizing the larger scale of evolution is that similar species are connected by “rings” of intermediates. Gulls and salamanders are ideal examples of “ring species” in the spatial dimension, one phenotypic trait fading into the other over a given area, with the two extremes at either end so dissimilar that they are considered different species, even though intermediates between them are interbreeding. This is speculated to have occurred in all species throughout history, and is the way in which evolution occurs. I understood the swirled “map” through the concestor history as a visual representation of this interconnectedness; the spiraling branches cleverly representing the mathematical infinitude of genetic variation in a mandala-like fashion.  This book came jam-packed with little surprises and relatable stories. Some of these surprises included descriptions of how certain traits evolved, and how the animal with that trait lives or, like in the case of pterosaurs potentially using echolocation, lived. I enjoyed these little visits to the different animals, learning things like how the Platypus and the Star-Nosed Mole may perceive the world by mapping their spaces as we do visually, but using alternative sensory input. Relatable stories like how a fish expert reacted to a not-so-extinct coelacanth made the experiences human, making the stories memorable and relatable.  As a fan of the Hitchhiker’s Guide series, I was also surprised (and happy) to see Douglas Adams mentioned, and to learn new things about him. After learning that he and Dawkins were friends, I had to read Lament for Douglas. This was a wholly terrible idea as I became absurdly emotional while reading it. D’awwkins! Then again, I should have noticed his pithy writing style. I should have noticed the thought, appreciation, and respect that he afforded each creature throughout this book. This eloquent attention definitely showed his squishy side. I will be reading this again, and already sent a copy to my mom."
591,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13459886-yhc,5,"This book is definitely unlike all other Dawkins' book, or i should said maybe we can see very rarely a book so fully of information in a very well structured way. I would consider it as a book close to encyclopedia. A tool book that you could come back and forth to consult the chapters that interest you.So many to learn but the brain can not absorb all at once. I read in Chinese version, which many other readers complain about the translation not quite smooth, I got same feeling but it after all pretty academic book.39 rendez-vous( tales) with branch shape structure, here is the greatest show on earth. I enjoy a lot and will read it over and over. “Evolution, or its driving engine natural selection, has no foresight. In every generation within every species, the individuals best equipped to survive and reproduce contribute more than their fair share of genes to the next generation. The consequence, blind as it is, is the nearest approach to foresight that nature permits. [...] That’s the kind of thing natural selection does all the time. It is always tinkering: here shrinking a bit, there expanding a bit, constantly adjusting, putting on and taking off, optimising immediate reproductive success. Survival in future centuries doesn’t enter into the calculation, for the good reason that it isn’t really a calculation at all. It all happens automatically, as some genes survive in the gene pool and others don’t.” "
592,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57518342-krish-sanghvi,5,"So I will start by saying that this is the best natural history book I've ever read. It starts with Dawkins describing lee smolin's hypothesis of cosmic Darwinism, in which he explains how the universe itself could be formed by evolution through natural selection. This book is not only an ode to evolution and ecology, but also to human history, and explains various concepts in theses subjects wonderfully. Dawkins has taken the diversity of life that exists today, and through them, explained some excellent natural history theories, like sexual selection, molecular clocks, behaviour, drift, evolution of multicellularity, domestication, speciation, paedomorphosis, selfish genes etc. This book derives its style from chaucer's the Canterbury tales, which he has stated explicitly, multiple times. He treats each organism as a character, which has some story to tell us about itself, and about life in general. Most of these organisms have some weird and wonderful story to tell about their own life history, anatomy, or behaviour. He uses these stories to extrapolate what the common ancestor of these organisms and ourselves would be like, in what sort of world would that organism have lived, and what would cause it to evolve in such a way. I especially loved this style of writing, of using time as a theme, on scales of a couple billion years, and gradually describing time itself, by explaining events that happened then. Dawkins takes two approaches to describe this journey of ancestry- the gene's view and the individual's view, showing us how these two journeys can be extremely different and equally fascinating, and re-emphasising the point we often see him make: that we are just machines of our selfish genes, phenotypes for our genes to multiply, and we shouldn't look at it with contempt, but with wonder. In the end, he also talks about how one can differentiate between intelligent design and evolution via self assembly, natural selection, and heredity, and shows how it's impossible that an omnipotent creator exists, coz that poses the question of who created the creator (till ad infinitum). I loved how this form of reductionism under special phenomenon has been explained. This book is an amalgamation of ecology, geology, biology, palaeontology, biochemistry, genetics, and even cosmology and particle physics, showing how all these subjects eventually come together to create the world we live in today! And it showcases the rarely seen romanticist side of Dawkins.It's a really fun read, and a thorough review of biodiversity in general (for those interested in a slightly more academic reading).Dawkins also describes some major geological events in great detail, like the K-Pg extinction, oxygenation, and Cambrian explosion, providing alternative hypotheses to some mainstream theories. The book is very well researched, and I would highly recommend it to anyone with the slightest interest in natural sciences, or wants to cherish, understand, and be fascinated by, the diversity of life on Earth and its origins. P.S.- for whoever has read Dawkins before and has been fascinated by his works, but thinks that he is a condescending intellectual asshole (I was one of them), this book is a must read and will change your views about him. He always talk about how humbling nature can be, and how insignificant we are, but at the same time, we have the ability to question, understand and be fascinated by nature. It is really difficult to even imagine writing a book which has such depth, and covers such a vast spatial and temporal scale (from the beginning of life, to the vastness of the cosmos), and it's such a commendable effort on the writers part, to have given the readers this incredibly rich, profound, and accessible source of knowledge, even truth, if I may say, and I really hope that people will appreciate the profundity that this book is.P.P.S.- I especially liked the parts when Dawkins has spoken about some core concepts in ecology and evolution, and some times even metaphysics (meaning of life, definition of life and all that jazz) from organisms we see [usually ignore] around us. I also loved the last few rendezvous, and Canterbury and the host's return, in which he shows how complex and fascinating bacteria and archaea can be, and how they have invented everything before us, using their chemical prowess, hence showing us the beauty of biochemistry, and molecular evolution, and making us question how such beautiful and complex things could arise, and making us think about our origins and that of everything else. I also enjoyed the early primordial earth part, in which he talks about oxygenation, replicators and life existing at a very biochemical level, and the conditions that were required for this primordial life to evolve into what we see today. He also speaks about the course of evolution, providing alternate hypothesis to discuss whether evolution has preferences, which will always cause life to converge upon something similar to that on earth, or whether evolution is truly random, and requires some major events (formation of cells, extinctions etc.) to converge. He also talks about a concept which was completely new to me: evolvability, which is the ability of evolution itself to evolve to allow 'better' evolution. P.P.P.S.- this book took me about 6 months to complete and is a really long undertaking, which requires lots of commitment and thinking on the readers part. It also bombards you with tons of information, and non biologists may find unfamiliar terms and concepts quite intimidating, and I'll suggest one reads other books on evolution (the greatest show on earth would be a great start), before they start with this one.Also, in this book, Dawkins has cited a great number of people and books, who have produced many of the fundamental theories we use today, and it has really helped me expand my bookshelves and wish list""My objection to supernatural beliefs is precisely because they miserably fail to do justice to the sublime grandeur of the real world"" - the ancestor's tale; it's been such a wonderful journey.!I've always been amazed by the fact that the universe, and all life in it, is a product of something so beautiful, elegant, and simple. There really IS grandeur In this view of life."
593,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17460041-hal-sitt,4,"This is my 2nd Dawkins book after Selfish Gene. Selfish Gene was fantastic in its dizzying array of super cool examples from nature. I really finished that book with a renewed appreciation of how much evolutionary biology was at work in the world around me.Ancestor's Tale is an equally illuminating book but differs from Selfish Gene in its scope and depth. It has a much wider scope but also definitely has less depth. In Ancestor's Dawkins takes us from modern humans to the ancestors of all living things and along the way he uses the ""pilgrims"" on this journey to teach us about things like gene duplication, geographical isolation, tectonic shifts, convergent evolution, etc. Since he sets out on such a long journey, he cannot without adding pages to this already 700 page tome, stop for too long at any one stop. The result is that he sometimes has to sacrifice depth for scope. By no means is this a bad thing. It is simply the nature of a book of large scope. My favorite examples of this are the duplication history of the hemoglobin genes and the effect of plate tectonics on evolution. I wanted to hear more about these but had to move on. Ancestor's really gives an excellent big picture and opened my eyes to so many areas that I want to read more about. I think this is always a sign of a great book"
594,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24009998-julie-decker,4,"Richard Dawkins, whose work in biology is among the most famous of contemporary scientists, pens a tale here loosely based on the format of the Canterbury Tales, taking us back in time through branches of evolution to show us our ancestors. Beginning with humans and rewinding, we take a journey to ""meet"" creatures with whom we share a common ancestor, with explanations of when our timelines ""join"" and what we have in common, along with various trivia and anecdotes about what makes each one special. Much like evolution itself, the small stories create a big picture to help us understand how the evolutionary process works. It's long-winded and thick to get through, but the spots of information were often delightfully interesting and lightheartedly told, and to be fair I'm not exactly the perfect audience for the book. I can follow what's happening like any textbook in a subject I don't specialize in, but as a layperson the terminology and experimental methodology sometimes went over my head. I enjoyed both the content and the telling, even though it took me over a month of bus-ride reads to finally get to the end."
595,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64464797-heather,3,"This book certainly contains an abundance of incredibly interesting information. The whole structure of his ""pilgrimage"" is very engaging, and he seems (mostly) capable of synthesizing complicated information for a less scientifically-literate audience. These qualities are what saves this book from the otherwise poisonously obnoxious attitude of Dawkins that tends to waft from the pages. I really wanted to like all of this book, but WAY too much of Richard Dawkins came through. Actually, what let me to even go for this book was the dual authorship. I mean, Dawkins is a smart guy, but all this anti-God stuff just seems too basic for him. Bashing religion is cheap, low-hanging fruit and it's obvious to anyone as smart as Dawkins that the whole set-up of the atheism/theism debate makes it fundamentally unsettle-able.You'll have pages of WAY too much detail (almost an arrogant level of detail, in places) followed by a casual swipe directly at creationists, as if they are reading this book. Really. Dawkins is a really smart guy, with brilliant knowledge and imaginative ideas (I think he would enthusiastically agree with this), but he just can't help himself."
596,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68316850-gavin,4,"Loads of lovely examples and vivid analogies. The sidebar on races is surprisingly careful and illuminating - that portion of the phenomenon that's genetic is more straightforward than I’d thought, in my Arts student way. (Though his placid definitiveness about the social interpretation is obvs controversial as hell. He’s a strict philosophical eliminativist, implying that the harm resulting from reifying race totally outweighs all gains from positive discrimination. This is unclear to say the least.) I hadn’t heard of the ‘two-fold cost’ of sex before, super-interesting. Not as snarky as you’d expect, and full of alternative perspectives so long as they’re other evolutionists’ perspectives. "
597,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36297846-wing,4,"Reading this updated edition ten years after reading the first is a true delight. Most of the updates are based on interval advancements in molecular genetics. This tome debunks misunderstandings of how evolution actually works and demonstrates why concepts that have been simplified can be misleading. It demands abstract reasoning from the reader and allows the beauty of the underpinning mathematics to shine out elegantly. As promised, it de-anthropocentrises our ill-conceived “preeminence” by tracing the history of the Tree of Life backwards. Even though “individuals are temporary meeting points on the crisscrossing routes that gene takes through history”, the whole story actually very subtly suggests, I believe, that sentience is an evolutionary convergence. A sense of serendipity and inevitability permeates the whole account. Interspersed by the authors' quips, musings, and dry humour, the book comprehensively clarifies the science of evolution through a plethora of insights and a pastiche of intellectual exercises. After reading it, it is hard not to end up being awed by the elegant complexity that colours Life on Earth. Four stars."
598,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81221576-diogenescfg,5,"Five stars seems unfair for a book so well written as The Ancestors Tale.Richard Dawkins takes us in a trip thousands or millions of years into the past, were we meet the common ancestors of current species, which he calls concestors. Starting with the humans, our closest relatives are chimpanzees and bonobos (concestor 1), followed by the common concestor between humans, chimpanzees and gorillas, who join in at concestor two.so on, several concestors meet our journey, from placental mammals, to marsupials, all the way down to starfish, molluscs, jellyfish, eubacteria and, finally, the first life form on earth.Sure, we can only speculate what this concestors could have looked like, based on the fossil record (when available), and triangulation techniques. However, much is said as to why we diverged from the rest of the populatoonat each concestor's rendez vouz, how natural selection pressure might have taken species in different directions, and what that tells us about ourselves as humans (hlmo sapiens).Be prepared for a long book, but full with interesting information that blows your mind at every page turn (if, like me, you are no biologist, nor anything close)"
599,061861916X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1190645-andrew-walter,5,"In classic 90's UK comedy programme Bottom there is a great moment when perspiring, lank haired comedy genius Rik Mayall, in the character of perspiring, lank haired pervy virgin Richie postulates:""I could have been a chess champion you know. If I'd spent my whole life learning how to play chess better than anyone else in the world I could have been a chess champion. And I look a bit slavic, don't you think?""Slavic countenances aside, this touches on how a reading of Dawkins' monumental work  The Ancestor's Tale made me feel. Yes, it is a tracing from all of the flora and fauna of the present day back into the origin of life on this planet, and so is at least a little daunting to those that don't make their living in the biological sciences. However Dawkins presents it to us in such a way as to ensure it is understood by the lay reader, and does so in such a way that you really feel as if you get it. Another reviewer on this site wonders if reading this book when they were at school would have turned them on to a career in biology, and I know exactly what they mean. You are a staggered by the awesome diversity of life throughout time but also by the awesomely succinct and economical nature of it all. I could have been an evolutionary biologist, you know.This is my first experience with the man's work, and as a sort of ""wannabe snob"", not to mention an athiest who is given to rolling his eyes in what he thinks is a droll manner every time the media seize on topics of ""hot debate"", I was fairly sick of hearing about The God Delusion, which I will probably read in about two decades if I ever do at all. Blithering dunderhead that I am, I actually didn't realise that he had written so many books about the science of life, but I'll lazily use the media as a scapegoat to explain how I'd pigeonholed him as a waffling antagonist endlessly stating what I consider to be the obvious (that creationism is nonsense). A brief conversation with my flat-mate about evolution and extremely intelligent men doing their reputations no favours, and a brief flick through of this book was enough to make me interested-I was sold on the idea alone.As other reviews on the site will no doubt make clear, the idea is at least in theory a reverse pilgrimage in the style of The Canterbury Tales, with different life forms used for ""tales"" demonstrating evolutionary theory in all of its glory. Many have remarked that this theme is somewhat clumsily applied, and that the ""tales"" diverge into areas not concerning the titular animal at all-I would remind these readers that it is at base book about EVOLUTION rather than anything else, so in depth discussions of the way that particular creatures live is only used to bolster certain points. Chapter headings aside, the Canterbury Tales metaphor is really used as nothing more than a framework throughout, with even the author poking fun at the potentially slightly twee nature of the ""pilgrimage"".There is nothing here I couldn't understand on a couple of re-readings, even with the atrophied knowledge furnished by a distant D grade in A-level biology (I blame sex in various guises for this, meeting a a girlfriend in my class on the one hand, and my Biology teacher getting my English Language teacher pregnant on the other) The writing is extremely informative, infectiously enthusiastic and at all times, careful not to patronise. A brief run through on the extreme basics of the structure of atoms and atomic decay in order to explain carbon dating is just one example; I know I needed reminding. The great level of detail presented does, admittedly, mean that it may not all stick at once, and you may find yourself turning back to refresh yourself on some points, but on the whole it is as much of a ""page-turner"" as a scientific work will ever be.It did take me a good six weeks to read, and a large part of this was I was anxious not to skim anything. I'll admit that this is a bad habit of mine if I am not fully engaged with a subject-mainly due to the inherent laziness of my mind, but here it wasn't even an issue, nothing felt slow or a drag. It is an incredibly rich piece of popular science writing (which I suppose you could say is sort of inevitable given the subject matter of ""every living thing on the face of the planet and where they sprung from"") , and is not afraid to present concepts that will make you stretch slightly to understand them, as well as the odd quirky aside ( eg: Anteaters utilise the fomic acid present in the ants they eat rather than bother to produce their own stomach acids ) that manage to be relevant as well as fully primed for use in awkward moments at parties.My one criticism here is that some of the demonstrations of how various methods of research are undertaken are left until right near the end of the book. We are given a brief summing up of ways in which prehistoric flora and fauna can be categorised and dated before the ""pilgrimage"" begins, but I was itching to know just how carbon dating and the dating of tree rings worked, and in particular how the ""molecular clock"" is calibrated and used. Findings using these methods are presented in every chapter of the book, but you don't have a really precise idea of HOW they work until you have read The Gibbon's Tale, The Redwood's Tale, and the Epilogue to the Velvet Worm's Tale. This was probably done to avoid overwhelming the reader, as these three chapters are definitely the heaviest in the book, but I did find it mildly frustrating to have to wait that long. Some readers may want to read these chapters first.In all though, it's an incredible read, and truly mind expanding for anyone that has questions about just how it all (or at least a hell of a lot of it) fits together. This is the work of a man who loves life and living forms with every eukaryotic organelle in his body, who is feverishly anxious to impart some of this passion to an interested lay audience. Sublime."
