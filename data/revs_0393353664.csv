0,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71848701-miranda-reads,3,"The answer is no - we are no where near smart enough to figure out how smart animals are.
Having escaped the Dark Ages in which animals were mere stimulus-response machines, we are free to contemplate their mental lives. 
 The prevailing theory used to be that animals are all instinct-driven, mute and empty-headed - but that couldn't be further from the truth. While it is true that animals are influenced by their instincts. For example:
One can train dolphins to jump synchronously because they do so in the wild, and one can teach horses to run together at the same pace because wild horses do the same.
 But mere instincts cannot explain the overwhelming evidence for cognition. Frans de Waal uses both scientific articles and anecdotes to show what researchers (and the general public) used to think about animals' thoughts and how that's changed over the years. From what I gathered while reading this novel - we only think animals are dumb because we are absolutely horrible at testing them.So many times, animals have ""failed"" a test (thus placing them in a lower intelligence bracket) because humans aren't testing either the right way, the right thing or used an inherently unfair method.
Testing the Right Way
For the longest time, scientists thought that elephants were among the few species that couldn't recognize their own faces. Their experiments consisted putting a mark (with a washable dye) on the animal's body then showing that animal a mirror. If the animal became interested in the dot, that indicated that they recognized their own faces. Monkeys and apes and so many other species could do this - but not elephants. In reality, the scientists just didn't account for the size factor - they were using mirrors only large enough to show the elephants their feet or part of their face.Once that was rectified, the elephants were fascinated by the mirrors - going so far as to stand on their rear legs and lean against the mirrors (much to their keeper's dismay!)
Testing for the right thing
Researchers tested primates on facial recognition skills and found that they were inherently poor at distinguishing subjects. However, the scientists were testing the primates on their ability to distinguish humans. When they later tested the primates on recognition of other primates, they excelled. Much like humans, the primates were far better at telling apart their own species than another.
Using inherently unfair comparisons
Waals points out that so many studies focus on what makes humans so different from other animals and yet many of the comparisons are inherently unfair. 
Would anyone test the memory of human children by throwing them into a swimming pool to see if they remember where to get out? 
 And yet that is a routine test for rat memory.Overall, this book did not disappoint. It was a bit dry at times and did feel a smidge repetitive but I did enjoy my time reading it - and I came away feeling like I learned a ton!Audiobook CommentsRead by Sean Runnette. I'm a bit torn about the narration - while it was rather well-done considering that the material may be considered dry by some. However, I noticed that the reader had a faint...not quite a lisp but the way he pronounced certain words kept taking me out of the story.YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Snapchat @miranda.reads Happy Reading!"
1,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,3,"I cannot give this book less than three stars because it contains lots of totally fascinating information about animals - the greater and lesser apes, whales, octopus, fish, birds and elephants for example. The author is a Dutch primatologist and ethologist. He is the Charles Howard Candler professor of Primate Behavior at the Emory University psychology department in Atlanta, Georgia, and director of the Living Links Center at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center. Primate social behavior is his central focus but this book goes beyond primates. The latest research about the abilities of animals and animal cognition is exciting. Our knowledge concerning the science of animal cognition, self-awareness, understanding, cooperation, inequity aversion, conformism and empathy has progressed far from the early days of behaviorism. The book starts with a review of the history of the science. Nevertheless, I did have problems with this book. I found it poorly organized. I would have appreciated clearer chapter titles so you knew what the coming chapter would contain. The chapters had diffuse titles such as Cognitive Ripples, Know What You Know, Talk To Me. The same experiments are mentioned several times with additional information added the second time around. Neither was there organization in terms of the species covered; one gets a smattering of species in each chapter. Quite simply the book was put together in a messy fashion. The author has a central message, namely that experiments must be designed to fit the animals being tested and that we must stop overestimating human cognition and underestimating other species' cognition. These became the author's mantras. I don't disagree with what he is saying but the preachiness with which the messages were delivered became annoying. The book is said to be written for the layman. One minute he addresses his readers as if we were children. Soon after the lines read as academic bickering. The author comes across as “thinking he knows all” and negatively viewing others. The tone is negative, which gets tiring. The result? You have to wade through a lot to get to the fascinating ground information. One more complaint – in comparison to the books listed below, the presentation of the experiments in de Waal’s book does not let readers get close to the animals. You do in the books listed below. Too often in de Waal’s book we are told what particular experiments prove, rather than letting readers judge for themselves. So yes, I do have a bunch of complaints with the way the book is organized, its tone and manner of presenting the data. The information presented is nevertheless thorough and fascinating. I spoke of the author’s negative tone. This is further enhanced by the audiook narration performed by Sean Runnette. The words are clear but the tone is one of sad despondency. ********************Related books which could be of interest: Beyond Words: What Animals Think and Feel (4 stars)Mind of the Raven: Investigations and Adventures with Wolf-Birds (4 stars) Wesley the Owl: The Remarkable Love Story of an Owl and His Girl (5 stars)Alex & Me: How a Scientist and a Parrot Discovered a Hidden World of Animal Intelligence—and Formed a Deep Bond in the Process (3 stars) (I mention the book on Alex only because it is covered in de Waal's book.

2,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,4,"Instead of making humanity the measure of all things, we need to evaluate other species by what they are.The field of animal cognition needs to take a lesson from the field of human education—the multiple intelligence model. Not every student will be good at every part of the curriculum, but it’s a rare person who isn’t talented at anything! Physical talent in sports or a love and understanding of nature count as kinds of intelligence, acknowledging that the academic subjects are not necessarily the be all and end all.De Waal writes clearly and engagingly about the history of the study of animal intelligence, pointing out the many prejudices that humans bring to this endeavour. Human subjects are tested by a member of their own species and in surroundings that they are comfortable in. Animal subjects are being tested by a member of another species (whom they are not necessarily interested in) and in a captive setting that adds to the stress of the situation. Ask any university student about the stress of exams and they will tell you that it is not an ideal way to take tests.He points out that these studies are hampered by the human tendency to try to set ourselves outside the animal world, to set a barrier between us and the rest of nature. He also discusses our relationship with the apes, especially our close link to the two chimpanzee species. Being very hierarchically focused, like chimps are, we spend a lot of time trying to set ourselves at the top of our perceived hierarchy of nature. We truly need to let go of this need to be superior and to evaluate other species according to their own talents.When I was a volunteer nature educator, I was often asked about animals, “How smart are they?” I guess people were hoping to feel superior to other species. My answer was always, “Just as smart as they need to be to survive.” Each species is adapted to its own environmental niche and is expert at living there. I would recommend Mr. de Waal’s books to anyone interested in animal cognition or in ape studies in general."
3,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4684009-william2,4,"The book is about clever experiments conducted to show that primates, crows, elephants, etc. possess a sense of the future and the past, that they can a plan for the future, and that they unequivocally make tools. Moreover the experiments discussed here demonstrate that animals have a sense of compassion, altruism and reciprocity just like us (at our best). All of the experiments with primates are interesting, but the ones with caching birds, like Jays—who inhibit immediate gratification for the sake of future need—and the ones that proved Ravens know each others’ voices and have a hierarchical status system, I found especially intriguing. Then there’s Irene M. Pepperberg’s Alex, the Gray Parrot, who can verbally respond to addition and subtraction tasks done in his head. The studies about animal metacognition—thinking about thinking—are gobsmacking. Mainly the author’s targets here are the many psychologists, philosophers and other experts who argue that only humans are endowed with such imaginative and creative capacities. I liked that the author, who’s worked with primates for 30 years, has an acerbic view of humans that seems entirely missing in his discussion of primates. See note, page 219. All my highlights and notes give a peek at the content of this brilliant book."
4,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"Well, some people are smart enough to know how smart animals are--but some people are not. It depends on whether experimenters can put themselves into the frame of the animal they are studying. Testing an animal in the same way as one might test a human just doesn't cut it. And this is the main theme of the book; that researchers must test animals in accordance with their biology and move away from human-centric approaches.Frans de Waal has written a fabulous book about researching the intelligence of animals. De Waal is a zoologist whose specialty is primates, and he has been studying them for many years. He is very well qualified to write this book, not just about primates, but about many types of animals.So many researchers are quick to point out the differences between humans and animals. De Waal came up with a metaphor for this approach--that of an iceberg. The vast underwater part of an iceberg represents the enormous similarities between humans and primates, while the above-water tip represents the differences. Many researchers look exclusively at the differences, while not even trying to notice the similarities. They are continually trying to answer the question, ""Mirror mirror on the wall, who is the smartest of them all?"", but this in de Waal's opinion, this is just a waste of time.People can even be intimidated by animals. There is a story about the ape house in a British zoo, where the chimpanzees were trained to have a genteel tea party. The chimps had excellent manners and correctly imitated a polite-society tea party. But, human spectators were intimidated and complained, and even ignored the spectacle. So, the zookeepers retrained the apes to have a naughty tea party, spitting and throwing tea around and causing havoc--and the human spectators loved it!There is an Aesops fable about a crow and a pitcher. The water level in the pitcher is too low for the crow's beak to reach it, so the crow drops small pebbles into the pitcher, in order to elevate the water level to the point where it is drinkable. And ... yes, you guessed it. This behavior has been replicated in a laboratory! Even though crows do not have a language--at least, not at any level of sophistication even approaching that of humans--crows can think. An animal does not require language in order to think. And actually, neither do humans need a language in order to think.This book is chock full of examples of animals that have thinking capabilities that are truly astonishing. For example, there is a bird named Alex that could respond to questions about objects, defining how they are different, their material composition--and not by rote, as they were new, unfamiliar objects, and in the absence of the experimenter. And, Alex could count and do addition. An experimenter would hide objects under three shells. He would lift up the first shell revealing the objects, then cover them up and lift up the second shell, and so on. Then, Alex would speak the number of objects he saw in total! A crow named Betty could bend straight wires into a hook in order to retrieve food from a tube; the first evidence of a non-primate making a tool. Apes can have sudden insights for solving problems, they are capable of inferential reasoning, like understanding the meaning of the absence of something. They are capable of deception. And when it comes to tools; some apes have been observed to carry around a toolkit consisting of five pieces of sticks of various shapes, each of which is necessary to be used in sequence to retrieve honey. Apes can spontaneously learn to brush their teeth, ride bicycles, light fires, drive golf carts, eat with a knife and fork, peel potatoes, and mop the floor. Apes that are reared with humans learn best how to imitate humans. They can imitate better than young children, because they can selectively imitate actions that have favorable consequences, ignoring actions that are unfavorable.Apes are capable of deception, as has been shown in a multitude of experiments. For example, orangutans are excellent escape artists. They slowly dismantle their cages over a period of many days. They keep the loosened screws in place or hidden, in order to fool the humans until they are ready to make their break for freedom.Many experiments with chimpanzees fail to result in meaningful conclusions. Often experimenters try to understand the ""Theory of Mind"" of chimpanzees, that is, to understand how they see humans. But this often fails because chimpanzees think of humans as omniscient.There are so many other examples of animal cognition. There are elephants who can tell human languages apart, as well as the gender and age of human speakers. A female orangutan used a lettuce leaf like a hat, using a mirror to aid in decorating herself. Octopuses seem to play with new, unfamiliar objects. Dolphins are capable of metacognition, that is, to think about thinking. And, dolphins have unique vocal signatures, which they use like names to call one another. Then there is the experiment that involved teaching a chimpanzee to recognize numbers written on a computer screen. He would be shown nine single-digit numbers for just a fifth of a second, after which he would press the keys in the proper order that he saw for just that split-second. The crazy thing is that humans are only capable of remembering five such numbers in similar experiments, even after training!The point of the book is to show that you simply cannot call one animal species smarter or dumber than another, or smarter or dumber than humans on the basis of individual capabilities. Each animal species has different abilities, many of which exceed that of humans. De Waal also blasts away at the behaviorists, who maintain that what an animal thinks, that is to say, the internal state of animal, is totally irrelevant. The only thing that matters, so they say, is external stimuli and conditioned behavior. De Waal shows over and over again, the backwardness of this attitude, and the incorrect conclusions that they reach concerning animal behavior.This book provides a wonderful perspective on animal behavior. The distinctions between animals and humans are not so strong as we would like to believe."

If it's meant for plebs like me, then write it in a language I would understand. I guess it's meant for a different audience. A great scientific exercise."
6,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22699228-matthew-quann,3,"Sometimes it can be hard to review a book for what it is instead of for what you wanted it to be. This is probably most true of fiction, but science books also vary in the level of depth to which they explore their topic. It can be tough as a reader to judge what audience the author is after, and that can lead to some discrepancy in the technicality of the reading material than expected. Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? was a book that delved far more in-depth into the field of animal cognition than I had expected. I wasn't really in the mood for the scientific rigour presented here--school being demanding enough--but was able to appreciate the book nonetheless. de Waal presents this book as a series of experiments that serve as counterpoints to those who suggest that animals are incapable of emotion, cognition, planning, etc. He also spends a great deal of time with the historical precedents for the field's current way of thinking.It works as a sort-of bird's eye view of the field of animal cognition. Your mileage will vary depending on how much this sort of thing interests you. Have you ever wondered about what your cat is thinking as you type away at your reviews or cozy up for an extended read? Well, you're less likely to be satisfied by the type of experiments herein. It's more like, I wonder how the mating patterns of meadow voles speaks to how animals view monogamy? Having a bit of a background in behavioural neuroscience, some of this was stimulating and familiar, while other bits didn't do much for me.I also decided to give this one a shot in audio, and the narrator does a perfectly passable job. There's no flair or enthusiasm, but it does make for a straightforward relation of facts. I also decided to read this as a counterpoint to an audiobook I read and reviewed earlier this year, 
The Hidden Life of Trees
. On a personal level, I was more engaged with the animal than the plant. de Waal does a good job of convincing the reader to lay down their species-perceived superiority in favour of a more empathetic view of animal cognition. So, I'm definitely not sorry I listened to this book. However, I wish I'd gone for something a bit lighter that relied less on a series of experimental descriptions. As it stands, this is a book that psychology majors and the lay public should enjoy. It provides as concrete science as possible in the field of psychology and doesn't make sensational extrapolation from the available data. If you're looking to broaden your understanding of the field of animal cognition, I can think of no better primer!"
7,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,4,"If you read only one book on animal cognition or cognitive ethology, make it this one. If you've read a bunch, as I have, read this anyway. There are some that are more interesting, or more focused, but this is the best current summary of the field, at least for a popular audience that I can find. It concisely provides history, anecdotes, references to other works and studies, a look at the future, and plenty of hard science.I sincerely doubt I'll ever read another book published before this. As you probably know, I have enjoyed quite a few already, but the field is evolving, methodologies are being refined, younger (and more diverse) scientists have bravely thrown off the shackles of the behavorists and of the dogma of human vs. animal, and it's become time we think more about Darwin's understanding of comparative intelligence as one of degree, not kind.Exemplar tidbits abound.Think of Clever Hans – though it's true that the horse couldn't count, he certainly was smart enough to understand human body language. (It wasn't just his showman owner who could evoke the right number of hooftaps via cues too subtle for most audiences to see.)“[M]ale but not female experimenters induce so much stress in mice that it affects their responses.... This means, of course, that mouse studies conducted by men may have different outcomes.... [M]ethodological details matter.”Re' comparing children's abilities to those of apes: “Since experimenters are supposed to be bland and neutral, they do not engage in … niceties. This doesn't help make the ape feel at ease and identify with the experimenter. Children, however, are encouraged to do so. Moreover, only the children are interacting with a member of their own species....” Examples like that make me admire apes even more, because I'm beginning to think of them as being able to get along in both ape and human social groups. Consider them to be bi-lingual, or bi-cultural....Re' experiments in cooperation, recalling human psychological investigation into game theory and concepts of fairness—remember from school or other readings how most humans will react to a peer getting a bigger reward so resentfully that they'll sacrifice their own, smaller reward to take that bigger reward away from the other? Well, de Waal and Sarah Brosnan have done further similar studies on primates, and have seen that what is likely really going on is not resentment. Rather, it's a strategy towards cooperative equalization of outcomes. Apes have even been known to reject an unfair *larger* reward!And re' how to measure physical evidence of a smarter brain (eg, larger doesn't make humans special, because whales and elephants, etc.); “Each octopus has nearly two thousand suckers, every single one equipped with its own ganglion of half a million neurons.... on top of a 65-million neuron brain. In addition, it has a chain of ganglia along its arms.... Instead of a single central command... more like the Internet.” That makes me admire Montgomery's recent “The Soul of an Octopus” book even more.Juvenile rhesus and stumptail monkeys were placed together for five months. “These macaques have strikingly different temperaments: rhesus are a quarrelsome, noncilatory bunch, whereas stumptails are laid-back and pacific.... After a long period of exposure, the rhesus monkeys developed peacemaking skills on a par with those of their more tolerant counterparts. Evn after separation from the stumptails, the rhesus showed nearly four times more friendly reunions following fights than is typical of their species. These new and improved rhesus monkeys confirmed the power of conformism.”On that happy note, I'll stop giving you free samples of the book, and again encourage you to read it for yourself.....I just encountered a children's poem that reminded me of this book, by Aileen Fisher:_*Little Talk*_Don't you think it's probablethat beetles, bugs, and beestalk about a lot of things-you know, such things as these:The kind of weather where they livein jungles tall with grassand earthquakes in their villages whenever people pass!Of course, we'll never know if bugstalk very much at all,because our ears are far too bigfor talk that is so small."
8,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"For awhile Woodland Park Zoo (in my hometown) was in the midst of creating outdoor environments for most of its animals where they could run and hide through tall grasses and shrubbery, climb trees, jump on rocks, or swim in ponds, or swing on tires. With every visit I saw fewer and fewer animals lived in small cement cages. I had bought an annual pass which entitled me to go to the zoo whenever as often as I liked. I worked near the zoo.I used to go to the gorilla display at the Zoo during my lunch hour on occasion. There was one gorilla who seemed to enjoy sitting near the window which separated us humans from its outdoor compound. I saw it come closer to the window whenever children were among the crowd of observers, looking to interact with some excited child. Since there was a solid glass pane between us and the gorilla, it had to be something beyond food that interested the gorilla to want to play with the children. Whenever I stopped there, that gorilla looked at me. Really, truly looked at me. I knew it was conscious, curious, interested - intelligent. I often saw my cat watching me, especially when I did something unusual (like trip over my feet), eyes bright with curiosity, or sometimes boredom, or disgust, and sometimes he seemingly was wondering ‘what the heck.’ Yes, he really did seem to have a variety of expressions from the age of two which mirrored human emotions appropriately when I did stuff. No, it wasn’t about a food reward or a coat brushing or an upcoming dreaded bath (he had a set of very unmistakable reactions that were different on those occasions). Outside the house, I noticed his face set into a mask of inscrutability; however, inside my house, he was physically and facially expressive, friendly and talkative (and abusive). While it was obvious his skillset of expressions was based on a small set of black and white emotions, one of them was clearly amusement, especially when it was at my expense. Sometimes I know he was feeling schadenfreude! Bastard. Really. He was a bastard (unknown parentage). 😃Cats.It is beyond me why so many scientists for hundreds of years have denied animals have cognition, memory, or planning skills. At least some scientists today are finally agreeing with us ordinary folk that many animals have brains which are active with emotions and thought, motivated by learning and feeling, much the same as us even if not for the same causes or interests. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging machine (MRI) has allowed scientists to see that when dogs see their owners, for instance, they have brain structures that activate similar to the locations in human brains which light up with pleasure. (Cats won't sit still in MRI machines. Frankly, I can't wait until someone comes up with a machine to see cat brains in action...)Fortunately, many scientists have lately taken on the task to observe, document and correlate actions of many animals to thinking, memory, planning and pleasure with experiments acceptable to most of the current scientific establishment. Frans de Waal’s book ‘Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?' describes many of these experiments, observations and, to me, proofs many animals are intelligent, albeit an intelligence dependent on the physiognomy of their bodies and on the things needed for their survival in their accustomed environment.De Waal believes experiments are often designed from the human environmental paradigm, or Umwelt, which gives results when interpreted that show a lack of ability or a lack of certain high-level aptitudes, skills and brain function. However, designing the test appropriate to an animal's life and body shows remarkably different and actual high-level cognition, even if it is a cognition only appropriate to the animal's needs when in an environment it understands.From page 13:""""The credo of experimental science remains that an absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. If we fail to find a capacity in a given species, our first thought ought to be ""Did we overlook something?"" And the second should be ""Did our test fit the species?""""The book is written in plain English describing how animals responded when tested appropriately using tests designed for their interests and abilities. Many animals hear sounds and see light and smell scents outside of our organic spectrum. Some of them have a completely different brain construction. Octopuses have a distributed brain, for example. Corvids, apes, elephants, dolphins, parrots, octopuses and many other animals can pass three-stage puzzles (using a variety of tools, such as a bunch of rocks and sticks in different lengths and shapes, combining the tools provided in a self-designed order to get a food tidbit, despite no training). Apes will make up a bag of their own tools, hidden and saved for when needed. Even sheep, who have a reputation of incredible stupidity, can recognize pictures of other individual sheep who look to us all alike! Holy cow... um, holy sheep!Cognition should be interpreted from an animal's viewpoint of the issue. What we see as a problem might be nothing essential to their world, so maybe they don't care enough to solve it. Animal brains might work out a different resolution to a problem than we would set up, too. Plus, human bias can affect how scientists design tests. For example, in testing toddlers to compare with an ape's response: children might be held in their mother's lap in a comfortable playroom, while the ape is behind bars in a metal cage in a laboratory all alone, separated from other apes and separated from its natural environment.The author does not only describe laboratory tests and recorded animal responses in this book. He tells about B. F. Skinner's (1904-1990) theory which until recently was the predominate one - that animals are simple mechanical robots with one computer program running on a loop - a stripped-down version of the human one. Mixed into lab examples refuting Skinner's theories are stories about actual observed behavior in zoos, aquariums, owner's homes (parrots and corvids) and in the wild. The stories are very amusing, amazing, and interesting. I have always known animals are smart, especially when in their own backyards so to speak, but their brainy capacities are demonstratively far more than what I knew. The chapters are organized to describe associated proofs of certain animal capabilities and which highlight the part of brain cognition which is being explored.The author is the C. H. Candler Professor in Emory University's Psychology Department and director of the Living Links Center at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center.

9,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14773738-julie,4,"This is another one of my non-reviews -- more of a literary/emotional ramble than an actual critique. Humans are arrogant. This much I know about us as a species, so to answer the question that the title of this book suggests, I would have to say, generally, we haven't a clue how smart animals are. We are just ""dumb animals"" too, after all, and there is some arrogance in even asking the question. Who is to say we are the better species for running this ole' planet of ours? Empirical evidence demonstrates quite the opposite in fact. Left to the ""lions and tigers and bears"" I wonder if we would be in quite the mess we are in, ecologically. But this isn't meant to be a rant on ecology either. Ethology ... the study of animal behaviour with emphasis on their behavioural patterns in the wildThis is a more common sense method of studying animal behaviour, albeit it is not a new science or approach, but one that is being adopted more frequently by thoughtful, observant, compassionate scientists. Approaching and studying animals on their own terms, in a manner of speaking; that is, looking at them them from what would most make sense to the animals in question, rather than imposing a set of constructs which we feel they should fit into. This sounds all rather silly, on the surface, to non-believers of the science -- much like it sounds silly to some of us that there are those who still believe the earth is only 6,000 years old and evolution is a dirty, stinking lie, or that we sprang from the head of Zeus, fully formed. In this case, we are not working with myths or fairy tales, but with science. How do we approach it, then, from the animal's point of view. We begin with the following premise:Each organism has its own ecology and lifestyle ... which dictates what it needs to know in order to make a living. There is not a single species that can stand model for all the others ... In the utilitarian view of biology, animals have the brains they need -- nothing more nothing less. Even within a species, the brain may change depending on how it is being used, such as the way song-related areas seasonally expand and contract in the songbird brain. Brains adapt to ecological requirements, as does cognition.In an honest approach to understanding animal cognition, we must demonstrate respect for every living organism and acknowledgement of its capacity to deal with the world on its own terms. It is our own anthropocentric attitude which makes this science even necessary, however, since it baffles me that the question need be asked at all. Is it not simply easier to accept that a toad has its toad-like shape, form, and attitude for surviving in a toad's world; or that a squirrel is equipped with all the knowledge and wisdom it needs to survive as a squirrel? I think many of us would be hard-pressed to survive as well as any deer in the forest, left to our own devices. Would we know how to forage and survive and thrive and raise a family if we didn't: have a job; have money to buy food we don't grow; have tools to dig the earth for the little we do grow; have tools, tools, tools for everything. Think about it. Think: someone drops you naked, in the middle of the forest, and says, may you flourish. How long would any of us survive? I'd give any of us a week. My money is on the deer.Part of the irony of all this is that we measure animal cognition and evolutionary advancement by the fact that they can/cannot use tools. It seems to be anthropocentrism on steroids, in my view. They survive admirably without tools; and yet, our measure of their evolved intelligence and cognition is that they must use tools. Seems like backward thinking to me: one must use an implement to do what another does instinctually. We are the dumb ones, not they.Having had my little tangent, I do admire Frans de Waal's approach to interpreting animal cognition. He, and scientists like him, are bringing us closer to inter-species understanding. When we finally acknowledge that all living things have a right to exist, it won't really matter how smart or how dumb we are. This book has great value in opening the conversation for those who have no concept or belief in higher animal cognition. For those of us who are beyond that point in the conversation, it is a comfort to know that animal studies are being conducted with more compassion, generosity of spirit, and empathy, than ever before.My one little quibble with it is that the writing runs a bit dry and only the most devoted to the science will read through to the end. A bit of colour never harmed the peacock if you want to attract some action. "

~ My Thoughts ~
I loved this book. In my undergraduate degree, I only had space for a few electives, and one of the classes I took was “Primate Behaviour”. In this course, we were required to read two Franz de Waal books: Chimpanzee Politics and Our Inner Ape. Usually when I’m “forced” to read something, I don’t enjoy it--whether it’s because I don’t have the time to enjoy it or because I’m contrary that way is besides the point. My point is that I genuinely loved these books, so much that I’m continuing to read de Waal’s publications even after university.One thing I love about de Waal’s books is that they’re so accessible to the general public, but not at the sacrifice of accuracy or including information about scientific process. He talks about things in layman’s terms, making them fun and engaging, all the while teaching the reader a ton of information on the topic.  As you may already know, I’m a librarian, and I do a lot of instruction in my job. In the ACRL’s Information Literacy Framework, one of the frames is “Scholarship as Conversation”. I doubt it’s even intentional in de Waal’s books, but the way he effortlessly talks about other researchers’ work and discoveries, how they contributed to general knowledge, how he himself has built off previous studies does a great job of showing how this conversation goes on in his field, and in science in general.As for the contents of this book, I’ve learned so many things that I can use in casual conversation (though it depends on who you’re talking to). Anytime I see a crow I tell anyone who'll listen about how they recognize human faces and hold grudges for generations.   I highly recommend this book to those who are interested in animal behaviour (not just apes in this book, but a variety of species), and to those who want to crack into reading nonfiction science books but aren’t sure of where to start.This review appeared first on https://powerlibrarian.wordpress.com/ Instagram | Blog | Website | Twitter My 2019 Reading Challenge"
12,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7983120-bobby,5,"This book is famed primatologist Frans de Waal at his best. We get the insight into the animal kingdom, with an emphasis on apes and monkeys, that we've seen in books like The Bonobo and The Atheist, The Age of Empathy, and Our Inner Ape. In this book, De Waal takes a close look at various ways of trying to understand animal cognition and goes in-depth into such topics as problem solving, communication, self-awareness, and relationship to events past and present, i.e. memory and planning for the future. The author manages to communicate in a way that the lay scientist can easily grasp while also making clear philosophical or scientific objections to various points of view and making all of it flow like a conversation.One of the key points in Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?, of course, is our own relationship to animal cognition. We are closely related to many of the species that are most commonly studied, chimpanzees and bonobos, for example. De Waal raises many questions but my favorite is probably the potential - and frequently the actuality - for human bias. Are we secure enough in ourselves as a species to acknowledge similarities with our animal relatives? And how unbiased are the tests that we use to compare animal and human cognition? Communication testing that is administered by a human to both a human infant and a primate is probably tilted in favor of humans, since the primate will not see one of his own kind while the human infant does.Perhaps most importantly, De Waal points out that these creatures that we're testing for cognitive ability have arrived where they are via evolutionary pathways that vary greatly from our own so that how they reflect their own cognitive abilities often differs greatly from what we expect from ourselves. In order to more fully understand the cognitive abilities of our animal friends, we must be able to shed the human bias that expects them to have the same abilities as we do. Communicating that is one of the great strengths of this book."

14,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,5,"Wow. Frans de Waal’s Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? is a breath of fresh air. It is a refreshing, insightful science book that both enlightens and entertains. In fact, I’d call it the most interesting science book I’ve read since Godel, Escher, Bach. If you’ve ever had a dog or a cat, you know they have “insides.” They think. They relate. And they have distinct personalities. And to see any dog looking at their master, waiting for a command… that seems love and respect personified. Problem is, university professors, even today, teach that animals had no insides. They are stimulus/ response machines. So that dog’s puppy-eyes reveal neither kindness nor affection for the owner. Instead, it was a learned response, since the master rewards a dog with a pat or food for that look. That behaviorist perspective never sat well with me. Nor, it seems, did cognitive biologist Frans de Waal agree. In fact, he debunks the behaviorist position over the book's 300 plus pages.This warm, humane and often funny book introduces the general reader to the science of ethology, or the study of animal behavior. Unlike the approaches students learn in psychology, where creepy, emotionless dudes in labcoats starve and shock rats, ethology honors their subjects. De Waal often repeats the advice of an early mentor: a prerequisite to understanding animals -- especially arthropods like monkeys and chimps -- is a fondness for them. De Waal implies you need heart to do good behavioral science. Which is refreshing.Philosophy aside, Are We Smart Enough is a wide-ranging book. It covers a broad spectrum of animal behavior. From mimicry in octopuses to the political jockeying for position typical of chimps. From the emotional intelligence of dogs, who fail intelligence measures like the mirror test, to the brilliance of dolphin hearing. From crows near a campus cawing warnings about a professor who, pursuing a line of research, captured chicks to raise -- picking one person from thousands -- to elephants solving problems and using tools.Most interesting to me was seeing the lengths other scientists, mostly psychologist, go through to ensure that humans come out as “the best” at tasks. De Waal does a wonderful job showing how human infant vs. ape tests are unfair. Psychologist test infants on their mother’s laps, while testing apes isolated in unfamiliar cages. And the tests often rely on human-specific aptitudes, like distinguishing human faces -- natural to an infant, unnatural to apes who are naturally better at distinguishing ape than human faces. The irony is that once ethologists adjust experiments, honoring an ape’s natural tendencies, the cognitive differences often disappear. But instead of conceding that apes (or jackdaws or dogs) are smart, psychologists move the bar. Shady, with hints of anti-Darwinism. Since instead of placing human cognition on a continuum, it seeks to set us apart.A refreshing book. That lays out an oft-neglected realm of science. That smashed Skinner’s box, revealing it as a sham, even after acknowledging the genuine desire of Skinner to improve human lives. Five-stars. And faved. "
15,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1655437-ac,4,"De Waal is interested in the topic of what he calls evolutionary cognition -- which refers to the study of how animals think, feel, degrees of consciousness, etc. He has been one of the foremost critics, in the past 20 years, of Behaviorism and proponents of ethology (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethology). This book, in particular, offers in a very readable format (written for the educated layman), an overview of the development of the field, and of the various topics within in. Rich in anecdote, the discussion of many different studies, of problems of scientific method (in this controversial field), and willing to probe the philosophical implications of his studies, the book is both illuminating and (to this layman, at least) persuasive.Less authoritative, perhaps, but better written and more moving, is Carl Safina's Beyond Words:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."
16,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96534946-l-g-cullens,4,"Relative to other such non-fiction books regarding the natural world that I've read, this to me is a four star read.As an over the hill naturalist student I still try to keep up with natural sciences research papers and books, and having read some of the author's previous books I was curious to read this one. To my perspective, in this book Frans De Waal presents a well-balanced, informative, lay-level description of the state of his science (Primatology and Ethology), his thinking, and a bit of history that has led to the current state of understanding. All this in the vein of:""What we observe is not nature in itself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning.""—Werner Heisenberg (1958)There are some repeated mentions, albeit out of necessity in being applicable to or contrasting with differing contexts. In other words, rather than superfluous bits I see such as a scientific mind trying hard to convey understanding of complex subject matter. He can also be a little cutting at times, for the most part appropriately so from my perspective:""What a bizarre animal we are that the only question we can ask in relation to our place in nature is 'Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the smartest of them all?'”If anything captures the gist of this book it is:""That all mammalian brains operate in essentially the same way has also been found in other domains. Behind these similarities is a much deeper message, of course. Instead of treating mental processes as a black box, as Skinner and his followers had done, we are now prying open the box to reveal a wealth of neural homologies. These show a shared evolutionary background to mental processes and offer a powerful argument against human-animal dualism.. . .""We are moving ever closer to Darwin’s continuity stance, according to which the human-animal difference is one of degree, not kind.""Think of the Clark's nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana) which squirrels away more than twenty thousand pine nuts, in hundreds of different locations over many square miles, and in the winter manages to recover most of them. Cognition, in good part, is relative to survival in any evolved life form, and in turn if a species becomes weedy can lead to excesses that prompt demise in Nature's balancing act.This month I came across a research paper which further reinforces Frans De Waal's thinking.Titled MRI scans of the brains of 130 mammals, including humans, indicate equal connectivity, it can be seen at https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases...This book can also be enlightening if the reader looks at it from another angle. That is, thinking about the evolutionary aspect of human proclivities. Most striking might be chimpanzee politics, which Frans De Waal mentions in this book and wrote an earlier (1982) book on. Chimpanzees are of course one of our close cousins, a sister taxon to the human lineage. Such can be enlightening in understanding our societal and governing issues.""The greatest of human discoveries in the future will be the discovery of human intimacy with all other modes of being that live with us on this planet."" ~ Thomas Berry""A human being is part of a whole, called by us the Universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings, as something separated from the rest - a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and ...to affection for a few persons nearest us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty."" - Albert Einstein"

“Are we open-minded enough to assume that other species have a mental life? Are we creative enough to investigate it? Can we tease apart the roles of attention, motivation, and cognition? Those three are involved in everything animals do; hence poor performance can be explained by any one of them.” 
if you love animals, you'll probably love this book I love animals and I really liked this book. It was so interesting to read about all the different tests and case studies of animals and animal cognition. This book is so easy to follow, it goes along chronically to explain the history of the study behind animal cognition and as it goes, gives lots of real life examples and stories of animals that were studied. I found these stories SO interesting and some of them were genuinely mind-blowing. It is amazing what animals can do and I never realised a lot of it until I read this book!As mentioned, this was really easy to read and I didn't think it was dry at all even though it's a non-fiction. I enjoyed it alot and I also listened to some of it on audiobook which is also good!"
18,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33447134-book-riot-community,0,"Humans have always used animals as a natural resource, justifying the killing of our fellow creatures in various ways, but mainly by assuming they are not like us. What if our denialism masks that animals are more like us than we can imagine? Can they think? Are they self-aware? Can they plan, remember and anticipate? Frans de Waal describes scientific research that reveals astonishing answers. When chimpanzees beat human children at video games or birds understand our language or elephants remember people after years, we need to rethink the nature of consciousness. After reading about chimpanzee politics, I felt many people voted not by analytical reason, but by ancient instincts. This book is revealing in two ways – animals are a lot more like us than we believe, and we’re still a whole lot like them.— James Wallace Harrisfrom The Best Books We Read In November 2016: http://bookriot.com/2016/12/01/the-be...

De Waal does a few things in this book. He gives the reader an overview of the way research into this field has developed from the time of Darwin to the present day, and he shows how far this research has got today, but also shows where more research is needed. I’m not a scientist, just a reader interested in this subject, and what I think he does best with this book is to make the theoretical aspects of this readable. I’ve read a quite a bit of non fiction over the years, and I can honestly say that even if a writer knows his subject better than anyone else, that doesn’t always mean they can write a readable book. De Waal can write, and this was an enjoyable read. "

Are we open-minded enough to assume that other species have a mental life? Are we creative enough to investigate it? Can we tease apart the roles of attention, motivation, and cognition? Those three are involved in everything animals do.
Like many of the other first year Liberal Arts university students I knew at the time, I took a lot of Intro courses (Intro to Psychology, Intro to Philosophy, Intro to Sociology), and these were for the most part fascinating enough to me that I broadened my sampling of the fields into my second year. I remember specifically taking both Comparative Psychology and a course called Ethology, and what I couldn't have known (twenty-some years ago) was that these two fields were about to go to war with each other: with the Psychologists insisting that all nonhuman behaviour is conditioned/preprogrammed and that the anthropromorphising of animals (and especially granting them intelligence or emotions) betrays a weak and sentimental mind, and the Ethologists rebutting that if researchers aren't finding evidence of human-like intelligence in nonhuman animals, the problem is with their methodology. Working and researching throughout these past few decades, Primatologist Frans de Waal has assembled much evidence to back up Darwin's initial claim that the difference between animals and humans is one of degree, not of kind, and with Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?, he traces the confrontation between the two sides of this debate; smugly trumpeting the victory of his own beliefs. Now, I still enjoy reading pop science and sampling what's new in the fields that have long intrigued me, but I didn't find this book to be terribly engaging: my mind kept wandering, I was rarely wowed by the illustrative anecdotes, and I didn't find the writing style to be very interesting; since I didn't know there had been this decades-long war between the two sides, de Waal's conclusion that accepted theory has shifted from the Psychologists' viewpoint to that of the Ethologists isn't paradigm-shattering to me. This was just an okay read.
It would be great if everyone were open-minded and purely interested in the evidence, but science is not immune to preconceived notions and fanatically held beliefs. Anyone who forbids the study of language origins must be scared of new ideas, as must anyone whose only answer to Mendelian genetics is state persecution. Like Galileo's colleagues, who refused to peek trough his telescope, humans are a strange lot. We have the power to analyze and explore the world around us, yet panic as soon as the evidence threatens to violate our expectations.
De Waal's main point is that for the last century, Behaviourists have been testing animals as though true intelligence can only be proven if nonhumans behave exactly like humans – they decided gibbons are non-tool-using because they won't grasp sticks (yet, they don't have opposable thumbs and will use tools if they are like the tree branches they find in nature [ie, horizontal strings]); they decided elephants are non-tool-using because they won't manipulate sticks with their trunks in the way that the researchers expected (yet, they will stack boxes to reach dangling food) – and they relied far too heavily on rats and pigeons, etc., in unnatural situations to explain human behaviour. De Waal makes the valid point that testing a chimp in a cage, directed by a nonmember of their own species in a white lab coat, against a human child who is sitting on her mother's lap and encouraged to identify with the researcher, is not exactly apples to apples: no wonder the chimps routinely test poorly against the children. By contrast, De Waal's research has taken him to nature preserve-type settings around the world where the complex (and intelligent) behaviour of chimpanzees can be tested and proven within their own Umwelt. These results are so unsurprising that it seems incredible that the Ethologists have had to fight so hard to have their findings accepted.
However good our relations with apes, the idea that we can test them in exactly the same way we test children is an illusion of the same order as someone throwing both fish and cats into a swimming pool and believe he is treating them in the same way.
De Waal shares research that proves various animals have the intelligence to display behaviours we previously attributed only to humans – tool use, planning for the future, complex speech, counting, recognising themselves in a mirror, etc – and beyond our near relatives the primates, he cites the intelligent behaviour of birds (and especially parrots and corvids; jays and crows, etc), dogs, dolphins and whales, octopuses, even some insects. De Waal traces the history of the confrontation between the two sides in the debate; often mocking the inflexibility of the Behaviourists and how they continually moved the goalposts in the face of new evidence in order to preserve the “uniqueness” of human intelligence. This mocking seems to be a hallmark of De Waal's style:
The term 'nonhuman' grates on me, since it lumps millions of species together by an absence, as if they were missing something. Poor things, they are nonhuman! When students embrace this jargon in their writing, I cannot resist sarcastic corrections in the margin saying that for completeness's sake, they should add that the animals they are talking about are also nonpenguin, nonhyena, and a whole lot more.
Note the exclamation point there, too – De Waal is a not infrequent devotee of their use. So, this wasn't quite the book I was expecting, and as for what it was, I didn't really engage with it. For the most part, it read like the victory speech of an ungracious winner. It is incredible to me that there has even been this debate about the need to test animals within their own environments (and not expect them to be able to replicate our own specific demonstrations of intelligent behaviours), so I understand why there was a need for this overview; I just wanted a better narrative, I guess."
21,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10312986-lyn-elliott,4,"Primatologist De Waal mounts a passionate, research-based case for animal intelligence. If ever you were in doubt, read this. It's a fascinating book, and important for anyone who thinks about the relationship between humans and animals.He argues for an end to the view that humans are unique, that previous concepts of linear evolution with humans at the top of the scale are wrong, and reflect 'anthropodenial '- a priori rejection of humanlike traits in other animals or animal like traits in us'. In chapter after chapter De Waal gives example after example of experiments that demonstrate different species have memory, use tools, count, recognise individuals of their own (wasps, sheep) and other species ), laugh, and recognise themselves in mirrors (chimpanzees, crows, elephants - who need a large mirror), monitor social interactions. All of these have at some stage been presented as indicating ways in which humans stand above all other animals, who were presumed not to have these abilities, but to act on instance, or in response to reward. Behaviorists such as B.F. Skinner and his followers come in for particularly tough criticism, quite justifiably I felt. Poor rates, poor pigeons and all the other animals who were tormented by generations of experimenters and their students as they were trained to push or peck at buttons or run through mazes. De Waal presents us with a new field he refers to as evolutionary cognition, which recognises that nimals have the sort of intelligence they need to succeed in their environment and lifestyle, their Umwelt. Every species is special, and learning is dictated by biology.To understand more about animal cognition, researchers need to focus on 'at what cognitive level a given species operates and how this suits their ecology and lifestyle'. We need to be teasing out the building blocks that make up cognition, rather than heading for the high ground of theory of mind, self awareness and language.He concludes by saying that we need to 'Instead of making humanity the measure of all things, we need to evaluate other species by what they are'. De Waal is a great science communicator, able to present a huge body of knowledge in an easy narrative style that never talks down to the reader but is not intimidating, even when discussing evolution which can get technical. Giving examples helps a lot with that, such as with the concepts of homologous and analogous evolution: Homologous evolution refers to traits derived fron a common ancestor, such as a human hand and the wing of a bat which both derive from an ancestral forelimb. Analogous evolution occurs when distantly related animals evolve in the same direction, as with the sensitivity to faces in wasps and primates, which came about independently and is based on the need to recognise individual group mates (p75).Most of the case studies he uses are from primate research, some other mammals, some birds, some insects and fish. Near the end of the book he notes briefly that he hasn't included animal emotions. This is a study of cognition, but if cognition and perception are closely connected as he argued, then I think you must include emotion as well. I hope there's another book to come."
22,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6296289-tyler-j-gray,5,"“Are we smart enough to know how smart animals are?” is a wonderful and insightful look at animal intelligence and cognition! It is backed up by evidence from controlled experiments and field research. It includes history on the beliefs of animal cognition and research, and how much people have learned over the years. I went into this book already open-minded about how smart animals are, I already believed they are often smarter than people give them credit for, and I was still amazed and learned so much! It is engaging and very accessible. Yes I did google things along the way, because I was interested. There is a glossary at the back of the book as well. He explains everything well through-out the book though. Frans De Waal is a Dutch/American biologist with a PH.D. in zoology, ethology and is the author of other books as well. He has spent decades studying animals and getting to know them, especially primates. This book felt very balanced. He doesn’t try to oversell anything and everything is backed up by discoveries, studies and other scientists. He obviously has a love for animals as well as science, both of which shined through the book. I love how one of the things stressed is the importance of well-constructed experiments. Experiments that fit the animal in question, their temperament, anatomy, etc. In one experiment some scientists thought a particular species of apes (or was it monkeys? I have too many tabs to find it) failed a certain test, until they realized their hand was shaped differently, in a way that they couldn’t actually do what was asked of them and when they modified the experiment to fit them, they passed it after all. Anatomy among other things must be taken into account. It reminds me of thisIn short, I loved this book and learned a lot from it! If you have an interest in animals, animal intelligence or cognition, i’d highly recommend it! Or if you think as animals as less than humans and dumb, i’d also recommend it. They may just surprise you, and it's all backed up by hard science."

I loved how he showed that sometimes ""skepticism"" is actually pseudo-skepticism which results from our eagerness to know ourselves as something special and different from all the other organisms, which the author -rightly so- names ""Anthropocentrism"".I loved this book. It shows the shortcomings of the field of ethology and how they can be fixed. And also how much evidence our society is underrating, even though many of them are right in our face and slapping us like: You idiot! Why can't you see me! And indeed, we are so self-involved that are unable to recognize science from bias. I enjoyed this book, It was a enjoyable read and I would recommend it. "
24,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13510236-richard-reese,4,"Primatologist Frans de Waal has made a career out of pounding his head against the rugged wall of human exceptionalism — the belief that humans are the only species that is conscious, self-aware, rational, cooperative, goal-oriented, empathetic, and so on. This wall of calcified grandiosity has resisted change for a long time, and has inspired an abusive relationship with the rest of the family of life. With his new book, Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?, de Waal has launched a new assault on the cult of exceptionalism.In the 1970s, when de Waal was in college, behavioral psychology was the hot trend. It asserted that animals were mindless, machine-like organisms that did nothing more than robotically respond to stimuli with responses. Animals were incapable of cognition — knowing based on perception and judgment. They could not have desires or intentions. Many scholars remain reluctant to consider the possibility that animals possess various forms of intelligence. Whoops, I meant non-human animals. In our culture, the two categories of fauna are humans and animals (not wombats and non-wombats).In the last 20 years, new research has been inspiring doubt in many long-held beliefs, including the notion that rationality is exclusively human. Yet “animal cognition” is still an obscene four-letter word, a diabolical heresy. Smart scholars wait until they have tenure before they come out of the closet and study it.The illusion of exceptionalism has deep roots. By the time children reach the age of 8 or 10, their worldviews are largely solidified for the rest of their lives. The culture constantly reinforces this worldview, and only a few can summon the power to question it. So, youngsters absorb the worldview, grow up, and raise their children with it, generation after generation. Entrenched belief is immune to conflicting evidence.Humans are extremely proud of our complex language and abstract thought, but these are just two tools in a big box of mental functions used by animals. De Waal believes that some species use forms of intelligence that we are still unaware of — intelligence beyond our imagination. The absolute bottom line for any species is basic survival, and ants and termites excel at this. No animal needs alphabets, numbers, or glowing screens.Irene Pepperberg had a parrot named Alex, who was remarkably capable of advanced cognition. When she pointed at a key, Alex said “key.” He pronounced words precisely. He could add numbers. Alex didn’t just memorize names, he could listen to questions, think, and answer correctly. He was asked, “What color is corn?” when no corn was present. “Yellow,” he replied.Other birds are also extremely smart. “The Clark’s nutcracker, in the fall, stores more than twenty thousand pine nuts, in hundreds of different locations distributed over many square miles; then in winter and spring it manages to recover the majority of them.” Could you do that?Crows, jays, magpies, and ravens are corvids, “a family that has begun to challenge the cognitive supremacy of primates.” One biologist caught and banded many crows, which really pissed them off. They recognized him wherever he went, and they regularly scolded and dive-bombed him.Ayumu the chimp was trained to use a touchscreen. On the screen, a number appeared for a quarter second, then another, in a rapid sequence. Ayumu could remember the sequence of numbers, and then tap them in the correct order. Without practice, he was far better than any human at memory tests — even a memory expert who could remember the sequence of cards in a deck. Harrumph! The supremacists soiled their britches and muttered obscenities. Eventually, a frantic researcher practiced, practiced, and practiced and was finally able to score as well as a chimpanzee.In Japan, chimps were taught a computer game, similar to rock-paper-scissors, which required them to anticipate their opponent’s choices. “The chimps outperformed the humans, reaching optimal performance more quickly and completely than members of our own species.”Like many social animals, primates excel at imitation and conformity, which can have great survival value. Youngsters note what their mothers eat, and what they avoid. Chimps readily imitate the behavior of high status chimps, but not low status ones. When apes are raised in a human home, they are as good at imitating humans as children are. They “spontaneously learn to brush their teeth, ride bicycles, light fires, drive golf carts, eat with a knife and fork, peel potatoes, and mop the floor.”Humans are pathological conformists, abandoning personal preferences when they conflict with the current whims of the majority, whims that are typically manufactured by a slimy mob of marketing shysters. When a celebrity dyes her hair pink, her fans do too. Respectable people must travel everywhere in gas guzzling motorized wheelchairs — bicyclists, bus riders, and walkers are low status slugs. Mindless imitation is the life force of consumer society, and the death force of Earth’s biosphere.When de Waal gives a talk on primate intelligence, he is frequently asked, “What sets humans apart?” Consider an iceberg, he responds. Almost all of it is submerged, only a wee tip is visible above the surface. We have many cognitive, emotional, and behavioral similarities with our primate relatives, and a few dozen differences — the tip. Academia focuses most attention on the tip alone. “Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the smartest of them all?”Animal intelligence books annoy me. Why do we need scientists to inform us that animals are not robots? Wild people, and others who live close to nature, never doubt the powerful intelligence of deer, ravens, foxes, and weasels. I know outdoor living. I have watched healthy wild animals survive long frigid winters without tools, fire, or clothing — a way of life that would promptly kill me.We are like fish out of water, space aliens. The best way to discover the intelligence and coherence of the family of life is to abandon our climate-controlled cubicles and go back home to the wild. But there are way too many of us. Books and videos cannot substitute for fulltime direct experience. It’s no fun being a space alien. The Koyukon tell us “Every animal knows way more than you do.” A shaman once told Knud Rasmussen “True wisdom is only to be found far away from people, out in the great solitude.”De Waal’s book jabbers a lot about experiments done in zoos and research centers, on enslaved animals. I’m not a fan of animal imprisonment. I’m a fan of wildness and freedom. The ancestors of chimps and bonobos have lived in the same place for millions of years without trashing it — a demonstration of profound intelligence. Send the researchers to the rainforest, so we can learn from our brilliant relatives, and rigorously question our entrenched beliefs.There is an enormous quirk in this book. The core premise is that humans are a highly intelligent species, and that the other animals are not as dumb as we think. Are ants seriously destabilizing the climate? Are termites acidifying the oceans? Are chimps sending billions of tons of topsoil into the sea? In this discourse on animal intelligence, the fact that human animals are knowingly bludgeoning the planet is never once acknowledged.De Waal says, “Cognition is the mental transformation of sensory input into knowledge about the environment and the successful application of this knowledge.” Cognition is about the process of acquiring and applying knowledge. “Intelligence refers more to the ability to do it successfully.” Among the propeller heads of science, “success” includes the bad juju of overpopulation, overshoot, and overconsumption. My definition of success requires long-term ecological sustainability. "
25,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28266634-liza-fireman,2,"Even though this book had some nice content, it was so repetitive that it really bothered me. I could not even count how many time the author mentioned ""it was once taboo for scientists to name their animals"". I think the main thing that becomes clear in this book is how we judge other animals: What a bizarre animal we are that the only question we can ask in relation to our place in nature is “Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the smartest of them all?”. We don't have the right tools or ideas how to judge many animals mental capacity, and they don't really need some of the skills that we have to survive. We overestimate our brain as the comparison, and our environment to make the experiments. And we have the hubris to start with the believe that we are better, smarter, superior. The claim that only humans can mentally hop onto the time train, leaving all other species stranded on the platform, is tied to the fact that we consciously access past and future. Anything related to consciousness has been hard to accept in other species. But this reluctance is problematic: not because we know so much more about consciousness, but because we have growing evidence in other species for episodic memory, future planning, and delayed gratification. Either we abandon the idea that these capacities require consciousness, or we accept the possibility that animals may have it, too.Here is one paragraph that makes it clear both of the lack of humanity in experiments, but also on why they may fail, not allowing animals the best conditions to thrive:There is the quality of life issue. It is my personal feeling that if we are going to keep highly social animals in captivity, the very least we can do for them is permit them a group life. This is the best and most ethical way to enrich their lives and make them thrive.I would rate it much higher if it was better written, but I feel that it missed big time, because of repetitive writing and lack of engaging structure. Almost 2.5 stars."
26,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3898791-udit-nair,5,"Incredibly Insightful. This is my second book from the same author and it is bang on point. First of all the title itself is very intriguing and picking it up became natural. The author very humbly does admit that it's not like a subject book but moreover like commentary on cognition studies. But it indeed challenges most of the paradigms on it's way. The book starts with most profound statement given by Charles Darwin that is ""The difference in mind between man and the higher animals,great as it is, certainly is one of degree and not of kind."" Frans De Waal takes it further and adds that this dictum can be easily applied to all organisms and not only higher animals per say. In the starting chapters he tries to explain how sometimes it's the methodology which hinders cognition tests rather than the cognition of the animal. There are numerous examples and anecdotes given to explain this stand. The expertise of the author is used very well here. The tool use argument which has been held at supreme to showcase the human uniqueness has been debunked completely in this book. The author not only gives samples evidences but also for all great apes and not only chimpanzees per say. He reminds us of the reply louis leakey gave to Jane Goodall when she reported tool use in gombe. Leakey replied that "" Either scientists must accept chimpanzee as man or redefine man or redefine tool use.""There is also interesting aspects comparing primate cognition with corvids. There is a little scientific rivalry going on but it's fun to read about the experiments. The author also points out that for long time animals in general and birds in particular have been denigrated and treated merely as creatures of instinct rather than as sentient beings. Having observed birds closely I can vouch for the enigmatic characteristics of feathered bipeds and to think that they are only mechanical creatures driven by instinct only would be a great disservice. We have all come across instances when animals and specially dogs understand what we want to convey. The author says that animals have this incredible quality of looking right through animals perhaps because they are not dictated by language. By directing our attention to what others have to say, we neglect body language. But for animals body language is all they have to go by. It is a skill that they employ every day and have refined to the point that they read us like a book. The anecdotes added to this claim are so incredibly insightful that I was just smiling throughout the chapter. The most profound insight I gathered from the book and I completely agree with it is this. In biology and medical sciences, continuity is the default assumption. It couldn't be otherwise, because why would anyone study fear in rats in order to treat human phobias if not for the premise that all mammalian brains are similar?. Continuity across life forms is taken for granted and however important humans may be, they are a mere speck of dust in the larger picture of nature. So while studying intelligence or cognition or neuroscience it doesn't make any sense to consider humans are special. Yes we do have things which makes us unique but that shouldn't be an assumption for all studies. Clearly it's time for us to start testing animals in accordance with their biology and move away from human centric approaches. The author makes interesting observations regarding dog and elephant cognition too. It is also true that not many studies have explored the cognition of elephants. We are only beginning to scratch the surface of one of the most enigmatic minds of the planet. I will sum up with the same lines author used to end the book which is "" instead of making humanity the measure of all things, we need to evaluate other species by what they are doing."""
27,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,4,"Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? By Frans de Waal“Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?” is an insightful look at animal intelligence backed up by evidence from controlled experiments. Dutch/American biologist with a Ph.D. in zoology and ethology and author of Our Inner Ape and others, Frans de Waal, takes the reader on a journey of the sophistication of nonhuman minds. This entertaining 352-page book includes the following nine chapters: 1. Magic Wells, 2. A Tale of Two Schools, 3. Cognitive Ripples, 4. Talk to Me, 5. The Measure of all Things, 6. Social Skills, 7. Time Will Tell, 8. Of Mirrors and Jars, and 9. Evolutionary Cognition. Positives:1.	Engaging and well-written book that is accessible to the masses.2.	A fascinating topic in the hands of a subject matter expert, nonhuman cognition. 3.	Entertaining and insightful. The book is easy to follow. Professor de Waal is fair and even handed. He is careful to not oversell nonhuman cognition while providing a mixture of stories, experiments and observations to back his points. “I will pick and choose from among many discoveries, species, and scientists, so as to convey the excitement of the past twenty years.”4.	Includes many sketches that complement the excellent narrative.5.	Introduces and explains key new terms. “Umwelt stresses an organism’s self-centered, subjective world, which represents only a small tranche of all available worlds.”6.	Does a wonderful job of explaining the most important topic of this book, animal cognition. “No wonder Griffin became an early champion of animal cognition—a term considered an oxymoron until well into the 1980s—because what else is cognition but information processing? Cognition is the mental transformation of sensory input into knowledge about the environment and the flexible application of this knowledge.” “While the term cognition refers to the process of doing this, intelligence refers more to the ability to do it successfully.”7.	A look into experimental science. “The credo of experimental science remains that an absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.”8.	One of the recurring themes of this wonderful book is the importance of conducting well-constructed experiments. “Their earlier poor performance had had more to do with the way they were tested than with their mental powers.” “The challenge is to find tests that fit an animal’s temperament, interests, anatomy, and sensory capacities.”9.	A fascinating look at the field of evolutionary cognition. “The field of evolutionary cognition requires us to consider every species in full.”10.	One of the most important topics covered is the notion of continuity. “It is far more logical to assume continuity in every domain, Griffin said, echoing Charles Darwin’s well-known observation that the mental difference between humans and other animals is one of degree rather than kind.”11.	Explains key differences between behaviorism and ethology. “The difference between behaviorism and ethology has always been one of human-controlled versus natural behavior. Behaviorists sought to dictate behavior by placing animals in barren environments in which they could do little else than what the experimenter wanted.”12.	The book provides interesting examples that includes animals beyond de Waal’s expertise of primates. “With animals such as chimpanzees, elephants, and crows, for which we have ample evidence of complex cognition, we really do not need to start at zero every time we are struck by seemingly smart behavior.”13.	Provocative questions. Do animals have culture? Find out.14.	Provides evidence for animal cognition. “A century ago Wolfgang Köhler set the stage for animal cognition research by demonstrating that apes can solve problems in their heads by means of a flash of insight, before enacting the solution.” “Apes do not just search for tools for specific occasions; they actually fabricate them.”15.	The pioneers of animal cognition. “Nadia Ladygina-Kohts was a pioneer in animal cognition, who studied not only primates but also parrots, such as this macaw. Working in Moscow at around the same time that Köhler conducted his research, she remains far less known.”16.	The amazing story of Ayumu. “Ayumu’s photographic memory allows him to quickly tap a series of numbers on a touchscreen in the right order, even though the numbers disappear in the blink of an eye. That humans cannot keep up with this young ape has upset some psychologists.”17.	An interesting look at social skills. “The cooperative pulling paradigm, as it is known, has been applied to monkeys, hyenas, parrots, rooks, elephants, and so on.” “In the end, we found proof in the pudding that chimpanzees are highly cooperative. They have no trouble whatsoever regulating and dampening strife for the sake of achieving shared outcomes.”18.	Do animals plan ahead? “This study was quite ingenious and included a few additional controls, leading the authors to conclude that jays recall what items they have put where and at what point in time.” “Lisala, a bonobo, carries a heavy rock on a long trek toward a place where she knows there are nuts. After collecting the nuts, she continues her trek to the only large slab of rock in the area, where she employs her rock as a hammer to crack the nuts. Picking up a tool so long in advance suggests planning.”19.	The intelligence of elephants. “In short, elephants make sophisticated distinctions regarding potential enemies to the point that they classify our own species based on language, age, and gender. How they do so is not entirely clear, but studies like these are beginning to scratch the surface of one of the most enigmatic minds on the planet.”20.	The three divided attitudes on animal cognition: slayers, skeptics, and the proponents. 21.	Notes and bibliography included.Negatives:1.	The scientific process needed to be explained in more detail and specifically how it relates to the study of primates. An appendix explaining de Waal’s overall scientific approach would have been helpful.2.	Lacks supplementary visual materials such as diagrams, charts and graphs. A chart depicting the different types of primates with key statistics as an example. Maps showing where the main subjects come from.3.	On the topic of neuroscience a little more depth was warranted. Once again, visual material would have complemented the narrative. 4.	The format could have been enhanced to highlight the most noteworthy observations or facts. In summary, this was a very entertaining book. Professor De Waal succeeds in entertaining and educating the public on animal cognition. His mastery of the topic is admirable and is careful to be grounded on the facts and not to oversell an idea. A lot of interesting insights don’t miss this one. I recommend it!Further recommendations: “The Bonobo and the Atheist”, “Our Inner Ape”, “The Age of Empathy”, “Chimpanzee Politics” by the same author, “The Genius of Birds” by Jennifer Ackerman, “Beyond Words: What Animals Think and Feel” by Carl Safina, “The Soul of an Octopus” by Sy Montgomery, “Animal Wise” by Virginia Morell, “Zoobiquity” by Barbara Natterson-Horowitz, “The Secret Lives of Bats” by Merlin Tuttle, and “Last Ape Standing” by Chip Walter.

28,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5877123-helen-power,5,"I loved this book. In my undergraduate degree, I only had space for a few electives, and one of the classes I took was “Primate Behaviour”. In this course, we were required to read two Franz de Waal books: Chimpanzee Politics and Our Inner Ape. Usually when I’m “forced” to read something, I don’t enjoy it--whether it’s because I don’t have the time to enjoy it or because I’m contrary that way is besides the point. My point is that I genuinely loved these books, so much that I’m continuing to read de Waal’s publications even after university.One thing I love about de Waal’s books is that they’re so accessible to the general public, but not at the sacrifice of accuracy or including information about scientific process. He talks about things in layman’s terms, making them fun and engaging, all the while teaching the reader a ton of information on the topic.  As you may already know, I’m a librarian, and I do a lot of instruction in my job. In the ACRL’s Information Literacy Framework, one of the frames is “Scholarship as Conversation”. I doubt it’s even intentional in de Waal’s books, but the way he effortlessly talks about other researchers’ work and discoveries, how they contributed to general knowledge, how he himself has built off previous studies does a great job of showing how this conversation goes on in his field, and in science in general.As for the contents of this book, I’ve learned so many things that I can use in casual conversation (though it depends on who you’re talking to). Anytime I see a crow I tell anyone who'll listen about how they recognize human faces and hold grudges for generations.  I highly recommend this book to those who are interested in animal behaviour (not just apes in this book, but a variety of species), and to those who want to crack into reading nonfiction science books but aren’t sure of where to start.This review appeared first on https://powerlibrarian.wordpress.com/ Instagram | Blog | Website | Twitter My 2019 Reading Challenge"
29,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2220787-ram,4,"A nice book that basically claims that animals have very high cognitive abilities. These abilities include making and using tools, future planning, changing behavior based on knowing what other (animal) individuals saw (and therefore know), memory that excels human memory, complex social behavior and many other features. The author claims that basically, we do not have the knowledge to evaluate the cognitive ability of animals and in many cases the experiments we do are the reason we come to the conclusion that there ability is inferior. In order to get accurate results there is need to have better understanding of the animal from the animal's point of view. I admit that I was impressed by this book and I treat my cat and dog differently following this book. One example I can give is of the Japanese Chimpanzee, Ayumu that managed to achieve better memory test results than humans:""Ayumu, is a young male who, in 2007, put human memory to shame. Trained on a touchscreen, he can recall a series of numbers from 1 through 9 and tap them in the right order, even though the numbers appear randomly on the screen and are replaced by white squares as soon as he starts tapping. Having memorized the numbers, Ayumu touches the squares in the correct order. Reducing the amount of time the numbers flash on the screen doesn’t seem to matter to Ayumu, even though humans become less accurate the shorter the time interval. Trying the task myself, I was unable to keep track of more than five numbers after staring at the screen for many seconds, while Ayumu can do the same after seeing the numbers for just 210 milliseconds. This is one-fifth of a second, literally the bat of an eye. One follow-up study managed to train humans up to Ayumu’s level with five numbers, but the ape remembers up to nine with 80 percent accuracy, something no human has managed so far.1 Taking on a British memory champion known for his ability to memorize an entire stack of cards, Ayumu emerged the “chimpion"" "" The author discusses and presents the history of animal behavior research , but I did not really find that part of the book very appealing. Basically, I recommend this book to anyone that is interested in evolution, animals, cognitive research , and anyone who wants a good popular science book."

This is the book I wanted to write and I am thrilled that someone eminently more qualified and clever than me has done so. Frans De Waal's ""Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?"" introduces readers thoughtfully and humorously to the evolution of our study of animals bringing us smoothly to the present. De Waal gently shifts paradigms so that we might consider that cognition, intelligence and communication may not rest solely in the hands of humankind."
31,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12436728-debbicat,5,"Fascinating read. Written by primatologist Frans de Waal, this is an astonishing study of animal intelligence. Did you know that Apes plan for the future? Or that elephants fetch boxes to reach a branch? Animals are amazing! So glad to see more information coming out on this. Thank you NetGalley and the publisher for an ARC in exchange for an honest review. YAY! I see (Dec. 12, 2016) that this won in the awards for Best Science for GR 2016. I did vote for it.

32,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,3,"It's interesting but not terribly inclusive and sometimes repetitious. It's crux is the umwelt of animals. Their worldview in their senses and body cognition. Primarily there is and has been for centuries a large disagreement between behavioral and a more singular cognition brain use re animals studies. Frans de Waal is not on the behavioral long term view that was so usually taught when I was young (more than half of the last century). Others in their excellent reviews here have explained it better than I.His writing style is ok, but I found my attention tended to wander. Wanting to read the animal tale examples and not so much all the scientific mesh they were placed within. And I do think it would be better read by those who have a lot less human cognitive psychology or mammal cognition formal studies as I did, albeit nearly 20 years ago now.He is a primate man. Most of the material is in his own field of expertise. I wanted to read more about the birds. And some other less obvious to reaction groups of animals who can operate and hold huge memory and retrieve it in majority correctly and quickly. IMHO, it has more to do with how we (this author or any scientific select question) connote and define ""smart"" than just about the animals' owning it too. And here, you do get that aspect of his opinion that it is not centered in behavioral pattern alone, but still- there is not sufficient definition of ""smart"" for me. Smart has become redefined into different aspects of connected ""learning"" techniques or abstract types of thinking? Or memory ability IQ type factor? Just my own opinion, but it needs to be more narrowly defined to have any exact scientific value to comparisons to answer that kind of question as the title asks."
33,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59371159-ilana,3,"I'm glad I read this book, because it's about a topic that interests me a lot, i.e. how ethologists* approach testing animals for signs of intelligence that are in keeping with their environment and physical attributes and needs. I was surprised to discover that ethologists had an uphill battle through most of the 20th century, and still to this day face fierce opposition from creationists on the one hand and those who refuse to believe human beings might share cognitive and social skills with the rest of the animal world on the other. Lots of fascinating description of observations of animals in the wild and in test sites, which is what I expected and was satisfied with. Unfortunately, I found the writing less than exciting and there were lots of little mistakes that seemed to be proof of poor editing, but it's a short book, which made these faults more tolerable for the sake of the information de Waal has to impart. I was tempted to give this book 4 stars because of how much interest in the raw material I had, but gave it 3.5 because it didn't make for that great a reading experience. But then... I don't read non-fiction all that much, so perhaps my expectations are too high in terms of writing quality?*Ethology is the scientific and objective study of animal behaviour, usually with a focus on behaviour under natural conditions, and viewing behaviour as an evolutionarily adaptive trait"

36,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5870882-sunny,4,"I enjoyed this. I’ve always had a penchant for animals and what I believe to be their natural intelligence (they don’t go around blowing the f out of each other and even if they could I’m not sure they would). The book is about various studies and often behavioural experiments that are done on various types of animals like monkeys and birds and dolphins and elephants to show that they have a degree of cognition which would have been scientific blasphemy (oxymoron / interesting title for a book?) if that had been said even a hundred years ago. The book gave interesting examples of when animals have gone on to mimic behaviours and essentially create a different culture from the one they had. Maybe they should lend our iPhone grabbing, Facebook addicted, twatter crazed zombie yout of today some hints and tips. The book had some really interesting sections:•	Werner Heisenberg “what we observe is not nature in itself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning”•	The story of Kluger (clever) Hans, a horse from Germany which could apparently count. His master would take him to all these village festivals and make millions of thallars out of him (ok maybe not that much) by giving him simple mathematical sums to work out like 3x3. The owner would count starting from 1 and he would continue counting until clever Hans stomped his feet. This baffled so many people but there was an explanation. When the horse would get to say 9 the owner (who always wore this big round hat) would look down at his feet and his hat wold tilt at a different angle at which point the horse would suddenly stomp down. He had learnt to stomp on a subtle movement his owner made at a certain point in time rather than being a mathematical genius •	A Japanese macaque (type of monkey) one day decided to wash her sweet potato before eating it. This wasn’t done by anyone else in that monkey tribe before this and upon seeing it the mother of this monkey started copying her daughter. After a while a culture spread of washing the sweet potatoes before they were eaten by the entire tribe of monkeys! This may not sound amazing but if you think that a monkey can spontaneously pick up a behaviour as simple as that (apparently none of the observing scientists had done this) then what else would a monkey in the right environment be capable of doing?•	Once in 1954 off Florida a stick of dynamite was thrown into the sea near a group of dolphins in an attempt to stun them and capture them for an aquarium. One dolphin was partially hit and stunned and as it floated to the surface 2 others came and put their heads on either side of the stunned one below its fins and guided it away to safety. •	“What a bizarre animal we are that the only question we can ask in relation to our place in nature is mirror mirror on the wall who is the smartest of them all?”"
37,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/502678-gail,3,"I have very mixed feelings about this book. It is well-researched and the author is one of the most well-known scientists in his field. The book seeks to explain why animal intelligence and cognition should be valued in their own right rather than compared to humans. In most studies of animal intelligence, the experiments are stacked against the animals from the start by using human paradigms and frames to evaluate the degree to which animals think. The author succeeds in his goal, but I only reluctantly went along for the ride. While the blurbs suggest that this is an exploration of the author's thesis written in lay language and that it surveys many animals, the book focuses heavily on primates, the author's area of specialty. You will definitely learn a lot about the scope and continuum of animal intelligence, but I thought it was a long slog getting to the conclusion...that yes, animals are smart in their own way, have self-awareness, plan ahead, use tools, understand their own particular social systems and conform to norms, and indeed have their own culture. It was even more striking to recognize so much of human behavior and culture in apes (not monkeys in the same way). This read more like a literature search and survey than a book written to engage lay readers. It was ponderous and I wasn't fond of the organizing structure he used. Unfortunately for Dr. de Waal, I recently read Carl Safina's book, ""What Animals Think & Feel"" and liked it much better. It was not a recitation of scientific studies to back a hypothesis but a coherent narrative that was lyrical, scientific, and engaging. I was never excited to learn about the research in this book and wished he'd focused more broadly. Safina cited some of the same scientific controversies in his book, but made the topics much more accessible. I have repeatedly recommended Dr. Safina's book. This one, by comparison, was OK and might be enjoyed by science junkies who have patience with hearing about all the studies. I did not. I did enjoy the history of the science though as it added to my understanding of why it has taken so long to accept the obvious - animals are smart and have a cognitive life of their own, independent of humans.  "
38,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5693583-james-jd-dittes,3,"After watching Dr. de Waal's TED talk, I was eager to read Are We Smart Enouth to Known How Smart Animals Are?De Waal cites studies the elevate our understanding of animal intelligence, from their use of tools and language, to the sophisticated ways they behave in groups. It is all part of Dr. de Waal's budding field of ""ethology,"" allowing animal intelligence to reveal itself in its own terms, rather than through human-oriented criteria.Dr. de Waal goes to great lengths to distinguish between his scientific methods and those of behaviorists--think of the rats-in-mazes experiments of the 1950s--or of earlier, disproven examples of animal intelligence such as Clever Hans, a horse who was believed to have the power of counting out math problems with his hoof.Special thanks to NetGalley for letting me preview this book.Reading as a person who doesn't have a strong scientific background, I got a little bogged down in the opening chapters, which sought to establish the scientific bona fides of ethology, but as I moved on into the chapters that summarized the various attributes of animal cognition, I found what I was looking for. This isn't an easy read for those interested in animal cognition. For those readers, I would recommend sticking to TED talks like de Waal's or Carl Safina's. It's a deep dive into a new and fascinating realm of evolutionary science."

He mainly uses apes/chimpanzees to illustrate his theses, but we also have birds (mainly of the corvid/raven variety), octopi, etc, brought in.

I could have dealt with that alone but the second part that drove me nuts was the author complaining about all of the biases people and different scientists have about comparing animal intelligence to people. It's obviously part of the story but the author harped on it again and again. It's obviously a pet peeve for him and I get it but after a while you want to scream no really I get it please move on.

Man/woman is clearly smarter than all the animals, or is he/she? When evaluating intelligence among species, the author makes it clear that it's important to evaluate based on the behavior and tendencies of the specific species, not just how similarly they express themselves to humans. There is example after example of how intelligent various species are in their own way. This is an eye-opening science book!"

Our dog was a manipulation champion, who always knew how to make us her obedient servants. She could also tell the time, and always knew when it was feeding time or time for a walk. If we forgot, she reminded us.People often assume that there’s a cognitive ladder, from lower life forms to higher ones, with humans at the top. But what if intelligence has another shape, if cognition take different forms which are not comparable to the human intelligence?The Dutch primatologist Frans de Waal has written a fascinating book about the concept of animal intelligence. Every animal has the intelligence that is necessary to master its surroundings and to survive.Intelligence is relative. As humans, we can never understand how it's really like to belong to another species, and animals can never understand how it is to be human. But it is still intelligence, and part of the problem is how to measure it.“Are we open-minded enough to assume that other species have a mental life? Are we creative enough to investigate it? Can we tease apart the roles of attention, motivation, and cognition? Those three are involved in everything animals do; hence poor performance can be explained by anyone of them.”The book is full of interesting stories from the animal kingdom. Japanese macaques dip sweet potatoes in the sea to make them more salty. New Caledonian crows create tools from tree branches to ferret out termites. Elephants can classify humans by age, gender, and language.“Ironically the study of animal cognition not only raises the esteem in which we hold other species, but also teaches us not to overestimate our own mental complexity.”"

He is a primatologist and ethologist who has studied animal behavior and cognition for decades. We see what animals can do. We see that many animals can recognize emotions, have memories, identities, can use tools and cooperate just as humans. The author explains how we need to evaluate other species by what they do in their own environment instead of making humanity the measure of all things.There is so much fascinating information about animals in this book from the greater apes, lesser apes, whales, octopuses, fish, birds and elephants to name a few. Even though the author specializes in primate social behavior at Yerkes Primate Research Center, he focuses on much more. Our science of animal cognition has progressed much since the early days of behavior studies from decades ago.Some of the fascinating stories are about Alex, the parrot that could respond to questions about objects, defining how they are different and not by rote. Alex could count and do addition. And Betty the crow that could bend straight wires into a hook to retrieve food from a tube, the first evidence of a non-primate making a tool. We see apes that have great insight for solving problems. They can learn to brush their teeth, ride bicycles, and eat with a knife and fork, peel potatoes and much more. They are also capable of deception. There are elephants who can tell human languages apart as well as the gender and age of human speakers.The premise of this book shows that you cannot call one animal species smarter or dumber than another on the basis of individual abilities. In order to fully understand the cognitive abilities of animals, we must dispense with the human bias that expects them to have the same abilities as we do. This book was very good at communicating this premise and is worth reading."

Having studied cognitive evolution at university, I had a decent grounding in the history, problems, and advances in the field. However, reading the refreshingly positive view that de Waal puts forward, I realise how negative studies have been, and the anthropocentric (and often egotistic) bias that the field has struggled with for the past 100 years.We aren't the 'peak' of evolution. Sure, we are pretty great at some stuff, but we are also pretty terrible at other things (I can't tell the difference between two red wines by either taste or smell). The fact that we look for things we are good at in other animals (i.e. Do they have language? Do they have Theory of Mind? Do they have culture?) is flawed in itself (even though the answer is usually yes), because we ignore the absolutely amazing cognitive marvels that non-human animals can do which we are no where near close to (echolocation springs to mind).In this book, de Waal puts forward an evidenced, unbiased account of the experiments, studies, and a number of observational anecdotes (often fascinating and amusing), being careful with his language and pointing out his own view when it is different from the more widely accepted theories.For anyone with a general interest in animals, psychology, and/or evolution, this is a must-read."

The gist of this book is: People, stop thinking we're so special."
47,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7208369-miles,5,"If humans want to survive and flourish in the Anthropocene, we will need to overcome the habits of thought that have wrought destruction on our collective psyche and the natural world. One of our most misguided and longstanding myths is the notion that humanity’s mental faculties should be considered qualitatively different from those of nonhuman animals. This view has always been wrong, but only over the last few decades have we acquired the scientific evidence to prove what many animal specialists have long suspected: Most animals are intelligent, emotional, and deeply social creatures. The delightful and irrefutable truth is that the spectrum of intelligence that has evolved on Earth is much vaster and more nuanced than previous generations could have imagined.While the need for specialization is an indispensable feature of the scientific endeavor, it is often interdisciplinary thinkers who excel at bringing the findings of science into the public sphere. This role is at least as important as the painstaking research from which scientific conclusions are derived, and Frans de Waal has occupied both worlds with remarkable poise over his distinguished career. His most recent book, Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?, is a grand achievement. The findings and ideas presented here might be old news to people on the cutting edge of animal research, but to the average reader they will appear startling, even miraculous.Upon diving into this text, I was immediately consumed by the pleasurable experience of trying to grasp the mental and emotional lives of nonhuman animals. de Waal’s exuberance for all aspects of animal research is invigorating and enlightening––the best salve for the unfounded ego trip we often indulge in our desperation to emphasize human uniqueness. He appeals at every turn to empirical evidence, delimiting areas where speculation is still necessary or research is too nascent to warrant strong conclusions.I’m certainly no animal specialist, but I’m very familiar with some of the other fields addressed here (consciousness, embodied cognition, linguistics, social psychology). Not once did any of de Waal’s observations lead me to believe he doesn’t have a firm enough grasp of these tricky topics to properly integrate them with findings from his own academic specialization. The result is a rare thing in the world of popular science books: A highly readable, balanced, and completely engaging synthesis of scientific perspectives that expands our understanding of the natural world while also shedding profound light on human capacities and limitations.Of the many technical terms de Waal uses to tell his story, the two most important are “Umwelt” and “ethology.” Umwelt is a German word that “stresses an organism’s self-centered, subjective world, which represents only a small tranche of all available worlds” (8). In order to acknowledge the depth of animal intelligence, we must first admit that each animal has its own specific Umwelt––a coherent world of sensory experience that may or may not overlap with our own. Evidence shows it is folly to assume that the Umwelts of nonhuman animals are somehow less rich or complex than the human Umwelt. This may not come as a surprise when considering mammals that we’ve long respected for their cleverness––dolphins and chimps, for example––but de Waal shows that we’ve also overlooked the remarkable abilities of animals traditionally thought to lack the capacity for higher intelligence, such as birds and rodents.In order to begin unraveling the plethora of Umwelts that make up the animal kingdom, de Waal suggests we turn to a field of study known as “ethology”: “The biological approach to animal and human behavior…that emphasizes species-typical behavior as an adaptation to the natural environment” (320). This is a fancy way of saying we need to study animals on their own terms, without pre-forming our own ideas of intelligent behavior and then expecting animals to conform to anthropocentric definitions. Each animal’s body has evolved over millions of years to interact with the natural environment in highly specialized ways; if we don’t take the body-environment relationship into account, we cannot properly analyze how or why animals do what they do.de Waal asserts that the ethological perspective is currently our best paradigm for studying and modeling animal Umwelts. When we do this successfully, we discover “magic wells”––the peculiar and splendid gifts bestowed on each species by evolution. The more magic wells we discover, the larger and more pluralistic our definition of intelligence becomes. The behaviorist and ""black box"" theories of past eras no longer apply, replaced by a continuum of intelligence rooted in our common evolutionary heritage:""All this requires that we circumvent the fragile human ego and treat cognition like any other biological phenomenon. If cognition’s basic features derive from gradual descent with modification, then notions of leaps, bounds, and sparks are out of order. Instead of a gap, we face a gently sloping beach created by the steady pounding of millions of waves. Even if human intellect is higher up on the beach, it was shaped by the same forces battering the same shore."" (163)It’s important to note that accepting the commonalities in the cognitive development of humans and nonhuman animals does not require us to reduce all instances of intelligence to one “type” or “mode” of thinking. There is still room for a special kind of “animal otherness”:""Every species deals flexibly with the environment and develops solutions to the problems it poses. Each one does it differently. We had better use the plural to refer to their capacities, therefore, and speak of intelligences and cognitions. This will help us avoid comparing cognition on a single scale…It seems highly unfair to ask if a squirrel can count to ten if counting is not really what a squirrel’s life is about. The squirrel is very good at retrieving hidden nuts, though, and some birds are absolute experts…There are lots of wonderful cognitive adaptations out there that we don’t have or need. This is why ranking cognition on a single dimension is a pointless exercise. Cognitive evolution is marked by many peaks of specialization."" (12, emphasis his).""Reality is a mental construct. This is what makes the elephant, the bat, the dolphin, the octopus, and the star-nosed mole so intriguing. They have senses that we either don’t have, or that we have in a much less developed form, making the way they relate to their environment impossible for us to fathom. They construct their own realities. We may attach less significance to these, simply because they are so alien, but they are obviously all-important to these animals."" (238)Intelligence, therefore, is not a unitary concept; it cannot be reduced to a set of general principles. Anyone wanting to know if a certain behavior or adaptation is “intelligent” must be sensitive to ecological circumstances. The question is not “Is an animal smart?” but rather “How does an animal achieve its goals within specific environmental contexts, and how plastic is its ability to learn and adapt to new challenges?”The reconfiguration of intelligence as a pluralistic concept is a worthy project for which de Waal offers plenty of supporting evidence, both theoretical and practical. This book overflows with mind-expanding examples from across the animal kingdom––data derived from controlled experiments as well as observations of animals in the wild. de Waal suggests we should value spontaneous behavior over experimental control, because watching animals follow their own inclinations is often the key to figuring out their particular type(s) of intelligent behavior (50, 137). An overhaul of experimental methodology has been necessary in some fields in order to locate and explore animal intelligence; the smartest scientists and labs have been on this path long enough to prove its efficacy.One of the most surprising aspects of Are We Smart Enough? is that a primatologist seems to understand the thorny topic of consciousness better than a good number of philosophers and neuroscientists. de Waal knows that––at least for now––the only way to talk intelligently about consciousness is to say very little about it while still acknowledging the biological mechanisms that almost certainly bring consciousness about:""There is sound evidence that mental processes associated with consciousness in humans, such as how we relate to the past and future, occur in other species as well. Strictly speaking, this doesn’t prove consciousness, but science is increasingly favoring continuity over discontinuity. This is certainly true for comparisons between humans and other primates, but extends to other mammals and birds, especially since bird brains turn out to resemble those of mammals more than previously thought. All vertebrate brains are homologous.Although we cannot directly measure consciousness, other species show evidence of having precisely those capacities traditionally viewed as its indicators. To maintain that they possess these capacities in the absence of consciousness introduces an unnecessary dichotomy. It suggests that they do what we do but in fundamentally different ways. From an evolutionary standpoint, this sounds illogical. And logic is one of those other capacities we pride ourselves on."" (234)If we weave together the different threads that might contribute to consciousness, we will find that––just like intelligence––any honest definition of consciousness must admit a plurality of natural forms. Many species are capable of problem-solving (including tool use), complex social hierarchies, future projection, and episodic (and perhaps even autobiographical) memory. The depth and flexibility with which various animals engage in these activities is staggering, and there is no single indicator or binary switch that will delineate between conscious and nonconscious beings.If there is a missing piece to this book, it is de Waal’s silence regarding the rapid destruction of the biosphere that has reached a fever pitch in recent decades. I’m sure he has taken up this topic elsewhere, but here we get no indication of his level of concern regarding the “magic wells” we will lose access to (or never get the chance to discover) if we keep annihilating the our planet’s natural habitats. It seems a safe assumption, however, that de Waal is more upset by this trend than most of us. He is also mute when it comes to the question of how humans can continue to justify our profligate torture and consumption of animal flesh in light of evidence that even “stupid” animals might be much smarter than previously thought.Although de Waal calls for a “moratorium on human uniqueness claims,” I think there is at least one moment when he belies this otherwise reasonable stance (158). In his final chapter, de Waal reveals (perhaps inadvertently) a practice that I think can still be identified as one that sets humanity apart from other animals:""Every species has a different story to tell. Each organism has its own ecology and lifestyle, its own Umwelt, which dictates what it needs to know in order to make a living."" (267)Indeed. While it is fair to suggest that each species can “tell its own story” simply by enacting its innate and learned behaviors, there is another level of storytelling going on here. As far as we know, we are the only animal that goes out of its way to study and propagate information about other animals in any sort of rigorous and consistent fashion. Moreover, any vibrant science community eventually learns to apply narrative schemas to scientific findings in order to render them accessible to nonspecialists. Storytelling is an essential component of how humans “make a living”; we crave stories as a form of metaphorical sustenance. de Waal is himself a marvelous storyteller, which helps account for why this book is so wonderful.If humanity has a special role to play moving forward, it seems two-fold: On the one hand, we must continue to build models of the natural world and adapt those models into stories that educate and inspire current and future generations. On the other hand, we must preserve and nourish existing ecosystems so the grand project of modern naturalism can continue.So, are we smart enough to know how smart animals are? I think de Waal’s answer would be a cautious affirmation. It would come as no surprise, however, if a quick admonishment followed: We might be smart enough, but it won’t matter much if more of us don’t start acting like it.This review was originally published on my blog, words&dirt."
48,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"A really excellent inquiry, à la Steven Wise, into the inherent prejudice of human evaluations of animal intelligence (""intelligence"" essentially gets defined as ""most human""--in research contexts, we don't really have an independent definition of ""intelligence"" so there's a kind of inherent circularity). But there's plenty of evidence that animals have intensely complex cognitions. Many can do lots of things we can, far better than we ever believed (for example, rats can regret their own decisions; crows use tools; monkeys have special neurons that let them learn from each other's mistakes). But animals also have cognitive abilities that, in some areas, dominate our own (say, the social cognition abilities of marine mammals). My favourite anecdote: Ayumu, a young male chimpanzee at the Primate Research Institute at Kyoto University. Ayumu plays computer games; he's free to leave the computer whenever he likes. He has to remember a sequence of 9 numbers and tap them in numerical order, even though the numbers are shown in random parts of the screen for short intervals of time (to understand the task, you can watch a short video of Ayumu I found online here). Notably, humans aren't very good at this task, especially when the intervals of time given to study the numbers gets shorter. The author, for example, could only keep track of 5 numbers after staring at the numbers for many seconds. Ayumu, by contrast, could do the same task, at the same accuracy, after seeing the numbers for just one fifth of a second. After rigorous training, Kyoto University was able to train humans to complete the task at 1/5 of a second, but only for 5 numbers. Ayumu is able to complete the task for 9 numbers--something no human, not even a renowned memory artist capable of memorizing an entire deck of cards, has ever done. Is that not a form of intelligence? Is Ayumu the lowly animal not more intelligent than humans, therefore, at short-term memory and decision-making? Strongly recommend this book for anyone interested in probing this topic. Engaging, well-researched, and thought-provoking.  "
49,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81718362-ann,3,"I primarily gave this book 3 stars for the overall content and the focus on ethology research. The author makes some convincing arguments as to why some past studies on animal behavior are actually incorrect or misleading. Unfortunately, it reads like a hodgepodge of animal ""studies"" which makes the entire book difficult to enjoy. Perhaps the information could have been organized in a different way, which would have allowed for a more cohesive flow and cut down on the incidences of repetitiveness."

51,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4162791-claudia-putnam,5,"Short answer: no.This is a wonderful book. The author's speciality is primatology, so most of the examples and summarized studies come from that field, but evidence is presented from other species as well. De Waal's focus is on annihilating the inherent bias in studying animals from the presupposition that humans are automatically more intelligent in every conceivable area. That evolution, as he puts it, stops at the head--that somehow, mystically, human brains took a great leap at an indeterminable point in evolutionary history, and are discontinuous from every other species in some inexplicable way. He recounts how, when a chimp proved to be objectively better at certain types of tests involving photographic memory, human scientists attempted to *train* themselves to beat the chimp. They just couldn't accept that an animal--forgetting that humans, too, are animals, specifically primates--could beat them at a particular type of specialized intelligence test. The assumption, again, is that humans must be the best at all kinds of intelligences. And yet, as de Waal reminds us, evolution did not stop for all species at the moment when apes and humans ""split off."" Apes, too, continued to evolve.As have other animals, and often the trouble with testing animals has been in test design, which de Waal critiques at length, and goes on to demonstrate how redesign of tests, taking into account animal environments, needs, and sensory intelligences can give us better information. For example, if elephants process through sound and touch, should we be comparing their intelligence to ours via information processed visually? Etc. I could review this book in much more depth, but I have limited my access to social media to 20 minutes per day, and I'd love it if you would explore it on your own, as it's a terrific journey. The only complaint I have is that while he does a great deal to describe the many walls we have erected to differentiate animals from human and how they have one by one fallen--bipedalism, for instance, opposable thumbs, or brain size, or the ability to plan, or ""theory of mind"" (oh, oh, oh, see my critique of How to Think Like a Neaderthal for this one!), or concept of time, he does cling to perception of language. My guess is that this may fall soon enough. See, for instance, The First Word, by Christine Kenneally. De Waal at least does not agree with Pinker that language is essential for thought. I was struck, though, by his descriptions of universal primate behaviors, and couldn't help observing some patterns that have been apparent in the 2016 US election... And I don't mean that snarkily. I'm inclined to give de Waal's The Inner Ape a read. For instance the way groups react to dominate males, and the roles played by females as peace keepers, which may be something that DOES differentiate humans--that females in some human societies have arisen to rulership roles (but also that in US society so far, we've been comfortable with female Secretaries of State, but not with female presidents). Okay, out of time on SM now, but probably more later!Highly recommended. "
52,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3282620-hilary,5,"4.5 starsI'm 2 chapters away from finishing, and feel the need to write most of my review now before I forget! This reads like a very accessible, popular science textbook, crammed with fascinating experiments, tests and social interactions between animals and humans. If you've read any of the books by Desmond Morris it's almost like those, but expanding on the actual science (facts, statistics, historical beliefs, theories, methodologies) far more, pointing out the flaws in the studies as well as the insights gained, and offering context for the studies. De Waal makes it clear what is interpretation or personal theory and expands the types of animals to include crows, dogs and cats and more, not just the typical chimpanzee/ape or rat/mouse.As a non-scientific reader, I learned the correct scientific descriptors for certain types of behavior, saw the impact of cultural or historical beliefs in attributing ""intelligence"" and ""planning"" to animals or children, the way to develop species-appropriate testing, and even saw the difference that the gender of the observer can make. Object permanence, inferential reasoning, referential signalling, empathy, the use of toolkits and conflict management are amongst the many aspects covered.Part of the reason I'm reading this so slowly is because it does feel very repetitive at time, but it's not exact repetition: the chapters are nuanced, building a case and making a very strong one (in my opinion). Although I love my Kindle, this would be a book I'd buy in paper form so I could underline, jot down notes and get a better visual representation.This would be an incredibly interesting book to use for studying psychology (human, not just animal), animal behavior or even biology, but you don't need to be an expert (or a student) to enjoy it.Disclaimer: I received a free copy from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."
53,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/746637-sally,4,"A leading cognitive ethologist traces the history of scientific investigation of animal cognition, from the time of Darwin, to its decades as a taboo idea under behaviorism, to its current status as a respectable field of research and increasingly dominant interpretation of animal behavior. The book is a refutation of the human tendency to put humanity in the center of cosmos and earth as the unique pinnacle that no other living thing can rival. Many people still have great difficulty with the idea that there is evolutionary continuity between animals and human beings, especially when it come to consciousness; they are more comfortable with the traditional chain of being with its digital jumps up and down in abilities between discrete levels: inorganic, plant, animal, human. The insistence on human superiority because of unique abilities not shared with anything else on the planet remains alive and well, though in constant retreat, by such means as ever more stringent redefinitions of what counts as evidence of some aspect of consciousness. The author sums up his book's purpose: ""I do not seek to provide a comprehensive and systematic overview of the field of evolutionary cognition. Readers may find such review in other more technical books. Instead, I will pick and choose from among many discoveries, species, and scientists, so as to convey the excitement of the past twenty years. My own specialty is primate behavior and cognition, an area that has greatly affected others as it has been at the forefront of discovery. Having been part of this field since the 1970s, I have known many of the players firsthand - human as well as animal - which allows me to add a personal touch."" "
54,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18653872-steve-wiggins,5,"Frans de Waal is one of the most sensible scientists alive. I have enjoyed his work in the past and this book makes more urgently the same points his previous work does. We must stop treating animals as if they have no minds! They are conscious beings. It would be difficult, in my opinion, to overestimate the damage done by the Behaviorist way of thinking. To get a sense of the intelligence of animals, all that is required is opening one's eyes. We see evidence everywhere that animals are far smarter than some political candidates among humans. De Waal asks the simple question of why we must always think humans are the smartest creatures alive, in every way. It's simply not true. Books like this are very important, and writers like de Waal are a credit to the human species.Further thoughts: Sects and Violence in the Ancient World."

57,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4792141-alex-railean,4,"Interesting and thought-provoking. - He makes a good argument that some of our experiments are not designed in a way that would adequately measure the intelligence of animals.- He provides examples of sophisticated behaviour that could indicate that animals are indeed capable of complex thoughts (e.g., planning for the future, seeing the world from the perspective of another individual, craft a tool). The examples cover various branches of the animal kingdom.- An adequate experiment would be designed in a way that considers the animal's umwelt (Die Umwelt = environment).- Intelligence is a spectrum, not a binary ""yes/no"".There is one matter that I am still thinking about. He says that the burden of proof should be on the shoulders of those who claim that animals are just automatons reacting to stimuli - i.e., they should prove that it is so. ""They"", on the other hand, argue that whoever makes the claim that other animals are intelligent should be responsible for proving that.I can see the argument from both sides, but it is not obvious where the burden of proof should be. The author convinced me that ""intelligence is a spectrum"", so I am inclined to share his point of view now - ""the others"" have to demonstrate that there is some sort of a cut-off threshold that delineates where there is intelligence, and where there isn't.Defending the claim that such a line exists would place the burden of proof on those who make the assertion. At the same time, if we stick to the ""intelligence is a spectrum"" idea (as his examples suggest), it means that our model of nature is simpler and it does not require the existence of such a threshold.I would be interested in knowing what other scientists have to say about it."
58,0393353664,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,4,"Every once in a while, a field of science (if we use that term in its broadest sense, to include things like economics and psychology) will have a bit of a problem admitting what is patently obvious to anyone outside the field. For example, until recently (and to a lesser extent even today), economics had a problem admitting that people were not always rationally optimizing their expected outcomes. To ordinary people, it is obvious that sometimes markets do stupid things like speculative bubbles, but to experts in the field it was heresy. Similarly, there was a time in psychology when Behaviorism was at its height, when the idea that people, much less animals, engaged in what the rest of us would call ""thinking"", was controversial.At this time, Frans De Waal was swimming upstream. He is credited by many with introducing the term ""Machiavellian intelligence"" for describing the kind of thinking that chimpanzees and other brainy, social animals do, although he claims not to really like the term. It refers to phenomena like a recently deposed, older male chimp supporting a big, brawny, but not all that bright male against the current alpha, his deposer. Or, one chimp waiting until a higher ranking chimpanzee is out of sight before they go to uncover the food which they (but not the higher ranking chimp) saw a human hide. Or, the cases where the higher ranking chimp anticipates this, and watches secretly until the lower ranking chimp uncovers the food, then rushes over to take it away. If you try to explain this kind of thing with behaviorist stimulus-response theory, you get nowhere fast. If you try to explain it in terms that any fan of Shakespeare's MacBeth or Othello or Hamlet would understand, then you can make some pretty good predictions.That, is precisely the problem. As de Waal relates in this thoroughly enjoyable read, we have a long history of trying to make distinctions between ourselves and all other animals, and anything which makes them seem too much like a character in Shakespeare gets some people a bit twitchy. It seems like we could use some of the obvious distinctions, like ""we create and use fire"" or ""we understand epic poetry"", but for whatever reason, philosophers and biologists and psychologists alike have often tried to come up with something more fundamental. Tool-making! Until we found that chimpanzees and even many birds in the corvid family do this. Language! But defining what exactly we mean by language, in a way that doesn't include the verbal and gestural communication of many other animal species, is surprisingly hard. Self-awareness! After detailing a long list of experiments by different researchers showing that many other species are self-aware, de Waal also points out in passing that everyone who has ever owned a cat or dog has seen it feel embarrassed, but none have seen them repeatedly fail to understand that their own reflection in the mirror is not another animal in their house, but rather just an image of themselves.Which is really the main issue here. Much of what de Waal and other researchers of his generation and the one before went through, was just trying to work their way back to the common sense knowledge of the everyday layman, that of course animals think. Maybe not insects, and who knows maybe not fish, but does anyone without an ideological reason to pretend otherwise, really think that their dog or cat or horse or the boat-tailed grackle on the street is not capable of thinking, planning at least a few steps ahead, being suspicious, understanding the difference between themselves and the rest of the universe? This process must have been, at times, enormously frustrating for de Waal and people like him, but he tells the story in this book with grace and good humor, and a variety of illustrations of animals that he did himself which add considerably to the book's charm.So, the fundamental issue here is not whether or not de Waal can convince you of his point of view; anyone will who is not brain-washed by a mid-20th century higher education to think otherwise. The issue is whether or not there is anything for the rest of us to learn from the quest of an entire field of scientists to find their way back to common sense. I think there is.Often times, human society can seem remarkably obtuse, making the same mistake over and over again, because they would rather change the world around them by bashing their forehead against it, than change the way they think about how the world works. I leave you to fill in your favorite example of this. But this book is a story of how, over a few decades, a variety of researchers from different backgrounds living on different continents, more or less turned their field around 180 degrees. They had no great resources of money, they had no extraordinary political connections, they had nothing really except determination and the overwhelming advantage that the facts were on their side. It may seem like having the facts on your side is not going to get you anywhere, and in the short term this is often the case. The answer is neither to throw up your hands, nor to demonize your opponents, but rather to chip away with experiment after experiment, demonstration after demonstration, listening to the objections raised to them and then doing a different experiment or demonstration to answer those objections. If the facts are on your side, and you continue in this fashion, eventually, even humans will come around, if you don't give up on them, and don't give up on demonstrating what the truth is. We have cause to be thankful to de Waal, and others like him, that they persisted."
