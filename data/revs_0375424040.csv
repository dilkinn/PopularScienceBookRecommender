0,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena,4,"The Drunkard’s Walk is a book about randomness, a topic that most people, unless they happen to be mathematicians or have a strange fascination with statistics, probably don’t think too much about. As a species, in fact, we generally prefer not to dwell on randomness, but rather to assume that we are in control of much more of our lives than we actually are. In this new book, physicist Leonard Mlodinow attempts to show why underestimating randomness is really not a good idea. He lays a foundation for this discussion by outlining the development of mathematical and scientific thought on the topic. When humans assumed all outcomes were due to the whims of the gods, there was no need for a concept of randomness. But that didn’t stop gamblers from trying to improve their odds in games of chance, and it is to them we owe a debt of understanding on the topic.Mlodinow spices up some rather technical discussions about development of the theory with interesting personal history of the major players (including a guy who figured out his baker was cheating customers by compulsively weighing his bread for a year and noting the differences from random distribution) and numerous fascinating studies on the topic. Along the way, he makes a compelling argument that the human propensity to see patterns where there are none can get us into a great deal of trouble, as anyone who has ever lost money in the stock market has probably figured out. It’s not just gamblers and investors who would benefit from understanding these concepts, however. Mlodinow also shows how misunderstandings of randomness and statistics can affect jury trials and medical studies and makes a compelling argument that the success of an individual business is usually far more impacted by randomness than it is by the personal talents of the CEO or movie studio head.Much of what Mlodinow discusses in this book is highly counterintuitive. That, combined with the above mentioned desire to believe we are masters of our fate, explains in part why we so often underestimate the effect of randomness on our lives. But acknowledging the power of randomness does not disempower us, Mlodinow argues. Rather, it allows us to focus on the aspects of our lives over which we really do have control, such as how persistent we are, and not take so personally the random luck--both good and bad--that touches all of us.

1,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a very fun, entertaining book about the myriad ways in which random phenomena affect our lives. There is nothing really new here. As a physicist, I am already well familiar will all of the concepts introduced, concerning probability and statistics. But oh--what a variety of fascinating applications!I love the story about the ""Ask Marilyn"" column in Parade Magazine. Marilyn vos Savant holds the record for the world's highest IQ. She discussed the famous ""Monty Hall"" problem, and got aggravated letters from 10,000 readers, including 1,000 PhD's (many mathematicians!) who claimed her analysis was wrong. Nevertheless, she was absolutely correct--people just do not have a firm grasp of probability concepts.The book explains lots of interesting puzzles and paradoxes. For me, the best part of the book is the discussion of how statistically random events conspire to make ""outliers"". This comes up again and again, in understanding ""genius"" mutual fund managers and fast-growing mega-companies.My only disappointment, is the book's emphasis on the so-called ""normal"" (Gaussian) distribution, to the exclusion of other distributions. Many economic and natural environmental events are outliers that deviate from the normal distribution, as described so well in Benoit Mandelbrot's The (Mis)Behavior of Markets."
2,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara,4,"Lots of people might think they can compute the odds that something will happen. For instance, If my favorite baseball team is playing an opponent with inferior stats I might be pretty sure my guys will win....and place a small wager. But random chance - which is the rule rather than the exception - could trip me up. A so-so batter on the other team might miraculously hit a grand slam home run! 😲In this book Leonard Mlodinow explains how randomness affects our lives. For example, a publisher rejected George Orwell's book 'Animal Farm' with the remark ""it's impossible to publish animal books in the U.S."" And before he became successful author Tony Hillerman was advised ""to get rid of all that Indian stuff."" John Grisham's books were repeatedly rejected at first. And J.K. Rowling's first Harry Potter book was rebuffed a number of times. These writers persisted and eventually happened on the right publisher....but other (perhaps equally talented) authors didn't. Random chance at work! Of course if we really want to figure out how likely it is that something will (or won't) happen we have to rely on math. In this book Mlodinow elucidates some of the math concepts behind probability theory and statistics - a lot of which is complex and requires re-reading a couple of times (for me anyway). So I'll just give a very basic illustration.Suppose Don picks up two coins and tosses them. He wants to know how likely it is he'll get one head. Don figures the possible outcomes are: zero heads, one head, or two heads. So, he thinks there's a 1 in 3 likelihood. Nope.Don has to consider all the possible sequences: heads-heads; heads-tails; tails-heads; and tails-tails. Two possible outcomes yield one head - so the chances are 1 in 2 (50%).A basic principal of probability theory is that the chances of an event happening depends on the number of ways it can occur.Here's another example: In 1996 the Atlanta Braves beat the New York Yankees in the first two games of the World Series (where the first team that wins four games is the victor). So, what was the chance the Yankees would make a comeback and win the series - assuming the teams are equally matched? After explaining all the possible ways the Yankees could win the remaining games, Mlodinow calculates that the Yankees had a 6 in 32 chance of winning the series, or about 19%. The Braves had a 26 in 32 chance of winning the series, or about 81%. Against the odds, the Yankees won! Mlodinow goes on to explain that - if one team was better than the other - that would weigh into the calculations and the odds would be different. This same type of reasoning can be applied to competing businesses, television shows, movies, whatever. And even if the odds favor the 'better contender', sometimes - by pure chance - the 'worse contender' will win. Of course 'experts' try to predict all kinds of things: whether stocks will go up; if a superhero movie will be No. 1 at the box office; whether Toyotas will sell better than Buicks; if a certain horse will win the Triple Crown; and so forth. And Mlodinow explains that - no matter how 'knowledgeable' the maven - the predictions might be wrong. The reason: our brains aren't wired to do probability problems very well. 🥴In the book, Mlodinow discusses Pascal's triangle, the Bell Curve, random number generators, the best strategy for picking the 'correct door' on 'Let's Make a Deal', the likelihood a woman carrying fraternal twins will have two girls, whether scolding a worker who does badly and praising a worker who does well makes a difference in their future performance, one man's strategy for winning at roulette....all kinds of interesting stuff.Pascal's TriangleBell CurveLet's Make A DealTwinsThe book is informative and contains a lot of fascinating stories about the philsophers and mathematicians who developed probability theory, how they did it, and why (usually having something to do with gambling.... ha ha ha). I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to readers interested in the subject.You can follow my reviews at http://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot.com/"
3,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,4,"I hadn’t realised I had read this guy before, and remarkably recently. Euclid's Window The Story of Geometry from Parallel Lines to Hyperspace was a fascinating read and oddly enough, I was even reminded of it as I was reading this one and I still didn’t put two and two together (an appropriate enough metaphor for books on mathematics) until I was well over half way through. They are very similar books – presenting an entire field of mathematics to a non-mathematical audience from an historical perspective in simple and engaging prose.The historical perspective is very important, too. Marx said somewhere that all subjects are pretty much history – even though that has rarely been my experience. This book shows that this is the case and shows (me at least) the benefits of this approach – as someone who learns best through narrative an historical approach is just the ticket. In presenting the history of probability theory and statistics in context and through the questions that haunted the various people who contributed to the advancement of the science I feel I have a much better understanding of these subjects than I gleaned at university where I struggled to remember which formula went with which particular sting of words in the question. This guy would make a fantastic teacher: actually, he makes a fantastic teacher in both of these books. He also points out the difference between probability and statistics, a distinction I’d never really picked up on previously. Probability is the study of data when you know a fixed probability of something. So, you can look at the results of a series of coin tosses in which all of the coins show heads given you know each toss has a 50-50 probability of coming down heads. Statistics is essentially working backwards – given a series of data how do you work out the underlying probability.The main point in his presenting all of this maths is to discuss why humans seem quite so incapable of rationally predicting outcomes based on the data presented to them and (as the maths shows) are quite predictably irrational in the mistakes they make in seeking to understand the meaning of particular strings of data. This stuff is handled better and more amusingly by Fooled by Randomness The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets, Predictably Irrational The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions and even in How We Know What Isn't So The Fallibility of Human Reason in Everyday Life (the oddest quote on the back of this book is from Stumbling on Happiness's author Daniel Gilbert who says this book is ‘occasionally hysterical’. If you want laughs with your science, read Gilbert or even Euclid’s Window, I can assure you that you shouldn’t buy this one for the jokes).But, having said that what this book does do is give a wonderfully simple understanding of the maths that is taken for granted by the authors of these other books and which in itself is a powerful incentive to read this book. The first chapter and last chapter of this book in particular are essential reading – the discussion of Hollywood film studio executive Sherry Lansing is instructive in both showing how much we overstate the affect ‘leaders’ have in the success of a company and also how we blame them and praise them for things that are probably little more than random noise. The notion that is reiterated throughout this book that exceptional performances are just that, that is ‘exceptional’, and that these exceptional performances will tend to be followed by a more average performance is a lesson we would all do well to learn.And here is why, what about this question? Is it better to praise someone after they have done something well or to severely criticise them after they have done something badly? Scientific studies looking at this question show unequivocally that praise is better than criticism. But is that what we do? People actually have good reason to do the exact opposite of what is proven to be the better technique of obtaining better performance. You see, if someone does something exceptionally well and you praise them for it their next attempt (given their previous attempt was ‘exceptional’) is likely to tend towards the mean – that is, it is likely to be worse than their previous go. People being what they are (creatures that are determined to see causal relationships even where none exist) will therefore conclude that their praise encouraged the high performer to ‘slacken off’ and to therefore do worse in the task the next time it was performed. But now look what happens the other way. Someone, just as randomly, does particularly badly at a task – so you scream at them and ‘wear their guts for garters’ as the expression goes. What is likely to happen the next time they do the task? Well, they are likely to also find their performance tends back toward the mean – that is, they will apparently get better at the task. So ‘experience’ teaches us the exact opposite of what is the best method of achieving better performances from the people we are instructing – rather than ever praising people, ‘experience’ tells us to never reward good performance and only to ever punish poor performance. And this is all the case because ‘experience’ is wrong due to us misunderstanding the lessons of randomness.This misunderstanding isn’t just the case in the pedagogical curiosity discussed above, but is much more general. We praise CEOs when the stock price goes up and sack them when it goes down, we delight when opinion polls have our favourite party gaining a percentage point in the popularity stakes and find ourselves in the doldrums when their fortunes fade by the same amount (even when the error in these polls can be as high as three percentage points and so these ‘shifts’ are actually completely meaningless) and we put people in prison because there is only a one in a million chance someone else did it, when there are three million people in the city where their crime took place. There are very disturbing consequences to our not understanding statistics, to our not understanding randomness. If you read The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time and could not follow the odd part in that story about changing your bet if you are on Let’s Make A Deal you should get this book. (Briefly, if there are three doors, only one with a good prize behind it and after you have made your selection the host discloses that behind one of the two doors you didn’t pick there is a rubbish prize – if you get the chance to change your selection, you should. I know, it doesn’t make sense, I know it sounds like your chance is still 50-50, but that is part of the reason why you should read this book).Gamblers generally ought to read this book. You will see (actually, you probably wont see anything of the kind, as gamblers are just as fooled by ‘experience’ as the bad teacher discussed above) that we are constantly fooled by what we ‘know’ is true, even when it isn’t. I remember talking to a guy who was explaining to me how he played two-up – a particularly Australian gambling game involving two coins. He told me about a time he won lots of money because heads kept coming up and so he shifted his beating because tails were ‘due’. Okay, so he won money, but not for the reasons he thought and there was no way I would ever have convinced him of this. You see, while there is a law of large numbers in probability theory – that is, if you toss a coin a very large number of times then if the coin is true it will tend to land 50% of the time on heads – there is no corresponding law of small numbers. And the mere fact that the coin has landed on heads for five or even fifty flips in a row does not mean tails is ‘due’. The fact we are so easily fooled by this is one of the main points behind this book. There are lovely explanations in this of Pascal’s Triangle and how this develops into the normal distribution curve. Fascinating and frightening discussions of false positives and biases that we invariably fall for. Then there are also topics on how we are manipulated and cheated because of our limited understanding of how randomness affects our lives. I’m finding that I can’t get enough of this topic at the moment – I’m hesitating, mostly due to not having the time, to buy a good book on statistics, it is nearly 30 years since I was taught this stuff at university and it might be finally time I learnt it properly.This is an essential companion book to so many other books on the topic of randomness and the consequences of randomness in how we understand (and misunderstand) our lives. I really enjoyed it and will now have to track down other books by this Mlodinow guy (and perhaps even try to remember his name so that I realise I am reading one of his books when I do.)"
4,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/995681-bronson-lauper,1,"Yes, I was an English major so, yes, I LOVE literature, but my statistics courses were my favorite courses ever. I can't claim to be an expert statistician since I haven't run a chi-square analysis in eons and since I can only remember the phrase ""data set"" but can't remember how to collect one (kidding), but COME ON! Some of Mlodinow's information is interesting, but much of his logic seems unfounded and certainly begs some sort of question (and often a rather basic one at that). I've only finished 1/3 of it, and I'm sure it has a wonderful ending for those with sadistic fortitude, but (statistically speaking) the likelihood of me completing any more of it is about eight deviations to the left on the s-curve, if ya' know what I'm sayin'. Sheesh."
5,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,4,"There is a lot that is disturbing in this book. Are we 'Masters of the Universe'? Not so much.The author discusses in a breezy, easy to understand conversational manner how randomness and chance are behind many human decisions which we believe to be either based on educated guesses or personal skills, as well as how luck functions far more than we know in how things turn out for us. Briefly, but entertaining all the while, the author discusses famous incidents which illuminate the psychology behind mistaken beliefs of 'winning'. He discusses as an overview the math which makes obvious how rules of chance trump planned success, or how choices can be better made if one understands the probability of a choice's odds of happening. Each chapter covers an aspect of randomness and the math that helps expose it or measure it, and a brief biography of the people who created a part of this interesting class of math. Many of the chapters show how what appears to be the results of rationalized planning or expert decision-making which resulted in successful conclusions are not so, but instead are simply random luck, measurable by probability or statistical math. It's eerie because in explaining why so many things actually occur vs. how your brain perceived the occurrence the book leaves you with feelings that are similar to the feelings that happen when a promotion is given that you assume is because of your excellent record, but it turns out to be because none of your rivals showed up due to a car crash on the highway. Complicating efforts to get on top of luck, in effect increasing it in your favor by learning probability math, appears to be so difficult of an exercise in logic in some cases that expert mathematicians flub it, which the author demonstrates in a couple of chapters. The conclusion this all leads me to is that people are truly lemmings with delusions of grandeur, yet through all of the illusions we create to feel we have more control and power over human events than we actually do, somehow through math, crunching numbers in formulas, these same lame brains of ours are able to 'see' reality, even though we totally ignore it to live and function. Does that bother you as much a it bothers me?"
6,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6708700-steve-bennett,4,"My mom carried a holy card of St. Jude with her at all times. St Jude is the patron saint of lost causes. This book suggests that lost causes and what the public commonly refers to failures may just have had bad luck. Mlodinow demonstrates a lot of what the world chalks up to superior skill or thorough preparation is actually due to randomness. Or as Ecclesiastics states, in perhaps less scientific but more concise terms: ""I have seen something else under the sun: The race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned; but time and chance happen to them all."" The Western world loves to hail victors and humiliate the losers. Yet, the difference between winning and losing is often mere chance. Mike Shanahan when he was wining Super Bowls in Denver was considered one of the best NFL coaches. This year, when he was going 3-13 with Washington, was considered one of the worst coaches ever. Did his coaching skill truly change that remarkably? Many times while reading this book, I thought it might be sending the message, ""Don't try, because randomness is a bigger factor of success than skill."" As in Ecclesiastics: ""All is vanity. What does it profit a man all his toil under the sun?"" However, the message is actually the opposite. The message is not to feel forsaken during apparent lost causes. The wheel is still in spin. Or as Tom Petty would say, ""Even the losers, get lucky some time.""  "
7,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,5,"Let's suppose you are on Let's Make a Deal with Monte Hall. There are three doors to choose from. Behind the doors are a goat, a can opener, and a new car. You want the new car. You pick door #3. Now Monte Hall says he will trade you door #3 for door #1. First he shows what's behind door #2: a goat. Now should you trade door #3 for door #1 in the hopes of getting a new car? Here are your three choices: (A) Trade because the odds are greater of getting a new car if you trade, (B) Don't trade because the odds are less, or (C) It doesn't matter because the odds are equal. Make your choice and explain why you did so, and I will tell you if you are right. By the way, the great mathematician Paul Erdos got this wrong. Here's another story. A pilot trainer yells at trainees who mess up and they do better landing next time, but when he praises a pilot for landing well, the trainee does worse next time. Is it better to yell? No, but you can see why coaches think it works. Odds are that the pilot who messed up will do better no matter what. Those who did well will eventually do worse. Story #3: the probability that two events will both occur can never be greater than the probability that each will occur individually. Yet intelligent people continually think otherwise. Unless an odd detail is added. So what I am learning from this book is really about how human ignorance can occur. And I always want to be vigilant about myself and my own ignorance. I'm a Socratic believer in the idea that ignorance is at the root of all our ills. #4: Legend has it that Paul Erdos quit amphetamines for a month and said, ""Before, when I looked at a piece of blank paper my mind was filled with ideas. Now all I see is a blank piece of paper."" #5: The chances of an event depend on the number of ways in which it can occur. #6: Try the birthday game at a party. Chances are that two people there will share the same birthday. I have done this in a classroom, and it usually works. #7: In 1654, Fermat, he of Fermat's last theorem fame, held a high position in the Tournelle, or criminal court, in Toulouse. Pierre de Fermat is usually considered the greatest amateur mathematician of all time. But he also condemned people to be burned at the stake. #8: For the last 8 years of Pascal's life, he committed himself to God. He sold everything except his Bible and gave his money to the poor. He wore an iron belt with points on the inside. When he was in danger of feeling happy, he pushed the spikes into his flesh. This was Pascal's Wager: Betting on the existence of God. #9: Grading papers. I can speak from experience on this one. We had to grade papers from around the state on a scale of 1 to 4. We had examples of each. Yet some teachers gave horrible papers a 4 because they had ""sincerity"" or some such nonsense and others gave great papers a 1 because they were too structured. #10: Voting recounts. Why does every recount get a different number? Great question. It never comes out the same. Says something about the system. #11: Best way to gain 30 points on your SATs is to take the test a few more times. Law of averages means you will eventually get a better score. #12: Wine tasting is a bit of a sham. No need to go into the details. You knew it all along, didn't you? #13: There were 1,000 more highway fatalities after 9/11 because people were afraid of flying. #14: Table moving in the mid 1800s was caused by the fidgeting of the participants with their hands on the table. #15: The psychologist Bruno Bettelheim said survival in Nazi concentration camps ""depended on one's ability to preserve some areas of independent action, to keep control of some important aspects of one's life despite an environment that seemed overwhelming."" #16: Nursing home residents given control of their rooms lived longer and were happier than those who had no control. #17: Nobel laureate Max Born: ""Chance is a more fundamental concept than causality."" #18: When an event is happening it is difficult to see the outcome. Later we can't understand why we didn't respond better. President Obama's measured approach is probably the best. Things happen because of many minor factors beyond the control of most people.#19: Observers tend to have a lesser view of victims. A high view of wealthy people. #20: Vodka has no difference in flavor whatsoever. Yet ask anyone who drinks it and they will tell you otherwise. How stupid is that? #21: Stephen King's Richard Bachman books did not sell until people knew it was him. #22: A final word of advice from Thomas Watson: ""If you want to succeed, double your failure rate.""

8,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3093693-angie-boyter,2,"I have a math background and an interest in the mind and enjoyed reading books like Predictably Irrational and Thinking, Fast and Slow. Given Mlodinow's reputation as a physicist, I expected a reasonably sophisticated presentation, albeit one that did not require a heavy math background. I was prepared for the book to be basic and probably start with the rudiments of probability, but the presentation is SO basic that the title term ""drunkard's walk"" does not even occur in the book until page 176 (out of only 219 pages).This seemed more like a history of probability and statistics (an interesting one, I'll admit, with lots of amusing anecdotes about celebrities past and present), with a bit of discussion of probability thrown in. I understand that many writers are reluctant to present a lot of equations in books for the general public, but the result in this case is that Mlodinow makes general statements but never carries the explanation far enough to satisfy curiosity or be useful. He says (p 108) ""The key to understanding randomness and all of mathematics is not being able to intuit the answer to every problem immediately but merely having the tools to figure out the answer."" Despite the claim on the back of the book that ""Mlodinow gives us the tools we need to make more informaed decisions"", he fails to provide the reader tools, instead being content to tell us which historical figures developed the tools that are in use today. This can make interesting reading, but it is not what was advertised."
9,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73783-taka,5,"Even better the second time--This little book is just so good—not only does it give you just enough math to make you feel curious and satisfied, it tells a ripping good story about probability theory and statistics, providing along the way compelling portraits of the eccentric scientists and mathematicians who contributed to the fields. This time, I wanted to refresh my memory of all the thorny problems probability and statistics give us (we are really, really bad at intuiting probability, as psychologists have again and again shown us). One good refresher among many was the fallacy we make in dealing with conditional probability, mostly prominently manifested in conspiracy theories and paranoid thoughts: these events happened, therefore there is a huge conspiracy. Or close to home (for me at least): an agent hasn't gotten back to me yet, therefore she must not like my work. Probability-wise these are based on the wrong probabilities, and logically, these are equivalent to the fallacy of affirming the consequent (if P then Q, Q, therefore P). So from the valid, highly probable inference, ""If there is a huge conspiracy, these events happen"" or ""If an agent doesn't like my work, she will not respond for a long time,"" we see the consequent—these events happened, or the agent hasn't responded in a long time—and draw the mistaken conclusion that there is a huge conspiracy. Or the agent doesn't like my work. What's wrong with this is that there are so many possible reasons why a series of events occurred other than due to a huge conspiracy, or why the agent hasn't gotten back to me in a long time (she's just busy!). In probability terms:the probability that she he doesn't respond to me in a long time GIVEN she doesn't like my workis high and valid, whereas:the probability that an agent doesn't like my work given she has not responded to me in a long timeis low (because there could be all sorts of reasons why she hasn't responded to me). Just to hammer it home, this can be illustrated with a simple example:If you are human, you eventually die.is a perfectly valid conditional, butYou (pointing at a squirrel) eventually die, so you (the squirrel) must be human.is definitely not.More importantly, what I for some reason failed to write about in my 2012 review and totally forgot about until I reread the book is Yale sociologist Charles Perrow's normal accident theory Mlodinow mentions in the last chapter, how disasters in complex systems occur when many little human mistakes just happen to coincide at just the wrong (or right—depending on your perspective) time. I was so interested in this theory that I actually bought the seminal book by Perrow himself (and duly put on the shelf for ""read immediately""). Excellent, excellent book.[Read 1/5/2012] Awesome--This book made me admire what modern statistics—a topic I couldn't care less—is capable of doing and convinced me, like Taleb's The Black Swan and Burton Malkiel's Random Walk Down Wall Street how randomness really rules our lives and it's important to recognize chance events and not mistakenly assign them some causality that's not there. The history of probability theory and statistics Mlodinow tells in this book is nothing short of fascinating, and I was floored by the answers to some of the problems he so deftly presents.For example:1) there are three doors. Behind one of them is a treasure, and behind two are geese. You pick a door. The host of the show opens one of the doors you've picked and show geese behind it. Is it better to switch your choice?The answer: yes. You will increase your probability of winning from 1/3 to 2/3. Why? Read the book to find out why.2) The Attorney's Fallacy. Take the O.J. Simpson trial. The prosecutor argued O.J. Simpson was an abusive husband. The defense attorney Alan Dershowitz then argued that the probability of an abusive husband killing his wife is so low, the prosecutor's argument for O.J.'s propensity for violence is misguided. In more detail:4 million women are battered annually by their husbands and boyfriends in the U.S.Yet in 1992, a total of 1,432 women (or 1 in 2,500) were killed by their husbands or boyfriends.Therefore, few men who beat their wives or girlfriends go on to murder them.Convincing, but that's not the relevant probability. The relevant probability is rather: the probability that a battered wife who was murdered is murdered by her abuser. And of all the battered women murdered in 1993 in the U.S.some 90% were killed by their abuser.Then there's the reassuring implication that success comes to you largely by random—publication, prizes, business success, fame, etc.—and that means the longer we persevere, the better our odds are of succeeding. As an aspiring writer, this non-deterministic paradigm of looking at the world has helped me boost my confidence and determination.A must-read."
10,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9133439-caro,3,"Despite the seemingly highly rated reviews this book has received, I suspect it is more of a case of this book was hard to read which means it must be good that accounts for its ratings rather than any credit to the author's writing.The Drunkard's walk, despite Mr. Mlodinow's attempts at following Mr. Gladwell's formula, does not succeed in copying Mr. Gladwell's easy to read voice as well. First of all, although the subtitle SAYS ""how randomness rules our lives,"" I actually found the book to be propogating the exact opposite, our lives are actually ruled by probability and math and not random at all. Second, there was no actual connecting theme in this book. It was a collection of the most random assortment of math stories that all seem to take place sometime in the 19th centuries. They were about bizarre discoveries or how math affected people's lives, I'm not exactly sure what randomness had to do with anything other than the stories did seem to be told by a drunken man. The writing was not easy, although if it was because it was about math and required extra concentration on my part, I apologize for that. I had to reread several chapters a few times in order to understand what Mr. Mlodinow was saying. I'm not exactly sure why his book was ordered in the way it was, nor do I understand how this became a book to begin with. The subtitle would be better renamed: 10 odd stories about math in people's lives and how none of this will affect you.Well. I'm glad I'm done with that book."
11,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48011083-steve,4,"I liked Leonard Mlodinow’s The Drunkard’s Walk. It’s an important reminder of those principles, studied long ago, now only distantly familiar, regarding randomness. Because our brains do such a poor job filtering data, owing to a wide assortment of cognitive biases, it’s important, it seems, to revisit the science of probability and statistics; this work achieves that end. I think it’s a better written volume than the four others I recently read on this topic.I enjoyed recounting the Monty Hall problem to friends. There’s got to be a way to make a quick buck off that trick? Anyone have any idea how?When I went to the library to pick up this book, I noticed a copy of A Confederacy of Dunces, by John Kennedy Toole, which I flipped through with a vigorous, yet brief, interest. When I got home, I started reading The Drunkard’s Walk. There, on p. 10, Mlodinow discusses what book? Why, A Confederacy of Dunces. The very next day, a social gathering I regularly attend announced their book club’s reading for next month: A Confederacy of Dunces. Now what are the odds of that? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller? Bueller?"
12,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1789478-shelley,2,"The weirdest thing about reading this book was the following:I watched the movie ""21"" in which a team of college students under the tutelage of a greedy professor make tons of money in Las Vegas by counting cards while playing Black Jack. In one scene of the movie, probabilities are discussed and the professor brings up the scenario of the 3 doors on ""Let's Make a Deal"" and asks the class if it's better to stick with your first choice of doors AFTER the host reveals one of the doors behind which there is no grand prize or switch to the remaining door. The correct answer would be to switch but most people don't get why. Not an hour after watching this movie, I continued reading this book, which I had started earlier and within a couple of pages, the author brought up and discussed the EXACT SAME SCENARIO and the reasons why you should switch in that situation.Talk about randomness! What are the odds on that?I found this book very interesting but being very dense when it comes to mathematics, I got lost in several places where the author went into great mathematical detail. I liked the historical aspects of the book, his descriptions of great mathematicians (Fermat, Pascal, Newton, etc.) and how thet built on each other's work over time."
13,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k,4,"I'll admit it. I like books by Malcolm Gladwell and Dan Ariely. I liked Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything and Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me): Why We Justify Foolish Beliefs, Bad Decisions, and Hurtful Acts. I know many consider these books lightweight and pseudointellectual, and that a more incisive critical reader than I am would probably make mincemeat of them. But I find them entertaining and interesting, even if they don't always hold up to critical analysis.The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives falls squarely into this genre, and some of the ground covered will be familiar to other readers who consume these books. The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives is a little different, though, in that it goes beyond cognitive biases and surprising stories of successful/failed fads and geniuses to discuss statistics and probability and the fact that we tend to underestimate the influence of chance and overestimate other factors such as talent, skill, and actual appeal. This may sound depressing, but we can actually view it as encouraging. Your talent and skill may be irrelevant. But because chance is so powerful, you can increase your likelihood of success simply by refusing to give up. Odds are, if you keep trying, eventually you'll achieve the results you want through sheer luck.The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives resembles Malcolm Gladwell's books in that the entertainment value of the examples perhaps exceeds the intellectual tautness of the connecting thesis. Still, though, this was an entertaining, readable, and interesting book which gives you a lot to think about and is fun without being a waste of time. "

Although there are some valuable things to learn from it. But I thought this book was going to have more to do with psychology but it has more to do with statistics and probabilities - mathematics... And do you know what my least favorite subject was in all of my Business degree? ... Statistics... Maybe it's because I'm not interested in it, maybe because I just don't understand it, but I hated and still hate it lol I think if were to want to learn about it I'd rather it in a textbook form and not a book."

Many people think acknowledging randomness is denying God.The book is a bit chatty, and needs to focus a bit more on errors people make with statistics in their personal lives ... but Mlodinow hit on an essential concept.I liked this lesson: that successful people are lucky, but that lucky people are persistent, flexible, and brave."
16,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4174287-robert-delikat,5,"You’re presented with three doors. Behind one door is a car and behind the other two doors are goats. Sound familiar? It is. You pick door number one. Instead of opening your choice, Monty opens door number two and reveals a goat. He then asks you if you wish to keep what’s behind your original choice (door one) or change your mind to door number three. If you think it makes no difference whether you switch or not and that your odds are 50/50 either way, you might be surprised at the answer and enjoy reading this book. If you are surprised by the answer to this ridiculously simple challenge, you’re in for a plethora of awakenings about the assumptions we make of the numbers and statistics we hear in our daily lives. Peppered with charm and wit; wonderfully read by Sean Pratt, I would highly recommend this title to anyone interested in a history of the development of statistics. Books about numbers are especially not easy ones to listen to but Sean Pratt reads this one at just the right pace and with just the right inflections to make listening to and learning from The Drunkard’s Walk totally accessible. I will often read two or three books at a time. This one, however, was just so captivating, it monopolized my complete attention. But then I’m a nerd and that too might be a requirement for truly enjoying this title."
17,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1538729-aaron,4,"Overall I'll give it to Leonard Mlodinow for writing a math book that's surprisingly accessible to the general public. Well, maybe it's not exactly a math book, or even a statistics book. But there's a fair amount of each and he did a fine job with keeping it generally light and interesting. Mlodinow explains that there are basically two definitions of random, and they don't always go together (pp. 84-85). The first is by Charles Sanders Peirce and basically states that a process or method is truly random if given enough tests, trials, samples, examples any outcome is equally likely as any other (the ""frequency interpretation of randomness""). In other words, regardless of how things seem (especially when you're only looking at very little data), there's nothing ""special"" going on that prefers or encourages one result over another. Mlodinow doesn't go in this direction, but I would say most people would relate this to/understand this in terms of neutrality, equality, fairness, balance, impartiality, etc. Setting aside debates in cognitive psychology and linguistics about modules and association, let's just say that most people would say these things are important (ideally) in business, law, politics - anywhere where people and things should be treated the same. Mlodinow then offers the second common definition of randomness, the ""subjective interpretation,"" where ""a number or set of numbers is considered random if we either don't know or cannot predict how the process that produces it will turn out."" Again, he doesn't take this road, but I think most reader would relate this to things like luck, whimsy, risk, guess, judgment, odds, choice, etc. You'd think that he'd establish these weird heavy definitions and and run with them for another 200 pages. But he doesn't. He leaves these definitions orphaned on pages 84-85, which is a shame because they seem to be the most interesting and relevant part of the whole book. What was the purpose of bringing them up at all? Better question is What is the purpose of the book? Sure, to sell books, makes some cash, and better inform the public. But more than that I think this book somewhat aims at the ""big dreamers,"" those people who seek big success, or at least dream about it, and want to know why it works. Or why it doesn't. Mlodinow uses a fair number of examples of business stories, Hollywood stories, scientist stories, and gambling stories. It's not a glorification attempt, but to illustrate that luck has a lot to with it. From Bill Gates to Bruce Willis, Stephen King to Anne Frank, Thomas Edison to George Lucas, luck plays a role as much as hard work. He offers the advice to persevere to those who aim to succeed because often not bad talent but bad luck that fails you. Okay, fair point. I think this is the kind of stuff that people want in such books so it's included for ""sentimental"" reasons, but it doesn't tell us anything we don't already know. What is interesting to me is the discussion of why we believe what we do and how we act accordingly. Mlodinow discusses factors that influence our perceptions and our ideas. He references a few studies, including Daniel Kahneman intuition studies and Melvin Lerner's Just-world phenomenon, but he doesn't really go into the details. In particular he glosses over part of Kahneman's study and overlooks a point that's essential to his own book. On page 22 he reports finds of a fictional character ""Linda"" described with, I guess you could call it, hippie or generally leftist leanings, and participants ranked the likelihood of 8 statements: 1. Linda is active in the feminist movement. 2. Linda is a psychiatric social worker. 3. Linda works in a bookstore and takes yoga classes. 4. Linda is a bank teller and active in the feminist movement. 5. Linda is a teacher in an elementary school. 6. Linda is a member of the League of Women voters. 7. Linda is a bank teller. 8. Linda is a insurance salesperson. The point here was that number 4 includes number 7, but was ranked as more likely. Mlodinow used this study to show that intuition is not a reliable judge and that people tend to make obvious mistakes once they get an idea in their head. (Specifically, Kahneman demonstrated that people are more likely to believe something is the case when additional, even irrelevant information is provided. But I read something else in this study - that people probably take number 7 to mean ""Linda is a bank teller, but not a feminist."" Maybe the original study specifically controlled for this (I doubt it), but the point is that number 7 is not ""neutral"" or ""interchangeable"" with other items. Whether she is a bank teller seems (to some degree) to be relevant to her social-political identity, as much as any of the other items suggest. For example, if they use ""Linda's new shoes are blue,"" or ""Linda was born in July,"" people would say they're both totally irrelevant to the description and uninformative to where they should rank. Is this really a relevant point? Maybe, maybe not. But I bring it up to show how difficult it is to really identify what people take into consideration when making decisions, which is a big part of what the book is about - given the fact that so much is outside our control, awareness, or understanding, how do we choose wisely? A fair amount of the book is dedicated to math and statistics. I think most people will find it manageable, or can safely skip over anything technical without missing much. About half of it is really ""about"" the first definition above (frequency) - and that's the heavy math stuff. The other half is about how people act and think when there is not enough information to know better, and what goes into that thinking. I don't know if this would do much to really change how people think about chance, statistics or randomness, as he seemed to specifically avoid technical issues. Most people will probably just fit each case covered into their present ideas of any of those italicized words I put after each definitions. Those are the real concerns I think most people have on this topic, and he did a fair job covering them. I wouldn't call this a social science classic, but it was entertaining and easy enough to get through. "
18,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,4,"So this was pretty good. I had it on my to read list for awhile so I may have built it up a bit too much in my mind before getting started though because I kept waiting for the book to ""pick up"" in some areas. Overall though good read, really enjoyable. A lot of these anecdotes have been used before though. I think he could have come up with a few more unique scenarios. Still it was fun. I have always thought the wine ratings were a bit suss anyway. "
19,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2990467-ric,4,"[However taking this a step further, Leonard Mlodinow suggests that much of how our lives transpire is happenstance, defined by a supreme law of probability that governs what we experience and perceive as humans. "
20,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/887347-uos-s,5,"A great little book about statistics (my college minor), written by a professor of physics (my major field of study).I got my minor 11 years ago and haven't used statistics since. I've been aiming to take it back up again. maybe even do a career switch to data science (sometime down the road, at least two textbooks and a few online courses away - not to mention that I don't know of any data science openings in my city and I love my current house, and so does my husband...). I figured that plunging myself into pop books on the subject might be a good start.From a technical point of view, there's not much to be gained from this book. I don't recall seeing even a single formula. However, it's kind of impressive that a professor of physics could write a book about statistics without using any formulas. Well, he has written for Star Trek and MacGyver afterall...Definitely a good historical account of statistics and statisticians, which I'd had only brief exposure to before. Also, I liked how he kept pointing out that probability/statistics/randomness can really influence our experience of our own lives. For instance, Mlodinow's own father lost his first wife and children to the holocaust. But, had that not happened, his father would never have married Leonard's mother (also a holocaust survivor), and Leonard would not exist. Obviously, someone with that background must have spent considerable time thinking about such dichotomies as meaning and randomness."
21,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2681022-steven,5,"I found this book fascinating. I knew I didn't understand statistics, but I didn't realize how little I understood about randomness and probability. The Monty Hall problem (aka ""Let's make a deal"", Ch. 3); the effect that naming a girl child ""Florida"" can have on the probability of having two girls (Bayesian theory, Ch. 6, p. 107); the errors that people consistently make on relative probabilities (see, e.g., p. 36-40). I especially liked the sections on how we tend to find patterns where there are none, to base decisions on completely unreliable data. The author teaches that because success is so random, the best advice is simply to keep trying. He quotes Thomas Edison that ""many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up."" and Thomas Watson, of IBM, that ""If you want to succeed,double your failure rate."" In a world which is almost random, in which there is only a slight correlation between merit and success, ""Try, try again"" is not just an ancient proverb, it is a thoroughly modern and useful algorithm. I strongly recomend this book. "
22,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4235397-sarah-clement,4,"This book is a well-written, common sense account of probability for the layperson. I found it entertaining and it reminded me of past statistics courses - things I had forgotten I had even learned. However, it's not really what I was expecting. I expected more focus on how we misjudge probability in our every day lives, but that discussion felt ancillary to the discussion of the history of statistics in the book. I don't want to make it sound boring, because it wasn't, and the last third of the book was much more in the realm of what I was expecting. I really enjoyed reading about the fund manager stuff in particular. It confirmed my suspicion that most of the financial professionals don't really perform any better than if they were guessing at random. This is just the same as ""futurists"" or any sort of job that involves prediction. I would have loved it if he would have expanded this discussion into other professions (like futurists) because that would have been very interesting. All in all though, a good read, and I thought that the metaphor of the drunkard's walk was great...I just wished it had been described earlier in the book, but I guess he was building up to it!"
23,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/706046-tim-abraham,5,"this book is great. it takes you through the history of how the statistics and probabilities we understand (or try to understand) today were first proven. It's amazing how probability is just simply not an intuitive thing for the human mind. be prepared for some anecdotes that will leave you scratching your head. Mlodinov examples of human biases are entertaining and thought provoking. Anyone who likes interesting factoids, data, or wants to understand the world better will find this a good read."
24,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5995202-isil-arican,4,"A good, introductory book to general concepts of randomness, chance, and probability. The author does a great job explaining things in a simple matter, giving examples the reader can relate from daily life and demonstrates how this information can be applied to critical thinking/ skepticism.The book provides a compilation of common/known topics ranging from base rate fallacy, regression to the mean, Monty Hall problem while also providing an easy to follow summary of the history of statistics.The name of the book made me read it much later than I bought it because I was under the impression that the topics covered would be heavier and more advanced, but it isn't. Do not let the name fool you, it is pretty basic/ introductory stuff.The only caveat is that I partly read and partly listened this book while driving. Some sections do require you to see the calculations, and hearing is not enough. So I probably will re-read those episodes.Recommended to all who are into critical thinking - one of the key skill sets is to be able to understand the data presented in news reporting, health claims etc, and this would help to turn a critical eye to things we see, hear or read every day.“The first step in battling the illusion of control is to be aware of if. But even then it is difficult, once we think we see a pattern, we do not easily let go of our perception.” "
25,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8316749-katiemc,3,"I loved Thinking, Fast and Slow and I always had plans for doing a long and elaborate review of it. I even have a chunk of it drafted. Alas, that review will probably never happen. But I will say, if you liked this book and want to explore some of the concepts in depth without the historical references, I highly recommend it.So this book I liked. Being a math person, many of the ideas are not new to me. But I will add that being a person who has an affinity for real and complex analysis, set theory and topology, the world of probability and statistics has always been a pesky buggar. Proving the author’s main thesis, it is not one comes readily or intuitively, I have to work at it. Warning - this book presents the ultimate modern day probability parable of Monte Hall and his goats. This is a good problem, one that I have struggled with, understand conceptually, and have filed away. The only thing I will say about it, and it’s true of a great many problems that involve probabilities, the wording of the problem is of upmost importance. Probability theory is not always complex, but it can be tedious and careful understanding of the words that describe the problem are crucial. Another note about the book, there are several diversions into the history of math interspersed throughout the book. I found these tangents interesting and relevant, but sometimes distracting to the points being made. In an absurd sort of way, it indirectly reinforces the author’s premise that probability theory is not intuitive and it’s really hard to stay in that head space. It’s like when a difficult conversation gets derailed by smalltalk, sometimes it’s just too hard to stay intense and on point.A very important takeaway is the need for mathematical literacy in the world of probability and statistics. The 24 hour news cycle is filled with dubious blame gaming and attribution for everything from daily stock market moves to employment rates to crime rates, as if these were deterministic events. At least they are not determined by a finite set of known events. Imagine the sanity that would be brought to political discourse if this was to be acknowledged.2017 reading challenge checks the box for 15. A book with a subtitle .

26,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6143501-kim,4,"I confess to math envy. I can understand general concepts and ideas if they're presented in verbal form. Show me a page full of numbers and  mathematical symbols and my brain freezes up like a sprinkler at the North Pole. That's why I find books like this one so helpful. Maybe it's not helpful, since I can finish a book like this and have no less arithmophobia than when I started, but at least I can wrap my head around the concept.""The drunkard's walk"" is a phrase that came into use in the 1930s to describe random occurrences, everything from throwing dice to the movement of molecules through water. Those and dozens of other concepts you need to deal with daily are covered in the book, some of which are too close to life or death to trust to intuition.Mlodinow has a friendly and easy approach to these and other instances of making sense of numbers and statistics in order to make better decisions in our lives. With this he gradually draws us through a history of mathematics and thoughts about randomness from the ancient Greeks, through the invention of basics like plus and minus signs, through quantum mathematics and string theory. Even for this aging English major the trip was easy and pleasant.Among the ideas talked about include making the best decisions on Let's Make a Deal when you're confronted with three doors. You'll also learn whether to add or multiply variables when deciding on a roll of the dice or other random event, as well as the dangers of ""the gambler's fallacy"", which applies as much to investing as it does to gambling. The author also touches on polling and voting, explaining the ""margin of error"". He even teaches how to understand what doctors and lawyers are saying or hiding when they use statistics. Doctors for medical and pharmaceutical statistics, lawyers for probabilities on things like DNA and crime statistics.The book has now been out just short of 10 years. It's still useful and informative with few examples to tax your memory for things that happened a decade ago. The book is still available in new and used paper and hard editions, Kindle, and audio editions."
27,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1132102-steve-schafer,4,"A decade ago, the statistician author of this book tested positive for AIDS. The doctor informed him that the test was 99.9% accurate, so there was little hope for error. After an abysmal weekend, he began to question the relevancy this number. The incidence of AIDS (within his demographic—middle aged, non-IV-drug user) is 1 in 10,000. So, out of every 10,000 who take the test, 1 person will test positive and will have the disease. HOWEVER, with a .1% error rate, of those same 10,000 tested, 10 people will falsely test positive. To his great relief, he realized that even though the test is 99.9% accurate, only 1 out of 11 people like him who test positive actually have AIDS. It turns out, the author did not—both he and his logic were victorious. Page after page, The Drunkards Walk turns numbers upside down, constantly highlighting the irony of something so concrete being so elusive, misleading and often counterintuitive. Mlodinow’s approach is shotgun, encompassing a broad and fascinating history of the science of chance. He lays it all out in a very accessible manner, but make no mistake about it, some of his points require a minor ‘matheletic’ workout to understand.As much as this is a how-to guide for solving questions of probability, it is more of a how-not-to guide. It is Mlodinow’s primary assertion that randomness plays a much stronger role in our lives than we realize. Probability has its place, but it’s in the backseat, where we seldom keep it. Our world is full of data we use to determine where our own best chances lie—when this is often a lie in itself. And in coming to this conclusion, the book sums to more than just an understanding of probabilities, but of the human condition. We are hard-wired to seek meaning, patterns and control in life—even in the (frequent) event that they don’t exist. If you like numbers, it’s probable that you’ll relate to and enjoy this book."
28,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,4,"This book is another one of those books that can be described as useful, informative, and other such not-really-flattering adjectives, but it’s a really good book and everyone should read it. It’s amazing how much we’re NOT meant to understand chance and randomness. This deficiency is not only a problem for your statistics and probability exams, but also in daily life. You need to read this book to see how sloppy reasoning and misunderstanding of randomness can impair our judgment in so many situations. One example: We fail to realize that if thousands of mutual funds do investments for many years, some of them will beat the market five years in a row just by chance (try saying that to the big egos managing the funds), as evident by the dismal performance of the same funds in the next five years. We simply overlook the effect of randomness in success and failure, and as a results give undo credit or blame to individuals (including ourselves). There are simply too many unpredictable and uncontrollable factors in this life. Another example – this one shows how we fail to understand the concept of conditional probability: If the chance of HIV tests resulting in a false positive is 1 in 1000, and if you have tested positive, what is the chance that you got a false positive? 1 in 1000, right? No, because if the true rate of HIV infection is 1 in 10,000 for your demographics, then only 1 in a population of 10,000 is truly HIV-positive, but 10 in that population will get a false positive. So chances are over 90% that you got a false positive! You really need to read this book. "
29,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2971930-vy,4,"This is an enjoyable synopsis of basic principles of probability and statistics. Lest that sound like an oxymoron, Mlodinow really does manage to be entertaining while covering such topics as Pascal's triangle, normal distributions, standard deviations, Chi square analysis, Bayesian analysis, and type I and type II statistical errors. He weaves in thought-provoking questions and injects interesting anecdotes about the mathematicians who came up with these ideas. If you are a mathematician, you won't like or need this book--there are very few actual formulas. I've learned all this information before, but my prob and stats courses were *never* this engaging, and it was too easy to get bogged down in the math. This book served as a good refresher course that actually helped me to retain a better sense of the big picture. I think it'd also be a great introduction to these topics for the uninitiated.Beyond the presentation of mathematical concepts, the book shows practical applications. There is a lot of discussion of what happens when we misconstrue the causality of random events and when we mistake a probability as a definite fact. You'll come away with an increased awareness of how chance occurrences shape our lives. Fans of Gladwell's Outliers will recognize some of these themes."
30,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1390215-mike,0,"A very good and accessible introduction to probability and randomness. Most people don't appreciate the fact that most of what we see every day is the product of chance. Social scientists are, ironically, sometimes more blind to this fact than others, because we are trained to hunt for patterns, and we therefore tend to find them even if they aren't there. (For anyone who does statistics, one way of thinking about this is that the typical social scientist routinely underestimates the magnitude of the error term in an equation.) We get so caught up in what can explain, or think we can explain, that we forget to think about the many factors we can't. Oddly, although this is far from a self-help book, I think its main point can be useful for anyone who is feeling a bit down. Most success (and most failure) is the product of luck. The one thing we can control is our own behavior: persistence is all. "
31,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/318324-kurt,4,"I loved this book. Because the author provides so many real-life examples to illustrate and demonstrate his ideas, this book is extremely interesting and useful and readable.One of my favorite passages in the book talks about the ""confirmation bias"". Francis Bacon described this bias as follows: ""the human understanding, once it has adopted an opinion, collects any instances that confirm it, and though the contrary instances may be more numerous and more weighty, it either does not notice them or else rejects them, in order that this opinion will remain unshaken."" To make matters worse, not only do we preferentially seek evidence to confirm our preconceived notions, but we also interpret ambiguous evidence in favor of our ideas.Like many other points made in this book I found this passage to be so useful in explaining so much of what is observed in the real world with real people."

Although many of the topics are familiar to late high school/early university maths courses, the history, anecdotal illustrations and examples are woven together to build an enjoyable story of what is generally considered to be a dry topic. Most of the examples are not heavy on the maths (I would have preferred a little more!) so the book should be accessible to most readers regardless of their self-perceived numeracy skills. Hopefully the book is read by a wider audience than those who have a professional interest, since there is broad relevance for most of us. The last chapter offers an encouraging perspective on coping with the vagaries of a random world on our need to be in control, at least in part, of our destinies. "

38,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51664350-paul-weiss,4,"A unique approach to a difficult subject!Mathematicians or, at least, those comfortable with mathematics will probably suggest that A DRUNKARD'S WALK offers little new to them in terms of concrete mathematical analysis that they weren't already familiar with. And I'm certainly inclined to agree.On the other hand (even as a graduate of a university program in applied math and theoretical physics), I found plenty of interest and a remarkable level of insight demonstrating how non-intuitive the correct approach to the evaluation of probability, statistics and the almost all-encompassing effects of randomness in real-life actually is. Mlodinow offers plenty of meaty examples to chew on that are drawn from a myriad of real world arenas - the stock market, sports, consumer preferences and sampling surveys, the ways in which defense and prosecution attorneys can lead judges and juries down mathematically irrelevant and entirely spurious garden paths, medical testing, misplaced blame or unearned congratulations for strings of failures or successes that are nothing more than random variation and much, much more. Mlodinow also gives his readers some fascinating insights into how the basic nature of human psychology is, in many cases, the fundamental reason for our misinterpretation of probabilities and statistics ... EVEN in those cases where we are well aware of the illogical underpinnings of our analysis.In short, as long as a reader already well-versed in the mathematics of probability and statistics knows what to expect, A DRUNKARD'S WALK is sure to please. Potential readers that are more math-phobic can be assured that there isn't an equation in sight and their enjoyment of a fine contribution to a diverse non-fiction library is a slam dunk!Paul Weiss"

So when the professor recommended this book to the class, I thought yes, let's read it. And while reading a nonfiction book that a professor recommends is a very nerdy thing to do, it's also exactly the kind of nerd that I want to be! (I'm jealous of all the people who willingly read nonfiction regularly and gain lots of cool knowledge while I stick to fun fiction)Anyhoo this book was very interesting and well written in a way that is definitely palatable for anyone, math background or not. It dragged a bit in the last third but is still cool. Would recommend!"

Drunk people are more likely to let the universe control their bodies. As you may know, the result is random (sort of). Thus the other way around is also true: the whole universe is drunk all the time! Damn, this even explains quantum mechanics? Sure. But this book is about the effects of a drunk universe in our ordinary lives. The bad news is: you don't need a drink to see randomness everywhere."

In it, the author gives an overview of the development of probably theories throughout history. Using that as a framework, he gives brief explanations of many of the theories and formulas in the field and provides real world examples to make them relatively easy to understand.The general takeaway from the book is that much of what we believe to be meaningful in our lives is actually just a result of meaningless chance. The moral is: Never give up on your dreams, because eventually, shear probability says you'll win. All in all, this was a good read."
44,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/867629-justin,4,"UPDATE 4/30/13I'm revising my rating of this up a star, because I just realized that I'm still thinking about one of this book's concepts years later (specifically, how we view people who depend on factors outside of their direct control— CEOs, baseball players, etc.—without taking a long view of the trend towards the mean, thereby discounting the effects of random chance when evaluating their performance). Whatever nits I picked at the time I read it, this book taught me something interesting that I've since applied in my daily life, which is high praise for scientific nonfiction.-------I appreciate my many blessings when it comes to the big things that matter in life, but avoid gambling due to my preternatural bad luck in games of chance. How many times can one be dealt a 16 in blackjack, or roll under 10 on a 20-sided dice in one night, you may wonder? The answer, if you are me, is many, many times. Therefore, I was attracted by the premise of this book when I read one of its reviews: despite our proclivities for assigning patterns and assuming control of our destinies, blind luck plays a much larger role in our successes and failures in life than we give it credit for, and we can learn a lot about ourselves by understanding how randomness and probability are really applied.I’ve never had a good head for math, but statistics has always been an exception. Even so, I discovered that in order to ride along with this book, you need to be up on your math. Mlodinow is very good at explaining mathematical concepts in layman’s terms, with plenty of interesting (and sometimes hilarious) examples, and the book is probably a cakewalk for those who are interested and/or work in mathematics. Even so, I found my eyes glazing over every now and again as I tried to follow along.That being said, there is a lot of fascinating stuff in this book that makes for some interesting dinner-table talk. The book is targeted at those who aren’t math majors or probability experts, so even if you don’t quite understand the theories and equations that Mlodinow explains, he gives plenty of examples in which they apply, both hypothetical and real-life. He repeatedly makes the case that we don’t do a very good job in dealing with randomness, attributing results to unsupported assumptions and patterns that don’t exist, and shows in detail how this can affect everything from picking stocks and playing games to the fate of Hollywood executives and corporate CEOs. He even touches a little on the psychological and sociological factors that contribute to this, though I kind of wish he talked about that a little more; this book is solely about the numbers, and how to read them.And therein lies my only real complaint with the book: in his zeal to explain how randomness and probability work and are correctly applied, Mlodinow sometimes seems to discount situational context. Not all the time, to be sure; one particularly interesting example he gives on how feedback does or does not affect performance shows succinctly how situational context sometimes does not matter at all, and conversely, nearly an entire chapter is dedicated to how context can be applied to correctly determine an event’s chances. But in other places, the examples he gives to demonstrate particular statistical theories seem to be missing a piece, or only apply because he’s making them apply. Of course, that could just be my pattern-loving brain asserting itself in the face of indomitable mathematics. Still, I felt that Mlodinow’s arguments were weaker in some places than they were in others.In any event, there are a lot of neat concepts to be explored in this book, such as the idea of there being order in chaos (regression to the mean) and chaos in order (""the drunkard’s walk"" of the book’s title). And I particularly appreciated being reminded how cool and useful Pascal’s Triangle is. The most important conclusion to draw from this book, however, is the reliability of the one aspect of chance that we do have control over: the sample size. In other words, the only surefire way of achieving success in an endeavor, conclusively backed up by the math, is to not give up and try as many times as possible until the results we want come our way.This book is occasionally dry and somewhat daunting for the casual reader, but definitely worth a read for anyone that has a passing interest in statistics, and is full of interesting (and applicable) ideas on how chance really works in our lives."
45,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1899624-zach,3,"This is an excellent layman's guide to how random chance dictates various aspects of our lives, and how poorly equipped the human mind is to deal with randomness, even after training. It's also a good primer on various core concepts of statistics and probability, such as combinatorics, confidence intervals, and the central limit theorem.Mlodinow writes anecdotally, using salient examples from the news and his own life to illustrate how, in every conceivable domain, even intelligent people can't reason about probabilities and therefore come to the wrong conclusions. For example, Mlodinow got a false positive for an HIV blood test he took, and his doctor told him that since the test was 99.9% accurate, he was almost certainly going to die. But his doctor was making a common error in this kind of scenario. The relevant calculation isn't the accuracy of the test, but the probability of Mlodinow having HIV given the test result. As a straight white male who doesn't abuse intravenous drugs, his odds of having HIV are 1 in 10,000. It follows that in a population of 10,000 men in his demographic, 1 would have HIV and 11 would test positive for HIV (one true positive and ten false positives). This means that his chance of having HIV given the test result was actually 1 in 11, not 999/1,000 -- much better odds.My favorite aspect of the book was Mlodinow's summary of studies that reveal the biases in human thinking about chance. The human mind is unwilling to admit that chance could play so great a role in its everyday affairs, and so people consistently (and erroneously) assume that a person's success or failure in any endeavor must be due to the person themselves. Mlodinow present numerous studies to demonstrate this universal bias, in simple and unambiguous situations where, for example, a test subject randomly selected to be paid more for the experiment -- that the other subjects know was selected randomly -- will be treated with increased respect and deference relative to his (randomly) lower paid peers. He speculates that the human need for control over one's life leads us to consistently overestimate the chance that, for example, hard work leads to success and indolence to failure, or that outcomes in general can be predicted ahead of time based on past performance. These very human notions are demonstrably false, but so completely ingrained into our natural thought processes that even trained mathematicians make the same errors when they themselves are the subject of the study.Overall this was a pleasant and entertaining layman's math book, but I didn't find it particularly mind-expanding, probably because I was already familiar with most of the concepts Mlodinow discusses. For example, he spends several pages dissecting the now-famous Monty Hall paradox. These passages and several others were retreads for me, although well told. But I did appreciate his very human portraits about some of the great historical minds of math and physics, and he does an excellent job explaining the cultural and political reasons why these now-commonplace ideas about probability were so revolutionary at the time of their discovery."
46,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker,4,"Mlodinow presents two definitions of randomness: the ""frequency interpretation,"" identified by Charles Sanders Peirce in 1896 as a method that will produce one set as frequently as any other set, and the ""subjective interpretation,"" based on our inability to predict results. (pp. 84-85) Falling under the subjective category is research dating back to the 1930s that showed that ""people could neither make up a sequence of numbers that passed mathematical tests for randomness nor recognize reliably whether a given string was randomly generated."" (p. ix)Unlike Nassim Nicholas Taleb in The Black Swan, Mlodinow has more use for the idea of the bell curve in describing overall expectations. However, he points out that it is impossible to draw the bell curve from a single data point, which is often all that we have. He writes: ""When we observe a success or a failure, we are observing one data point, a sample from under the bell curve that represents the potentialities that previously existed. We cannot know whether our single observation represents the mean or an outlier, an event to bet on or a rare happening that is not likely to be reproduced."" (p. 142)His book uses many examples from sports, such as the fact that firing a coach after a bad season doesn't correlate with improved team performance, although popular belief holds the coach responsible. These concepts were presented well and it was enjoyable to try to work through the math.Quotes:""The theory of randomness is fundamentally a codification of common sense. But it is also a field of subtlety, a field in which great experts have been famously wrong and expert gamblers infamously correct. What it takes to understand randomness and overcome our misconceptions is both experience and a lot of careful thinking."" (p. 21) ""We associate randomness with disorder. Yet although the lives of 200 million drivers vary unforeseeably, in the aggregate their behavior could hardly have proved more orderly. ... But it was not just the regularities that astonished them [the 19th-century scientists:]. It was also the nature of the variation. Social data, they discovered, often follow the normal distribution."" (p. 148)"
47,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1073647-robyn-blaber,4,"Few things are more annoying to me that when friends say ""Everything happens for a reason."" I'm reminded of Voltaire's Candide where he is annoyed by the philosophical concept of ""sufficient reason"". Voltaire wonders what the sufficient reason of the Lisbon earthquake was (the most devastating natural disaster of his era and the end of the Portuguese as a world power). Was the sufficient reason that Portuguese rescue workers needed rescue work? The possible answers make sufficient reason seem quite absurd.We know the reason for almost everything. Mathematical probability. If you flip a coin long enough, you will get a heads result. If you practice guitar long enough, you'll learn to play Stairway to Heaven. And so on and so on.As an evolutionary advantage, our minds automatically try to make sense of random events and bring order to the chaos. It makes us feel better... and even live longer. We ascribe things such as god, karma, luck, the illusion of skill or whatever we can imagine to explain random phenomenon, particularly when the phenomenon makes the odds appear long.What's the difference between a personal understanding of long odds and a general understanding? For example, what are the chances that you will win a lottery? Not good. What are the chances that ""someone"" will win the same lottery? Very good. If you narrow the scope of a long-odds event to your own personal experience, of course these events can seem like providence.The Drunkards walk was (for me) a little too simple. I've studied combinatorial mathematics and statistics and the book was a simple reminder of the works of Pascal, Fibonacci, Newton and a few others. For someone new to mathematics, however, I think it would be a better read... it explained simple combinatorics problems that I assume would not confuse a virgin to mathematics.In the end... the lasting idea is... our lives are ruled by chance and we can improve our lives by tipping odds in our favour. Before we can do this, however we have to accept that everything has odds and that we are rarely in control. Not easy advice, but worth the price. "
48,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1385106-jamie,3,"Yeah, that's right. A book about probability theory. And actually, it's not bad if you can either shrug off or endure a bit of lecturing on basic mathematics and statistics. Author Leonard Mlodinow sets out to review the history of probability, starting with the ancient Greeks and following the field's evolution and application. Mlodinow has a pretty good style, keeping things relatively low level so that anyone with a high school education in math can probably follow along. He also peppers the narrative with jokes and asides to break up the otherwise less-than-fluffy subject matter. And it works pretty well, though I suspect the lengthy discussion of the normal curve might have lost me if I hadn't already had all that info drilled into me in graduate school.My favorite parts of The Drunkard's Walk were the historical bits dealing with the personalities and biographies of the people who helped define the field. It's interesting to see how one, for example, labored as a would-be academic for years and years, before turning his burgeoning probability theory to gambling and making more money than he ever dreamed of. Actually, that theme shows up a lot --another section describes how another researcher working in the field went to a casino and used his meticulous study of roulette tables to uncover flaws in the system and make himself fabulously wealthy before they kicked him out.Where The Drunkard's Walk falls down (ha!) a bit is in its examination of the practical problems to which probability theory can be applied. That is, why it matters to YOU. The best books on popular science do this really well, and it moves the work from being academic to accessible by anyone looking to be both educated and entertained. Don't get me wrong, Mlodinow does some of this, but he doesn't really nail it as well as some others I've read. Still, if you've got a little bit of grounding in the topic and want to add some context to your knowledge, The Drunkard's Walk should do that quite nicely."
49,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4101122-jeremy,4,"A really nice overview of fundamental concepts in probability and statistics, in the context of the lives of the frequently bizarre people who developed them! If you wanted to learn more about this topic, this book would give you a good handle on the concepts so you could dive in and understand your awful textbook full of opaque formulas.I really enjoyed the descriptions of collaboration and inspiration among the people who made important contributions to probability.The writing style is overall a bit academic, but still good for a general audience without any background in the subject or extensive practice deciphering universitese. It's pleasant, casual, and the examples are easy to follow.Where this book falls down a little bit is in guiding you towards applying these concepts to your life or work. I think a reader would need a little more hand-holding and walking through specific scenarios to think about how to use these ideas. We're not likely to be guests on ""Let's Make A Deal,"" so even after working out the awesome and counterintuitive Goat Odds, it would still be hard to go through the same process for scenarios we're likely to encounter in real life. This is where an author like Malcolm Gladwell would really succeed with this kind of material - by coming up with a few good ideas for applications and running with them, stripping them down to their bare essentials and presenting a persuasive argument for how to identify your biases that are based on limited evidence, override your intuition and rely on real measurements of what is likely to occur. Mlodinow tries to advocate for this, but you'd need to develop it on your own, and where's the pop-science fun in that?"
50,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15155099-jacob,4,"I'm not good at math. I am, however, very good at being drunk. I had hoped this book would marry the middle ground and suddenly I'd be wonderful at maths. This didn't happen. What DID happen was the book proceeded to explain to me that being bad at maths wasn't necessarily my fault. Most people, as it turns out, are terrible with numbers. When calculating odds we tend to process with incomplete data and with an irrational relish for fallacies and rhythms in the realm of chance.Mlodinow takes us through the often counter-intuitive maths and history of divining the odds while also using thought exercises to try and connect the fickle ground between knowing and understanding. And the book that handles it's topics well. You may find yourself rereading certain paragraphs more than a few times, but retraining thousands of years of faulty inherited logic was never going to be easier. It's infinitely readable, which is great, because it should be read. This book, or at the very least the total of it's contents, should be forced upon everyone who wishes to engage in public life. It is a book not just about knowing the odds, but about appreciating just how deep they are in every faucet of our lives. Taken the right way the book can act as a liberating filter for one's self perception of the world. Your failures are never entirely your own, nor your successes. Win or lose you are at the whim of a grand and infinitely variable collection of uncertainties. You can never know what lies ahead, but with the right set of tools and the right amount of data you can figure the odds. Which I suppose if you enjoy knowing how unlikely it is you're going to succeed at something, is kind of like playing god. "
51,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26674095-gy,5,"For the start of this brief review that explains the book and our human nature let me quote from the book: A few years ago a man won the Spanish national lottery with a ticket that ended in the number 48. Proud of his “accomplishment,” he revealed the theory that brought him the riches. “I dreamed of the number 7 for seven straight nights,” he said, “and 7 times 7 is 48.”No known higher order of matter in the, by us known chaos (at least looks like that) we call the Universe, than we are! One of the main evolutionary skills of our mind to plan, anticipate, to forecast our everyday life, the outcomes of our actions, had been for millennia our main tool of survival and progress. Our mind that generates our self-model within a world that's surrounds us is working on that way as well. We are the only species capable for long term planning and that's force us to permanently create, apply and if face unknown to search for patterns.On other side however, we live in very dynamic, ever changing environment where the chance, the randomness, the lack of information and time for planning and making decisions are invading our comfort zone every single day, moment of our life.This book is about war between the chaos, chance, randomness, and the living being that can't survive without plans and search for patterns. It is about the way we make choices and the processes that lead us to make mistaken judgments and poor decisions when confronted with randomness or uncertainty.This is Mr. Molodinow's attempt to teach us to the principles that govern chance. Great book, love it and will read it again!"
52,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/270914-diana,3,"A little disappointing. I expected more mathematical examples, but non the less an interesting read. If you've had any experience with statistics, some of the more popular sociological experiments and a basic understanding of human psycological behavior then there are several sections that can be scanned thru. The chapter on false positives; especially in medicine caught my attention in particular. I was pleasantly surprised to read some of the more in depth history of the development of statistics, that isn't something I would have gone out looking for as reading material, so it was nice to get a little more exposure to the development of such a popular mathematical tool. As was the discussion of a dye molecule in a glass in relation to the attack on Pearl Harbor and 9/11.Bottom line . . . Mlodinow is making the case to stop searching for patterns to make sense of one's life, because there truly isn't one. Human perception and interpretation is/ are fallible. It's a all a game of chance, skill, talent, knowledge, location and number of attempts. All play roles but persistence equates to more opportunity to achieve. The same could be said of putting yourself in a position where there is a higher probability of something negative happening. Thought provoking and a great book for someone with little exposure to stats, etc. It's easy to read and a Mlodinow injects some humor throughout the book keeping it light and personable. "
53,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/784513-danielle,4,"Really interesting. I really enjoyed it. Here is my favorite quote from the book, which summarizes the entire theme: ""It is easy to believe that ideas that worked were good ideas, that plans that succeeded were well designed, and that ideas and plans that did not were ill conceived. And it is easy to make heroes out of the most successful and to glance with disdain at the least. But ability does not guarantee achievement, nor is achievement proportional to ability. And so it is important to always keep in mind the other term in the equation—the role of chance."" I'm also reading Outliers right now, which shares the idea of ""success"" not really being as hard-earned as we want to believe. Even among our idols, there's a good deal of luck involved. I like the idea that outward success doesn't really correlate with inherent worth.If you decide to read this book (which I recommend) keep in mind that there's a hefty amount of statistics (in basic layman's terms, but it did call up memories of Stats 105), and also a lot of history about the field of statistics. That being said, Mlodinow does an impressive job of making a dry subject interesting, and I never lost my motivation to keep reading. "
54,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/128167-audrey,3,"I wanted to like this book more, and I did enjoy it a lot, but it was somewhat unfocused (and I somewhat doubt that Mlodinow was engaging in performative randomness).If anything, I think ""The Drunkard's Walk"" suffers from trying to be a few too many things at once; I could have done with a bit less biographical information about the mathematicians and statisticians whose work was cited. I also would have liked to see more math and hard numbers, which I suppose is a hard selling point for a book targeted at non-math folk. The case study format falls a bit short of Gladwell, though there are a few interesting examples (and just as many examples I've seen rehashed elsewhere).Overall, I also thought the book was more about statistical analysis and conditional probability than it was about true randomness, as the title and introduction and a lot of the chapter intros kept promising. I'd probably rate this at just above a 3.6, though I'm unmathematically rounding down. I got the sense I would much rather sit down with Mlodinow and have a conversation with him than try to read his at times serendipitous thought-association squashed into linear form. [Disclaimer: Most of my reading of this book took place after 1 a.m., so maybe that skewed my opinions.]"

The first time I read it, I hadn't yet encountered The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference or Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything. On a second read, I discovered just how snarky Mlodinow is about them and their tendency to infer patterns where they may or may not exist. I still think he goes too far, though. Just because randomness is everywhere doesn't mean that there isn't an underlying signal; randomness doesn't imply 50-50....And that's all I'm going to post here.

Whereas Pink caters to the popular manager and corporate slave, this addresses the nitty-gritty more. The writing is interesting and concise, which I perfer in my science books, even if they're pop science. Of course, this book tries to draw you in with the clever title, but doesn't reference it until the last few chapters, when you learn it has to do with Brownian motion. This is much more mathematical than I had anticipated, but so interesting on the points of history and the significance that I'm already putting it on my reread shelf. There's a lot to unpack here, and it deserves more attention. I have a sneaking suspicion that the ebook would be a valuable accompaniment to the audiobook. The narrator is excellent. He kept me going through the history of math notation and calculus, not my favorite subjects, with his diction. So good for this material. Well done! "
57,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5133745-sarah,4,"This is the sexiest book on probability and statistics I have ever read, fo' sho. What the title doesn't tell you is that it is a pretty fascinating look into the lives of mathematicians and statisticians over the ages, as well as a how-to guide for conducting your own experiments (which might come in handy if you have a burgeoning meth habit or have to take a statistics course). I would consider this a ""must read"" for anyone taking probability and statistics, because it breaks everything down into ""knowable"" language and magically makes math seem accessible. Jargon is kept to a minimum or explained and the examples and anecdotes are genuinely entertaining. Though Mlodinow doesn't take us there, the book is radically egalitarian in its political implications, though I thought the book the could be improved if he did a little more to cover the interface between math and psychology (e.g. how expectations influence outcomes, the normalcy bias, etc). Finally, the book gets +10 points for doing ann excellent fakeout at the end, which seems like it is going to be a heartfelt and moralistic stitching, and ends up being a message of doom and gloom of the highest order.

In addition to helping us question how we view events and often assign patterns when none actually exist, I now have a much better understanding of basic statistics. The author even explained the Monty Hall problem in a very understandable manner. Even if you are not a numbers geek, this book will give you a fresh perspective on the world around you and how you link events. With examples from business to sports to entertainment as well as our everyday lives, he makes the underlying analyses come to life. I think he gets a little bit preachy and heavy-handed in his analysis of Donald Trump, but it may be that he fails to go into the underlying info sufficiently - his other examples are much better supported. In listening to the audio version of this book, I was originally wondering why it was part of the Coach-In-A-Box series, but after reading it I think it really does belong there. As to my categorization of the book, I originally classified it only as a non-fiction/interesting book, but I added to my self-help and provocative lists also."

I enjoyed some of the real life stories the author included to articulate a point, but overall I can't believe that everything is pure random chance. I think a person would have to be an atheist, or at least very agnostic, to believe that there is absolutely zero influence in how things happen. I might be wrong (wouldn't be surprising) on that point. I can see how some things are left to chance, but you can greatly increase your chance through various means (be it skill, determination, who you know, etc) and I think the author probably said that, but I interpreted it wrong.Or maybe it's just all due to my confirmation bias. I'd recommend this book to people that already like this sort of thing, but it wasn't for me."
60,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,"I wonder if I had not just read Superforecasting by Tetlock and Gardner immediately proceeding reading this book if I would have given this book 5 stars instead of 4. The Drunkard's Walk is an excellent book full of concepts about randomness that every person should try to understand. How humans understand randomness affects every aspect of life. This book was not as exciting as Superfocasting, but surely as worthwhile. Mlodinow presents many interesting examples of randomness that are often seen as meaningful in some way. The meaning we attach to events or information can direct our thought and actions. Since our perception is false, our thoughts and actions that are guided by our perceptions are questionable, and we should absolutely question them. This is simply a great primer for life in general. "
61,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4526901-khalid-alnaqbi,2,"Some books are famous only because of the attractiveness of their titles (like this one and like 'Naked Statistics' or whatsoever). And also because of a commentary written by a famous person on the cover of the book (in this case, STEPHEN HAWKING! Most probably that he/she just spent few minutes skimming the book). The problem is that each author copies from others with different titles. The things we read in these books are exactly the same in a basic statistics (or probabilities) course. You'll only benefit from the examples that they provide, not because they are practical but because they are exciting.I recommend not to waste your time with these book. Take a probabilities course which will benefit you more and more."
62,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39356997-michael-bailey,5,"Probability and randomness is very poorly understood by people. That's unfortunate because it affects all of our lives on a daily basis. Understanding how probability works is crucial to understanding the interactions and interplay of the many random events that surround our lives. Mlodinow does an amazing job of not just highlighting the ways in which randomness plays out, but also goes into some depth on the mathematical tools that allow us to analyze and comprehend this randomness.I similarly recommend the book ""Fooled by Randomness"" by Nasim Taleb. At first I was worried that this book would simply be a reprise of what I had already read there. While there was some cross-over, the books took different paths and ultimately complemented each other very well."
63,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/700527-kristen,5,"This is a great book explaining the mathematical reasons behind the randomness of life and everything else. I especially enjoyed the conversation about why things like obvious after the fact. In this time of great glory of worship that is given to the billionaires, I advise more than ever that people need to understand math and science. When we do not have knowledge of how randomness works in the world, it is easy to give into deterministic beliefs. Hard work is not what causes wealth, and in return wealth does not mean you have worked hard. My favorite Mr. Thomas Hardy described it best when he said that we are judged not by the reasons for our actions, but on the accidental outcomes. ""The need to feel in control interferes with the accurate perception of random events."" "
64,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2861083-erika,3,"The book had an auspicious beginning: interesting anecdotes related to randomness and probability, including helpful hints on how to win Let's Make A Deal. From the middle of the book on, however, the author thought that it would be a neat idea to see if he could make his book as unreadable as possible. Born without the ability to skim, I read bunches and bunches of words that, whilst I may have understood them when I was a member of my middle school math team, have become less than meaningless to me now.Conclusion: This book is the perfect ""punishment reading"" for all those who say the phrase ""Well, I believe everything happens for a reason"". It's random, you asshole!"
65,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76688-eric,4,"The last popular science book I read, which Mlodinow co-wrote, was The Grand Design. While that book went over my head early and often, this book on chance, probability, statistics and randomness was much easier to understand and digest. It is littered with real world examples that are both compelling and illustrative of the mathematical points they were describing. The main concept to take out of The Drunkard's Walk is simple -- results are based on a good deal more random chance than skill, and the only tool we have to make that work for us is hard work and perseverance, as the more often we try, despite failure, the more chances we give ourselves for success."
66,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7452326-pedro,3,"I wish I had read this book before or during my statistic classes! The Drunkard's Walk book explains some concepts of statistics in a easy way to understand. It also shows how it usually affects our life.After reading it, I've started to see the randomness everywhere and to understand how important it is to my life decisions. However, even that is easy to understand, I think that the reader must have some basic maths or even statistics to fully understand the book. The person can read the book entirely by only believing on what the authors says, but if you want to prove some concepts, you will have to do some basic calculations. I think this is fun :).I recommend it!"
67,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5558652-emma-sea,2,"Not as much fun as I hoped.I didn't expect as much on the historical development of different statistical techniques and theorems: I thought there'd be more emphasis on the randomness in our day to day lives. Where this was the focus I thought the book was great: aspects like false positive HIV tests and film studio performance, for example. For this reason I enjoyed the final two chapters vastly more than the rest of the book. Trevor wrote an incredibly comprehensive review which sums it all up nicely. 2.5 stars, rounded down."
68,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12925436-annie,4,"This book is being sold as a book about randomness -- how our lives are affected by random events... as if we have no control and who knows how our lives will turn out. But really, it's about understanding probability and how our minds create pattern and order sometimes when none exist. Sometimes you can do things that favor your chances if you know what are the factors that can contribute to improving your chances. There is also a lot of information about the development of these theories and a lot of stories of how those theories are applied. This would be an excellent prerequisite reading assignment for a statistic class."
69,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2427207-paul,4,"I always enjoy trying to understand why the innumerate masses misunderstand risk and reward. In other words, why some people play the lottery, or avoid flying on airplanes, etc. this book exposes the fascinating history of the development of the math behind statistics, and the modern misunderstandings of probability. A quote, Francis Bacon put it in 1620, “the human understanding, once it has adopted an opinion, collects any instances that confirm it, and though the contrary instances may be more numerous and more weighty, it either does not notice them or else rejects them, in order that this opinion will remain unshaken.”"
70,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4579049-justin,3,"The Drunkard's Walk belongs on the same shelf as Freakonomics, Black Swan, and Malcolm Gladwell's books. Each delves science and history to present new ways of understanding how things work. This books focuses on randomness and presents a study of how our understanding of it has evolved and how it continues to do so. Though the narrative can get bogged down in stretches of mathematics or statistics, it's an entertaining and very intelligent read. I now get to kid myself into thinking I'm smarter, though statistics won't bear that out. Recommended for any fans of these types of books."
71,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54304445-baby-adam,4,"Lots of interesting examples of the misuse of statistics, and illustrations of how a bit of stats knowledge can give you a whole different perspective on the world! I would very much recommend to anyone interested in business, sport, and following big names in media etc. The mathematical content is simply explained, and well chosen so as not to overwhelm the reader. More people should read this kind of work - it would change the world! Shout out to the UoR library from which the book was borrowed."
72,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,4,"As other reviewers have pointed out, Mlodinow's strength is an exceptional ability to convey statistical ideas clearly. At times I found the chattiness of his style a little irritating. And I'm guessing that, in certain chapters, he overestimates the tolerance of his target audience for mathematical details. But it is a useful book, well-written and engaging, though I ultimately preferred Nassim Taleb's ""Fooled by Randomness""."
73,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/968901-jaime,3,"The book was well-written and funny at times, but the subject matter made me sad. We're not as talented or skilled as think we are; we're just lucky or unlucky. There was a lot of math and statistics that were tedious at times. As much as Leonard Mlodinow wishes I will be able to apply these ideas to everyday life, they were a bit heavy for me. "
74,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5476796-drucilla,2,"I feel the need to explain my rating. I...did not care for this book. I thought it would be a philosophy book, but instead it was a probability and statistics text. Even though the author says he wrote it for the lay person, I hardly understood any of it. That being said, I'm not a math person, which is why I felt it wasn't fair to give it a one star rating. It did have some interesting stories and experiments, but on the whole, I skimmed most of it."
75,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7408955-motaz-alfarraj,5,"When I first studied probability theory and randomness in engineering school, I was fascinated by the theory! Since then I consider this topic as one of favorites. I know how randomness play an important role in our lives but I have never looked at it from the point of view from which the author of this book views it. This book was suggested to me by a friend a while ago and I regret not starting reading when it was first suggested."
76,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11662595-rajan,0,"And so the first step is to realize that success or failure sometimes arises neither from great skill nor from great incompetence but from, as the economist Armen Alchian wrote, “fortuitous circumstances.”------The outline of our lives, like the candle’s flame, is continuously coaxed in new directions by a variety of random events that, along with our responses to them, determine our fate. As a result, life is both hard to predict and hard to interpret.---++"
77,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/968809-garrett-burnett,4,"I give you a four-in-five chance of enjoying this book. The Drunkard's Walk is a wonderful volume on probability, its history and application. I may be escalating myself to a new realm of geekiness by admitting how much I liked it, but it was entertaining (given the topic), easily understandable, and informative."
78,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/189647-candice,4,"My husband read this book and would talk about things he had read in it, so I decided to give it a try and possibly sharpen those nearly dead math major skills. It was very interesting. It went into the history of probability and statistics in an understandable way and gave good explanations of what randomness really is. Very clearly written and enjoyable."
79,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11502659-deniz,3,"Overly detailed at times with the examples and the depth into which they go into the math, but there were some interesting concepts and ideas. Felt like a trip back into Statistics and Calculus class at times. Overall it was interesting, but there were definitely a few points where I was questioning continuing on near the first half of the book."
80,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41912303-vil-m-zouhar,4,"I was looking forward to reading this book for already some time and I certainly wasn't disappointed. It covers the history, principles, misconceptions and fallacies of our interpretation of randomness whilst still being brief and not boring. For further reading I recommend the first few chapters from Antifragile by Nassim Nicholas Taleb."
81,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2222510-john-buchanan,4,"Worth reading. I found the early chapters would have benefitted from some diagrams. The last few chapters show the problem of inductive reasoning, clear in hindsight. The final two chapters are gems. Despite a little criticism, a great read and a worthy investment of time. I will certainly refer to it again."
82,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45146641-eric-levenstein,4,"Although some of the math was way above my head (I'm an Engineer, so although this sounds pompous I'm very comfortable with statistics), this is a wonderful book that really made me reconsider many decisions and views of the world."
83,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43835105-nikos-korexenidis,3,Black Swan and antifragile are way better than this!! very pop science with lots of stories and experiments but little practical stuffi recommend it only to those who just starting to learn about propability 
84,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/922754-camille,4,This book is a great overview of some basic probability concepts. It's a good warning of how mis-interpreting chance and randomness can lead us to make really bad decisions...
85,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/915302-lotte,4,I bow to those for whom this is a quick read. I paused often to grasp (or attempt to grasp) various aspects of probability and am still pondering the role of randomness in life.
86,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1565750-larry-evans,0,Great history of the development of probability theory and statistics with a lot of interesting applications. Actually a really fun book.
87,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/940307-greg,2,This was less about how randomness rules our lives- than a history of mathematicians whose work connected to chaos theory.
88,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3279997-manifest-stefany,3,I found the last two chapters very moving and inspiring. The book was enjoyable to read even though at some points it felt a little repetitive.
89,0375424040,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4089478-jim,4,"I really enjoyed this - informative and entertaining, with a lot of history and fun anecdotes. Longer review soon, I hope.. "
