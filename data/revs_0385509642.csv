A Clash of Cymbals
, the concluding volume of the ""Cities in Flight"" tetralogy, scientists make a momentous discovery: we are not the only universe. A parallel universe, separated from ours across a fourth spatial dimension, is drawing ever closer. When the two universes collide, they will mutually annihilate and start a new cycle of the cosmic story.I liked Blish's story as a teen, but found the basic premise hard to swallow. I am all the more astonished to discover that Paul Steinhardt and Neil Turok (hereafter, S&T), both highly respected cosmologists, have proposed a similar scenario and argued for it at length. There are a few differences, of course. In Blish's story, the other universe was made of antimatter, and the S&T one is normal matter; also, Blish has the collision occurring in 4004 A.D., while S&T more conservatively estimate that it will happen about a trillion years from now. All the same, the two versions are surprisingly similar. Even more surprisingly, no one seems to have told the two scientists about their fictional precursor. They quote Asimov's short story The Final Question with evident approval, but there's not a mention of poor old Blish.S&T seem disappointed that hardly anyone is prepared to take them seriously, despite all the work they've done. They make some good points. ""Inflation"", the current mainstream theory of the very early universe, is a bit of a mess: in particular, it relies on an expansive force which only had effect right at the beginning of time, and whose nature is still obscure. Originally it was supposed to be caused by the Higgs field, but it turned out that that didn't work; now it's claimed to be something similar to the Higgs field, but distinct from it. The properties of the ""inflaton"" field seem rather ad hoc, and have to tuned carefully to fit the data. S&T point out that we already know about one universal expansive field, dark energy. Their theory uses dark energy to do all the expanding and smoothing that inflation is supposed to do. Each trillion year cycle of the universe ends up with space-time ironed flat by dark energy; it then collides with the parallel universe, releasing a huge amount of energy and kicking the cycle off again. Some parts of this idea seem to have been borrowed by Penrose in his recent book 
Cycles of Time
.S&T have detailed mathematical models for everything, and there's no doubt that it's real science. It makes concrete predictions: if inflation happened, it ought to have given rise to strong gravitational waves, whose effects we should fairly soon be in a position to detect by the way they would polarize the Cosmic Background Radiation. S&T, in contrast, predict much weaker gravitational waves. We only need to be able to measure the polarization a little more accurately to be able to distinguish the two theories. Stephen Hawking (a colleague of Turok) has apparently made one of his famous bets to the effect that these measurements will disprove the cyclic theory. Right now, however, it seems that no one knows what's going on.So the jury's still out, but I'm afraid my reaction is the same as it was when I read Blish's novel in the early 70s: it's just too bizarre to think that there's an invisible universe alongside ours, which periodically collides with us. I gather that my reaction is pretty much the usual one. All the same, the book is responsibly written and contains a lot of interesting detail about how the world of modern cosmology works. If you're into that kind of thing, I warmly recommend it.___________________________________________________I wrote to Steinhardt yesterday to ask if it really was the case that he had not come across the James Blish novel. He thanked me and said that I was the first person to point out the connection. I do feel sorry for Blish. Evidently his book is utterly forgotten, a mere 50 years after it was first published. "

2,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61033954-m-r,4,"Two world-renowned scientists present an audacious new vision of the cosmos that “steals the thunder from the Big Bang theory.” —Wall Street JournalThe Big Bang theory—widely regarded as the leading explanation for the origin of the universe—posits that space and time sprang into being about 14 billion years ago in a hot, expanding fireball of nearly infinite density. Over the last three decades the theory has been repeatedly revised to address such issues as how galaxies and stars first formed and why the expansion of the universe is speeding up today. Furthermore, an explanation has yet to be found for what caused the Big Bang in the first place.In Endless Universe, Paul J. Steinhardt and Neil Turok, both distinguished theoretical physicists, present a bold new cosmology. Steinhardt and Turok “contend that what we think of as the moment of creation was simply part of an infinite cycle of titanic collisions between our universe and a parallel world” (Discover). They recount the remarkable developments in astronomy, particle physics, and superstring theory that form the basis for their groundbreaking “Cyclic Universe” theory. According to this theory, the Big Bang was not the beginning of time but the bridge to a past filled with endlessly repeating cycles of evolution, each accompanied by the creation of new matter and the formation of new galaxies, stars, and planets.Endless Universe provides answers to longstanding problems with the Big Bang model, while offering a provocative new view of both the past and the future of the cosmos. It is a “theory that could solve the cosmic mystery”"
3,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77417-bill-greene,4,"I picked up Endless Universe mainly because I wanted to read something about recent cosmological theory, especially dark matter and dark energy. The book provides all that and then goes further by postulating a more controversial model than the inflationary one currently in favor.In a recent phone conversation, I mentioned this book and its authors' ideas to a friend of mine who writes about astronomy for a major scientific magazine, and I could hear her rolling her eyes. Suffice it to say, the model put forth in Endless Universe is not widely accepted by the scientific community.I have no problem with the inflationary model's premise that the universe will expand forever until it is so diffuse that it is, for all practical purposes, empty. What I find hard to believe is that 'everything' just popped into being one day. From where? One might as well believe in creation theory.Paul Steinhardt and Neil Turok, physicists at Princeton and Cambridge Universities respectively, have an alternative. The idea, in a nutshell, is that rather than one big bang out of nowhere/nowhen, why couldn't there be a never-ending series of bangs and contractions? This is called the cyclic model and in itself is not a new idea. In the past, the cyclic model was soundly trounced by everything from evidence that the expansion of the universe is speeding up with no end in sight to the Second Law of Thermodynamics. To deal with all this they introduce the multiverse, the idea that there are other universes along other dimensions which exert a gravitational effect on ours that could act to reverse the inflationary effect of dark energy. The bangs themselves are actually our universe whacking into the universe next door from time to time.The book does a great job of presenting things simply, but the midsection does get a bit difficult for layfolk. ('Challenging' is the word the authors use.) In order to explain what they're explaining they throw in basic primers on string theory and quantum mechanics. I was able to plow through all that with only the sketchiest idea of what they meant, and it was enough. Some simple drawings were helpful.One of the joys of the book is its enthusiasm. In one touching passage, the authors, both physicists by discipline, pay tribute to the trailblazers of the previous generation, such as Andrei Sakharov and Steven Weinberg.""In the 1960s and '70s, most particle physicists judged cosmology to be too speculative and recommended that their students steer clear of it. But a few celebrated theorists... were notable exceptions... As important as the research itself was the impression it left on the younger generation of physicists. The fact that world-renowned scientists would consider this problem worthy of their attention sent the message that cosmology was ripe for exploration by particle physicists. By the early 1980s, a growing band of young particle theorists had begun to follow their pioneering trail and explore other puzzles lurking in the early universe. The two of us were part of this new generation.""It's a great read whether you agree with their ideas or not. Steinhardt and Turok provide a good overview of cosmology, including a sympathetic summary of the inflationary model. (Steinhardt is a defector from that camp, so he knows the party line well.) There were moments reading this book when I was suddenly struck by the scale of space and time being thrown around, and I felt real awe. That alone is worth the price of admission."
4,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019174-terence,3,"First off I should establish my bona fides for reviewing a book like this (i.e., science): I have none!My interest in astronomy & its relatives goes back to when I was 8 and entertained the idea of becoming an astronomer. Alas, I have no head for math and only my 9th grade science teacher was any inspiration at all so I wound up in the humanities (not that I regret it, given my talents and interests I didn't make the wrong choice). I am but an amateur dilettante who can only watch from the bleachers.My lack of credentials firmly established, this is a very interesting read. The authors are the originators of the only serious contender to the dominant theory about the origins of the universe, the inflationary big bang theory. Their version is called ""the cyclic universe"" theory.They identify several areas where the IBB is deficient; the most telling being the lack of a source for inflationary energy. But perhaps I should back track a bit: The ""inflation"" in IBB refers to a period right after the big bang when space/time expanded at an enormous rate, far faster than it had been and did subsequently. This inflationary quirk had to be introduced to the original big bang model because, otherwise, cosmologists couldn't explain why the universe looks the way it does today. This aspect of the big bang theory has always bothered me, actually. It seems rather arbitrary to simply introduce a condition in order to make your theory work out (though there is enough circumstantial evidence to make it plausible).The authors attempt to resolve the dilemmas faced by the IBB by postulating that our universe is but the latest in a cycle of universes that have been created, lived & died. There may be no beginning (which would have Aquinas rolling in his grave) and no end to the cycles (which last about a trillion years). Space and time existed before our universe emerged and don't have to be created ex nihilo; and previous universes may have had an influence on the structure of ours, which would explain why ours is so congenial to our lifeform. They can do this by relying on the characteristics of the latest incarnation of string theory -- M theory. This is probably the weakest part of their argument since string theory has lately come under some fierce attacks and it may turn out NOT to be the answer to ""life the universe and everything"" afterall (besides we all know it's 42 anyway).I like their theory anyway. It's more elegant than the IBB and aesthetically pleasing (which, of course, is not definitive) and the authors present it very clearly.I'd like to think their solution or one similar to it is the correct one but I'll enjoy watching how things turn out over the course of the next few years."
5,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68203854-andrew-harris,4,"I really enjoyed the book. I have read Turok before, ""The Universe Within"" so decided to give this a try. They present their work on an alternative model of the universe to the inflationary theory. I found it challenging at times and put some time into summarizing it so that I could benefit from a more complete understanding of the cyclic model.Inflation post big bang caused the universe to expand 10100 times in 10-30 seconds. Gas cooled, expansion slowed allowing atoms and molecules to clump and form stars and galaxies. This was the theory conceived in 1980s, but now recent observations show that dark energy took over and started to accelerate expansion again. The standard inflationary model states that the expansion will continue forever until space turns into a nearly perfect vacuum. Flaws of inflationary model: 1)	Patchwork theory with many disconnected ingredients. Ordinary matter, dark matter (accounts for most of the mass of galaxies), dark energy (invisible antigravity force causing accelerated expansion), inflationary energy which exists in the first few instants after the big bang and decays away in 10-30 s.As an aside, dark matter was discovered through the search for missing mass which presented itself in the unpredictably fast galactic orbital speeds which could not be explained using regular matter alone. It was discovered through gravitational lensing and most phycisists believe it is a soup of neutral elementary particles which do not scatter or absorb light. Dark energy can only be detected through its repulsive gravitational effect over large distances. It can be thought of as the cosmological constant proposed by Einstein in 1917. It is the energy of the vacuum; the energy remaining when all matter and radiation are removed and its value is much smaller today than theory predicts (cosmological constant problem).Energy density determines the expansion rate of the universe. Energy density of mater decreases as volume increases. Same for radiation, but it is also subject to doppler effect, decreasing the frequency (and energy) as the universe expands. Dark energy in contrast, remains constant. The relative proportions are always changing. At early times, radiation dominates the energy density (0-75,000 years), then followed by a matter dominated period (expansion was slow enough to allow for the formation of higher order structures like stars, planets, and galaxies), and ending in the dark energy dominated period. Attempting to extrapolate back before Act Two (one second after the Big Bang to the present day) is difficult because the the Friedmann relation dictates that the scale of the universe is zero and the density and temperature are infinite, the singularity. There are three issues with the current picture: homogeneity, inhomogeneity, and the flatness problem. The homogeneity problem is that the universe was very uniform just one second after the big bang and extended a light year across. But light cannot travel farther in a second than a light second. The only way to explain how a uniform universe existed one second after the big bang is to assume that the matter and radiation had been produced in a nearly perfectly uniform state. Next is the so called inhomogeneity problem which states that there must be slight variations in the density to allow for matter to clump under gravity and form galaxies. The variations have to match the observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The third is the flatness problem. Measurement of the CMB show that the universe is flat on large scale. This requires a perfect balance between expansion rate and energy density. Inflationary and cyclic models both try to solves these issues.The inflationary model assumes that the big bang was the beginning of all time. To account for the flatness of the universe, inflationary energy has specially tuned properties. The dark energy takes over to explain the current period of expansion. What if the big bang was not the beginning and dark energy could be integrated more effectively into the picture?Enter the cyclic model. The framework of the cyclic model relies on string theory. In essence, bits of string vibrate and rotate in specific quantized motions. Each quantized state has physical properties such as mass, charge and spin and can account for all elementary particles, including gravitons. In M theory, the Horava-Witten model uses ten dimensions of space and comes close to Einstein’s goal of explaining fundamental physics in a purely geometrical way. M theory has a so called, sixth regime involving branes not strings.The Horava-Witten picture can be simplified. Imagine two parallel sheets (really nine-dimensional sheets) separated by an extremely small tenth dimension. Although the sheets are nine-dimensional, six of the dimensions are expected to curl into a tiny ball and are important for describing the properties of matter and forces. Now the two sheets each have three dimensions (height, length, width). The observable universe lies on one of the sheets or membranes (braneworld) and it is separated from a second hidden braneworld by 10-30 cm. Apparently, colliding branes (big bang) have the right, nearly scale invariant (objects or laws are constant on different length scales) properties needed to fit the real universe. The cyclic model has six periods: The Big Bang. No infinities or singularities. Before the bang, space is flattened and has a smooth energy distribution because dark energy from the previous cycle has decayed.Radiation dominated epoch. The bang creates a smooth and flat universe, no inflationary period is needed. After a millionth of a second quarks combine to form protons and neutrons. At one second, hydrogen and helium nuclei begin to form.Matter dominated epoch. After 75,000 years matter takes over. The first atoms are formed at 380,000 years after the big bang, matter is drawn together and galaxies form. The epoch ends after around 9 billion years.Dark energy dominated epoch. Expansion accelerates and the universe becomes empty and uniform.Contraction epoch. Key assumption in the cycle model is that dark energy can decay after a period of around a trillion years, causing the deceleration and eventual slow contraction. Once contraction begins, the energy density rises quickly and gravitational energy is converted into a new form of high pressure dark energy and ensures that the universe remains smooth and flat during contraction.Big crunch. Dark energy is converted into hot matter and radiation and the universe expands. The universe was smooth and flat before the bang, so it remains so afterwards. High pressure dark energy solves the homogeneity and flatness problems.As an added bonus, the cyclic model also solves the cosmological constant problem. One possibility is that the constant begins at a relatively large value but decreases through tiny quantum jumps (tunneling through small energy barriers to states with lower and lower vacuum energy). This process takes an unimaginably long time to complete, for the constant to reach zero. “Our calculations showed that a patch of the universe would survive at least (1010)100 cycles at this last step”. The point is that the constant is much smaller than we expect because the universe is much older (much older than 14 billion years, having gone through who knows how many cycles) than we thought. This gives the constant ample time to decrease to the observed value today."
6,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51836314-kenneth-bachmann,3,"A very well written account of the evolving efforts to establish the theory of a cyclic universe as an alternative to inflation theory. Along the way it seems that great pains were taken to explain the operant features of the theory in terms that non-physicists could understand. I'm not sure how successful Steinhardt and Turok were in that regard, but I think they made heroic efforts to do so. I'm not sure how difficult this account of the cyclic universe might be to physicists and cosmologists, but it was a tough slog for me, and the best I can say is that I think I sort of get the gist of it. Certainly the symmetry of the cyclic model is somehow more uplifting than the uncertainties built into the inflationary model along with the depressing end of the universe predicted by the inflationary model. One feature of the overall cyclic theory that is perplexing is the apparent need for there to be two (2) interacting Branes. Why this number? Why not multiples of two or even infinite Branes? And of course, it seems as though the inflationary model comes closer to explaining the original cause of creation. The cyclic model explains the original cause of our observable universe, of course, but not the original cause of the elements that give rise to each big bang, namely the Branes themselves.As someone who learns somewhat more easily visually, I thought that the illustrations and cartoons were fairly lame, and not particularly helpful in illustrating how things happen in either of the two models.One of the nicest features of this book was the understated way in which these world class theorists repeatedly made clear that it will be years or decades before the world of physics and cosmology ultimately adopts the inflationary model, displaces it with the cyclic model, or finds another model altogether. They were very careful not to paint the cyclic model as a panacea for physics and cosmology.All in all, in spite of the heavy lifting required of non-physicist readers, the book was enjoyable, informative, and in some sense even spiritually uplifting."
7,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/237421-joe,3,"Endless Universe was good though a bit bothersome at times. I understand that, as competing theories, it is essential to point out the dissimilarities between the inflationary and cyclic models of the universe, but Steinhardt and Turok seemed like they were fighting their way out of a corner throughout the book — and they wrote it!Being in a defensive stance for most of the book also made some of their arguments seem petty. On p.222 they basically claim that the inflationary model spells the end of empirical science as if there is nothing else to discover about the universe if that theory ""succeeds."" It's just not true. Another issue I had was that the authors waited until almost the end of the book to elaborate on any flaws in the cyclic model, leaving me with some very obvious questions in the front of my mind throughout my reading. I know that you don't want to hand over a list of all your character flaws on a first date, but when it comes to science writing, not hearing the faults in a more natural progression was very distracting.Also, it was one of those books that elaborates on some pretty high concepts to paint a picture of a theory, but then goes on to define what an atom is in the glossary! Most popular physics books claim that no prior knowledge is necessary, but it's never true. If you don't know what an atom is, you probably won't understand anything covered in this book... and you are scientifically illiterate to an embarrassing degree.The authors ended the book on a very vague ""we'll see what happens"" note, so I figured I'd do the same: Endless Universe was a good read about some very interesting ideas that, frankly, I hope are right! The ekpyrotic (cyclic) model is a beautiful theory indeed, though no self-respecting scientist worth his weight in protons chooses a model based on neatness. Without resorting to the anthropic principle, it does make a lot of sense, but only space-time will tell!"
8,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2309246-cassandra-kay-silva,5,"A good review of the Cyclic Model, as presented by someone who helped develop it. I think it poses some strong arguments against the currently held inflationary model but was disappointed by the lack of mathematical explanation given. I still love this book. Even if they may turn out incorrect I love that they have challenged the conventional cosmological outlook as I think that is the nature of true science and discovery. "
9,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2479444-leah-hortin,2,"I feel like I need to preface this review with some context. I have a BS in Biology, I took exactly 1 physics class in college, a bunch of chemistry classes, and that's it. I struggle to grasp cosmology and astrophysics and metaphysics. Last year, I watched that Stephen Hawking biopic and enjoyed it but I still didn't ""get it"". It sent me down the rabbit hole of looking at ""cosmology for dummies"" on YouTube, trying to understand Dark Matter, trying to understand how the hell we are holograms on the edge of a black hole. (Like, seriously?) So I made it a bit of a mission this year to try to learn more and better my understanding. I ended up at OMSI and watched a Neil Degrasse thing in the planetarium on astronomy and cosmology. I liked it, but had even more questions. I knew it was just grazing the surface and I just. didn't. get. it. The museum shop has a bunch of books on cosmology - I took pictures of them, looked at reviews, and selected a couple to invest in in hopes of getting a better understanding. This book, Endless Universe, was the first one I picked up. It is beyond me. The principles are too advanced for me to comprehend. I would have moments of ""ahhhhha"" where they would explain something well, but then I'd be lost again in the next paragraph. It took me 6 months to wade my way through. I ended up just reading a couple pages a day to try to get through it because reading large chunks would send me into anxiety. Maybe I need to start in the kids section...That being said, I can tell this book was well thought out and they do offer a compelling argument for the cyclic model. I get that piece, on a high level. The details elude me though. But I gleaned enough to definitely raise my eyebrows questioningly at the current inflationary model. This book is now over a decade old and more WMAP's have come out - I would have loved to see an afterward added that discussed advancements since original publication. I cannot in good conscience give a glowing review merely because my comprehension level is so extraordinarily low. I did find the history of theory progressions very interesting, and the straw example of extra dimensions did stick with me. "
10,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46930862-durgaprasad,4,"The book discusses the two theories of formation of Universe, the inflationary theory and the cyclic theory and analyse the plausibly as to which theory will gain traction. Written in a language, which is easy to understand but at the same time not bare of technical aspects, the book also deals with various theories of Universe which have been considered in the past by renowned scientists, including the Big Bang theory. It also analyses Einstein’s concept of cosmological constant in the context of the cyclic theory, which itself has evolved out of the ekpyrotic theory of Universe. A worth read, for the beginner as week as the well versed."
11,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12788229-christopher,3," I picked up this book because the title intrigued me. Its over a decade old at this point, and if anything the assertions made here are less likely to be true than they were then, but it is fun to see how the debate about cosmology unfolds. The theory argued for here is the ""cyclic model"" as opposed to the ""expansion model."" Its a really interesting idea, but relies on M theory, which itself is very controversial. "
12,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60680330-brian-keating,5,"Fantastic overview that is, unfortunately, still relevant. An excellent review of modern cosmology, including the debate between proponents of inflation, and those of its opponents, who back the cyclic models. What is depressing and unfortunate is that cosmologists are no closer to resolving the debate more than a decade after the book was written. Oh well...the authors suggest we will know in less than 88 more years so that is something to look forward to. "
13,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8738605-claire,4,"I have tried to read this book once before. I am not sure about the exact details.My high approval rating comes from how these two scientists brought me closer to understanding a subject I have not done as well with as I would have preferred.I will read this book again, very likely, but I am not sure when."
14,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18436842-mark,5,"Excellent read. Fascinating, complex concepts that potentially reflect the nature of reality.

17,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84876015-shrungi-bhatt,5,"Extremely intriguing, following this topic!!"
18,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20412671-ross-nelson,4,"I came to this book after seeing a video of Steinhardt lecture on the topic. Because it's targeted at a general audience, it sometimes comes across as a sales pitch for their theory which is sort of annoying. On the other hand, that argument that there inflationary model has to continuously be tweaked and patched is a reasonable argument for looking at alternatives. Their cyclic or ekpyrotic model also depends on string theory, and they could have included more discussion of the requirements that the models create w/r/t one another. On the white, however, a fascinating idea. "

20,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93990-ashley,3,"I found this an accessible, even-handed book for general audiences about a very compelling competing theory to the standard model of the universe (i.e. inflationary theory, big bang, etc). Although I think the weaknesses of the standard theory are quite glaring, Steinhardt and Turok handle these weaknesses with a great deal of respect. I found myself challenged in areas of the book that discussed what are foundational aspects of cosmology (no matter how many times I read the section on the scale-invariant spectrum, I couldn't figure it out). I do think it was perhaps a little too light in terms of proof. Not that I'm a math mind by any stretch, I still would have liked to have seen some of the underlying math concepts that support the element of the cyclic theory that has the branes coming together. The authors mention the math for this element of the theory is still in developmental stages, but what, if anything, supports it? I forgot to mention when I first posted it the coolest thing. Last year, scientists on the BICEP experiment at South Pole claimed to have found, definitively (five-sigma), proof of b-modes, which would mean the end to Steinhardt and Turok's dream of a cyclic universe. The world of science was abuzz--this was an intensely important moment. However, at the time, Steinhardt counseled caution (http://www.nature.com/news/big-bang-b...), that the findings could be misleading, perhaps clouded by cosmic dust. And, in fact, nearly a year later, this seems to be exactly what happened down there: http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/n... The BICEP scientists have pulled way back from their announcement of proof of b-modes in the CMB, and therefore the cyclic model is still on the table. I cheered. "
21,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/843957-stuart,5,"From p. 222 - ""If the inflationary landscape model is to be believed, science has now reached the limits of what it can ever explain. Many basic properties of the universe, for example, the dark energy density, are just accidents and will never be predicted with any precision. Instead, they must be accepted as facts of our own peculiar situation in the ""multiverse"" of possible universes. The cyclic hypothesis leads to a far more optimistic outlook for fundamental science. According to this view, the universe is a single, coherent entity that exists in a stable cycling state whose properties can eventually be understood as a consequence of the basic laws of nature.""For myself, I prefer the cyclic theory to the inflationary theory (though I don't understand the math to have a real say) for a few reasons. I agree with the authors that a theory that posits infinite parallel universes seems to spin out of control, hinting that it may not be valid. If all variations of physical reality exist across the multiverse, it seems the laws of physics don't mean much. A complicated, patchwork, all-of-the-above theory would be disappointing to Einstein and others. I also have a problem with the Big Bang creating something out of nothing, it smacks of religion. The cyclic model potentially cycles back into the past and forward into the future forever. Lastly, I like the idea of the universe evolving like life does, like stars do. I'll be interested to see if the theory tests out and becomes the dominant paradigm. "
22,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5025818-edward-canade,3,"So if you are curious about cosmology and need to update your basic understanding of particle theory, this might be a good book to satisfy that curiosity and bring insight into the stuff of the universe. It's a small book but packed with information that will stretch the average reader's comprehension of scale and time. This book is bucking the current most widely accepted view that the universe started with a singularity, the Big Bang 14 billion years ago, and is now overtaken by dark energy that will lead, in a trillion years, to a ""vacuous oblivion."" The cyclic theory of the universe holds the universe to be much older, going through multiple big crunches and expansions each lasting a trillion years.One of the big problems with the book is that it was written a decade ago and that predates the CERN Large Hadron Collider experiments and the discovery of gravitational waves by the PLANCK Satellite. So, it's in serious need of an update. But still got me caught up on a lot. I still thought space was curved. "
23,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6372492-doug-dillon,5,"When the authors titled their book Endless Universe, they meant just that--ENDLESS. And in the subtitle, they reinforce their thesis by using the words, Beyond the Big Bang. What they are proposing that there are multiple, and even parallel universes to be exact, that collide periodically, thus creating ""endless"" numbers of Big Bangs and ""endless"" new universes out of all that destruction.This really is a new theory about our cosmic origins based upon particle physics, superstrings and astronomy. But don't worry, the authors not only explain all this in clear terms, they have also included a number of graphic examples that makes things less complicated. An excellent glossary is available as well as a solid list of books For Further Reading. A detailed index helps make finding things much easier.Yes, this is an even stranger outlook than quantum physics itself but one that ""strangely"" seems to make sense."
24,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8921719-jeffrey-mckinley,5,"I have read this book several times. In fact, I used the concept in my own recently published novel Somewhere Between Sacred & Common as the theory proposed by fictional scientist Robert Pershing. When I became an atheist I still struggled with the concept of a beginning: How did something come from nothing? Perhaps I was still infected by the assumptions drilled into my head while indoctrinated by fundamentalist piffle, but this book gave an alternate way of looking at the Big Bang. Of course it depends on the validity of String Theory which, while being mathematically consistent, it is still unproven and therefore merely a hypothesis. For those interested in investigating the big questions, I highly recommend this book. If you're like a simpler explanation crouched in a gripping romance-thriller, try my ebook Somewhere Between Sacred & Common (Damnable Heresies Book 1) by Jeffrey McKinley."
25,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59252999-roo-phillips,4,"Steinhardt and Turok have an interesting story to tell, and the tell it well. They do a great job of explaining the prominent theory of inflationary cosmology (right after the big bang the universe went through a massive expansion period in an instant and then slowed down), how it works, why it's generally accepted, but also its underestimated pitfalls. They then propose an alternative to big bang theory called the ekpyrotic (conflagration) universe. This theory invokes string theory to predict a recurring (cyclic) universe of big bangs and big crunches. Predictions from this theory are testable, and it has passed those tests, but so has inflationary cosmology. But there are future tests that will probably kill one of these two models, or open the door for new ones. This is what makes this book so interesting. It is written at a time where answers are sparse, but filling in as time goes on. I recommend it for anyone interested in the evolution of our universe."
26,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33972372-ko-matsuo,4,"This is a mildly technical exposition of theoretical physicists and their theories behind an oscillating universe. Steinhardt and Turok draw broadly from general relativity, cosmology, string theory, and quantum physics to postulate that dark energy becomes the driving force to stretch and flatten branes thus creating the energy to enable multiple big bangs, and thus the basis for an ever oscillating universe. Feels hip because it uses recent WMAP (Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe) data.Geeky, nerdy, and definitely not accepted by mainstream theorists (the inflationary universe being the most accepted theory), the authors bring light to concepts that still may be outside of science to completely figure out - theories and processes that require trillions of years to replicate. Fascinating none the less."
27,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1453295-john,4,"This book points out some of the problems with inflationary model, and describes the less well-known cyclic model. The cyclic model posits that ""big bangs"" occur regularly, as two parallel branes (from M theory) oscillate back and forth along another dimension, periodically colliding and creating all the matter and radiation we observe in the universe. Neat! However, the book was written eight years ago, and one of the authors (Steinhardt) has admitted that if the recent BICEP2 results that show evidence of gravitational waves caused by inflation are confirmed, then the current variant of the cyclic model will be disproved. Too bad, because I kind of liked it.Overall, it was an enjoyable book that provided me with a much better understanding of both the cyclic and inflationary models."
28,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55694997-edwin,5,"Endless universe is a really good book for some who wants to know about the universe, the theories, the hypothesis, and everything that composes it. For example the Bing Bang and how maybe it wasn't just an explosion. The author of this book introduces every topic to something relate-able to the reader since they're very complex topics. I really like how the author develops the books because he makes such topics easy to understand, and I think it also depends on the authors taste, since not everyone likes things related to the Universe and it's complicated ways. I would recommend this book to someone that wants to learn about this, but the reader must be really interested on this since this might be boring to certain audience. "
29,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15078897-ryan-young,3,"it is interesting to reflect that the big bang theory of the creation of the universe has so many unanswered questions. while the alternative 'cyclic' theory presented in this book relies way too much on speculation, i enjoy the reminder that we really don't know yet what happened. what will it mean for humanity if we ever do find out? the difference between the eventual heat death of the universe and a new bang a trillion years hence does not seem to matter much to a species whose very solar system will not last another 10 billion years. but i hold out hope that some of the cosmological discoveries waiting for us will impact humanity in a positive way, maybe give us purpose. i refuse to believe that more understanding is a bad thing."
30,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/319148-eliot,4,"The authors describe their cyclic universe theory, which is an interesting alternative to the inflationary big bang picture. In describing their theory, they also detail the traditional inflationary model for a comparison, and as it turns out, the two theories coincide on essentially every observation that has been made to date. Fortunately, they make different predictions that may soon confirm or strike down either of the theories.It would be nice if I knew something about string theory, and I don't know what kind of clout the idea carries in the scientific world, but the cyclic universe is more philosophically palatable than the inflationary big bang model."
31,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,2,"The authors are a little self centered, dedicating lots of time to explaining their own personal journey. Also, the book tells a rather one-sided account of the story, even playing the conspiracy card more than once! The first half of the book dangles the cyclic model like the plot of a mystery novel, which is frustrating, I kept yelling at the book to get on with it! The science of the cyclic model is NOT explained very well. I was made very uncomfortable by the digression into coincidental points of view found in Greek philosophy, Hindu religion, the Old Testament, and even a science fiction story by Isaac Asimov. Religion in my science book, yuck!!!"
32,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/602550-ron,4,"There are legitimate alternative theories to the Big Bang theory of the universe. Steinberg and Turok posit many big bang making the universe much older than the big bang theory allows for. Using quantum physics and the idea of ""branes"", they think that the ""branes"" bump into one another periodically in a big crunch that generates another big bang which then creates another universe with many/most of the same properties that we know in this one. Readable and understandable. They do a good job of illustrating how scientific theories are created tested, adopted or abandoned."
33,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61943-tamara,3,"Started off good enough. Pretty easy to understand and all that. Then it started having maps/photos/charts that weren't labeled and explained. They were discussed in the text, but I only realized that on the few pages that I fully understood what was being discussed. And then the language got a bit too technical for me. It would still be good reading for those who's technical expertice isn't expert, but is higher than mine..."
34,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2221534-brie,3,"Overall an interesting read. Many parts of the book are quite technical, and way more than I could grasp. But it was interesting to see their theory, the cyclic model, against the current favored theory, the inflationary model. They basically contend that the 'big bang' was not the beginning, but one in a series of bangs our universe has and will experience. But it's considerably more complicated than that."
35,0385509642,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34285875-jovany-agathe,5,"This book is about the ekpyrotic model for the evolution of our universe. It states that about every trillion years or so our universe recycles itself.As the authors say in their glossary ""ekpyrosis: a collision between two branes that produces a flat, expanding universe filled with matter and radiation, with a nearly scale-invariant distribution of density inhomogeneities."" It is a competing theory to the better known inflationary model of the universe."
