0,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,1," FUTURE SCHLOCK(If you loved ""Future Shock"", and ""The Celestine Prophecy"" changed your life, this is the book for you)But, wait! All those 5-star reviews gotta count for something, right? Well, let's take a look. ""We will have the requisite hardware to emulate human intelligence with supercomputers by the end of this decade."" Really, Ray. How's that coming along? You've still got a year, two if we're charitable. But, even despite the spectacular vagueness of the claim, things are hardly looking good.  ""For information technologies, there is a second level of exponential growth: that is, exponential growth in the rate of exponential growth"". A breathtakingly audacious claim. Without a scintilla of evidence provided to justify it. Graphs where the future has been conveniently 'filled in' according to the author's highly selective worldview do not count as evidence, and are nothing more than an embarrassment. But then, most of the graphs in this book do not bear up under close scrutiny - their function is more cartoon-like. Even Kurzweil's more apparently reasonable claim - that of exponential growth at a constant rate - rests on a pretty selective framing of the question and interpretation of existing data.  ""Two machines - or one million machines - can join together to become one and then become separate again. Multiple machines can do both at the same time: become one and separate simultaneously. Humans call this falling in love, but our biological ability to do this is fleeting and unreliable."" Say what now?From a technical standpoint, as far as biotechnology is concerned (which is the area I am most competent to judge), there's hardly a statement that Kurzweil makes that is not either laughably naive or grossly inaccurate. Assuming that, indeed, drug delivery via nanobots and the engineering of replacement tissue/organs will at some point become reality, Kurzweil's estimate of the relevant timeframe is ludicrously optimistic. A relevant example is the 20 years it took to derive clinical benefit from monoclonal antibodies -- the rate-limiting steps had little to do with computational complexity. So the notion that, in the future, completely real biological, physiological, and ethical constraints will simply melt under the blaze of increased computing power is fundamentally misguided. From a statistical point of view, things are no great shakes either. His account of biological modeling is such a ridiculous oversimplification it defies credulity. I'd elaborate, but frankly, the whole sorry mess is just starting to irritate me. Given the density of meaningless, unsubstantiated, and demonstrably false statements in the first few chapters, it's hard to see the point in continuing. If one actually reads carefully what he's saying, and assumes that he is assigning standard, agreed-upon, meaning to the words he uses, then several possible reactions seem warranted:* that sinking feeling that one inhabits a universe that is completely orthogonal to those who gave this a 5-star rating* heightened skepticism and aversion to Kool-Aid* bemusement at the gap between Kurzweil's perception of reality and one's own - in particular, the evident moral vacuum in which he ""operates"", as well as apparent ignorance or indifference to the lot of the vast majority of the planet's inhabitants* wonder at the sheer monomaniacal gall of the manGrandiose predictions of the future, the more outlandish the better, appear to have an undiminished appeal for Homo sapiens. For the life of me, I have never been able to figure out why."
1,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17744555-blackoxford,3," Imminent Metaphysics The subtitle contains the entire thesis: an expectation that machines will allow human beings to escape the limitations of their physical bodies. This contention has been called ‘daring,’ ‘optimistic,’ ‘arresting,’ ‘really out there,’ ‘outrageous,’ ‘terrifying,’ and above all just ‘big.’ And certainly the idea that a machine can be linked to a brain to form what is effectively a new species is certainly that: Big. But in terms of bigness (as Trump would say) it’s a sideshow and not the main event. It’s just that the main event doesn’t sell nearly as many tickets.Of course human beings already have transcended much of their biology long ago. Kurzweil’s own analysis in this and his previous books demonstrates this fact repeatedly. Humanity in its various sub-species did so through the core technology which he recognises as the source of just about all advances in human well-being and dispersion around the planet:  the technology of language. It is language which permits both complicated and large-scale cooperation among individuals, and which allows experience to be codified and stored over generations. It is language - in the form of self-learning code - which is the foundation of the machines which Kurzweil envisions will be linked functionally to human brains in order to form a new sort of mind, a kind of Leibnizian monad, essentially disconnected from the world of its fellows, talking to itself in its own increasingly idiosyncratic language.But there is an issue, or rather a central fact, of our current situation which Kurzweil ignores. Language is not the invention or the possession of an individual. It cannot be patented as a technology; it cannot be controlled in its development (despite the Academie Francaise and high school English teachers); and it requires a rather large population who implicitly assert its usefulness and right to survive. Language is a collective endeavour. Although it is a technology, it is not a machine. And, fatally for Kurzweil’s thesis, language has already freed the species Homo sapiens from the constraints of strict biology eons ago. It did so as a collective endeavour not as a connection between an individual human being and a machine.Kurzweil (along with many others) are myopically fascinated by electronic machines and their coding. This is understandable. Machines are visible to everyone. They can be touched and measured and improved. They are the emblem of progress in industrial (or post-industrial) society. Language on the other hand is amorphous. It is visible only in its use, and then just barely as language-users habitually substitute things for words. Machines work; when they don’t they can be repaired. Languages work as well, but when language goes wrong, no one knows quite what to do about it. Machines may be complicated and their coded routines complex; but they are predictable in their operation even if surprise is the prediction. Language is largely a mystery; no one knows if it’s hard-wired in our genetic makeup or acquired randomly.It is important to keep in mind that both machines and the human brain are shaped by language beyond their coding or genetic character. Certainly some genetic mutation in the history of our species allowed the transition from mere signalling to complex language-based communication. But from that moment (or evolutionary epoch), language transcended every individual who used it. Language was a communal technology or it didn’t exist at all. And it was the technology that allowed everything from cave painting to the Library of Congress. Language, that non-biological miracle of human existence, influenced genetic development itself, initially by setting rules about who could mate with whom, more recently through gene therapy. So if there is a ‘singularity’ in our immediate future, it is not one of biological transcendence. It may, however, be one of a complete submission to the dominance of that which we have arrogantly presumed is our instrument. What Kurzweil describes is indeed a new species, perhaps one with an unlimited intellectual potential and an indefinite but very long lifespan. But this is a species whose entire world is language. It will have no other experience except in communication with other specific language-users. The species will not have transcended language, it will have been absorbed into it. The new species will be one entirely constituted by language. His book is  “... predicated on the idea that we have the ability to understand our own intelligence—to access our own source code, if you will—and then revise and expand it.” As Kurzweil says, the world formed by this new species with the altered source code will be peaceful; conflict will be about words, only in words. Greed will be unnecessary; words are infinitely abundant. Culture will flourish; words underpin not just technology but writing and arts of all kinds. The needs of our composite machine/brain existence - fuel, food, climate control - will be catered for. All the rest of our emotional, sexual, and aesthetic needs will be supplied by the language of our coding, which will pursue its own evolutionary path, presumably at an accelerating rate.As I have pointed out elsewhere, Kurzweil’s vision is superficially similar to that of Teilhard de Chardin’s ‘noösphere.’ (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...) Teilhard first used the term in his  Cosmogenesis  of 1922. Very much like Kurzweil, de Chardin adopted an evolutionary approach in his theological philosophy: the ‘geosphere’ of dead matter evolves the biosphere of living things, which generates the noösphere of pure reason. It is human cognition, that is to say, language, which is the driving force for the transition from the biosphere. Increasing complexity and consciousness creates a ‘layer’ of thought encircling the earth.The difference between Kurzweil and de Chardin is that the phenomenon of the noösphere for Teilhard is communal. It emerges and is sustained through the interaction of minds not through the isolated, algorithmic cogitation of new kinds of minds. And Teilhard’s minds are not absorbed into the language from which they are constructed. The key relationship among minds for Teilhard is love, essentially existence for the sake of the other. That is, not for the sake of language as implied in Kurzweil’s vision. Rather, Teilhard’s vision is of what he calls the Omega Point, a state of perfect mutual regard and care. This state is not one of subordination to language but to each other through language. The evolution of language in that direction does not result in a transcendent new species living next to the old Homo sapiens, but in an entire society which transcends itself. Kurzweil, it occurs to me, is at heart an aesthete rather than a technologist; and his aesthetic is highly questionable.This is all a matter of practical metaphysics, our imagining of that which lies beyond language. For most of modernity, by which I mean since the industrial revolution, metaphysics has been a field derided as philosophical self-abuse. The importance of all of Kurzweil’s work is its demonstration that metaphysics is an important social science. I understand his use of advances in electronic technology as a focal point. Among other things, it sells. Nevertheless, the significance of his own analysis is not about the new composite mind, it is about the relationship among minds and how these relationships can develop a world which is imminently liveable not transcendentally detached. This is a moral not a technical issue. I don’t know the answer to the situation he describes. But I think Teilhard has some good alternative suggestions."

3,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,1,"This starts with the thesis: Technological change is exponential!This has been true for many measures such as micro-processor size, cost of mass-produced goods, etc.It is not, however, a general rule of thumb to apply blindly to all things ""technological""!This seems to be Kurzweil's big mistake.He extrapolates features of technology to an unrealistic infinity.For example, Moor's law is running up against the quantum limit, so micro-processor size is exponential up to a fast-approaching limit.To take another example, the cost of an iPod may drop exponentially as you scale up production, but you can only sell so many iPods.Once everyone has an iPod, you read a production limit, and the price becomes stable.The major claim in the book is that brains will merge with computers.Kurzweil argues that since transistors are faster than neurons, they will make better brains.The fallacy here is that you would ever WANT to build a brain out of transistors in the first place!Neurons can network widely at a low price, but wide networks of transistors are slow and costly in power and heat.No engineer would try to build a brain out of transistors.The lesson here is that biological evolution, while it's scope has been limited, will ALWAYS win in a contest with human engineers.The better your artificial brain performs, the more it will look like a human brain.This is not coincidence.One important point made in the book is that our only problem need be to produce an intelligence greater than our own. Once this is accomplished, all other tasks can be up to that greater intelligence. While this is absurd applied to most practical problems like baking a cake, it makes some sense in the realm of AI. Here I disagree with Kurzweil, who asserts any such improved intelligence would be ""non-biological"". Heck, many parents achieve this goal by giving their child a good education!Another thing he gets right is the demystification of Searle's Chinese Room thought experiment. Searle's objection to an artificial brain is wrong. Mind is platform-independent, but the port is yet to be written.Ray makes the same tired arguments over and over, redundantly redundant.You can almost hear him TRYING to keep alive his delusional dream of living forever!It's sad.Ray argues that a future AI will be produced with the ability to iteratively improve its own intelligence.Among his many skills, he's an accomplished software engineer, so he should know better.This will never, ever happen in this millennium.Even if we assume computing resources increased by a dozen powers of ten.Even if we ""reverse-engineer the human brain"" (whatever that means).I know this review is getting long, but he does make some speculations about the year 2010, most of which never came to pass. He predicts we will have virtual assistants that can look-up movie actors, etc. that will respond to our vocal queues in virtual vision contact lenses. Instead, we have Wikipedia on our iPhones. Pretty far off the mark, if you ask me.By far the most annoying thing Ray brings up no fewer than 10 times is that the speed of light may be ""circumvented"". I swear, there's nothing sacred to this man! He embarrassingly bungles an explanation of quantum entanglement, calling it ""quantum disentanglement"" and mistaking spin axis for wave function phase. Yikes.This book is a big house of mirrors meant to disguise the lunacy of the thesis.Don't get me wrong, the mirrors are interesting to look at in their own right:Nano technology, genetic engineering, genetic algorithms, neural networks.It's fun stuff!But the singularity is not near, it is the delusion of an old man who would like very much to live forever."
4,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani,4,"The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology, Ray KurzweilKurzweil characterizes evolution throughout all time as progressing through six epochs, each one building on the one before. He says the four epochs which have occurred so far are Physics and Chemistry, Biology and DNA, Brains, and Technology. Kurzweil predicts the Singularity will coincide with the next epoch, The Merger of Human Technology with Human Intelligence. After the Singularity he says the final epoch will occur, The Universe Wakes Up.Kurzweil explains that evolutionary progress is exponential because of positive feedback; the results of one stage are used to create the next stage. Exponential growth is deceptive, nearly flat at first until it hits what Kurzweil calls ""the knee in the curve"" then rises almost vertically. In fact Kurzweil believes evolutionary progress is super-exponential because more resources are deployed to the winning process. As an example of super-exponential growth Kurzweil cites the computer chip business. The overall budget for the whole industry increases over time, since the fruits of exponential growth make it an attractive investment; meanwhile the additional budget fuels more innovation which makes the industry grow even faster, effectively an example of ""double"" exponential growth.عنوان: تکینگی نزدیک است: زمانی که انسان فراتر از ذات خود می‌رود؛ نویسنده: «ری کورزویل»؛تکینگی نزدیک است: زمانی که انسان فراتر از ذات خود می‌رود؛ یک کتاب غیرتخیلی، نوشته شده توسط مخترع و آینده نگر «ری کورزویل» در سال 2005 میلادی است، که درباره ی «هوش مصنوعی» و «آینده ی بشریت» است. این کتاب بر مبنای ایده‌ هایی است، که در کتاب‌های پیشین «کورزویل»: «عصر ماشین‌های هوشمند (1990 میلادی)»، و «عصر دستگاه‌های معنوی (1999 میلادی)» ارائه شده‌ است. با این حال، اینبار، «کورزویل» از اصطلاح «تکینگی» استفاده می‌کند، که توسط «ورنر وینچ» در مقاله ای در سال 1993 میلادی، با عنوان «تکانگی تکنولوژی آینده» بیش از یک دهه پیش، مورد استفاده قرار گرفت؛ «کورزویل» در این کتاب، قانون «افزایش شتاب» خود را توضیح می‌دهد، که پیش بینی کننده ی افزایش سرعت، پیشرفت انفجاری، در فناوری‌هایی همانند: «کامپیوتر»، «ژنتیک»، «فناوری نانو»، «رباتیک»، و «هوش مصنوعی» می‌باشد. در «هنگامی که تکینگی اتفاق بیفتد»، «کورزویل» می‌گوید، که هوش ماشینی، بینهایت بیشتر از هوش مجموع تمام انسان‌های جهان خواهد شد. پس از آن، ایشان پیش‌بینی می‌کنند، که هوش به خارج از سیاره، جریان پیدا می‌کند، تا آنکه هستی را اشباع کند. «تکینگی» همچنین نقطه ای هست، که هوش ماشینی و انسانی، با هم ترکیب می‌شوند. ا. شربیانی"
5,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6638317-jill,3,"Realists beware: this oversized pill is seriously hard to swallow. ...but.Possibility 1: Kurzweil Is NutsI used the term 'batshit crazy' more than a few times while speeding through this book (N.B. I think I ended up reading more than I skimmed, but many of the lauded 2005 advancements are less impressive 9 years later -- which is, of course, part of Kurzweil's point). ""Dude, seriously? The ultimate destiny of the universe is to be shaped by humanity?! Right, okay, by the time we colonize the stars, our exponentially-increased mechanical intelligence will fully remove human fallibility. We will be perfect because we're smart. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME.""Here's the major problem with Kurzweil's argument -- ASIDE FROM several more niggling, specific concerns [i.e. the sort-of-embarrassing obsession with longevity & immortality (320...and so many more); the lack of appreciation for the human body as a full system (200, for example: ""not everything is contained in the brain but who cares we only need the brain!"" uh, what?); the assumption that immediate gratification supersedes all else (313); the comparison of current computer viruses with hacking into a human body (you fucking kidding me bro?); more and more.]: He never takes into account that HUMANS FUCKING SUCK. SERIOUSLY, GUY. a) You mention but never deal with the fact that ""much of human thought is petty and derivative"" -- well, if we have MORE time, MORE technology, how will that be abated in any way? Having my Android with me at all times makes me stupider, I am absolutely sure. I use that thing for games and movie times -- NOT to supplement my intelligence -- and I'm not even a worst-case-scenario. How will suddenly having technology at our fingertips suddenly make us more intelligent? Huge leap. Huge. Having a large hard drive doesn't mean it's filled to capacity.b) So to have any hope of gaining intelligence from these advances, we (as a species) need to be critical. We need to reflect. While Kurzweil devotes [fairly] significant time to the philosophical issue of consciousness, he never mentions critical thought or reflection -- and he certainly never mentions the fact that the majority of people [I say this as a teacher, not a misanthrope] don't actually engage in it without a push. Problem is, if we are not UNIVERSALLY CRITICAL, and we are given all of the technological possibilities scattered through the book, we will not only waste them -- but probably destroy ourselves in the process.c) And when I say destroy, I really fucking mean destroy. Kurzweil's faith in humanity is sort of humiliating. Everyone will suddenly have access to this technology? No. The wealthy and the greedy will enhance themselves before it trickles down, and that will not be used to positive ends. Though Kurzweil devotes time to the potential dangers of 'strong AI,' I'd think that the real dangers will come long before that BECAUSE PEOPLE SUCK. This tech will be controlled so that it does not reach the masses (and if you believe the western world is living in democracy, Ray, I have some land in Florida for ya...), and it will be used inappropriately before it gets there. And when it DOES get there, you think we're going to suddenly use it for noble, intellectual pursuits? Buddy, we're gonna be dressing up in virtual reality to fuck our latest celebrity crush. Humans have never, as a group, been upstanding representatives of all that is good.And what about animals? What about our ecosystem? What about the SOLAR SYSTEM AND UNIVERSE? Why are you so immediately dismissing these things as secondary to 'human destiny'? In Kurzweil's argument, human intelligence -- amplified by machines -- will essentially become god and that's our right and privilege. Sounds a bit like 19th-century imperialism to me, sir.Might wanna check yourself there.Possibility 2: Kurzweil Is a Smart MofoYou know those scientists you see in TV shows that, by the power of fiction, have extensive knowledge of every scientific discipline even though they should really only understand problems relating to physics? Kurzweil kinda reminds me of those guys. His scope is extensive (or ""startling"" as the New York Times reviewed). His references are heavily documented. He has credentials to back up many of his less-lunatic thoughts. And, much of his point is well-taken: we cannot imagine what the next 100 years will look like. I don't know if I agree with all of his predictions, but the essential premise is valid -- if we don't destroy ourselves/our environment beforehand, we will be living in a completely new world. There's no way, at this point, to stop progress.I have to admit, even as I was shaking my head -- wouldn't it be crazy if, in 2045 when the Singularity is supposed to occur, Kurzweil was right? Wouldn't it be cool to have read a book that would become a technological prophecy, required reading, back when you actually had to read and not download books into your brain it actually was a prophecy? I'm not inclined to blindly believe anything I read -- so I think Kurzweil got to me, with all his documented examples, at some point or another. For a minute, every now and then, I believed the possibility. There's something to his explanation, if not the argument proper.Possibility 3: This Is a Sci[-fi] NovelI first found out about Ray Kurzweil because of a Canadian alt-rock band, Our Lady Peace, who put out a concept album based on Kurzweil's book The Age of Spiritual Machines in 2000. That book, which I read in 2009, was more literary than this one: with an understanding of form and language, characters, almost beautiful, at parts. But there is something inherently present in Kurzweil's writing that lends it, inexorably, to artistic inspiration. It reads like possibility, like a novel, and I can see why it is tempting, inspiring, creative. So perhaps, as/if you take on the behemoth, seeing it from that perspective is the best one. Accept the ridiculous premise that humans are essentially good. Suspend disbelief, as you would for a good sci-fi novel. More than anything, I think, The Singularity Is Near is a thought experiment -- and for all that, it's not a bad one."
6,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/206483-dj,5,"I would consider this an 'impact book', one that truly changed the way I perceive the world. Kurzweil aims to convince his reader that we are on the cusp of an exponential growth in genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics (GNR) that will fundamentally change humanity, creating humans that are fully integrated with machines, live as long as they like, and frequently immerse themselves in virtual worlds. Its premise sounds a bit far-fetched but his meticulous research, incredibly broad grasp of current research, and history of success in predicting technological growth are surprisingly convincing. The book can be repetitive as Kurzweil feels the need to offer each and every criticism a full rebuttal, frequently reusing the same points, and to repeatedly explore the same concepts in various scenarios. If you can get over the repetitiveness, accept the fact that some of the science of this book will probably go over your head, and allow yourself to be open to the possibility that Kurzweil's futurist predictions might actually be feasible, this book will introduce you to an incredible new world, decades before you actually meet it."
7,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1639329-erik,3,"The Singularity, if you’ve never heard it, is a term given to a theoretical point in the future when our technology will have become so advanced (compared to today) that it becomes impossible to see beyond it or understand its ramifications.For example, try to imagine a person with an IQ of 200. Not that difficult. Empathy is still valid at that point. The thinking of a 200 IQ person is qualitatively similar to that of a 100 IQ person but scaled up: faster, sharper, wider, deeper. A 200 IQ person would still use his human flesh to navigate the world and would still use our languages and institutions. He might struggle with loneliness. He might experience love. Now try to imagine an entity with an intelligence equivalent to an IQ of 10000. Impossible. Would it – could it even – be housed in a human body? Such an intelligence would certainly have no more use for human language than humans have for the chirping of birds. We have as much chance of understanding this 10000 IQ intelligence as an ant has of reading Shakespeare.And yet we can understand and ponder the steps leading up to the development of this super-intelligence. This is the task that Ray Kurzweil attempts with The Singularity Is Near, and the picture he paints is certainly an intriguing one.In Kurzweil’s vision of the (not so far) future, we have transcended our mortal coils. We’ve moved beyond genetic mastery wherein we use tools like CRISPR to edit out the flaws in our genetic code. We’ve moved beyond nanobots in our blood, which are capable of capturing sensory input and motor output to immerse us in a virtual reality that is indistinguishable from the real. Instead, we’ve shed our weak flesh to merge with (and become) immortal machine super-intelligences, spreading through the solar system, the galaxy, and then the universe in a quest to reach ever new heights of knowledge, art, beauty, and creation. And through this all, claims Kurzweil, we maintain our humanity.Pretty grand! But how realistic? Will this vision of the future come true?Put simply: yes. True enough, Kurzweil’s time-frame is almost certainly too optimistic and the steps along the way will probably turn out different than he imagines, but the end game? The singularity? This vision of ever increasing intelligence and complexity? Barring catastrophic human destruction, self-inflicted or otherwise, is there ANY reason to doubt it? It is a completely indisputable, unambiguous statement to say that the history of our planet is one of escalating intelligence/complexity and that the history of human civilization is one of escalating technological and scientific advancement. Meanwhile history is full of breakthroughs skeptics claimed were impossible: Europeans crossing the Atlantic ocean, heavier-than-air flight, space flight, nigh-instantaneous world-wide communication, the elemental analysis of ultra distant stars and galaxies, etc. In 1934 Albert Einstein wrote, “There is not the slightest indication that [nuclear energy] will ever be obtainable. It would mean the atom would have to be shattered at will.” Mmhmm.Even the numerous ultimately FAILED endeavors or companies that Kurzweil cites don’t render his general claims dubious. At one point, I estimated roughly 80% of the companies or technologies he was citing had since failed. Seems a slam dunk case against his predictions. In fact, the opposite is true. His “Law of Accelerating Returns” suggests that companies fail and arise at ever-increasing rates. Consider the solar power industry:I recently undertook some research in various solar power companies with the aim of investing in their stock. I have little doubt that solar power will play a major role in the future of power generation, if just because solar power follows the general trend of decentralization that seems to be happening in so many industries. Even so, after my research, I opted not to invest in any stock. Why not?Because no solar company seemed a particularly good bet. Here’s the problem: A solar company will create (or acquire) a new process or method for more efficient and/or cheaper solar modules or cells. So they build a new factory (or retool an old one) to manufacture these new solar cells, a rather expensive investment. This puts the company, momentarily, in the lead. Consumers, corporations, and governments buy their stuff. However technology is advancing so rapidly now that before this company can earn back its expensive investment, some other better solar product reaches the marketplace. Everyone switches to this new product. So the first company goes bankrupt and a new company acquires their expertise and technology and eventually puts out a newer, superior product. Thus the wheel turns.So while the solar industry as a whole is progressing, no single company has yet to truly dominate the field, as Google has done with search engines. And I, at least, can’t predict which one, if any, will.Point being, when looking at broad predictions of the future, we can’t let day-to-day or even year-to-year chaos and setbacks obfuscate the overall path. We must try to see the forest, despite the trees, and Kurzweil seems to do a decent job of this.Nevertheless, I wasn’t a huge fan of The Singularity Is Near. Now I certainly learned *a lot.* This book inspired me to do outside research on a slew of topics including wormholes, genetic engineering, the phases of clinical trials, and much more. And yet, the book as a whole lacks humanity. It explores these visions of the future without ever truly exploring how they will affect humanity – at the visceral, emotional, dramatic level of individuals. Kurzweil’s writings were less engaging than they might have been because they rarely afforded me the opportunity to hypothesize upon what I personally might do, when faced with future ethical questions. In fact, the overall feel of the book is that it’s less about communicating with me as a fellow human being than it is about Kurzweil organizing his own thoughts and evidences on the matters he wishes to write about.Such a lack is ironic because Kurzweil seems very concerned with countering the notion that our humanity might be lost when we escape our corporeal bondage. He finishes the prologue with a quote from Muriel Rukeyser: “The universe is made of stories, not of atoms” and the actual last line of the prologue is: “This book, then, is the story of the destiny of the human-machine civilization, a destiny we have come to refer as the Singularity.”If this was truly his intention – to tell this story – then I would say Kurzweil singularly failed.So, some good, some bad. That much for the book review. To finish, I want to try to succeed, in at least one tiny area, where I feel Kurzweil failed. I want to talk about immortality and what it’ll mean to you and to me, personally.The year is 2060. I am 75 years old. My parents are dead, as will be many of those reading this right now. My nephews who are 5 and 6 years old right now will have become grown men, almost 50 years old themselves, maybe with kids of their own. At 75, I am extremely healthy. Not as spry as I am now, but like all those who can afford it, I undergo routine age extension treatments. The world government, which speaks English as the lingua franca, is constantly debating whether such age extension should be ‘nationalized’ but as yet it is not and the biomedical company that provides these treatments is the wealthiest company in the world and has a name as recognizable as that of Google.Speaking of, Google has far transcended its early century roots as a mere search engine. It is a massive artificial general intelligence whose intelligence is well-documented to be quite beyond even the smartest unmodified human, who is on average 5 to 10 IQ points smarter than today’s human, given ubiquitous and routine pre-natal gene therapy techniques.When I wake up in the morning, I say to Alexandra, my own personal household AI, more family than slave and also one of my best friends: “Alex, you there?”“Yep,” she says. “Wondering what’s going on with the immortality debates?” “You know me,” I reply.She sighs dramatically. “Lord what fools these mortals be!”I laugh in agreement. “Mmhmm. Show me.”Alex turns on the debates – held in a virtual building of course – regarding the impending immortality treatment. The world is vastly more peaceful than it ever used to be. Superior medicine and therapy techniques have reduced the effect of mental illness, while increased prosperity and education have slowly eroded the last bastions of fundamentalism, crime, and irrationality. But of course, it is not all gone, as the vociferous debates demonstrate it. Immortality at our fingertips… and some still reject it.Because, of course, they must. Immortality is one of my favorite topics to bring up to my students, and I’d say that, on average, more students REJECT the idea of immortality than embrace it. Their reasons include many objections: overpopulation; that being immortal would be “boring”; or that death gives us meaning or otherwise motivates us. Rather abstract objections. I encourage them to try to think of immortality not as some idea far out in the future but as an imminent issue requiring real, practical decisions.Consider a person in my above setting. He’s 110 and dying and there are no more technologies to stop it. What will HE think about these debates regarding immortality? Are they, in some sense, tantamount to murder? What must it feel like to WANT to live forever, to be so near, and be so afraid that you’ll miss your chance by mere days or months? Or consider that man’s wife, who may have been married to him for eighty years, and who does live long enough to avoid death.I’m particularly interested to see how religious people will respond to the real possibility of immortality. Will they REALLY choose to die – so that they might enter heaven? Some might, but I doubt most will, no more than Christians who get cancer today concede, “Welp guess this is God’s will. I’ll let myself go.” No of course not. Most fight tooth and nail to live. And how will the Pope and other religious leaders respond to this? How will they re-interpret their various holy books to account for this change in mortal fortunes? Consider fundamentalists who WILL choose to die rather than choose to be immortal. That’s their choice, okay, sure. But what if they choose it for their children? What if immortality involves maintaining a neural and genetic backup and some fundamentalist parents refuse to let their children maintain such backups – just as many parents now refuse to let their children be vaccinated? Is this child abuse? Is this murder? Do we FORCE it? Will those same people who are so against abortion suddenly go from “pro-life” to “pro-death”? [Hint: Yes they will, though it won’t be called ‘pro-death.’]Where will YOU stand on these issues? Will you stick by your religious beliefs and take the gamble for an eternity of post-death paradise? If your honest answer’s no, what does that say about your beliefs now? If your answer’s yes, then will you teach the same to your children? If some accident happens and they die, what will you tell yourself? How will you deal with the guilt? And in a broader sense, will you vote for politicians who run on anti-immortality, pro-death platforms, knowing that such might deny us non-believers the chance to extend our lives and the lives of those we love?What if, say, becoming immortal meant becoming permanently sterile, either for biological reasons or as part of a government-enforced agreement to deal with potential overpopulation? Is that an acceptable trade for you?Or will you take the opposite tack? What arguments can you make to convince those who are anti-immortality? How will you deal with the pseudo-science they will inevitably find showing that the, say, consciousness transfer technology doesn’t REALLY work? That it’s been shown that the copy persona isn’t ACTUALLY the original persona? Will you test out your supposed new immortality by undertaking daring and fatal stunts, like leaping from a plane with no parachute, just so experience what it’s like? Or will you be too fearful and consider the idea utterly foolish, if not disrespectful?Such conundrums – and the drama, humanity, bravery, hate, and love associated with them – constitute the real story of the topics that Kurzweil brings up. Perhaps I am asking for too much to have wanted him to try to capture all that in his non-fiction book. Luckily, science fiction offers a wealth of stories which do explore such drama. Just from my own collection:Paolo Bacigalupi’s short story Pop Squad focuses on the conundrum of immortality & sterility/population control.In Richard Morgan’s very noir Altered Carbon, a rich man commits suicide, and his backup hires a detective to figure out why.The second of Arthur C. Clarke’s three laws is stated thus: The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible. Kurzweil’s book, and man himself, for all their faults, is a daring adventurer who does just that. He deserves at least a little applause.[This review is part 2 of a small AI-focused reading study I undertook. The first book I read and reviewed was James Barrat’s Our Final Invention. The next book is Oxford Philosopher Nick Bostrom's Superintelligence]"
8,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1224909-trevor-jones,1,"Perhaps I will revisit this book and its subject matter relatively soon, let me just say that not long after reading parts of this work I definitely count what is called ""transhumanism"" to be the ""World's Most Dangerous Idea"". Perhaps if someone could explain to me these concepts in terms of why a human being with a shred of moral responsibility would even be slightly interested in pursuing the goal of much of what is discussed herein, I might reconsider my judgment. Perhaps if what is discussed herein were not just canards for genocides of the future, I could evaluate Kurzweil's thought from something of a more neutral standpoint. Perhaps if the word and idea ""Intelligence"" were not framed into a narrow, technocratic and mechanized field of mere computation and servile specialization, instead of a holistic and cross-disciplinary humanism that seems to be rarer these days, I might think Kurzweil and similar Silicon Valley powermongers were actually formulating plans to improve human happiness and welfare with their prognostications on A.I., biotechnology and genetics. Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps. But assuredly this is the world's Most Dangerous and Most Frightening Idea in a single tome. Why write science fiction dystopia books anymore? We are already living in one. "
9,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5179711-ken-badertscher,2,"The Singularity Is Near by Ray Kurzweil: dislike it (2/5)Too optimistic, too wacky, too wrong.The full title of this book is “The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology,” and like its title, the book is verbose and very, very speculative. I know, I know. What should I expect from futurist Ray Kurzweil other than futuristic foo from the future? How about a book with a coherent structure? How about a book that doesn’t repeat its fundamental premises multiple times in each chapter? Maybe a book that leaves out a few unsupported theoretical assumptions stated as foregone conclusions? Singularity has a few fascinating passages, some really interesting ideas, and a collection of delightfully eclectic quotes. Sadly, all the good stuff is surrounded by a repetitious screed with nearly as much substance in the footnotes as in the text.Kurzweil starts off on the wrong foot with some wrong predictions for technological advances to appear “by the end of the decade.” Given that the book was published in 2005, and as I write this it is 2011, we should be able to fact-check some of these predictions. “We will have the requisite hardware to emulate human intelligence with supercomputers…” Nope. “Computers… will become essentially invisible: woven into our clothing, embedded in our furniture and environment…” Nuh uh. Yes, lots of smart devices exist now, but wearable computing turned into the smartphone, and pervasive computing isn’t all that pervasive. There’s also a claim that the Web will become the “worldwide mesh… once all of its linked devices become communicating web servers….” The only real approximation of this is botnets, created with malware and harnessed by malcontents. While a few impressive networked computing projects currently exist, most folks still don’t give up their CPU’s background cycles to anything productive.After a rocky start predicting the near future, how are we expected to follow along as Kurzweil turns us into mind linked cyborgs with nanobot blood who can merge and reform our identities at will? One example: virtual reality. Over and over again we are reminded that we will soon be using fully immersive virtual reality. “By early in the 2nd decade of this century” we will have fully immersive 3D environments beamed into our eyeballs, and shortly thereafter we will be plugged in using devices that directly stimulate our sense centers in the brain. But who is going to build these environments? Are we doomed to socialize using virtual meeting places as bizarre as Second Life, furries and ambulatory vegetation and penises everywhere you look, only with more fidelity than we can currently imagine and plugged in to our brains? Who wants that?There’s a lot more way-out-there stuff I could bring up from the book, but that’s really not its worst failing. The thing that bothered me most about it was the repetition. It’s almost as though Kurzweil at some point abandoned a reasoned thesis for truth by repetition. He goes on and on again and again about how we will know the brain’s inmost secrets, and how nanobots will solve ecological problems, and how superintelligent sentient machines will treat us wetware humans with respect and care. It’s all very Pollyanna, and in some cases more than a little disturbing. Kurzweil’s vision of the ultimate goal of humanity is a nanobot swarm with superintelligent AI flying at near the speed of light and colonizing wherever it lands without regard for existing life of any kind. If that’s my future, I want out."
10,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5022445-john,2,"Can this book ever get to the point? Is there a point? In the future, when machines begin to express human discernment and burn books, I'm sure this endless and gigantic tome of wordy lists and nerd-spooge will be set alight, or edited towards readability. Either is fine with me. I would love to read the executive summary of this, but this book is too long."
11,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7308397-morgane,2,"A lot of the technology he talks about is undoubtedly cool, and I do believe it'll happen. Scientists WILL create a lot of these things, for sure. But the issue I have with the book is how naively optimistic it is about this technology being readily available to everyone. He briefly touches on this criticism, and his argument is: while it's true that there's a lot of inequality in the world, even poor rural people in China have cellphones, so everyone will have [nanobots in their bloodstream, VR headsets, whatever].Ah... yes. Everyone has cellphones. Even refugees in Europe have cellphones. They also don't have access to real education (sorry, online MIT lectures don't count), reasonable housing, healthcare... We can't even get these basic needs down, but hey, we all have cellphones.The whole thing was so starry-eyed and came from such a privileged perspective that it was hard to take seriously. He glossed right over how capitalism throttles progress; he thinks that, since these technologies are cheaper and cheaper to make, there's no issue in making them accessible. As the recent EpiPen scandal has proven, it really doesn't matter if your tech only costs pennies to make. If you can still charge whatever you want for it, then no, it's not going to be widely accessible. He ignores cultural and psychological attitudes towards tech, too. He imagined something like Google Glass being invented around now, and he was right. Google Glass exists. It's also extremely weird to use and was largely seen as a joke. Or his idea that we'll have sex in VR and it'll be just like the real thing. Do I even need to explain how... no, it won't be? So overall, yes technology is amazing and yes I'm sure a privileged few will get access to all this stuff, but if this book taught me anything, it's that we need more diversity amongst futurists and more perspectives when discussing humanity's fate."
12,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/772467-dan,5,"Kurzweil has made a living of being a futurist and an inventor. Many of his inventions are the result of his predictions coming true, so there is good reason to listen to what he has to say on the topic. The main idea is that the evolution of technology is not linear (as most people think) but exponential. This exponential development of key technologies leads to dramatic changes in human history over relatively short periods of time. Good examples include the internet and cell phones. The book focuses specifically on 3 key technologies that will produce the human ""singularity"", an event where humans transcend their former selves and become something more than human. These key technologies (known as GNR) are genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics (or artificial intelligence). When these 3 things progress and converge in the next few decades, we will see humanity benefit by eradicating disease, prolonging life expectancy indefinitely, and promoting human intelligence to astronomical levels through direct neural connections to computer hardware. Effectively, we'll become so smart we'll be able to outlive and outhink ""normal"" humans to an unimaginable degree. He makes a compelling argument that the singularity is not a matter of ""if"" but of ""when"", and that we should be proactive in pursuing these technologies, not just for the benefit of humanity, but to keep amoral people from exploiting these things to an unfair advantage. It's a fascinating read and worth digging into if you have any appreciation for science in general. "
13,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3452713-cody-sexton,2,"Ray Kurzweil postulates that we are fast approaching a time when humankind will meld with technology to produce mind boggling advances in intelligence. He calls this future time period The Singularity, which is a term he borrowed from physics, in which the pace of technological change will be so rapid, it’s impact so deep, that human life will be irreversibly transformed. In other words, ""technology will be the metaphorical opposable thumb that enables our next step in evolution.""But as Paul Davies writes in Nature about The Singularity is Near, “it’s a breathless romp across the outer reaches of technological possibility"" while warning that the ""exhilarating speculation is great fun to read, but needs to be taken with a huge dose of salt.""This book should not be read as a scientific treatise. Rather, it is a futuristic book of technological optimism limited only by our human imagination.In the book Kurzweil characterizes evolution as progressing through six epochs, each one building on the one before. He says the four epochs which have occurred so far are Physics and Chemistry, Biology and DNA, Brains and Technology. Kurzweil predicts the Singularity will coincide with the next epoch, which would be The Merger of Human Technology with Human Intelligence.He even predicts that this future intelligence will actually radiate outward from the planet until it has saturated the entire universe.Kurzweil says that evolution moves towards ""greater complexity, greater elegance, greater knowledge, greater intelligence, greater beauty, greater creativity, and greater levels of subtle attributes such as love"". He says that these attributes, in the limit, are generally used to describe God. That means, he continues, that evolution is moving towards a conception of God and that the transition away from biological roots is in fact a spiritual undertaking.This is perhaps the best known book related to transhumanism which is a zealous type of utopian thought underwritten by the belief that day by day we are getting closer and closer to building a better human.Transhumanists believe we can make ourselves. But, as Thomas Ligotti says, “this is impossible,” and the reason its impossible is because of evolution. “Evolution made us. And everything we have done since we became a species has been a consequence of being made. No matter what we do it will be what we were made to do. One of those plans seems to be the dream of transhumanism which may just be a plan to unmake us.”Transhumanists are dissatisfied with what we are as a species. Naturally they think that being alive is all right so much so in fact that they cannot stand the idea of not being alive and have envisioned strategies for staying alive forever. Their problem is that they need being alive to be vastly more all right than it is.An apocalyptic scenario has even been inserted into their world view like a wild card, which they refer to as the Singularity. In this sense, transhumanism is a secular retelling of the Christian rapture myth, and some of its believers even foresee it as happening within the lifetime of many who are alive today, just as the early Christians believed in an impending Judgement Day.Yet one possibility transhumanists have not wrestled with is that the ideal being standing at the end of evolution may deduce that the best of all possible worlds is useless, if not malignant, and that the self extinction of our future selves would be the optimal course to take."
14,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65714-noah-m,5,"Ray Kurzweil suggests that exponential trends in information technology will usher in world changing revolutions in Genetics, Nanotechnology and Robotics. By the year 2040 there will be little left of our biological intelligence. Eventually, once we have harnessed the maximum computational capacity of matter, we will expand out from our solar system. He believes that there will be a way to circumvent the speed of light, so pretty soon we're going to be a universe spanning intelligence.So we will be god. And then perhaps we will create a new universe, to run a new program. And the cycle starts again, I suppose.If you haven't read enough science fiction, this all sounds completely insane. However, having examined his arguments, and having a general sense of the sort of progress being made in Genetics, Nanotech and Robotics, I feel that his prognostications are, on the whole, accurate.I see no reason why aging can't be conquered before the year 2020. Assuming trends in miniaturization continue, I don't see any reason why we won't have mastered nanotechnology by the end of the 2020's. I find myself less willing to accept that human level artificial intelligence will arrive in the 2030's, but I do consider it an inevitability. So, since we conquered aging in second decade of this century, we'll get there eventually.I mostly accept Kurzweil's analysis of the trajectory of technological progress. To be fair, his book is sometimes a bit light on evidence to back up some of his claims. There are a few examples for each topic, and he tends to use them over and over again.However, all his ideas are firmly grounded in reality. On a long enough time-line, there is no reason why nearly everything described in this book cannot be accomplished by humanity. Whether you accept the time frame that he endorses is up to you, but you have to acknowledge that he is writing a book about the likely shape of the future, be it near or far.Additionally, I would add that my acceptance of Kurzweil's thesis can probably be attributed to several factors:1) The internet rising to prominence during my formative years has given me a very real sense of the world changing possibilities of technology.2) I've read a shit-ton of science fiction, and I've certainly read about futures more bizarre than what he describes.3) It provides me with some measure of hope for the future. If the world isn't going to drastically change in the next forty years then we, as a species, as well and truly fucked. No one has any interest in solving the problems of the future. They'd rather fuck things up now, and let future generations deal with the fallout. Only a general acceptance of accelerating change will force people to consider the future consequences of decisions we make now.4) I want to be able to morph my genitals at will and have crazy zero-gravity sex in virtual reality. IS THAT SO WRONG????"
15,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12973215-danny-tyran,4,"I'm not sure to be the right guy to review such a book. Why? I'd lie if I told that I understood everything Kurzweil explained in it. O.K. the author tried hard to make it more understandable: he put as much as possible in graphs and statistics, pictures, examples of the ordinary life and so on. All these tools should help us to understand, but... this is still a book written by a nerd for nerds. And don't you know that graphs and stats lie? Furthermore, in French we say: ""Comparaison n'est pas raison"". It means that's not because you give great examples that seem to justify what you're saying that you're right.Anyway, sometimes this book seemed to me like a plate of spaghetti. There are a lot of theories (noodles) from many different sources, some true, some questionable, and they are so much intermingled that you can't tell where one ends and the other begins. And on top of that, Kurzweil adds his own theories (sauce) that cover everything, so we are not able to really distinguish on what he exactly based his statements. But maybe, the problem is not Kurzweil's wordiness, maybe it's just me. I'm not a nerd in genetics, nanotechnology, computing, and robotics. Who, except Kurzweil, can pretend to possess an extensive knowledge on all these subjects anyway? Even for an avid reader of science blogs and scientific magazines, there are parts hard to read in this book. But the papers I usually read in magazines are much shorter and more simplified than the content of this dense book.DESCRIPTIONKurzweil characterized evolution throughout all time as progressing through six epochs, each one building on the next. He said the four epochs which have occurred so far are Physics and Chemistry, Biology and DNA, Brains, and Technology. He predicts the Singularity will coincide with the next epoch, The Merger of Human Technology with Human Intelligence. After the Singularity he says the final epoch will occur, The Universe Wakes Up.Law of Accelerating Return in summary:Kurzweil explains that evolutionary progress is exponential because of positive feedback; the results of one stage are used to create the next stage. a) human intelligence creates technologyb) technology is growing fastc) technology is now beginning to improve human intelligence (computing, biotech, neuroscience, etc.)d) this creates a positive feedback loop, exponential in natureKurzweil is not the first to suggest the idea of accelerating change - it's been stated in varying forms since the 60's by folks like Buckminster Fuller. But basing his thesis on the well-known ""Moore's Law"" - computing power will double every eighteen months - Kurzweil shows how computer processing capacity will soon outstrip that of the human brain. Once that transformation is achieved, it will be a short step to enhance existing technology to reforming the human body.Singularity:""We are just now obtaining the tools sufficient to begin serious reverse engineering (decoding) of the human brain's principles of operation. We already have impressive models and simulations of a couple dozen of the brain's several hundred regions. Within two decades, we will have a detailed understanding of how all the regions of the human brain work.We will have the requisite hardware to emulate human intelligence with supercomputers by the end of this decade and with personal-computer-size devices by the end of the following decade. We will have effective software models of human intelligence by the mid-2020s.""""In the aftermath of the Singularity, intelligence, derived from its biological origins in human brains and its technological origins in human ingenuity, will begin to saturate the matter and energy in its midst. It will achieve this by reorganizing matter and energy to provide an optimal level of computation... to spread out from its origin on Earth.""Predictions:Kurzweil is very optimistic. He believes that dramatic advances in GNR (Genetics, Nanotechnologies, and Robotics) are inevitable; any resistance by governments, ethicists, or individuals are automatically calculated into his predictions. So he has no qualms on setting a date for the completed Singularity: 2045. By that time, he claims, we would have completely reverse engineered the human brain (meaning decoded the brain and recoded it in machines), and would be leveraging non biological intelligence a billion times more powerful. We would be able to change or upgrade any part of the human body; our DNA will be transformed to make us unable to catch major diseases; we'll have ""nanodoctors"" inside our bloodstream that will improve our health from within. Thus we would be able to practically live forever (if we are still alive by then). Kurzweil is also confident that other serious issues confronting humanity such as poverty, hunger, energy shortage, global warming and so on will be easily solved by the power of technology. Most of the solutions seem to depend on Genetics, Nanotechnology, Robotics (GNR) supported by Artificial Intelligence (AI). With autoreproducing nanocomputers, nanobots, nanotubes, other nanotechnologies and inventions. And by ""the power of ideas"" (according to the author, there is an idea to solve any problem if you think hard enough) every hurdle will be easily surmountable.Here are some of the arguments he bases his predictions on:* Software are getting exponentially more complex* Hardware are getting cheaper* Our understanding and modeling of the human brain is getting better and betterHe focuses on the good impacts of technology, such as:* Technological innovations will allow the disabled to see, hear, and walk if they so choose (it remembers me some well-known prophet)* New ""toys"" as immersive virtual reality* End of illness* Radical life extension* Economic benefits* Freeing humans from workAnd some of the scary impacts:* New ""toys"" as immersive virtual reality* Nanorobots for the military that make it possible to kill anybody anywhere with complete precision* Destruction of the biological basis of humans and uploading one's brain on the computer (unclear how it will be done and how voluntary this will be)* Legal rights for artificial intelligence machines* Genetic engineering of babies (people who will not subscribe to this will 'evolve' out of the way)* Failure to understand the social consequences of new technologies is like playing with fire* A nanodefense immune system to protect the biosphere from the dangers of self-replicating nanobots (why this is scary is that an improper use of the immune system itself can destroy the entire Earth biosphere in a matter of hours)* Merging of human and machine (not determined if ""human"" is the result our complete genetic or the result of the functioning of our brain)* There will not be any technological magic wand to help us with these possible problems.Note that I put ""new toys"" in the good and the bad impacts because it could seem ""virtually"" fun, but I don't want anybody to become a part of the ""Matrix"".A few personal questions:If we got nanochips in our brain and the technology improves exponentially, how many times are you ready to be operated to get the last technology? What will happen if futuristic hackers succeed to control all those in-brain chips? What will happen if terrorists succeed to remote control our nanobots (nanoweapons, nano-aircrafts, nanomissiles and nanowarriors,...)? With the possibility to control remotely everything, there are no borders anymore, so who will legislate on those topics?Before ending, just a little joke. J. G. Ballard, a great science fiction author wrote: ""If enough people predict something, it won't happen.""Conclusion:It's hard to believe that this book was written 8 years ago. It still reads like a cutting-edge science book. Whether we agree with Kurzweil or not, this book is an intellectual feast and an absorbing read. Example, there are great discussions as to when computers will become indistinguishable versus humans (Turing test). If nothing else, the book is dynamite to any reader who likes to ponder the future and technological changes. So I give it four stars."
16,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7311271-julie-capell,5,"If I could give this book 10 stars I would. I am a big fan of scifi with some slight understanding of and interest in the Singularity for quite some time. So when I saw this book at a friend’s house, I asked if I could borrow it and I am so glad I did. This is one of those books that has the potential to forever change the way you think about life, the universe and everything. And no, the answer is not “42.” In this book, Kurzweil, who has the credentials to back up what he is writing about, examines the rate of advancement of human technology and predicts that within the lifetimes of most people alive today, human beings will unite their biological intelligence with machine intelligence and create a whole new way of being human.  The beginning of the book is chock-full of graphs showing the exponential growth curve that describes the advancement of technology and its concurrent tendency to get cheaper as it gets better (while extremely wonky, most of this section is pretty easy to understand and reads quickly). Taken together, these two concepts drive Kurzweils’ pronouncement that very soon—within the next few decades—“the pace of technological change will be so rapid, its impact so deep, that human life will be irreversibly transformed.” Transformed how? In pretty much every way imaginable.There is a chapter that analyzes the amount of computation and memory needed to achieve human levels of intelligence in machines (computers). There’s a fascinating chapter on how to reverse engineer the human brain—which will require us to understand our own thinking. I was already familiar with some the concepts in this chapter from having read the book “The Most Human Human” (which I also highly recommend). Understanding our own thinking is not easy but is key to our ability to create machines that can pass as human (Turing Test). The next chapter discusses the revolutions that are occurring right now in genetics, nanotechnology and robotics (which Kurzweil calls “GNR”). There are enough ideas in this chapter alone to fuel a thousand science fiction novels. Yet most of what is described is already in the works in labs around the world. In the final chapters, Kurzweil takes everything he has posited thus far and shows where it will lead. He discusses the search for intelligent life in the universe, the Fermi paradox, the theory of multiple universes, black holes, quantum entanglement, the speed of light, how we will likely colonize the universe (probably NOT using our biological bodies), how we know something is conscious, and the nature of God, among many other things. If you are getting the feeling that this is an ambitious book, then I have done a decent job of describing it, but there are truly so many fascinating ideas in here that you must read it yourself. I haven’t even gotten into the large section in which Kurzweil responds to his critics by examining concepts like software stability, intelligent algorithms, analog vs. digital processing, quantum computing, the digital divide, materialism vs. patternism and more. This section repeated many concepts that had been touched upon earlier in the book but revisiting them from a different angle definitely increased my understanding. This book was so good that the minute I finished it I wanted to immediately start it over again. This book was so good that after I returned my borrowed copy I went out and purchased my own copy so that I can refer back to it as I would a reference book. This book is so good I want to give it to everyone I know. What more can I say? Read this book. I was going to say it will blow your mind, but that’s not quite right. Instead, I’ll say this book will open your mind to the truly amazing future that is just around the corner.The answer is 2045. I’ll be eighty-four. And the adventure will be just beginning. "
17,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,4,"I love Kurzweil, love most of this book, and would read anything he wrote. However, if you have time for only one Kurzweil book, I would strongly recommend How to Create a Mind over this book. Kurzweil is one of my favorite writers because his predictions are a result of his deep understanding of both the current state of technology and the timing of various technological advances. This is evident in How to Create a Mind. In this book however, Kurzweil's desire to live forever is clearly clouding his usually superior prediction skills. Dying sucks. I get it. Life saving technological advances are around the corner and knowing it will not come in time to save his life makes it all the harder to get old. His motivation to be overly optimistic about medical advances is very clear throughout most of this book. I am not saying the advances of which he speaks will not happen. Indeed, I feel very confident they will, just not in the timeframe he suggested. If you take his extended life time with a grain of salt, then this book deserves 5 stars. "
18,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1780231-tracy-black,1,"First I have to admit that I only made it to page 50. If Krurzweil redeems himself later in the book, I guess I'll never know. I was expexting more because so many very intelligent people I know have read it and loved it. He seemed to be cherry picking history to fit his ideas, that technology is advancing exponentialy and has been doing so since the dawn of civilization. I don't agree with this. I know that it is advancing rapidly right now, but it has also done so at other times in the past and has back slid more than once in our history. What clinched the one star is when he went farther back and applied it to biology. I don't know how he defines complexity (he didn't say) but this is wrong. And evolution is not ""the process of creating patterns of increasing order"". He is oversimplifying very complex topics to fit his ideals. He undermined his credibilty, so I won't be finishing the book. "
19,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,4,"I've been familiar with Ray Kurzweil's ideas for many years, but oddly enough had never read one of his books. My first exposure was in 2000 with the release of Spiritual Machines, an album by the Canadian Rock band Our Lady Peace featuring tracks of Kurzweil's voice intoning technological predictions along with songs based on ideas from his book The Age of Spiritual Machines. Track 3, ""R.K. 2029"", posits monotonically: ""The year is 2029. The machines will convince us that they are conscious, that they have their own agenda worthy of our respect. They'll embody human qualities and claim to be human, and we'll believe them."" That album and its thought-provoking songs exploring issues like ""How many parts you can replace and remain human?"" inspired me to read more by and about Kurzweil. The 2009 film Transcendent Man is a great look at his life and work, and I got to see him speak live a couple years ago at SXSW. Kurzweil is a fascinating figure: an optimistic futurist with legitimate chops as a pioneering inventor and a so-far impressive knack for predicting technological trends. His inventions, such as early optical character recognition, text-to-speech devices for the blind and real-time digital avatars have reflected his interests in using technology to supplement, enhance and mimic human behavior and intelligence. Google has hired him as their Director of Engineering. He comes by this passion honestly, and I loved finding this clip of 17-year-old Kurzweil in 1965 demonstrating a computer he'd programmed to write music on a Steve Allen program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4Nei....The Singularity is Near is a fantastic primer on the major fronts of technological development, and what we can expect to see in the future of computation, machine intelligence, energy, biology, space travel, virtual reality, consciousness and so forth. The singularity of the title is that treshold point at which machine intelligence matches humanity's (Kurweil predicts this will happen by 2045). At that point, the machines will not only outpace us, but will do so at a rapidly expanding rate, using their greater intelligence and processing speed to further improve their own capabilities ten-fold, then a hundred-fold, and so on. Exponential growth is a key concept in this book, and Kurzweil points to this as the basic feature missing in others' failed predictions. He explains in great detail how an exponential trend, like Moore's observation that transistor density doubles about every two years, combines a number of smaller, overlapping curves as one innovation builds upon another and another. He walks us through future innovations we can expect that will continue and amplify the trend: carbon nanotubes and quantum computing are two such technologies that will carry us far into the future. Kurzweil never stops there: he asks how much computation is physically possible for an object of a given mass if we can truly harness every motion of its constituent particles.Kurweil applies this same analysis to energy production, and explores how much power we might potentially harness from the sun to fuel this expanding computation (there are even ideas for energy-neutral computation that reverses each calculation), and extrapolates beyond to how we might potentially fully capture the energy output of the sun and other stars and put them to use. He pictures a future in which intelligence lights up in the universe, and all matter contributes to the storage and processing of information.Biology is another frequent topic, and we get a glimpse of how improved ""GNR"" (genetics, nanotechnology and robotics) will allow us to re-write our genomes, deposit microbots in our blood stream to eradicate disease, vanquish cancer, and extend our lives indefinitely. Meanwhile, we will integrate machines into our bodies, and they will enhance our senses, memories, capabilities, ability to learn, and redefine what it means to be human. Kurweil is notoriously at war with death, and takes a massive host of daily pills and supplements (one of his fringier pursuits) in order to stay alive long enough to reach the day when he can back up his intelligence to a computer substrate. In the meantime, he collects massive boxes of his ideas, mementos and memories.All of this might sound pie-in-the-sky, but I think Kurzweil deserves to be taken seriously. These are extraordinary predictions, but we must remember that science and engineering have already achieved many marvels that we enjoy already. I wish I could find the exact quote, but at some point he defines engineering as our ability to find a subtle effect, isolate it, and harness it to do work. Our discoveries are cumulative and their pace will be... well, exponential. Our bodies already have amazing restorative powers, but those will eventually be enhanced to the point at which we can control every aspect of them. Our computers have increased in computation speed while decreasing in size and power consumption. These trends will continue until we learn to integrate them with our biology. This work is already well underway.The Singularity is Near is punctuated with little discussions between Ray and characters like Molly 2004, Molly 2104, Charles Darwin, Sigmund Freud, and other thinkers who toss around various thoughts on meaning, identity, eternity, and other concepts. Like an episode of Steve Allen's Meeting of the Minds, these discussions provide Kurzweil a chance to explore differing viewpoints, timescales in his predictions, and perhaps deflect some criticisms. There is a fair amount of effort expended in responding to many of Kurzweil's critics, and this book feels part of a larger dialog. And yet, it is self-contained. Though it was written in 2005, the issues remain relevant and the predictions seem to be holding up well.As a phrase, ""The singularity is near"" reads like something you'd find on a doomsday prophet's sandwich board. There are many religious overtones to be found, because technology is expanding into areas that were once only the domain of theology. The powers once attributed to God will finally become real, but will be achieved technologically. Kurweil is warning us about a much different future than the doomsayers. It's bright future, with visions based not on revelation, but on evidence and extrapolated trends that obey the laws of physics (none of his predictions require us to exceed the speed of light or develop perpetual motion). Certainly, he may be overly sanguine about some specific technologies that may not pan out the way he so confidently posits. Yet other technologies, perhaps ones we're not aware of yet, will arise to continue these trends. It's an exciting future, and I hope to live to see much of it."
20,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20465190-g-g-galt,5,"This review is from: The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology (Kindle Edition)Ray Kurzweil is a brilliant inventor, writer and scientist who has more than earned his reputation as the best-known futurist in the world today.The last time I saw him was on television in 2012 speaking at a spot on the Super Bowl. You or your parents may remember him when he first appeared as a boy genius on a major television show before the world had any idea of the impact computers would make--others will recall how he made a grand piano sound realistic, and the work he did with Stevie Wonder--doctors will remember the device he invented to make transcribing their notes easier.Back in 1998 I was first introduced to Dr. Kurzweil at the Harvard Coop Bookstore in Harvard Square. On the main floor in a big center display, I discovered his newly released book, ""The Age of Spiritual Machines."" I went back to my dorm and read it cover to cover over the weekend. On Monday, excited about the book, I shared it with my meta-physics professor, who'd heard about the book. He recommended I read a critical review by John Searle. From that article I learned Ray's book was controversial. It still is, even though most of his many predictions and theories have come true.I corresponded with Dr. Kurzweil to get help with my Meta-Physcis Class. Shortly thereafter, I got a message he and his family were at the White House attending a New Year's Eve party for three hundred people. It blew me away that he had taken the time to e-mail his friends New Years greetings along with pictures of what had just happened --President Clinton awarding him the ""Inventor of the Year"" award from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the 1999 National Medal of Technology.For any who may not know, that is the highest award the President of the United States can bestow upon individuals and groups for pioneering new technologies.Shortly thereafter, President Clinton presented Kurzweil with the National Medal of Technology in recognition of his development of computer-based technologies to help the disabled.In April of that year following lunch and an interview for my final meta-physics paper, Dr. Kurzweil gave me a tour of his Brookline facilities. There he graciously allowed me to demonstrate my most recent invention--the forerunner to what was soon to become the world's most popular guitar-like product.Just how much of what Dr. Kurzweil predicts in ""The Singularity Is Near"" comes true, no one knows, but there's no denying, much of it already has. Whether an individual is a person of faith, or not, the predictions in The Singularity Is Near, can provide comfort that modern technology can eventually bring peace and prosperity to the world. And even, eternal life. We'll not only get new hearts and lungs, but any body part imaginable--that one day, it'll be difficult to distinguish where being human ends and a being a robot begins.Bottom line, this book does an excellent job of arguing that the evidence offered by Moore's Law is better than other forecasting methods. It does equally as well at explaining the implications of those trends. Best of all, anyone can pick up this book and understand it. You don't have to be a scientist to understand or appreciate what he writes."
21,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5159920-max-de-freitas,1,"This weighty volume is based on a simple observation. Technological progress mimics the exponential growth of reproductive processes in nature. Examples abound but are redundant because most result from applications of exponential growth in microprocessor manufacture. Kurzweil does not understand the underlying principle that technological progress is exponential only when developments spawn further advances. Failures and dead ends are conveniently ignored. Technologies can stagnate and become extinct just as species do in nature. Boundless, unquestioning optimism and blind faith are not scientific.I had expected a scientific examination of exponential growth technologies and some way to identify future trends that might merit investment. Instead I found pseudo-scientific rubbish sprinkled with fanatic ravings interspersed by some real experimental conclusions in the author's areas of expertise.While the book contains some interesting history, there is no intellectual foundation for any sound prognostication of the direction of future exponential growth technologies. One is left with the author’s opinion and speculation."
22,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8811289-correen,4,"This was my second attempt at reading this book. I seemed daunting and dull at first glance but was fascinating on audio. Kurzwell is a noted scientist, as he calls himself -- a singularitarian. Specifically, his studies include how humans will transcend biology and incorporate (or be incorporated by) technology. He notes how the process has begun and at the accomplishment of singularity, enhanced humans will have the advantage of extensive memory and processing skills as well as corrected DNA. The exponential progress in technology will have brought about massive changes in wellness, energy sources, problems solved, and exploration of the universe. The book seems fantastical but Kurzwell not only makes predictions, he tells what it will take to make the predictions possible to accomplish."
23,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8802499-marco-santini,5,"A great inspirational book. Genetics, nanotechnology, robotics and artificial intelligence will be the driving forces of a never ending, finally non-human, progress. Technological-evolution will lead to the singularity in a few decades, since the law of accelerating returns will make technology progress at an exponential rate. Cerebral processing power will be surpassed, DNA errors corrected. Human technology will merge with human intelligence, giving rise to transhumans and posthumans, populating the whole universe. The idea of the universe waking up is powerful. Everything described here has a great final scope and will become reality within this century. "
24,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/199033-tyson,3,"It's been a few weeks since I read it and the details are already fuzzy - he provides a lot of examples and detailed explanations to back up his thesis. I skimmed through several paragraphs in a couple of the chapters because it gets pretty boring. But Kurzweil's main predictions are at times mind blowing, scary, difficult to buy into. Kurzweil - who supposedly is a respected inventor and futurist who's made accurate predictions in the past - claims that through technological advances in Gene Therapy, Nanotechnoloy, and Robotics (GNR), humans and machines will become indistinguishable within the next 30-40 years. He names this merging of humans and machines ""the Singularity."" Kurzweil bases his predictions on ideas like Moore's law, and other rates of advancement in various technological fields. He offers all kinds of numbers and figures to back up his ideas. As interesting as his predictions are, the book is hard to wade through. And it's more than a little creepy to hear the human body referred to as Human Body 2.0. I gave it four stars because some of the ideas really did blow my mind and got me thinking pretty deeply about the nature and destiny of humanity, etc. But I think Kurzweil is far too optimistic. Not just about the technological predictions, but in his belief that humans will go along with human-machine integration. He has admittedly seen the Matrix and Terminator but doesn't believe the potential dark side of AI will dominate. Although, he does spend a chapter at the end answering fears and criticism of his ideas. I get the impression he's just another man obsessed with immortality and overzealous about science and technology being the answer.Some of his predictions (from a list on wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicti..., now you don't need to read the book: 2018-1013 bits of computer memory--roughly the equivalent of the memory space in a single human brain--will cost $1000.2020-One personal computer will have the same processing power as a human brain.2020s-Computers less than 100 nm in size will be possible.-Highly advanced medical nanobots will perform detailed brainscans on live patients.-Accurate computer simulations of the entire human brain will exist due to these hyperaccurate brainscans, and the workings of the brain will be understood.-By the later part of this decade, virtual reality will be so high-quality that it will be indistinguishable from real reality.-The threat posed by genetically engineered pathogens permanently dissipates by the end of this decade as medical nanobots--infinitely more durable, intelligent and capable than any microorganism--become sufficiently advanced.-A computer passes the Turing test by the last year of the decade (2029), meaning that it is a Strong AI and can think like a human (though the first A.I. is likely to be the equivalent of a very stupid human). This first A.I. is built around a computer simulation of a human brain, which was made possible by previous, nanotech-guided brainscanning.2030s-Mind uploading becomes possible.-Nanomachines could be directly inserted into the brain and could interact with brain cells to totally control incoming and outgoing signals. As a result, truly full-immersion virtual reality could be generated without the need for any external equipment. Afferent nerve pathways could be blocked, totally canceling out the ""real"" world and leaving the user with only the desired virtual experience.-Recreational uses aside, nanomachines in peoples' brains will allow them to greatly expand their cognitive, memory and sensory capabilities, to directly interface with computers, and to ""telepathically"" communicate with other, similarly augmented humans via wireless networks.-The same nanotechnology should also allow people to alter the neural connections within their brains, changing the underlying basis for the person's intelligence, memories and personality.-Human body 2.0 (as Kurzweil calls it) is incrementally accumulated into this decade. It consists of a nanotechnological system of nourishment and circulation--obsolescing many internal organs--and an improved skeleton.2040s-Human body 3.0 is gradually implemented during this decade. It lacks a fixed, corporeal form and can alter its shape and external appearance at will via foglet-like nanotechnology (similar to the T-1000 from Terminator 2).-People spend most of their time in full-immersion virtual reality (Kurzweil has cited The Matrix as a good example of what the advanced virtual worlds will be like, without the dystopian twist).2045: The Singularity-$1000 buys a computer a billion times more intelligent than every human combined. This means that average and even low-end computers are vastly smarter than even highly intelligent, unenhanced humans.-The technological singularity occurs as artificial intelligences surpass human beings as the smartest and most capable life forms on the Earth. Technological development is taken over by the machines, who can think, act and communicate so quickly that normal humans cannot even comprehend what is going on. The machines enter into a ""runaway reaction"" of self-improvement cycles, with each new generation of A.I.s appearing faster and faster. From this point onwards, technological advancement is explosive, under the control of the machines, and thus cannot be accurately predicted.-The Singularity is an extremely disruptive, world-altering event that forever changes the course of human history. The extermination of humanity by violent machines is unlikely (though not impossible) because sharp distinctions between man and machine will no longer exist thanks to the existence of cybernetically enhanced humans and uploaded humans.Post-2045: ""Waking up"" the Universe * The physical bottom limit to how small computer transistors (or other equivalent, albeit more effective components, such as memristors integrated into Crossbar latches) can be shrunk is reached. From this moment onwards, computers can only be made more powerful if they are made larger in size. * Because of this, A.I.s convert more and more of the Earth's matter into engineered, computational substrate capable of supporting more A.I.s. until the whole Earth is one, gigantic computer. * At this point, the only possible way to increase the intelligence of the machines any farther is to begin converting all of the matter in the universe into similar massive computers. A.I.s radiate out into space in all directions from the Earth, breaking down whole planets, moons and meteoroids and reassembling them into giant computers. This, in effect, ""wakes up"" the universe as all the inanimate ""dumb"" matter (rocks, dust, gases, etc.) is converted into structured matter capable of supporting life (albeit synthetic life). * Kurzweil predicts that machines might have the ability to make planet-sized computers by 2099, which underscores how enormously technology will advance after the Singularity. * The process of ""waking up"" the universe could be complete as early as 2199, or might take billions of years depending on whether or not machines could figure out a way to circumvent the speed of light for the purposes of space travel. * With the entire universe made into a giant, highly efficient supercomputer, AI and human hybrids (so integrated that, in truth it is a new category of ""life"") would have both supreme intelligence and physical control over the universe. Kurzweil suggests that this would open up all sorts of new possibilities, including abrogation of the laws of Physics, interdimensional travel, and a possible infinite extension of existence (true immortality)."
25,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1571969-billie-pritchett,1,"Ray Kurzweil's Singularity Is Near is an argument for a technology singularity coming in the near future, a time when machines will have and be able to make other machines with intelligence comparable to human beings, and he expects this to happen in year 2045. Kurzweil predicts that at some point after this machine production of other machines that human beings and other machines will be indistinguishable.I am agnostic about the truth of the thesis, my complaints instead being about the writing of the book. After the reader is introduced to the thesis and is given several predicted stages that are supposed to follow life's current evolutionary stages, Kurzweil writes about particular ways in which the technological singularity will either become apparent or begin to become apparent. For example, he writes that nanotechnology can be introduced into the human body and prepare and restore, and maybe eventually create from scratch, DNA molecules.Although the topic might sound fascinating and clear from the information I have provided so far, after reading the introduction and a few of the chapters, I had to stop, mainly because I did not know what Kurzweil was writing about or why he was writing what he was writing. I skimmed other parts of the book that appeared equally obscure and esoteric. It reminded me of conversations I have had about the Kennedy assassination with people who cite obscure and esoteric ballistics knowledge that, were I to be able to understand it, would prove, they claim, that Oswald could not have been the gunman. Unless I can understand the support that someone is providing for a claim, I cannot even begin to have an opinion about the legitimacy of the claim. I will readily admit that I might be too ignorant to get it. If so, shame on me and not Kurzweil. But read for yourself and find out if you feel the same or not. And feel free to write a comment on here to let me know how you feel and why."
26,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3733820-keith-swenson,3,"For anyone whose job depends upon an understanding of the trajectory of technology, Ray Kurzweil has carefully formulated a clear vision of the future, including some pretty fantastic possibilities. We all know the future will be strange. Look back at the 1950's and see how futurists of that time completely missed most of things we take for granted today, and how surely those people would have been shocked if someone had accurately projected the future. Nobody, of course, can predict the future exactly, and Kurzweil is no exception, but he does have some very sensible projections which are well supported, and quite shocking. It is a wild roller coaster ride over the nature of intelligence, the meaning of life, and the consciousness of the universe. Heady stuff to say the least.This book is a compendium of evidence to support his projections. The breadth and detail of this evidence is overwhelming. The way he delves into so many subjects: from the structure of the brain and nerves, the way DNA replicates, and surveys of current nanotech experiments, and too many others to mention here.The book gets three stars because it is a very good and interesting book, but it is probably not the best book for the casual reader. He has presented the core concepts elsewhere and in more succinct form. This, however, is a study guide for the student of the singularity. You know who you are, and if you want the details behind how he came to the ideas, it is all here. If not already a fan of Kurzweil, you might find this book too encyclopedic. "
27,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13556622-leonidas,5,"Summary: Not for the scientifically feint of heart! This book goes into such detail and precision of constructing a case for the exponentially accelerating advancing of technology. The key technological advancements of the 21st century involve GNR: Genetics, Nano-Technology, & Robots. Detail goes into what has already been achieved in these fields, and what is currently underway (albeit, 2004-2005, prior to even Watson).More emphasis is placed on the exponential developments of ""Strong"" Artificial Intelligence, and the technological and political benefits and consequences.Review: The all-encompassing volume of the Singularity is ridiculous, to the point of producing a paradigm shift.In effect, the ""Singularity"" is the point at which technology is doubling in performance/price so quickly, that even the exponential curve exponentiates itself, and the speed of doubling becomes perceivably infinite to humans.If you are into the exponential pace of technology from a scientific, innovation, or want to read the details to develop a big-picture point of view, this book is definitely for you!5/5 StarsFood for thought: What happens when technology supports us into the 'average' age of 120 years?What happens when we start duplicating our consciousness into a virtual medium after our physical bodies reach their limit?There will always be a market for these in a capitalist system. In effect, the rich will be the first adapters, and quickly it will become feasible for everyone else to adapt the technology as well. Ie. Computers, cellphones, cars, etc.Metaphorically speaking, you would be paying a fee to get into a heaven (parallelism to the roman catholic church of the 8th to 15th century).If World of Warcraft has 12 million subscribers, then it would be inevitable."
28,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1386765-brian,3,"While I praise Kurzweil for his forward thinking and attempt to tackle future technological issues before they arise, in many respects he falls under the category of ""scientists that spend too much time in their laboratory who consequently don't understand that just because a thing is possible doesn't mean that the rest of society will want to suddenly adopt it as well."" If, in the near future, we are capable of relinquishing our physical forms for upgraded digital ones does not mean that people will be running out to get this done, which, by the way, is supposed to be widespread by the late 2020's. People are naturally averse to change, and waiting in line overnight to buy the latest iPad should not be grouped in the same category as quickly disposing of our comfortable human forms for an uncertain future in the digital world. He weakly tries to philosophize that our definition of ""self"" is ambiguous and can therefore be dispensed with, but it is apparent throughout that his only rational for adopting such changes is simply because we can. A belief which, if followed, might spiritually, philosophically, and quite literally lead to the diminishment of the human race. Will many of his predictions come to pass? Certainly. Will we look back in 30 years and laugh at another futurist book whose claims seem so off the mark as to appear almost quaint? Without a doubt (as long as our robot overlords haven't outlawed laughing and other base human emotions.)"
29,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14067646-e-daniel-ayres,5,"I just finished the audiobook version of this book, my first read of Ray Kurzweil material. I had to download and review his illustrations from the book's web site as a review. The book may represent the synthesis of an awful lot of his previous works as well as illustrate clearly his broad perception of many key mathematical concepts that should help all of us inform ourselves about what is really going on in our present generation. Almost any trend line I want to chart today displays an ""L"" shaped curve. Ray explains why and how so many of them are linked and how rapidly the pace of change is changing as its trend line suddenly jumps toward infinity once you start up the slope of increasing changes. The conclusion that human intelligence will shape then combine with machine inteligence at the singularity reached when any one human cannot distinguish between the intellect of another human or the intellect of a technical creation of so-called non-biological intelligence, is clearly supported by all of his cited evidence and explanations. I just hope I live long enough to see scientific rationality embedded and fed back to humanity by its technical creations. The one place where his ""singularity"" doesn't really jell for me is when it comes to his treatment of issues like emotion and personality in the non-human brain. "
30,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34455515-omran-antar,5,"Outstanding book, it left more intrigued about AI and human spirit longing to progress. Kurzweil compares the faster or exponential pace of technology compared to biological evolution and concluded that singularity , a vast growth in intelligence resulting in reshaping of the universe, is somewhere near 2045. His prediction is based on the eloquent comparison of slow biological intelligence growth compared to exponential technological intelligence. He argues that nanotechnology is an essential contributor to understand the brain and thereof advance in non biological intelligence based on the former information processing. I was fully immersed in this book especially when the author describes how human will overcome their biological limitations and become transbiological and then pure machines. The hypothetical debates between ethicists and materialists is captivating, the one between him, Darwin, Frued and Molly about consciousness is mind blowing . Whether his predictions are accurate or not, Ray is an ultimate genius and this book takes you into an intellectual journey, I will definitely read all his books."
31,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2021836-george,5,"HEAVY DISCLAIMER: this review will require a lot of repetition to stress a few important points. To properly convey the information will require that I take Kurzweil's side since I do not intend to do much in the way of refuting or debating his ideas.I have thoroughly enjoyed reading the predictions that Ray Kurzweil makes for the future of the human race. His track record of technological predictions to date has been very accurate and I expect that many of the things he forsees in this book will happen. But, I am also certain that many human beings are not ready for the technologies that he describes. Along the way to any potential technological Singularity, there will be a great deal of upheaval in many human arenas. Perhaps I should explain the notion of the Singularity first.The term is borrowed from a few disciplines and has multiple meanings within each of those fields. The general application of the term is a situation that describes a point beyond which anything is unknown. In math this is a formula with a solution so large as to be currently impossible to calculate but not infinite. In astrophysics this is what lies beyond the event horizon (the exact point where nothing can escape) of a black hole in space. In the case of the technological singularity it is the point where biological human technology surpasses the understanding of even the most brilliant humans.Kurzweil's overall belief is based upon his mathematical analysis of exponential growth of all information, from nature's DNA to the code behind Microsoft Windows and therefore ultimately information technology (not the IT profession). He's spent years developing formulas that have allowed him to safely make predictions about the core outcomes of information technology and he suggests that everything humans do is becoming information technology. This is already the case in the medical, entertainment and increasingly the manufacturing industries.But exponential growth is not limited to productivity. It also applies to world knowledge and the economy. Which are also information technologies. Technological growth affects world knowledge growth. We can easily see this in the much larger amount of information available to a larger segment of the world population thanks to the web. Indeed, I would not have been writing this review, nor would you be reading it now if the technologies that form the internet and support the web on top of it had not been developed. More world knowledge and information sharing also increase exponentially as well as bringing about new ideas and further technological progress. While there are still many who don't yet have access to the web, think about those who do today. People who didn't even have access to basic education only a decade or two ago now have access to a wide variety of information and educational opportunities that didn't exist a short time ago. This is one of Kurzweil's main points.The other point is that the exponential growth of technology combined with the exponential growth of world knowledge cause exponential growth of the world economy. Granted that there are currently many problems with the US economy, Kurzweil points to the surprisingly large numbers of people in developing nations who have come out of poverty just in the 15 years before he wrote this book. Like technological and knowledge growth, the expanding global economy provides more resources to further develop technology worldwide.Yet another point that he stresses is that the exponential growth of information technology is itself also grouwing exponentially. Where technological developments used to take decades to become reliable and widely used, the time has now shortened to less than a decade. Smart phones and digital music players are examples of faster development and adoption of new technologies. If his predictions are correct, technologies like this will continue to become reliable and ubiquitous in less than five years as we traverse the current decade.He spent more time discussing these things near the end of the book rather than the beginning. But I chose to explain them first to give you some concepts which may help you understand why he believes in the more startling predictions he makes for the 21st century. These predictions are not likely to sit well with many people and as a result they will either deny the possibility, or argue against them from the current day mindset.The Singularity is Near is a very information dense book. Nearly 500 pages are used to explain, postulate and defend the idea that the ultimate form that humanity will take is non-biological. He predicts that this will happen in the second half of the 21st century. So some of you reading this may live through this transformation. As much as it sounds like science fiction his predictions are well within the bounds of reality. For example, he suggests that as we replace more and more of our bodies with non-biological components (we already do this) our machines will simultaneously become less and less machine-like and more and more human. This will occur to such an extent that making the distinction between ""human"" and ""machine"" intelligence will eventually have no meaning.First let's talk about A.I. (artificial intelligence), which is the main technology that promises to give our machines human qualities. Many people believe that artificial intelligence, as a field of development is long dead. Kurzweil counters by pointing out the many things machines do today could only be accomplished with partial or complete human intervention just a decade or two ago. The fact is that A.I. has become so successful that, after A.I. becomes capable of performing yet another previously human only task, it appears completely unremarkable. A.I. has not failed but it is so commonplace in our day to day lives that no one notices, unless it malfunctions. A.I. research continues and makes more progress every year, so more gains of this nature lie in the future.One thing that really struck me while reading this book is that humanity is not ready for many of the things he predicts if you tell people outright what to expect. But, as they live through the changes as they occur, humans adapt. In many cases, people either wonder how they lived without the new technologies or at worst they grudgingly see the benefits, with only a few exceptions.Much as the industrial age shaped much of the late 19th and first half of the 20th century, Kurzweil believes that through the combination of genetics, nanotechnology and robotics the information age will define the first half of the 21st century. I say the first half because Kurzweil predicts that the Singularity will happen somewhere in the 2040s. This is when machines will surpass human beings and their capability for thought and emotion.The changes that I've personally observed over the past three decades are in keeping with his exponential models. The changes of just the past ten years have been considerably accelerated compared to the previous 20, and that's his point. Had you asked someone with little interest in electronics or computers only 25 years ago if they thought that they would ever own a pocket sized device that was a phone that worked almost anywhere and had A.I. in it that would spell check, predict words as they type and allow for hands free voice dialing and touch screens, many of those people would have thought you were reading from a science fiction novel. Between the years 2000 and 2010, I've seen wireless networking develop from large, slow clunky cards for PCs, to small wireless networking radios in SD cards for cameras about the size of a quarter. This is exactly the sort of accelerated change Kurzweil is describing.A philosophical issue that Kurzweil discusses is the concept of consciousness, or what makes us human. If humanity begins to replace biological components to the extent that everyone is eventually non-biological, can we say that they are no longerr human? If you really think so, then ask yourself, what is the cut off point for being human? Replacement of the heart? The brain? A certain fraction or percentage of cells? Kurzweil suggests that what makes us human is our minds including our emotions as well as our experiences and ideas. Because of this, he believes that even if we ""uploaded"" our minds into a virtual reality and were no longer physical, we would still be human. He knows that this will be one of the greater philosophical questions of th 21st century. One that may cause a lot of problems for humans as these changes happen.The other side of the equation are the machines we are building. Once our machines have emotional intelligence and can interact with us just like other humans, can we still say they aren't conscious? No one has developed a way to measure or detect consciousness in humans, so how can we say that intelligent machines that can think and feel like we do, aren't really conscious? Just these two views of consciousness are going to bring about a lot of difficult exchanges among humans and according to Kurzweil's time line, we're only 30 years away from the beginning of that era.Once again, this book is huge and covers a lot of ground. That makes writing a good summary and review quite difficult. I also don't want to give too much away about the book so that anyone interested will have some things to look forward to. But here are a few teasers. What would you think of a human who no longer has a heart or blood? How about clouds of nanomachines that create ephemeral physical manifestations in the real world of virtual items and intellects? Do you think the notion that a future intelligent race originated from humans will eventually have the power to create more computational devices out of the sun itself? Even the entire universe? Just these few hints at what is in the book should give you some idea why I think most people will not accept or relate to these ideas. I think he's pretty close to correct for many of his extrapolations, but there is no guarantee. If any of these ideas intrigue or disturb you, give the book a try."
32,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45322768-adam,5,"I've heard so much said about Ray Kurzweil over the years but never got around to reading this controversial book. I expected to read these fantastical predictions of a future with no basis in reality. Instead this book is a very thorough, well researched, well supported examination of progress and where it is almost certainly inevitably headed.To be sure, the book hasn't aged perfectly in the 14 years since its publication. Kurzweil makes predictions about advanced technologies which he believes will be commonplace as early as the 2020s and, now that the decade in question has started, it seems unlikely these will play out. In that sense, he is a bit optimistic but I don't think he's likely off by that much. His predictions of progress are based on reliable trends. The technologies he suggests are grounded in physical reality. There is no magical leap needed for everything to fall in place. By putting replication of the human mind as the path to the singularity we remove ourselves from the unpredictable path of some software breakthrough which may, or may not, occur first. While Kurweil may assume an aggressive timeline, the timeline itself does not seem to be in question.Kurweil is himself very open to the idea of modifying himself and humanity. I am absolutely on board with this and embrace the type of future he is detailing in these pages. Others I think may not be quite as open to the idea. While he downplays the resistance the average person may have to such things as life extension therapies, I think they will still come just perhaps at a slower pace than he thinks. Something being within our scientific reach doesn't mean it will happen. We've had the technology for human cloning for decades and haven't down anything with it. We currently have the ability to rewrite the human genome and it isn't getting much traction. While people are generally on board with a single life saving technology they don't seem to have much appetite for general life extension. It's a bit like AI. A lot of people are using AI to find solutions to specific problems but not many people are trying to make a general purpose human intelligent AI system. A lot of people are trying to cure cancer or any number of ailments but not a lot of people are looking into fundamentally extending life. Will it happen? Almost certainly. Will it happen in Ray Kurzweil's lifetime? I can't be sure. How many others have gone to the steps he has to extent their lives? Almost none.All around I love the author's approach. He studied computer programming and has an eye for the physical aspects of computing as well as the programming and algorithm side. He approaches a problem with a rational view of it. The book details things in a straightforward way. No doubt that computing will continue to advance. No doubt that nanotech will become more common. No doubt that models of the brain will become better and better. No doubt that we will soon have the computing ability to run a simulation of a mind. Will we be able to simulate a human mind on a computer? The only difficulty will be in scanning and replicating it. There is surely nothing magical about a brain which makes it impossible to duplicate on a computer!Is the Singularity Near? I don't know. I think it's coming, but it's hard to predict just when. Ray Kurzweil isn't pulling his predictions out of nowhere. He did the work and he's on the right track. For his sake as well as that of all of us, I hope it's soon!"
33,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1899624-zach,3,"This pseudo-religious, pseudo-scientific tome by one of the world's leading futurists lays out a timeline to a moment when the pace of technological innovation -- specifically, in the power of computer hardware and software -- becomes so rapid that, from our perspective in the present, it occupies a single point in time. Hence, the singularity.Kurzweil's predictions are based primarily upon an observation made by Gordon Moore of Intel: that computing power per dollar will double every 18 months. This isn't exactly what he said; it's actually an expression of transistor density. But the effect that consumers and Kurzweil care about is price-performance, which is doubling every 18 months. Kurzweil looks into the future and extrapolates that $1000 will buy you as much processing power as a human brain by the mid 2020s and more than all human brains in existence by the 2030s. More intriguingly, he also looks into the past and postulates an identical exponential progress, starting with the evolution of DNA and continuing on up through homo sapiens, agriculture, the wheel, and investment banking. This observation, that ""milestones"" in ""progress"" seem to be happening more frequently as time goes by, is the basis of his Law of Accelerating Returns, which is the cornerstone of his belief system. Basically, Kurzweil believes that all evolutionary systems, of which technology is one, increase their ""order"" exponentially. Therefore, it's no coincidence that it took 2 billion years for DNA to evolve, but then only 1 billion years for eukaryotes, then only 500 million years for multicellular organisms, and so on, each milestone occurring in half as much time as it took to achieve the one before it. For reference, see:Canoncial milestones in the SingularityThe foundation for his Law of Accelerating Returns is by far the weakest part of his argument for what the future will be like. He asserts that evolutionary systems inevitably increase their ""order"" exponentially, but never approaches a rigorous definition of the term. This hand-waving approach to his fundamental theory really comes to a head when he talks about the Fermi Paradox, the observation that intelligent life in the universe seems to be uncommon. This flies in the face of Kurzweil's thesis, which is that intelligence inevitably evolves from DNA up through brains through supercomputers, until eventually a civilization is converting all the matter and energy in the universe into one giant computational device at an exponential rate. If such a project is underway on behalf of some other intelligent race, they're being awfully quiet about it. Therefore, a futurist is forced to either 1) apply a universal anthropic principle: we must be the first intelligent (technology-creating) race in the universe; or 2) accept that there's nothing inevitable about the evolution of intelligence or technology. Kurzweil chooses option 1), and while he makes an eloquent case for his choice it's far from airtight. Beetles have been evolving exactly as long as we have -- they're more successful than us by any evolutionary metric -- and yet they possess no intelligence.Kurzweil is at his best when he sticks to the predictions that his objective measures of price-performance of information technologies actually support, and these predictions really are awe-inspiring. We can say with great certainty that the years of the 2020s will in fact give rise to truly earth-moving, paradigm-shattering technologies as a result of cheap, ubiquitous computers. Kurzweil has a lot of specific examples, mostly concerning the augmentation of human intelligence and virtual reality interfaces for the brain, that are best read in the book itself.It's worth noting that Kurzweil doesn't seem to think that peak oil will affect his predictions in the least. James Kunstler's The Long Emergency Surviving the End of Oil, Climate Change, and Other Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty-First Century talks about the diminishing returns of technology, while Kurzweil posits the Law of Accelerating Returns. Clearly, one of these men is a pessimist and one an optimist. The question that concerns all of us is: who is right? I view the singularity and peak oil as a race, with the future of human civilization at stake. Can the exponential increase in technological progress replace our fossil fuel energy before Saudi production peaks? No one knows; Kurzweil is pretty bad at predicting specific applications of technology (he thought we would have glasses that use lasers to paint images onto our retinas by 2009), but his data on the exponential increase in price-performance in information technologies is so predictable as to be considered infallible. There's enough solar energy hitting this planet to replace our fossil fuel use and then some. Kunstler thinks we'll be unable to harness it as a civilization because of the how very little time we have until oil production peaks; but then, he clearly doesn't understand the exponential nature of progress, so his predictions are suspect. Kurzweil, on the other hand, is a self-admitted utopian optimist who sincerely believes that humankind's ascension to the stars is not just likely, but destined, preordained.So to reiterate: should you be investing in canned food or in nanotechnology companies (and virtual pornography firms, of course)? I can't tell you how to live your life, but my personal perspective on this dilemma is as follows: in 20 years we will either be living in the middle of the fantastic future promised by the Singularity; or we'll be back to an agrarian lifestyle and focused mainly on staying alive and killing our neighbors. Since the latter outcome, the total and near-irrevocable destruction of our way of life, is unthinkable, I prefer to believe in the former. In other words, I choose not to invest in canned food, because I can't imagine living in a world where I'll need it.I can't say I recommend this book very strongly, except for those who already have a strong interest in the Singularity. The subject matter is often fascinating and thought-provoking, but the presentation leaves much to be desired. Kurzweil rambles and repeats himself, and multiple times lets his narrative devolve into pages upon pages of bulleted lists. I'm sorry, Mr. Kurzweil, but I could have gotten that on Wikipedia."
34,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3037001-pamela,4,"It's tempting to call this book science fiction since its fundamental idea seems so far-fetched. Much can be said about this book, much has been said. I find it hard to write a review because this book is very big, in length and ideas. Kurzweil is a very smart man who has already made our lives better, he’s an inventor and coder. He developed electronic keyboards, text-to-speech readers, OCR and more. He’s very smart. He’s also written several books about the future, or where humans are headed. The Singularity is Near is nearly a decade old already, but hardly dated. There are a lot of charts that can be updated, but overall the book is still very relevant. I would encourage anyone to read the book. Warning it is not easy, the writing style is dense, sometimes dull. But it’s not quite as long as it appears with about 20% of the book being notes and index. The basic gist of the Singularity is three-fold: GNR. Genetics, Nanotechnology and Robotics, and everything is becoming information. How everything becomes information and the speed at which everything is going to change is due to Moore's Law, which is about exponential growth, and Kurzweil takes it a little further with “Law of Accelerating Returns.” We will have leaps of achievements and ability in genetics and along with nanotechnology, we will repair and renew our bodies, helping to extend our life span. Nanotechnology will end up allowing us to scan and reverse engineer our brain, and ultimately be able to transfer our consciousness (memories and personality) to another substrate, meaning a digital form. Smart A.I. and supercomputers will help us achieve this. After merging with computers, becoming biological and digital, we will have an infinite life-span as our consciousness, our individuality is preserved digitally. The end result is unknown, we as humans, will reach a Singularity where the unknown is unforeseeable because we just can't comprehend what is next. Okay, I probably butchered that summary, skipped a ton but yeah, it’s wild! It's all quite fascinating. Kurzweil thinks we are on the cusp of these revolutions and maybe the baby-boomer generation will see it if they take care of their bodies. People born after 1960 most likely will. Sure there are a lot of reasons to discount this future, and Kurzweil writes a full chapter on responding to critics. (The chapters are quite long!) Since the publication of his book The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence, which has similar ideas, Kurzweil had many critics, and he explains why they are wrong. The first few are the typical: disbelief this is possible, and what about rich/poor gap. He writes that all of this can be overcome, and will. Personally I think Kurzweil discounts a few things a little too readily, such as people or governments putting the brakes on this trend, as well as the rich and poor divide. As he is wealthy it may be hard for him to appreciate the difference between having money and barely surviving. He says that it is irrelevant since in the beginning technology is expensive and doesn't work well, only the rich buy the devices, but as the technology improves it goes through stages until it works great, is ubiquitous and practically free. Perhaps the great lifesaving and body improving technologies will work down to the poor masses but in the short time frame he claims I do have strong doubt. Using his law of accelerating returns, timelines shrink and he claims the time difference will be in a few years instead of decades that we see now. He uses AIDS drugs, cell phones and the internet as examples. Perhaps. All in all, it's a very optimistic outlook on the future of mankind. Take that in contrast to other outlooks, such as Jared Diamond, Thomas Friedman or the countless number of environmentalist's such as Bill McKibben. I have been steeped in those ideas and so this one of Kurzweil's I find quite hopeful. Kurzweil has been spot on with many of his predictions and quite a few of his critics don’t disagree with his conclusions, just the timeline, not never, just a matter of when. Did want to keep this short, but find it impossible. "
35,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86318-amy,2,"Hooooo, boy. Where do you even start with this thing?Stylistically, it has a lot of flaws. Super repetitive. Sputters out at the end, and then as an appendix he throws in a few equations. The hypothetical dialogues interspersed in the text are sometimes eye-rollingly lame, although, to be fair, they just as often directly responded to questions/criticisms the book had raised in my mind.I'm not sure who his audience is supposed to be. The math and theoretical physics stuff was not always sufficiently explained in that I, a fairly intelligent lay reader who at least has vague recollections of high school math and science, just couldn't follow significant portions of his supposed proof. I think most general readers would have the same problem.I don't have the computer science or math background to evaluate a lot of his assertions, so it is hard to tell how much is plausible, if far-fetched, and how much is pure crazy. I am perfectly willing to believe that at some point, advances in technology will render everyday life difficult to recognize. I am on board with the possibility that ""we will be cyborgs."" My mind started to close when he discussed how in a century or so we will have expanded into the galaxy and started spreading throughout the universe, and perhaps beyond, in search of more information processing capacity. While it is an interesting possibility, I'm unclear on how that process will work.His explanation for how a lot of this will be accomplished boils down to: ""We will be supersmart because our computers, with whom we will be merging, will also be supersmart, so while I don't know how we're going to do this, we'll figure it out."" Well, maybe, but you're going to have to do a little better than that.Also, what a dreary view of the future and our potential expansion into the stars. No learning about new environments, or learning about ourselves, really. Just a bunch of boring cyborgs goofing off in simulated environments and using up the materials of the universe (with apparently no thought given to who or what else might be using those materials) to make our processing units run better. And apparently the best use of this knowledge will be: (i) to live indefinitely, (ii) to be supersmart, and (iii) to hang out in virtual reality. What's the point of (i) and (ii) if all you're going to do with it is (iii)?He sort of tries to address, but doesn't really, how you are really alive if your ""consciousness"" is merged with a mechanical substrate while the physical you is stranded in meatspace. Maybe I am a selfish jerk, but I am more concerned about death because it means I won't be alive anymore, rather than because the world will be deprived of the privilege of interacting with me or an exact replica of my personality.He doesn't address more than in passing the real-world political obstacles to the supposed availability of cheap, unlimited resources he says is coming. Sure, sure, the big fossil fuel companies will totally stand by and not try to block cheap solar power, etc. They will cast aside their profit motives because ... more CPUs? I don't know. Similarly troubling is the author's lack of serious discussion of the fact that greater reliance on computers means less jobs. He seems to say that this is cool, because everything in the future will be really inexpensive, but this ignores his own point that information (software forming the patterns, for example, of all those nifty clothes we will create on 3D printers) will be the real commodity.Finally, he disregards some pretty obvious privacy concerns. People flip out about their Facebook settings, but within a century most people will be uploading/merging/sharing their actual consciousness online? He doesn't discuss any methods of or possible desire to keep any of the self separate from this collective consciousness, but wouldn't that be a huge concern for most people? Putting your drunk pictures on the internet is one thing, sharing your brain with the world quite another.For all of that, I did slog through the whole thing, and I kept talking about what I had read, so it definitely raised some interesting points. And I suspect at least some of the author's claims are on point (it was already pretty spot-on about on-board nav systems in cars). But from my (admittedly technically handicapped) viewpoint, it winds up somewhere off the rails."
36,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19648573-mark-locascio,2,"A lot of the reviews here seem to be saying ""it's complicated, so it must be profound."" This is not true. There is no reason for this book to be 650 pages long. Kurzweil's thesis is pretty straightforward: technology advances at an exponential pace. By that logic, there's reason to believe that nonbiological (i.e., computational) intelligence will eventually become much more advanced than human intelligence. This book is essentially Kurzweil's prediction for how great it'll be.I'm not fond of speculation about science... technology rarely evolves the way you think it will. But a well-crafted opinion would still be an interesting read. Unfortunately, this was not well-crafted. The book is long and rambling. There are wild detours that span dozens of pages. Academic research is misinterpreted and extrapolated well beyond what any real scientist would allow. The end-notes are a pain in the nads. The fixation on lactation and virtualized, gender-swapped sex adds nothing but confusion.The book isn't getting a poor review from me because I couldn't understand it. I did graduate research in both nanomechanics and robotics, two of the areas Kurzweil writes about for too many pages. I know enough to know that he's really stretching here. This book seemed like he'd had a lot of conversations with a lot of smart people, and wanted to publish as much of it as he could to appear knowledgeable himself. In the end, it just seemed like he didn't know which book he wanted to write, and wasn't qualified to write any of them.There was some good discussion of the ethics of artificial intelligence, I'll give him that. And for what it's worth, his predictions likely won't be completely wrong. But this book could have benefited quite a bit from a strong editorial influence or some peer-review. Skip it. Go browse his web site and save yourself about 600 pages."
37,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2683760-gary,4,"Rarely I read a book that truly blows my mind. This is one. Noted futurist Kurzweil lays out a radically different view of the future enabled by exponential development of artificial intelligence. A couple of the key milestones on the way to the future he envisions:-By 2029, computers will have advanced so far as to be able to pass a Turing test, which essentially means that they will be able to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of biological humans.-And by 2045, the ""singularity"", meaning merging of biological and non-biological humanity will be a reality.So the singularity is near, but not so near that is going to happen, say, next year. If Kurzweil is even half right, we are in for some incredible advances in genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics, his ""big three"" technological revolutions that will pave the way for the human-machine melding he sees coming.I can't say that I agree with everything presented here, but neither can I refute the powerful argument he makes for the path that our civilization appears to be on: after what will be only several hundred years of having machines in our lives, we basically will have developed them to the point where they are as smart as us, and very soon after that, nearly indescribably smarter than us. Take a listen/read, this is powerful stuff with all sorts of moral implications. It will make you think very hard about what may be to come in the future.**The narrator sounds a bit like one of the old Speak & Spell toys from the 1980s, which is kind of funny given the text-to-speech technology development that Kurzweil has been involved in."
38,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59510129-chris,3,"Kurzweil makes remarkably far-sighted predictions about humanity will change during our lifetimes. The very far-sighted analysis on physical limitation of computation is quite interesting, as are the predictions about the pre-singularity advances in genetics, nanotechnology and robotics. However, Kurzweil quickly dismisses two glaring issues with surprising immaturity. One, he claims that since technologies like self-replicating nanobots will become cheaper at an exponential rate, they will be ubiquitous among the poor seven years later than the rich, so access to resources will be democratized. This opposes all historical precedent and should not be dismissed without much stronger evidence. Two, he claims that Strong AI is not an existential threat because we can also develop a Strong AI immune system to defend against bad actors, and our immune systems work pretty well. He invokes his argument at least three times but fails to state the obvious that people’s immune systems fail sometimes, but we only get one universe. If a Strong AI immune system fails in a vastly interconnected system, it’s not just one person who dies, it’s everybody. Finally, I was disappointed by Kurzweil’s lack of discussion of the societal implications of inevitable rapid technological “progress.” For something that will affect the whole world, he focuses an awful lot on what it will mean for an individual - implicitly, one who can afford it."
39,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/136271-maria,2,"Predicting the future is always hard and Kurzweil whole hypothesis is that there is a point in the future when our technology will shift so dramatically that we can't imagine what it will be like. He then proceeds to explain just what it will be like. Why I started this book: Another audio from my professional reading list.Why I finished it: Good thing it was an audio, I kept a steady pace and wasn't drowned in the ridiculousness. Buddy Read: Where's My Jetpack?: A Guide to the Amazing Science Fiction Future That Never Arrived. The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology might have been more helpful/wonderful a decade ago... but I'm struggling now. That's the problem with predictions about future technology. You might guess that we'd have hand-held computers but who would guess that we would use them to watch cats, other videos and argue with strangers in thread wars?"
40,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47739629-stefanos,3,"Kurzweil has strong points justifying his (calculated) predictions about us primates rapidly transcending to a (much) higher and more capable species through the help of technology. Or is it computers reaching human consciousness and far surpassing human capabilities in the immediate future? Actually he makes both claims and the fact that those massive changes are happening exponentially (Ray Kurzweil's Law of Accelerating Returns) in the next 20-30 years, is downright crazy to think of.You know what they say, ""extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"" and Kurzweil provides a fair amount of these and to his defense, in the 15 years that have passed since the publication of this book, several of these predictions (that I know of) have already been materialized. There is much to digest in this book and while the ideas are fascinating, the book itself is a hard read, with some repeated content (for clarity?) and tries to analyze in depth several subjects thus losing the reader's focus from time to time. Still, a classic if you want to dive into the ""Singularity is near"" trend."

Some people have said this book is the Bible of the Singularitianism as new religion.. and that felt true in the way it was mostly throwing affirmations into my face and asking me to just believe them (while implying that if I didn't, it was my own fault from not being enlightened enough)In summary : Glad i read it, gave me a lot to think about... Even happier to be done with it, painful from a literary standpoint :("

Among those three I fear an experiment with self-replicating nanobots gone wrong is the most likely to wipe us out. I also think that the time scale may be a bit off but that might just be me not being able to think in terms of exponential growth even though Kurzweil tries to teach me over and over again. It's inevitable that we will (continue to) improve ourselves through genetics, augment us with nanotechnology and invent artificial life and live as mainly information (or ""patterns""). Combinations of these will basically make us immortal and, in my opinion, still human but with way better control of our evolution. The singularity is coming. I just hope I won't miss it."

Even if it all will come to pass. Talking about future with today's terms seems frightful and terrifying, but I'd suggest to cross the bridge when we come to it. It's ok to speculate as a thought experiment, because it's also cool and exciting, but don't get an heart attack about something that doesn't make any sense with the current information.But that said, I cannot wait to get cheap quality replacement/upgrade parts to by biological organs.

44,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23183558-dina,5,"First of all, I will put this book on the shelf to re-read. The information is quite heavy and technical to digest from the first time (especially if you are a non-scientist). Second, Ray is of course brilliant, but there is just too much. It's like he is trying to write about everything, at the same time. Third, the future is scary. In the future, human will be part human part machine. Ray is trying to be optimistic about the convergence of both, but somehow shows only the positive sides of it. For example, even now we have medical technology that can do miracles but unless you have good insurance, you won't have access to it. So what are the guarantees that future advances in technology will be accessible to all, not just the richest 1 percent. Overall, most of the book is wishful thinking - or living in ones head."

I don't think he is off by much, but his optimistic predictions do not realistically account for political, economic and other social factors that can slow many of this down. When we landed on the moon, just ten years after the first man in space, everyone assumed much faster growth of space-faring technologies, but out political will was just not there, and 2001 Space Odyssey still remains a science fiction. However, I too strongly believe that a technological evolution of humankind is not too far off. The next hundred years is going to be the most exciting period for our species."

While other scientific linked to the society, Ray paints a very bright future for us where GNR (genetics, nanotechnology and robotics) will solve solve all the world problems: medical, environmental, sociological...If I read Kurzweil, I remember why it is fun to be an engineer, combining sciences from all different domains to create new technology to reshape mankind. I do not agree with all what he has to say (technology is not available to all and will likely create as many problems as it solves, do we really want to become demi-gods, immortal and living only for intellectual pleasures?), but it sure is an interesting read."

In some ways that helps the author's case since many of his predictions have already, or about to, become a reality. It is well researched and chock full of ideas and an inherent optimism about the future, which is refreshing after reading so many bleak sci-fi novels (like mine).The writing is somewhat dry however, and very little commentary or opinion is presented, instead piling on facts, research, maths, and graphs. Also, the graphs are very difficult to read on a Kindle, it could have been formatted better."

Kurzweil is an inventor, not a scientist, and it shows in this book of his - he even harps on about how technology is ""an extension of biological evolution."" If you're looking for a well-grounded introduction to how weird, wonderful and dangerous this century will be, my list of recommendations would place The Singularity Is Near close to the bottom of the list."

He goes off the deep end in the middle but ends on a strong note.I still think he is overly optimistic about the reliability of complex software though, as well as his timeline for general AI. Finally, sometimes I think that our exponential progress might be slowed down a bit since some of this generations brightest minds work on social media apps and click bait instead of figuring out how to get to Mars. But I have hope that things will get better soon."

I also found Ray Kurzweil's narrative and view of the future to be rather endearing, focusing on these exponential leaps and how humanity will transcend the bounds of biology and I am just READY for the transhumanist technocult. Also of note, I have some of the OCR software that he had created so I appreciate Ray Kurzweil for his contributions towards accessibility. "

Also, the way the book is structured is awfully boring.

Kurzweil compares the faster or exponential pace of technology compared to biological evolution and concluded that singularity , a vast growth in intelligence resulting in reshaping of the universe, is somewhere near 2045. His prediction is based on the eloquent comparison of slow biological intelligence growth compared to exponential technological intelligence. He argues that nanotechnology is an essential contributor to understand the brain and thereof advance in non biological intelligence based on the former information processing. I was fully immersed in this book especially when the author describes how human will overcome their biological limitations and become transbiological and then pure machines. The hypothetical debates between ethicists and materialists is captivating, the one between him, Darwin, Frued and Molly about consciousness is mind blowing . Whether his predictions are accurate or not, Ray is an ultimate genius and this book takes you into an intellectual journey, I will definitely read all his books."
61,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2021836-george,5,"HEAVY DISCLAIMER: this review will require a lot of repetition to stress a few important points. To properly convey the information will require that I take Kurzweil's side since I do not intend to do much in the way of refuting or debating his ideas.I have thoroughly enjoyed reading the predictions that Ray Kurzweil makes for the future of the human race. His track record of technological predictions to date has been very accurate and I expect that many of the things he forsees in this book will happen. But, I am also certain that many human beings are not ready for the technologies that he describes. Along the way to any potential technological Singularity, there will be a great deal of upheaval in many human arenas. Perhaps I should explain the notion of the Singularity first.The term is borrowed from a few disciplines and has multiple meanings within each of those fields. The general application of the term is a situation that describes a point beyond which anything is unknown. In math this is a formula with a solution so large as to be currently impossible to calculate but not infinite. In astrophysics this is what lies beyond the event horizon (the exact point where nothing can escape) of a black hole in space. In the case of the technological singularity it is the point where biological human technology surpasses the understanding of even the most brilliant humans.Kurzweil's overall belief is based upon his mathematical analysis of exponential growth of all information, from nature's DNA to the code behind Microsoft Windows and therefore ultimately information technology (not the IT profession). He's spent years developing formulas that have allowed him to safely make predictions about the core outcomes of information technology and he suggests that everything humans do is becoming information technology. This is already the case in the medical, entertainment and increasingly the manufacturing industries.But exponential growth is not limited to productivity. It also applies to world knowledge and the economy. Which are also information technologies. Technological growth affects world knowledge growth. We can easily see this in the much larger amount of information available to a larger segment of the world population thanks to the web. Indeed, I would not have been writing this review, nor would you be reading it now if the technologies that form the internet and support the web on top of it had not been developed. More world knowledge and information sharing also increase exponentially as well as bringing about new ideas and further technological progress. While there are still many who don't yet have access to the web, think about those who do today. People who didn't even have access to basic education only a decade or two ago now have access to a wide variety of information and educational opportunities that didn't exist a short time ago. This is one of Kurzweil's main points.The other point is that the exponential growth of technology combined with the exponential growth of world knowledge cause exponential growth of the world economy. Granted that there are currently many problems with the US economy, Kurzweil points to the surprisingly large numbers of people in developing nations who have come out of poverty just in the 15 years before he wrote this book. Like technological and knowledge growth, the expanding global economy provides more resources to further develop technology worldwide.Yet another point that he stresses is that the exponential growth of information technology is itself also grouwing exponentially. Where technological developments used to take decades to become reliable and widely used, the time has now shortened to less than a decade. Smart phones and digital music players are examples of faster development and adoption of new technologies. If his predictions are correct, technologies like this will continue to become reliable and ubiquitous in less than five years as we traverse the current decade.He spent more time discussing these things near the end of the book rather than the beginning. But I chose to explain them first to give you some concepts which may help you understand why he believes in the more startling predictions he makes for the 21st century. These predictions are not likely to sit well with many people and as a result they will either deny the possibility, or argue against them from the current day mindset.The Singularity is Near is a very information dense book. Nearly 500 pages are used to explain, postulate and defend the idea that the ultimate form that humanity will take is non-biological. He predicts that this will happen in the second half of the 21st century. So some of you reading this may live through this transformation. As much as it sounds like science fiction his predictions are well within the bounds of reality. For example, he suggests that as we replace more and more of our bodies with non-biological components (we already do this) our machines will simultaneously become less and less machine-like and more and more human. This will occur to such an extent that making the distinction between ""human"" and ""machine"" intelligence will eventually have no meaning.First let's talk about A.I. (artificial intelligence), which is the main technology that promises to give our machines human qualities. Many people believe that artificial intelligence, as a field of development is long dead. Kurzweil counters by pointing out the many things machines do today could only be accomplished with partial or complete human intervention just a decade or two ago. The fact is that A.I. has become so successful that, after A.I. becomes capable of performing yet another previously human only task, it appears completely unremarkable. A.I. has not failed but it is so commonplace in our day to day lives that no one notices, unless it malfunctions. A.I. research continues and makes more progress every year, so more gains of this nature lie in the future.One thing that really struck me while reading this book is that humanity is not ready for many of the things he predicts if you tell people outright what to expect. But, as they live through the changes as they occur, humans adapt. In many cases, people either wonder how they lived without the new technologies or at worst they grudgingly see the benefits, with only a few exceptions.Much as the industrial age shaped much of the late 19th and first half of the 20th century, Kurzweil believes that through the combination of genetics, nanotechnology and robotics the information age will define the first half of the 21st century. I say the first half because Kurzweil predicts that the Singularity will happen somewhere in the 2040s. This is when machines will surpass human beings and their capability for thought and emotion.The changes that I've personally observed over the past three decades are in keeping with his exponential models. The changes of just the past ten years have been considerably accelerated compared to the previous 20, and that's his point. Had you asked someone with little interest in electronics or computers only 25 years ago if they thought that they would ever own a pocket sized device that was a phone that worked almost anywhere and had A.I. in it that would spell check, predict words as they type and allow for hands free voice dialing and touch screens, many of those people would have thought you were reading from a science fiction novel. Between the years 2000 and 2010, I've seen wireless networking develop from large, slow clunky cards for PCs, to small wireless networking radios in SD cards for cameras about the size of a quarter. This is exactly the sort of accelerated change Kurzweil is describing.A philosophical issue that Kurzweil discusses is the concept of consciousness, or what makes us human. If humanity begins to replace biological components to the extent that everyone is eventually non-biological, can we say that they are no longerr human? If you really think so, then ask yourself, what is the cut off point for being human? Replacement of the heart? The brain? A certain fraction or percentage of cells? Kurzweil suggests that what makes us human is our minds including our emotions as well as our experiences and ideas. Because of this, he believes that even if we ""uploaded"" our minds into a virtual reality and were no longer physical, we would still be human. He knows that this will be one of the greater philosophical questions of th 21st century. One that may cause a lot of problems for humans as these changes happen.The other side of the equation are the machines we are building. Once our machines have emotional intelligence and can interact with us just like other humans, can we still say they aren't conscious? No one has developed a way to measure or detect consciousness in humans, so how can we say that intelligent machines that can think and feel like we do, aren't really conscious? Just these two views of consciousness are going to bring about a lot of difficult exchanges among humans and according to Kurzweil's time line, we're only 30 years away from the beginning of that era.Once again, this book is huge and covers a lot of ground. That makes writing a good summary and review quite difficult. I also don't want to give too much away about the book so that anyone interested will have some things to look forward to. But here are a few teasers. What would you think of a human who no longer has a heart or blood? How about clouds of nanomachines that create ephemeral physical manifestations in the real world of virtual items and intellects? Do you think the notion that a future intelligent race originated from humans will eventually have the power to create more computational devices out of the sun itself? Even the entire universe? Just these few hints at what is in the book should give you some idea why I think most people will not accept or relate to these ideas. I think he's pretty close to correct for many of his extrapolations, but there is no guarantee. If any of these ideas intrigue or disturb you, give the book a try."
62,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45322768-adam,5,"I've heard so much said about Ray Kurzweil over the years but never got around to reading this controversial book. I expected to read these fantastical predictions of a future with no basis in reality. Instead this book is a very thorough, well researched, well supported examination of progress and where it is almost certainly inevitably headed.To be sure, the book hasn't aged perfectly in the 14 years since its publication. Kurzweil makes predictions about advanced technologies which he believes will be commonplace as early as the 2020s and, now that the decade in question has started, it seems unlikely these will play out. In that sense, he is a bit optimistic but I don't think he's likely off by that much. His predictions of progress are based on reliable trends. The technologies he suggests are grounded in physical reality. There is no magical leap needed for everything to fall in place. By putting replication of the human mind as the path to the singularity we remove ourselves from the unpredictable path of some software breakthrough which may, or may not, occur first. While Kurweil may assume an aggressive timeline, the timeline itself does not seem to be in question.Kurweil is himself very open to the idea of modifying himself and humanity. I am absolutely on board with this and embrace the type of future he is detailing in these pages. Others I think may not be quite as open to the idea. While he downplays the resistance the average person may have to such things as life extension therapies, I think they will still come just perhaps at a slower pace than he thinks. Something being within our scientific reach doesn't mean it will happen. We've had the technology for human cloning for decades and haven't down anything with it. We currently have the ability to rewrite the human genome and it isn't getting much traction. While people are generally on board with a single life saving technology they don't seem to have much appetite for general life extension. It's a bit like AI. A lot of people are using AI to find solutions to specific problems but not many people are trying to make a general purpose human intelligent AI system. A lot of people are trying to cure cancer or any number of ailments but not a lot of people are looking into fundamentally extending life. Will it happen? Almost certainly. Will it happen in Ray Kurzweil's lifetime? I can't be sure. How many others have gone to the steps he has to extent their lives? Almost none.All around I love the author's approach. He studied computer programming and has an eye for the physical aspects of computing as well as the programming and algorithm side. He approaches a problem with a rational view of it. The book details things in a straightforward way. No doubt that computing will continue to advance. No doubt that nanotech will become more common. No doubt that models of the brain will become better and better. No doubt that we will soon have the computing ability to run a simulation of a mind. Will we be able to simulate a human mind on a computer? The only difficulty will be in scanning and replicating it. There is surely nothing magical about a brain which makes it impossible to duplicate on a computer!Is the Singularity Near? I don't know. I think it's coming, but it's hard to predict just when. Ray Kurzweil isn't pulling his predictions out of nowhere. He did the work and he's on the right track. For his sake as well as that of all of us, I hope it's soon!"
63,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1899624-zach,3,"This pseudo-religious, pseudo-scientific tome by one of the world's leading futurists lays out a timeline to a moment when the pace of technological innovation -- specifically, in the power of computer hardware and software -- becomes so rapid that, from our perspective in the present, it occupies a single point in time. Hence, the singularity.Kurzweil's predictions are based primarily upon an observation made by Gordon Moore of Intel: that computing power per dollar will double every 18 months. This isn't exactly what he said; it's actually an expression of transistor density. But the effect that consumers and Kurzweil care about is price-performance, which is doubling every 18 months. Kurzweil looks into the future and extrapolates that $1000 will buy you as much processing power as a human brain by the mid 2020s and more than all human brains in existence by the 2030s. More intriguingly, he also looks into the past and postulates an identical exponential progress, starting with the evolution of DNA and continuing on up through homo sapiens, agriculture, the wheel, and investment banking. This observation, that ""milestones"" in ""progress"" seem to be happening more frequently as time goes by, is the basis of his Law of Accelerating Returns, which is the cornerstone of his belief system. Basically, Kurzweil believes that all evolutionary systems, of which technology is one, increase their ""order"" exponentially. Therefore, it's no coincidence that it took 2 billion years for DNA to evolve, but then only 1 billion years for eukaryotes, then only 500 million years for multicellular organisms, and so on, each milestone occurring in half as much time as it took to achieve the one before it. For reference, see:Canoncial milestones in the SingularityThe foundation for his Law of Accelerating Returns is by far the weakest part of his argument for what the future will be like. He asserts that evolutionary systems inevitably increase their ""order"" exponentially, but never approaches a rigorous definition of the term. This hand-waving approach to his fundamental theory really comes to a head when he talks about the Fermi Paradox, the observation that intelligent life in the universe seems to be uncommon. This flies in the face of Kurzweil's thesis, which is that intelligence inevitably evolves from DNA up through brains through supercomputers, until eventually a civilization is converting all the matter and energy in the universe into one giant computational device at an exponential rate. If such a project is underway on behalf of some other intelligent race, they're being awfully quiet about it. Therefore, a futurist is forced to either 1) apply a universal anthropic principle: we must be the first intelligent (technology-creating) race in the universe; or 2) accept that there's nothing inevitable about the evolution of intelligence or technology. Kurzweil chooses option 1), and while he makes an eloquent case for his choice it's far from airtight. Beetles have been evolving exactly as long as we have -- they're more successful than us by any evolutionary metric -- and yet they possess no intelligence.Kurzweil is at his best when he sticks to the predictions that his objective measures of price-performance of information technologies actually support, and these predictions really are awe-inspiring. We can say with great certainty that the years of the 2020s will in fact give rise to truly earth-moving, paradigm-shattering technologies as a result of cheap, ubiquitous computers. Kurzweil has a lot of specific examples, mostly concerning the augmentation of human intelligence and virtual reality interfaces for the brain, that are best read in the book itself.It's worth noting that Kurzweil doesn't seem to think that peak oil will affect his predictions in the least. James Kunstler's The Long Emergency Surviving the End of Oil, Climate Change, and Other Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty-First Century talks about the diminishing returns of technology, while Kurzweil posits the Law of Accelerating Returns. Clearly, one of these men is a pessimist and one an optimist. The question that concerns all of us is: who is right? I view the singularity and peak oil as a race, with the future of human civilization at stake. Can the exponential increase in technological progress replace our fossil fuel energy before Saudi production peaks? No one knows; Kurzweil is pretty bad at predicting specific applications of technology (he thought we would have glasses that use lasers to paint images onto our retinas by 2009), but his data on the exponential increase in price-performance in information technologies is so predictable as to be considered infallible. There's enough solar energy hitting this planet to replace our fossil fuel use and then some. Kunstler thinks we'll be unable to harness it as a civilization because of the how very little time we have until oil production peaks; but then, he clearly doesn't understand the exponential nature of progress, so his predictions are suspect. Kurzweil, on the other hand, is a self-admitted utopian optimist who sincerely believes that humankind's ascension to the stars is not just likely, but destined, preordained.So to reiterate: should you be investing in canned food or in nanotechnology companies (and virtual pornography firms, of course)? I can't tell you how to live your life, but my personal perspective on this dilemma is as follows: in 20 years we will either be living in the middle of the fantastic future promised by the Singularity; or we'll be back to an agrarian lifestyle and focused mainly on staying alive and killing our neighbors. Since the latter outcome, the total and near-irrevocable destruction of our way of life, is unthinkable, I prefer to believe in the former. In other words, I choose not to invest in canned food, because I can't imagine living in a world where I'll need it.I can't say I recommend this book very strongly, except for those who already have a strong interest in the Singularity. The subject matter is often fascinating and thought-provoking, but the presentation leaves much to be desired. Kurzweil rambles and repeats himself, and multiple times lets his narrative devolve into pages upon pages of bulleted lists. I'm sorry, Mr. Kurzweil, but I could have gotten that on Wikipedia."
64,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3037001-pamela,4,"It's tempting to call this book science fiction since its fundamental idea seems so far-fetched. Much can be said about this book, much has been said. I find it hard to write a review because this book is very big, in length and ideas. Kurzweil is a very smart man who has already made our lives better, he’s an inventor and coder. He developed electronic keyboards, text-to-speech readers, OCR and more. He’s very smart. He’s also written several books about the future, or where humans are headed. The Singularity is Near is nearly a decade old already, but hardly dated. There are a lot of charts that can be updated, but overall the book is still very relevant. I would encourage anyone to read the book. Warning it is not easy, the writing style is dense, sometimes dull. But it’s not quite as long as it appears with about 20% of the book being notes and index. The basic gist of the Singularity is three-fold: GNR. Genetics, Nanotechnology and Robotics, and everything is becoming information. How everything becomes information and the speed at which everything is going to change is due to Moore's Law, which is about exponential growth, and Kurzweil takes it a little further with “Law of Accelerating Returns.” We will have leaps of achievements and ability in genetics and along with nanotechnology, we will repair and renew our bodies, helping to extend our life span. Nanotechnology will end up allowing us to scan and reverse engineer our brain, and ultimately be able to transfer our consciousness (memories and personality) to another substrate, meaning a digital form. Smart A.I. and supercomputers will help us achieve this. After merging with computers, becoming biological and digital, we will have an infinite life-span as our consciousness, our individuality is preserved digitally. The end result is unknown, we as humans, will reach a Singularity where the unknown is unforeseeable because we just can't comprehend what is next. Okay, I probably butchered that summary, skipped a ton but yeah, it’s wild! It's all quite fascinating. Kurzweil thinks we are on the cusp of these revolutions and maybe the baby-boomer generation will see it if they take care of their bodies. People born after 1960 most likely will. Sure there are a lot of reasons to discount this future, and Kurzweil writes a full chapter on responding to critics. (The chapters are quite long!) Since the publication of his book The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence, which has similar ideas, Kurzweil had many critics, and he explains why they are wrong. The first few are the typical: disbelief this is possible, and what about rich/poor gap. He writes that all of this can be overcome, and will. Personally I think Kurzweil discounts a few things a little too readily, such as people or governments putting the brakes on this trend, as well as the rich and poor divide. As he is wealthy it may be hard for him to appreciate the difference between having money and barely surviving. He says that it is irrelevant since in the beginning technology is expensive and doesn't work well, only the rich buy the devices, but as the technology improves it goes through stages until it works great, is ubiquitous and practically free. Perhaps the great lifesaving and body improving technologies will work down to the poor masses but in the short time frame he claims I do have strong doubt. Using his law of accelerating returns, timelines shrink and he claims the time difference will be in a few years instead of decades that we see now. He uses AIDS drugs, cell phones and the internet as examples. Perhaps. All in all, it's a very optimistic outlook on the future of mankind. Take that in contrast to other outlooks, such as Jared Diamond, Thomas Friedman or the countless number of environmentalist's such as Bill McKibben. I have been steeped in those ideas and so this one of Kurzweil's I find quite hopeful. Kurzweil has been spot on with many of his predictions and quite a few of his critics don’t disagree with his conclusions, just the timeline, not never, just a matter of when. Did want to keep this short, but find it impossible. "
65,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86318-amy,2,"Hooooo, boy. Where do you even start with this thing?Stylistically, it has a lot of flaws. Super repetitive. Sputters out at the end, and then as an appendix he throws in a few equations. The hypothetical dialogues interspersed in the text are sometimes eye-rollingly lame, although, to be fair, they just as often directly responded to questions/criticisms the book had raised in my mind.I'm not sure who his audience is supposed to be. The math and theoretical physics stuff was not always sufficiently explained in that I, a fairly intelligent lay reader who at least has vague recollections of high school math and science, just couldn't follow significant portions of his supposed proof. I think most general readers would have the same problem.I don't have the computer science or math background to evaluate a lot of his assertions, so it is hard to tell how much is plausible, if far-fetched, and how much is pure crazy. I am perfectly willing to believe that at some point, advances in technology will render everyday life difficult to recognize. I am on board with the possibility that ""we will be cyborgs."" My mind started to close when he discussed how in a century or so we will have expanded into the galaxy and started spreading throughout the universe, and perhaps beyond, in search of more information processing capacity. While it is an interesting possibility, I'm unclear on how that process will work.His explanation for how a lot of this will be accomplished boils down to: ""We will be supersmart because our computers, with whom we will be merging, will also be supersmart, so while I don't know how we're going to do this, we'll figure it out."" Well, maybe, but you're going to have to do a little better than that.Also, what a dreary view of the future and our potential expansion into the stars. No learning about new environments, or learning about ourselves, really. Just a bunch of boring cyborgs goofing off in simulated environments and using up the materials of the universe (with apparently no thought given to who or what else might be using those materials) to make our processing units run better. And apparently the best use of this knowledge will be: (i) to live indefinitely, (ii) to be supersmart, and (iii) to hang out in virtual reality. What's the point of (i) and (ii) if all you're going to do with it is (iii)?He sort of tries to address, but doesn't really, how you are really alive if your ""consciousness"" is merged with a mechanical substrate while the physical you is stranded in meatspace. Maybe I am a selfish jerk, but I am more concerned about death because it means I won't be alive anymore, rather than because the world will be deprived of the privilege of interacting with me or an exact replica of my personality.He doesn't address more than in passing the real-world political obstacles to the supposed availability of cheap, unlimited resources he says is coming. Sure, sure, the big fossil fuel companies will totally stand by and not try to block cheap solar power, etc. They will cast aside their profit motives because ... more CPUs? I don't know. Similarly troubling is the author's lack of serious discussion of the fact that greater reliance on computers means less jobs. He seems to say that this is cool, because everything in the future will be really inexpensive, but this ignores his own point that information (software forming the patterns, for example, of all those nifty clothes we will create on 3D printers) will be the real commodity.Finally, he disregards some pretty obvious privacy concerns. People flip out about their Facebook settings, but within a century most people will be uploading/merging/sharing their actual consciousness online? He doesn't discuss any methods of or possible desire to keep any of the self separate from this collective consciousness, but wouldn't that be a huge concern for most people? Putting your drunk pictures on the internet is one thing, sharing your brain with the world quite another.For all of that, I did slog through the whole thing, and I kept talking about what I had read, so it definitely raised some interesting points. And I suspect at least some of the author's claims are on point (it was already pretty spot-on about on-board nav systems in cars). But from my (admittedly technically handicapped) viewpoint, it winds up somewhere off the rails."
66,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19648573-mark-locascio,2,"A lot of the reviews here seem to be saying ""it's complicated, so it must be profound."" This is not true. There is no reason for this book to be 650 pages long. Kurzweil's thesis is pretty straightforward: technology advances at an exponential pace. By that logic, there's reason to believe that nonbiological (i.e., computational) intelligence will eventually become much more advanced than human intelligence. This book is essentially Kurzweil's prediction for how great it'll be.I'm not fond of speculation about science... technology rarely evolves the way you think it will. But a well-crafted opinion would still be an interesting read. Unfortunately, this was not well-crafted. The book is long and rambling. There are wild detours that span dozens of pages. Academic research is misinterpreted and extrapolated well beyond what any real scientist would allow. The end-notes are a pain in the nads. The fixation on lactation and virtualized, gender-swapped sex adds nothing but confusion.The book isn't getting a poor review from me because I couldn't understand it. I did graduate research in both nanomechanics and robotics, two of the areas Kurzweil writes about for too many pages. I know enough to know that he's really stretching here. This book seemed like he'd had a lot of conversations with a lot of smart people, and wanted to publish as much of it as he could to appear knowledgeable himself. In the end, it just seemed like he didn't know which book he wanted to write, and wasn't qualified to write any of them.There was some good discussion of the ethics of artificial intelligence, I'll give him that. And for what it's worth, his predictions likely won't be completely wrong. But this book could have benefited quite a bit from a strong editorial influence or some peer-review. Skip it. Go browse his web site and save yourself about 600 pages."
67,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2683760-gary,4,"Rarely I read a book that truly blows my mind. This is one. Noted futurist Kurzweil lays out a radically different view of the future enabled by exponential development of artificial intelligence. A couple of the key milestones on the way to the future he envisions:-By 2029, computers will have advanced so far as to be able to pass a Turing test, which essentially means that they will be able to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of biological humans.-And by 2045, the ""singularity"", meaning merging of biological and non-biological humanity will be a reality.So the singularity is near, but not so near that is going to happen, say, next year. If Kurzweil is even half right, we are in for some incredible advances in genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics, his ""big three"" technological revolutions that will pave the way for the human-machine melding he sees coming.I can't say that I agree with everything presented here, but neither can I refute the powerful argument he makes for the path that our civilization appears to be on: after what will be only several hundred years of having machines in our lives, we basically will have developed them to the point where they are as smart as us, and very soon after that, nearly indescribably smarter than us. Take a listen/read, this is powerful stuff with all sorts of moral implications. It will make you think very hard about what may be to come in the future.**The narrator sounds a bit like one of the old Speak & Spell toys from the 1980s, which is kind of funny given the text-to-speech technology development that Kurzweil has been involved in."
68,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59510129-chris,3,"Kurzweil makes remarkably far-sighted predictions about humanity will change during our lifetimes. The very far-sighted analysis on physical limitation of computation is quite interesting, as are the predictions about the pre-singularity advances in genetics, nanotechnology and robotics. However, Kurzweil quickly dismisses two glaring issues with surprising immaturity. One, he claims that since technologies like self-replicating nanobots will become cheaper at an exponential rate, they will be ubiquitous among the poor seven years later than the rich, so access to resources will be democratized. This opposes all historical precedent and should not be dismissed without much stronger evidence. Two, he claims that Strong AI is not an existential threat because we can also develop a Strong AI immune system to defend against bad actors, and our immune systems work pretty well. He invokes his argument at least three times but fails to state the obvious that people’s immune systems fail sometimes, but we only get one universe. If a Strong AI immune system fails in a vastly interconnected system, it’s not just one person who dies, it’s everybody. Finally, I was disappointed by Kurzweil’s lack of discussion of the societal implications of inevitable rapid technological “progress.” For something that will affect the whole world, he focuses an awful lot on what it will mean for an individual - implicitly, one who can afford it."
69,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/136271-maria,2,"Predicting the future is always hard and Kurzweil whole hypothesis is that there is a point in the future when our technology will shift so dramatically that we can't imagine what it will be like. He then proceeds to explain just what it will be like. Why I started this book: Another audio from my professional reading list.Why I finished it: Good thing it was an audio, I kept a steady pace and wasn't drowned in the ridiculousness. Buddy Read: Where's My Jetpack?: A Guide to the Amazing Science Fiction Future That Never Arrived. The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology might have been more helpful/wonderful a decade ago... but I'm struggling now. That's the problem with predictions about future technology.

Or is it computers reaching human consciousness and far surpassing human capabilities in the immediate future? Actually he makes both claims and the fact that those massive changes are happening exponentially (Ray Kurzweil's Law of Accelerating Returns) in the next 20-30 years, is downright crazy to think of.You know what they say, ""extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"" and Kurzweil provides a fair amount of these and to his defense, in the 15 years that have passed since the publication of this book, several of these predictions (that I know of) have already been materialized. There is much to digest in this book and while the ideas are fascinating, the book itself is a hard read, with some repeated content (for clarity?) and tries to analyze in depth several subjects thus losing the reader's focus from time to time. Still, a classic if you want to dive into the ""Singularity is near"" trend."

Some people have said this book is the Bible of the Singularitianism as new religion.. and that felt true in the way it was mostly throwing affirmations into my face and asking me to just believe them (while implying that if I didn't, it was my own fault from not being enlightened enough)In summary : Glad i read it, gave me a lot to think about...

Among those three I fear an experiment with self-replicating nanobots gone wrong is the most likely to wipe us out. I also think that the time scale may be a bit off but that might just be me not being able to think in terms of exponential growth even though Kurzweil tries to teach me over and over again. It's inevitable that we will (continue to) improve ourselves through genetics, augment us with nanotechnology and invent artificial life and live as mainly information (or ""patterns""). Combinations of these will basically make us immortal and, in my opinion, still human but with way better control of our evolution. The singularity is coming. I just hope I won't miss it."

Even if it all will come to pass. Talking about future with today's terms seems frightful and terrifying, but I'd suggest to cross the bridge when we come to it. It's ok to speculate as a thought experiment, because it's also cool and exciting, but don't get an heart attack about something that doesn't make any sense with the current information.But that said, I cannot wait to get cheap quality replacement/upgrade parts to by biological organs.

The information is quite heavy and technical to digest from the first time (especially if you are a non-scientist). Second, Ray is of course brilliant, but there is just too much. It's like he is trying to write about everything, at the same time. Third, the future is scary. In the future, human will be part human part machine. Ray is trying to be optimistic about the convergence of both, but somehow shows only the positive sides of it. For example, even now we have medical technology that can do miracles but unless you have good insurance, you won't have access to it. So what are the guarantees that future advances in technology will be accessible to all, not just the richest 1 percent. Overall, most of the book is wishful thinking - or living in ones head."

I don't think he is off by much, but his optimistic predictions do not realistically account for political, economic and other social factors that can slow many of this down. When we landed on the moon, just ten years after the first man in space, everyone assumed much faster growth of space-faring technologies, but out political will was just not there, and 2001 Space Odyssey still remains a science fiction. However, I too strongly believe that a technological evolution of humankind is not too far off. The next hundred years is going to be the most exciting period for our species."

I do not agree with all what he has to say (technology is not available to all and will likely create as many problems as it solves, do we really want to become demi-gods, immortal and living only for intellectual pleasures?), but it sure is an interesting read."

It is well researched and chock full of ideas and an inherent optimism about the future, which is refreshing after reading so many bleak sci-fi novels (like mine).The writing is somewhat dry however, and very little commentary or opinion is presented, instead piling on facts, research, maths, and graphs. Also, the graphs are very difficult to read on a Kindle, it could have been formatted better."

Kurzweil is an inventor, not a scientist, and it shows in this book of his - he even harps on about how technology is ""an extension of biological evolution."" If you're looking for a well-grounded introduction to how weird, wonderful and dangerous this century will be, my list of recommendations would place The Singularity Is Near close to the bottom of the list."

He goes off the deep end in the middle but ends on a strong note.I still think he is overly optimistic about the reliability of complex software though, as well as his timeline for general AI. Finally, sometimes I think that our exponential progress might be slowed down a bit since some of this generations brightest minds work on social media apps and click bait instead of figuring out how to get to Mars.

I also found Ray Kurzweil's narrative and view of the future to be rather endearing, focusing on these exponential leaps and how humanity will transcend the bounds of biology and I am just READY for the transhumanist technocult.

Kurzweil compares the faster or exponential pace of technology compared to biological evolution and concluded that singularity , a vast growth in intelligence resulting in reshaping of the universe, is somewhere near 2045. His prediction is based on the eloquent comparison of slow biological intelligence growth compared to exponential technological intelligence. He argues that nanotechnology is an essential contributor to understand the brain and thereof advance in non biological intelligence based on the former information processing. I was fully immersed in this book especially when the author describes how human will overcome their biological limitations and become transbiological and then pure machines. The hypothetical debates between ethicists and materialists is captivating, the one between him, Darwin, Frued and Molly about consciousness is mind blowing . Whether his predictions are accurate or not, Ray is an ultimate genius and this book takes you into an intellectual journey, I will definitely read all his books."
91,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2021836-george,5,"HEAVY DISCLAIMER: this review will require a lot of repetition to stress a few important points. To properly convey the information will require that I take Kurzweil's side since I do not intend to do much in the way of refuting or debating his ideas.I have thoroughly enjoyed reading the predictions that Ray Kurzweil makes for the future of the human race. His track record of technological predictions to date has been very accurate and I expect that many of the things he forsees in this book will happen. But, I am also certain that many human beings are not ready for the technologies that he describes. Along the way to any potential technological Singularity, there will be a great deal of upheaval in many human arenas. Perhaps I should explain the notion of the Singularity first.The term is borrowed from a few disciplines and has multiple meanings within each of those fields. The general application of the term is a situation that describes a point beyond which anything is unknown. In math this is a formula with a solution so large as to be currently impossible to calculate but not infinite. In astrophysics this is what lies beyond the event horizon (the exact point where nothing can escape) of a black hole in space. In the case of the technological singularity it is the point where biological human technology surpasses the understanding of even the most brilliant humans.Kurzweil's overall belief is based upon his mathematical analysis of exponential growth of all information, from nature's DNA to the code behind Microsoft Windows and therefore ultimately information technology (not the IT profession). He's spent years developing formulas that have allowed him to safely make predictions about the core outcomes of information technology and he suggests that everything humans do is becoming information technology. This is already the case in the medical, entertainment and increasingly the manufacturing industries.But exponential growth is not limited to productivity. It also applies to world knowledge and the economy. Which are also information technologies. Technological growth affects world knowledge growth. We can easily see this in the much larger amount of information available to a larger segment of the world population thanks to the web. Indeed, I would not have been writing this review, nor would you be reading it now if the technologies that form the internet and support the web on top of it had not been developed. More world knowledge and information sharing also increase exponentially as well as bringing about new ideas and further technological progress. While there are still many who don't yet have access to the web, think about those who do today. People who didn't even have access to basic education only a decade or two ago now have access to a wide variety of information and educational opportunities that didn't exist a short time ago. This is one of Kurzweil's main points.The other point is that the exponential growth of technology combined with the exponential growth of world knowledge cause exponential growth of the world economy. Granted that there are currently many problems with the US economy, Kurzweil points to the surprisingly large numbers of people in developing nations who have come out of poverty just in the 15 years before he wrote this book. Like technological and knowledge growth, the expanding global economy provides more resources to further develop technology worldwide.Yet another point that he stresses is that the exponential growth of information technology is itself also grouwing exponentially. Where technological developments used to take decades to become reliable and widely used, the time has now shortened to less than a decade. Smart phones and digital music players are examples of faster development and adoption of new technologies. If his predictions are correct, technologies like this will continue to become reliable and ubiquitous in less than five years as we traverse the current decade.He spent more time discussing these things near the end of the book rather than the beginning. But I chose to explain them first to give you some concepts which may help you understand why he believes in the more startling predictions he makes for the 21st century. These predictions are not likely to sit well with many people and as a result they will either deny the possibility, or argue against them from the current day mindset.The Singularity is Near is a very information dense book. Nearly 500 pages are used to explain, postulate and defend the idea that the ultimate form that humanity will take is non-biological. He predicts that this will happen in the second half of the 21st century. So some of you reading this may live through this transformation. As much as it sounds like science fiction his predictions are well within the bounds of reality. For example, he suggests that as we replace more and more of our bodies with non-biological components (we already do this) our machines will simultaneously become less and less machine-like and more and more human. This will occur to such an extent that making the distinction between ""human"" and ""machine"" intelligence will eventually have no meaning.First let's talk about A.I. (artificial intelligence), which is the main technology that promises to give our machines human qualities. Many people believe that artificial intelligence, as a field of development is long dead. Kurzweil counters by pointing out the many things machines do today could only be accomplished with partial or complete human intervention just a decade or two ago. The fact is that A.I. has become so successful that, after A.I. becomes capable of performing yet another previously human only task, it appears completely unremarkable. A.I. has not failed but it is so commonplace in our day to day lives that no one notices, unless it malfunctions. A.I. research continues and makes more progress every year, so more gains of this nature lie in the future.One thing that really struck me while reading this book is that humanity is not ready for many of the things he predicts if you tell people outright what to expect. But, as they live through the changes as they occur, humans adapt. In many cases, people either wonder how they lived without the new technologies or at worst they grudgingly see the benefits, with only a few exceptions.Much as the industrial age shaped much of the late 19th and first half of the 20th century, Kurzweil believes that through the combination of genetics, nanotechnology and robotics the information age will define the first half of the 21st century. I say the first half because Kurzweil predicts that the Singularity will happen somewhere in the 2040s. This is when machines will surpass human beings and their capability for thought and emotion.The changes that I've personally observed over the past three decades are in keeping with his exponential models. The changes of just the past ten years have been considerably accelerated compared to the previous 20, and that's his point. Had you asked someone with little interest in electronics or computers only 25 years ago if they thought that they would ever own a pocket sized device that was a phone that worked almost anywhere and had A.I. in it that would spell check, predict words as they type and allow for hands free voice dialing and touch screens, many of those people would have thought you were reading from a science fiction novel. Between the years 2000 and 2010, I've seen wireless networking develop from large, slow clunky cards for PCs, to small wireless networking radios in SD cards for cameras about the size of a quarter. This is exactly the sort of accelerated change Kurzweil is describing.A philosophical issue that Kurzweil discusses is the concept of consciousness, or what makes us human. If humanity begins to replace biological components to the extent that everyone is eventually non-biological, can we say that they are no longerr human? If you really think so, then ask yourself, what is the cut off point for being human? Replacement of the heart? The brain? A certain fraction or percentage of cells? Kurzweil suggests that what makes us human is our minds including our emotions as well as our experiences and ideas. Because of this, he believes that even if we ""uploaded"" our minds into a virtual reality and were no longer physical, we would still be human. He knows that this will be one of the greater philosophical questions of th 21st century. One that may cause a lot of problems for humans as these changes happen.The other side of the equation are the machines we are building. Once our machines have emotional intelligence and can interact with us just like other humans, can we still say they aren't conscious? No one has developed a way to measure or detect consciousness in humans, so how can we say that intelligent machines that can think and feel like we do, aren't really conscious? Just these two views of consciousness are going to bring about a lot of difficult exchanges among humans and according to Kurzweil's time line, we're only 30 years away from the beginning of that era.Once again, this book is huge and covers a lot of ground. That makes writing a good summary and review quite difficult. I also don't want to give too much away about the book so that anyone interested will have some things to look forward to. But here are a few teasers. What would you think of a human who no longer has a heart or blood? How about clouds of nanomachines that create ephemeral physical manifestations in the real world of virtual items and intellects? Do you think the notion that a future intelligent race originated from humans will eventually have the power to create more computational devices out of the sun itself? Even the entire universe? Just these few hints at what is in the book should give you some idea why I think most people will not accept or relate to these ideas. I think he's pretty close to correct for many of his extrapolations, but there is no guarantee. If any of these ideas intrigue or disturb you, give the book a try."
92,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45322768-adam,5,"I've heard so much said about Ray Kurzweil over the years but never got around to reading this controversial book. I expected to read these fantastical predictions of a future with no basis in reality. Instead this book is a very thorough, well researched, well supported examination of progress and where it is almost certainly inevitably headed.To be sure, the book hasn't aged perfectly in the 14 years since its publication. Kurzweil makes predictions about advanced technologies which he believes will be commonplace as early as the 2020s and, now that the decade in question has started, it seems unlikely these will play out. In that sense, he is a bit optimistic but I don't think he's likely off by that much. His predictions of progress are based on reliable trends. The technologies he suggests are grounded in physical reality. There is no magical leap needed for everything to fall in place. By putting replication of the human mind as the path to the singularity we remove ourselves from the unpredictable path of some software breakthrough which may, or may not, occur first. While Kurweil may assume an aggressive timeline, the timeline itself does not seem to be in question.Kurweil is himself very open to the idea of modifying himself and humanity. I am absolutely on board with this and embrace the type of future he is detailing in these pages. Others I think may not be quite as open to the idea. While he downplays the resistance the average person may have to such things as life extension therapies, I think they will still come just perhaps at a slower pace than he thinks. Something being within our scientific reach doesn't mean it will happen. We've had the technology for human cloning for decades and haven't down anything with it. We currently have the ability to rewrite the human genome and it isn't getting much traction. While people are generally on board with a single life saving technology they don't seem to have much appetite for general life extension. It's a bit like AI. A lot of people are using AI to find solutions to specific problems but not many people are trying to make a general purpose human intelligent AI system. A lot of people are trying to cure cancer or any number of ailments but not a lot of people are looking into fundamentally extending life. Will it happen? Almost certainly. Will it happen in Ray Kurzweil's lifetime? I can't be sure. How many others have gone to the steps he has to extent their lives? Almost none.All around I love the author's approach. He studied computer programming and has an eye for the physical aspects of computing as well as the programming and algorithm side. He approaches a problem with a rational view of it. The book details things in a straightforward way. No doubt that computing will continue to advance. No doubt that nanotech will become more common. No doubt that models of the brain will become better and better. No doubt that we will soon have the computing ability to run a simulation of a mind. Will we be able to simulate a human mind on a computer? The only difficulty will be in scanning and replicating it. There is surely nothing magical about a brain which makes it impossible to duplicate on a computer!Is the Singularity Near? I don't know. I think it's coming, but it's hard to predict just when. Ray Kurzweil isn't pulling his predictions out of nowhere. He did the work and he's on the right track. For his sake as well as that of all of us, I hope it's soon!"
93,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1899624-zach,3,"This pseudo-religious, pseudo-scientific tome by one of the world's leading futurists lays out a timeline to a moment when the pace of technological innovation -- specifically, in the power of computer hardware and software -- becomes so rapid that, from our perspective in the present, it occupies a single point in time. Hence, the singularity.Kurzweil's predictions are based primarily upon an observation made by Gordon Moore of Intel: that computing power per dollar will double every 18 months. This isn't exactly what he said; it's actually an expression of transistor density. But the effect that consumers and Kurzweil care about is price-performance, which is doubling every 18 months. Kurzweil looks into the future and extrapolates that $1000 will buy you as much processing power as a human brain by the mid 2020s and more than all human brains in existence by the 2030s. More intriguingly, he also looks into the past and postulates an identical exponential progress, starting with the evolution of DNA and continuing on up through homo sapiens, agriculture, the wheel, and investment banking. This observation, that ""milestones"" in ""progress"" seem to be happening more frequently as time goes by, is the basis of his Law of Accelerating Returns, which is the cornerstone of his belief system. Basically, Kurzweil believes that all evolutionary systems, of which technology is one, increase their ""order"" exponentially. Therefore, it's no coincidence that it took 2 billion years for DNA to evolve, but then only 1 billion years for eukaryotes, then only 500 million years for multicellular organisms, and so on, each milestone occurring in half as much time as it took to achieve the one before it. For reference, see:Canoncial milestones in the SingularityThe foundation for his Law of Accelerating Returns is by far the weakest part of his argument for what the future will be like. He asserts that evolutionary systems inevitably increase their ""order"" exponentially, but never approaches a rigorous definition of the term. This hand-waving approach to his fundamental theory really comes to a head when he talks about the Fermi Paradox, the observation that intelligent life in the universe seems to be uncommon. This flies in the face of Kurzweil's thesis, which is that intelligence inevitably evolves from DNA up through brains through supercomputers, until eventually a civilization is converting all the matter and energy in the universe into one giant computational device at an exponential rate. If such a project is underway on behalf of some other intelligent race, they're being awfully quiet about it. Therefore, a futurist is forced to either 1) apply a universal anthropic principle: we must be the first intelligent (technology-creating) race in the universe; or 2) accept that there's nothing inevitable about the evolution of intelligence or technology. Kurzweil chooses option 1), and while he makes an eloquent case for his choice it's far from airtight. Beetles have been evolving exactly as long as we have -- they're more successful than us by any evolutionary metric -- and yet they possess no intelligence.Kurzweil is at his best when he sticks to the predictions that his objective measures of price-performance of information technologies actually support, and these predictions really are awe-inspiring. We can say with great certainty that the years of the 2020s will in fact give rise to truly earth-moving, paradigm-shattering technologies as a result of cheap, ubiquitous computers. Kurzweil has a lot of specific examples, mostly concerning the augmentation of human intelligence and virtual reality interfaces for the brain, that are best read in the book itself.It's worth noting that Kurzweil doesn't seem to think that peak oil will affect his predictions in the least. James Kunstler's The Long Emergency Surviving the End of Oil, Climate Change, and Other Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty-First Century talks about the diminishing returns of technology, while Kurzweil posits the Law of Accelerating Returns. Clearly, one of these men is a pessimist and one an optimist. The question that concerns all of us is: who is right? I view the singularity and peak oil as a race, with the future of human civilization at stake. Can the exponential increase in technological progress replace our fossil fuel energy before Saudi production peaks? No one knows; Kurzweil is pretty bad at predicting specific applications of technology (he thought we would have glasses that use lasers to paint images onto our retinas by 2009), but his data on the exponential increase in price-performance in information technologies is so predictable as to be considered infallible. There's enough solar energy hitting this planet to replace our fossil fuel use and then some. Kunstler thinks we'll be unable to harness it as a civilization because of the how very little time we have until oil production peaks; but then, he clearly doesn't understand the exponential nature of progress, so his predictions are suspect. Kurzweil, on the other hand, is a self-admitted utopian optimist who sincerely believes that humankind's ascension to the stars is not just likely, but destined, preordained.So to reiterate: should you be investing in canned food or in nanotechnology companies (and virtual pornography firms, of course)? I can't tell you how to live your life, but my personal perspective on this dilemma is as follows: in 20 years we will either be living in the middle of the fantastic future promised by the Singularity; or we'll be back to an agrarian lifestyle and focused mainly on staying alive and killing our neighbors. Since the latter outcome, the total and near-irrevocable destruction of our way of life, is unthinkable, I prefer to believe in the former. In other words, I choose not to invest in canned food, because I can't imagine living in a world where I'll need it.I can't say I recommend this book very strongly, except for those who already have a strong interest in the Singularity. The subject matter is often fascinating and thought-provoking, but the presentation leaves much to be desired. Kurzweil rambles and repeats himself, and multiple times lets his narrative devolve into pages upon pages of bulleted lists. I'm sorry, Mr. Kurzweil, but I could have gotten that on Wikipedia."
94,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3037001-pamela,4,"It's tempting to call this book science fiction since its fundamental idea seems so far-fetched. Much can be said about this book, much has been said. I find it hard to write a review because this book is very big, in length and ideas. Kurzweil is a very smart man who has already made our lives better, he’s an inventor and coder. He developed electronic keyboards, text-to-speech readers, OCR and more. He’s very smart. He’s also written several books about the future, or where humans are headed. The Singularity is Near is nearly a decade old already, but hardly dated. There are a lot of charts that can be updated, but overall the book is still very relevant. I would encourage anyone to read the book. Warning it is not easy, the writing style is dense, sometimes dull. But it’s not quite as long as it appears with about 20% of the book being notes and index. The basic gist of the Singularity is three-fold: GNR. Genetics, Nanotechnology and Robotics, and everything is becoming information. How everything becomes information and the speed at which everything is going to change is due to Moore's Law, which is about exponential growth, and Kurzweil takes it a little further with “Law of Accelerating Returns.” We will have leaps of achievements and ability in genetics and along with nanotechnology, we will repair and renew our bodies, helping to extend our life span. Nanotechnology will end up allowing us to scan and reverse engineer our brain, and ultimately be able to transfer our consciousness (memories and personality) to another substrate, meaning a digital form. Smart A.I. and supercomputers will help us achieve this. After merging with computers, becoming biological and digital, we will have an infinite life-span as our consciousness, our individuality is preserved digitally. The end result is unknown, we as humans, will reach a Singularity where the unknown is unforeseeable because we just can't comprehend what is next. Okay, I probably butchered that summary, skipped a ton but yeah, it’s wild! It's all quite fascinating. Kurzweil thinks we are on the cusp of these revolutions and maybe the baby-boomer generation will see it if they take care of their bodies. People born after 1960 most likely will. Sure there are a lot of reasons to discount this future, and Kurzweil writes a full chapter on responding to critics. (The chapters are quite long!) Since the publication of his book The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence, which has similar ideas, Kurzweil had many critics, and he explains why they are wrong. The first few are the typical: disbelief this is possible, and what about rich/poor gap. He writes that all of this can be overcome, and will. Personally I think Kurzweil discounts a few things a little too readily, such as people or governments putting the brakes on this trend, as well as the rich and poor divide. As he is wealthy it may be hard for him to appreciate the difference between having money and barely surviving. He says that it is irrelevant since in the beginning technology is expensive and doesn't work well, only the rich buy the devices, but as the technology improves it goes through stages until it works great, is ubiquitous and practically free. Perhaps the great lifesaving and body improving technologies will work down to the poor masses but in the short time frame he claims I do have strong doubt. Using his law of accelerating returns, timelines shrink and he claims the time difference will be in a few years instead of decades that we see now. He uses AIDS drugs, cell phones and the internet as examples. Perhaps. All in all, it's a very optimistic outlook on the future of mankind. Take that in contrast to other outlooks, such as Jared Diamond, Thomas Friedman or the countless number of environmentalist's such as Bill McKibben. I have been steeped in those ideas and so this one of Kurzweil's I find quite hopeful. Kurzweil has been spot on with many of his predictions and quite a few of his critics don’t disagree with his conclusions, just the timeline, not never, just a matter of when. Did want to keep this short, but find it impossible. "
95,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86318-amy,2,"Hooooo, boy. Where do you even start with this thing?Stylistically, it has a lot of flaws. Super repetitive. Sputters out at the end, and then as an appendix he throws in a few equations. The hypothetical dialogues interspersed in the text are sometimes eye-rollingly lame, although, to be fair, they just as often directly responded to questions/criticisms the book had raised in my mind.I'm not sure who his audience is supposed to be. The math and theoretical physics stuff was not always sufficiently explained in that I, a fairly intelligent lay reader who at least has vague recollections of high school math and science, just couldn't follow significant portions of his supposed proof. I think most general readers would have the same problem.I don't have the computer science or math background to evaluate a lot of his assertions, so it is hard to tell how much is plausible, if far-fetched, and how much is pure crazy. I am perfectly willing to believe that at some point, advances in technology will render everyday life difficult to recognize. I am on board with the possibility that ""we will be cyborgs."" My mind started to close when he discussed how in a century or so we will have expanded into the galaxy and started spreading throughout the universe, and perhaps beyond, in search of more information processing capacity. While it is an interesting possibility, I'm unclear on how that process will work.His explanation for how a lot of this will be accomplished boils down to: ""We will be supersmart because our computers, with whom we will be merging, will also be supersmart, so while I don't know how we're going to do this, we'll figure it out."" Well, maybe, but you're going to have to do a little better than that.Also, what a dreary view of the future and our potential expansion into the stars. No learning about new environments, or learning about ourselves, really. Just a bunch of boring cyborgs goofing off in simulated environments and using up the materials of the universe (with apparently no thought given to who or what else might be using those materials) to make our processing units run better. And apparently the best use of this knowledge will be: (i) to live indefinitely, (ii) to be supersmart, and (iii) to hang out in virtual reality. What's the point of (i) and (ii) if all you're going to do with it is (iii)?He sort of tries to address, but doesn't really, how you are really alive if your ""consciousness"" is merged with a mechanical substrate while the physical you is stranded in meatspace. Maybe I am a selfish jerk, but I am more concerned about death because it means I won't be alive anymore, rather than because the world will be deprived of the privilege of interacting with me or an exact replica of my personality.He doesn't address more than in passing the real-world political obstacles to the supposed availability of cheap, unlimited resources he says is coming. Sure, sure, the big fossil fuel companies will totally stand by and not try to block cheap solar power, etc. They will cast aside their profit motives because ... more CPUs? I don't know. Similarly troubling is the author's lack of serious discussion of the fact that greater reliance on computers means less jobs. He seems to say that this is cool, because everything in the future will be really inexpensive, but this ignores his own point that information (software forming the patterns, for example, of all those nifty clothes we will create on 3D printers) will be the real commodity.Finally, he disregards some pretty obvious privacy concerns. People flip out about their Facebook settings, but within a century most people will be uploading/merging/sharing their actual consciousness online? He doesn't discuss any methods of or possible desire to keep any of the self separate from this collective consciousness, but wouldn't that be a huge concern for most people? Putting your drunk pictures on the internet is one thing, sharing your brain with the world quite another.For all of that, I did slog through the whole thing, and I kept talking about what I had read, so it definitely raised some interesting points. And I suspect at least some of the author's claims are on point (it was already pretty spot-on about on-board nav systems in cars). But from my (admittedly technically handicapped) viewpoint, it winds up somewhere off the rails."
96,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19648573-mark-locascio,2,"A lot of the reviews here seem to be saying ""it's complicated, so it must be profound."" This is not true. There is no reason for this book to be 650 pages long. Kurzweil's thesis is pretty straightforward: technology advances at an exponential pace. By that logic, there's reason to believe that nonbiological (i.e., computational) intelligence will eventually become much more advanced than human intelligence. This book is essentially Kurzweil's prediction for how great it'll be.I'm not fond of speculation about science... technology rarely evolves the way you think it will. But a well-crafted opinion would still be an interesting read. Unfortunately, this was not well-crafted. The book is long and rambling. There are wild detours that span dozens of pages. Academic research is misinterpreted and extrapolated well beyond what any real scientist would allow. The end-notes are a pain in the nads. The fixation on lactation and virtualized, gender-swapped sex adds nothing but confusion.The book isn't getting a poor review from me because I couldn't understand it. I did graduate research in both nanomechanics and robotics, two of the areas Kurzweil writes about for too many pages. I know enough to know that he's really stretching here. This book seemed like he'd had a lot of conversations with a lot of smart people, and wanted to publish as much of it as he could to appear knowledgeable himself. In the end, it just seemed like he didn't know which book he wanted to write, and wasn't qualified to write any of them.There was some good discussion of the ethics of artificial intelligence, I'll give him that. And for what it's worth, his predictions likely won't be completely wrong. But this book could have benefited quite a bit from a strong editorial influence or some peer-review. Skip it. Go browse his web site and save yourself about 600 pages."
97,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2683760-gary,4,"Rarely I read a book that truly blows my mind. This is one. Noted futurist Kurzweil lays out a radically different view of the future enabled by exponential development of artificial intelligence. A couple of the key milestones on the way to the future he envisions:-By 2029, computers will have advanced so far as to be able to pass a Turing test, which essentially means that they will be able to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of biological humans.-And by 2045, the ""singularity"", meaning merging of biological and non-biological humanity will be a reality.So the singularity is near, but not so near that is going to happen, say, next year. If Kurzweil is even half right, we are in for some incredible advances in genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics, his ""big three"" technological revolutions that will pave the way for the human-machine melding he sees coming.I can't say that I agree with everything presented here, but neither can I refute the powerful argument he makes for the path that our civilization appears to be on: after what will be only several hundred years of having machines in our lives, we basically will have developed them to the point where they are as smart as us, and very soon after that, nearly indescribably smarter than us. Take a listen/read, this is powerful stuff with all sorts of moral implications. It will make you think very hard about what may be to come in the future.**The narrator sounds a bit like one of the old Speak & Spell toys from the 1980s, which is kind of funny given the text-to-speech technology development that Kurzweil has been involved in."
98,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59510129-chris,3,"Kurzweil makes remarkably far-sighted predictions about humanity will change during our lifetimes. The very far-sighted analysis on physical limitation of computation is quite interesting, as are the predictions about the pre-singularity advances in genetics, nanotechnology and robotics. However, Kurzweil quickly dismisses two glaring issues with surprising immaturity. One, he claims that since technologies like self-replicating nanobots will become cheaper at an exponential rate, they will be ubiquitous among the poor seven years later than the rich, so access to resources will be democratized. This opposes all historical precedent and should not be dismissed without much stronger evidence. Two, he claims that Strong AI is not an existential threat because we can also develop a Strong AI immune system to defend against bad actors, and our immune systems work pretty well. He invokes his argument at least three times but fails to state the obvious that people’s immune systems fail sometimes, but we only get one universe. If a Strong AI immune system fails in a vastly interconnected system, it’s not just one person who dies, it’s everybody. Finally, I was disappointed by Kurzweil’s lack of discussion of the societal implications of inevitable rapid technological “progress.” For something that will affect the whole world, he focuses an awful lot on what it will mean for an individual - implicitly, one who can afford it."
99,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/136271-maria,2,"Predicting the future is always hard and Kurzweil whole hypothesis is that there is a point in the future when our technology will shift so dramatically that we can't imagine what it will be like. He then proceeds to explain just what it will be like. Why I started this book: Another audio from my professional reading list.Why I finished it: Good thing it was an audio, I kept a steady pace and wasn't drowned in the ridiculousness. Buddy Read: Where's My Jetpack?: A Guide to the Amazing Science Fiction Future That Never Arrived. The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology might have been more helpful/wonderful a decade ago... but I'm struggling now. That's the problem with predictions about future technology.

100,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47739629-stefanos,3,"Kurzweil has strong points justifying his (calculated) predictions about us primates rapidly transcending to a (much) higher and more capable species through the help of technology. Or is it computers reaching human consciousness and far surpassing human capabilities in the immediate future? Actually he makes both claims and the fact that those massive changes are happening exponentially (Ray Kurzweil's Law of Accelerating Returns) in the next 20-30 years, is downright crazy to think of.You know what they say, ""extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"" and Kurzweil provides a fair amount of these and to his defense, in the 15 years that have passed since the publication of this book, several of these predictions (that I know of) have already been materialized. There is much to digest in this book and while the ideas are fascinating, the book itself is a hard read, with some repeated content (for clarity?) and tries to analyze in depth several subjects thus losing the reader's focus from time to time. Still, a classic if you want to dive into the ""Singularity is near"" trend."

Some people have said this book is the Bible of the Singularitianism as new religion.. and that felt true in the way it was mostly throwing affirmations into my face and asking me to just believe them (while implying that if I didn't, it was my own fault from not being enlightened enough)In summary : Glad i read it, gave me a lot to think about...

Among those three I fear an experiment with self-replicating nanobots gone wrong is the most likely to wipe us out. I also think that the time scale may be a bit off but that might just be me not being able to think in terms of exponential growth even though Kurzweil tries to teach me over and over again. It's inevitable that we will (continue to) improve ourselves through genetics, augment us with nanotechnology and invent artificial life and live as mainly information (or ""patterns""). Combinations of these will basically make us immortal and, in my opinion, still human but with way better control of our evolution. The singularity is coming. I just hope I won't miss it."

Even if it all will come to pass. Talking about future with today's terms seems frightful and terrifying, but I'd suggest to cross the bridge when we come to it. It's ok to speculate as a thought experiment, because it's also cool and exciting, but don't get an heart attack about something that doesn't make any sense with the current information.But that said, I cannot wait to get cheap quality replacement/upgrade parts to by biological organs.

The information is quite heavy and technical to digest from the first time (especially if you are a non-scientist). Second, Ray is of course brilliant, but there is just too much. It's like he is trying to write about everything, at the same time. Third, the future is scary. In the future, human will be part human part machine. Ray is trying to be optimistic about the convergence of both, but somehow shows only the positive sides of it. For example, even now we have medical technology that can do miracles but unless you have good insurance, you won't have access to it. So what are the guarantees that future advances in technology will be accessible to all, not just the richest 1 percent. Overall, most of the book is wishful thinking - or living in ones head."

I don't think he is off by much, but his optimistic predictions do not realistically account for political, economic and other social factors that can slow many of this down. When we landed on the moon, just ten years after the first man in space, everyone assumed much faster growth of space-faring technologies, but out political will was just not there, and 2001 Space Odyssey still remains a science fiction. However, I too strongly believe that a technological evolution of humankind is not too far off. The next hundred years is going to be the most exciting period for our species."

I do not agree with all what he has to say (technology is not available to all and will likely create as many problems as it solves, do we really want to become demi-gods, immortal and living only for intellectual pleasures?), but it sure is an interesting read."

It is well researched and chock full of ideas and an inherent optimism about the future, which is refreshing after reading so many bleak sci-fi novels (like mine).The writing is somewhat dry however, and very little commentary or opinion is presented, instead piling on facts, research, maths, and graphs.

Also, missed exploring the dangers and philosophical issues of GNR too a wider extent (that’s why Nick Bostrom’s book is next on the list)."
118,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53431386-mihai-pop,2,"For a long run on the potential progress for the post-AI humanity, this book should have served well for a 10-year old kid, but for me it missed almost completely the point. The ideas got stuck to the reasons of post-AI intelligence to get more intelligent, and there seemed to be no idea of why? Oh well, if you have to read this book, do it anyway, is not that bad, but other ways, you won't have missed that much."
119,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3112-scott-lerch,4,"This book was basically a denser, more detailed, and less fun version of Ray Kurzweil's The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence. It's still good though and has more interesting discuessions about the ultimate limits of computing and the universe but didn't conjure up the same excitement as his previous book."
120,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34455515-omran-antar,5,"Outstanding book, it left more intrigued about AI and human spirit longing to progress. Kurzweil compares the faster or exponential pace of technology compared to biological evolution and concluded that singularity , a vast growth in intelligence resulting in reshaping of the universe, is somewhere near 2045. His prediction is based on the eloquent comparison of slow biological intelligence growth compared to exponential technological intelligence. He argues that nanotechnology is an essential contributor to understand the brain and thereof advance in non biological intelligence based on the former information processing. I was fully immersed in this book especially when the author describes how human will overcome their biological limitations and become transbiological and then pure machines. The hypothetical debates between ethicists and materialists is captivating, the one between him, Darwin, Frued and Molly about consciousness is mind blowing . Whether his predictions are accurate or not, Ray is an ultimate genius and this book takes you into an intellectual journey, I will definitely read all his books."
121,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2021836-george,5,"HEAVY DISCLAIMER: this review will require a lot of repetition to stress a few important points. To properly convey the information will require that I take Kurzweil's side since I do not intend to do much in the way of refuting or debating his ideas.I have thoroughly enjoyed reading the predictions that Ray Kurzweil makes for the future of the human race. His track record of technological predictions to date has been very accurate and I expect that many of the things he forsees in this book will happen. But, I am also certain that many human beings are not ready for the technologies that he describes. Along the way to any potential technological Singularity, there will be a great deal of upheaval in many human arenas. Perhaps I should explain the notion of the Singularity first.The term is borrowed from a few disciplines and has multiple meanings within each of those fields. The general application of the term is a situation that describes a point beyond which anything is unknown. In math this is a formula with a solution so large as to be currently impossible to calculate but not infinite. In astrophysics this is what lies beyond the event horizon (the exact point where nothing can escape) of a black hole in space. In the case of the technological singularity it is the point where biological human technology surpasses the understanding of even the most brilliant humans.Kurzweil's overall belief is based upon his mathematical analysis of exponential growth of all information, from nature's DNA to the code behind Microsoft Windows and therefore ultimately information technology (not the IT profession). He's spent years developing formulas that have allowed him to safely make predictions about the core outcomes of information technology and he suggests that everything humans do is becoming information technology. This is already the case in the medical, entertainment and increasingly the manufacturing industries.But exponential growth is not limited to productivity. It also applies to world knowledge and the economy. Which are also information technologies. Technological growth affects world knowledge growth. We can easily see this in the much larger amount of information available to a larger segment of the world population thanks to the web. Indeed, I would not have been writing this review, nor would you be reading it now if the technologies that form the internet and support the web on top of it had not been developed. More world knowledge and information sharing also increase exponentially as well as bringing about new ideas and further technological progress. While there are still many who don't yet have access to the web, think about those who do today. People who didn't even have access to basic education only a decade or two ago now have access to a wide variety of information and educational opportunities that didn't exist a short time ago. This is one of Kurzweil's main points.The other point is that the exponential growth of technology combined with the exponential growth of world knowledge cause exponential growth of the world economy. Granted that there are currently many problems with the US economy, Kurzweil points to the surprisingly large numbers of people in developing nations who have come out of poverty just in the 15 years before he wrote this book. Like technological and knowledge growth, the expanding global economy provides more resources to further develop technology worldwide.Yet another point that he stresses is that the exponential growth of information technology is itself also grouwing exponentially. Where technological developments used to take decades to become reliable and widely used, the time has now shortened to less than a decade. Smart phones and digital music players are examples of faster development and adoption of new technologies. If his predictions are correct, technologies like this will continue to become reliable and ubiquitous in less than five years as we traverse the current decade.He spent more time discussing these things near the end of the book rather than the beginning. But I chose to explain them first to give you some concepts which may help you understand why he believes in the more startling predictions he makes for the 21st century. These predictions are not likely to sit well with many people and as a result they will either deny the possibility, or argue against them from the current day mindset.The Singularity is Near is a very information dense book. Nearly 500 pages are used to explain, postulate and defend the idea that the ultimate form that humanity will take is non-biological. He predicts that this will happen in the second half of the 21st century. So some of you reading this may live through this transformation. As much as it sounds like science fiction his predictions are well within the bounds of reality. For example, he suggests that as we replace more and more of our bodies with non-biological components (we already do this) our machines will simultaneously become less and less machine-like and more and more human. This will occur to such an extent that making the distinction between ""human"" and ""machine"" intelligence will eventually have no meaning.First let's talk about A.I. (artificial intelligence), which is the main technology that promises to give our machines human qualities. Many people believe that artificial intelligence, as a field of development is long dead. Kurzweil counters by pointing out the many things machines do today could only be accomplished with partial or complete human intervention just a decade or two ago. The fact is that A.I. has become so successful that, after A.I. becomes capable of performing yet another previously human only task, it appears completely unremarkable. A.I. has not failed but it is so commonplace in our day to day lives that no one notices, unless it malfunctions. A.I. research continues and makes more progress every year, so more gains of this nature lie in the future.One thing that really struck me while reading this book is that humanity is not ready for many of the things he predicts if you tell people outright what to expect. But, as they live through the changes as they occur, humans adapt. In many cases, people either wonder how they lived without the new technologies or at worst they grudgingly see the benefits, with only a few exceptions.Much as the industrial age shaped much of the late 19th and first half of the 20th century, Kurzweil believes that through the combination of genetics, nanotechnology and robotics the information age will define the first half of the 21st century. I say the first half because Kurzweil predicts that the Singularity will happen somewhere in the 2040s. This is when machines will surpass human beings and their capability for thought and emotion.The changes that I've personally observed over the past three decades are in keeping with his exponential models. The changes of just the past ten years have been considerably accelerated compared to the previous 20, and that's his point. Had you asked someone with little interest in electronics or computers only 25 years ago if they thought that they would ever own a pocket sized device that was a phone that worked almost anywhere and had A.I. in it that would spell check, predict words as they type and allow for hands free voice dialing and touch screens, many of those people would have thought you were reading from a science fiction novel. Between the years 2000 and 2010, I've seen wireless networking develop from large, slow clunky cards for PCs, to small wireless networking radios in SD cards for cameras about the size of a quarter. This is exactly the sort of accelerated change Kurzweil is describing.A philosophical issue that Kurzweil discusses is the concept of consciousness, or what makes us human. If humanity begins to replace biological components to the extent that everyone is eventually non-biological, can we say that they are no longerr human? If you really think so, then ask yourself, what is the cut off point for being human? Replacement of the heart? The brain? A certain fraction or percentage of cells? Kurzweil suggests that what makes us human is our minds including our emotions as well as our experiences and ideas. Because of this, he believes that even if we ""uploaded"" our minds into a virtual reality and were no longer physical, we would still be human. He knows that this will be one of the greater philosophical questions of th 21st century. One that may cause a lot of problems for humans as these changes happen.The other side of the equation are the machines we are building. Once our machines have emotional intelligence and can interact with us just like other humans, can we still say they aren't conscious? No one has developed a way to measure or detect consciousness in humans, so how can we say that intelligent machines that can think and feel like we do, aren't really conscious? Just these two views of consciousness are going to bring about a lot of difficult exchanges among humans and according to Kurzweil's time line, we're only 30 years away from the beginning of that era.Once again, this book is huge and covers a lot of ground. That makes writing a good summary and review quite difficult. I also don't want to give too much away about the book so that anyone interested will have some things to look forward to. But here are a few teasers. What would you think of a human who no longer has a heart or blood? How about clouds of nanomachines that create ephemeral physical manifestations in the real world of virtual items and intellects? Do you think the notion that a future intelligent race originated from humans will eventually have the power to create more computational devices out of the sun itself? Even the entire universe? Just these few hints at what is in the book should give you some idea why I think most people will not accept or relate to these ideas. I think he's pretty close to correct for many of his extrapolations, but there is no guarantee. If any of these ideas intrigue or disturb you, give the book a try."
122,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45322768-adam,5,"I've heard so much said about Ray Kurzweil over the years but never got around to reading this controversial book. I expected to read these fantastical predictions of a future with no basis in reality. Instead this book is a very thorough, well researched, well supported examination of progress and where it is almost certainly inevitably headed.To be sure, the book hasn't aged perfectly in the 14 years since its publication. Kurzweil makes predictions about advanced technologies which he believes will be commonplace as early as the 2020s and, now that the decade in question has started, it seems unlikely these will play out. In that sense, he is a bit optimistic but I don't think he's likely off by that much. His predictions of progress are based on reliable trends. The technologies he suggests are grounded in physical reality. There is no magical leap needed for everything to fall in place. By putting replication of the human mind as the path to the singularity we remove ourselves from the unpredictable path of some software breakthrough which may, or may not, occur first. While Kurweil may assume an aggressive timeline, the timeline itself does not seem to be in question.Kurweil is himself very open to the idea of modifying himself and humanity. I am absolutely on board with this and embrace the type of future he is detailing in these pages. Others I think may not be quite as open to the idea. While he downplays the resistance the average person may have to such things as life extension therapies, I think they will still come just perhaps at a slower pace than he thinks. Something being within our scientific reach doesn't mean it will happen. We've had the technology for human cloning for decades and haven't down anything with it. We currently have the ability to rewrite the human genome and it isn't getting much traction. While people are generally on board with a single life saving technology they don't seem to have much appetite for general life extension. It's a bit like AI. A lot of people are using AI to find solutions to specific problems but not many people are trying to make a general purpose human intelligent AI system. A lot of people are trying to cure cancer or any number of ailments but not a lot of people are looking into fundamentally extending life. Will it happen? Almost certainly. Will it happen in Ray Kurzweil's lifetime? I can't be sure. How many others have gone to the steps he has to extent their lives? Almost none.All around I love the author's approach. He studied computer programming and has an eye for the physical aspects of computing as well as the programming and algorithm side. He approaches a problem with a rational view of it. The book details things in a straightforward way. No doubt that computing will continue to advance. No doubt that nanotech will become more common. No doubt that models of the brain will become better and better. No doubt that we will soon have the computing ability to run a simulation of a mind. Will we be able to simulate a human mind on a computer? The only difficulty will be in scanning and replicating it. There is surely nothing magical about a brain which makes it impossible to duplicate on a computer!Is the Singularity Near? I don't know. I think it's coming, but it's hard to predict just when. Ray Kurzweil isn't pulling his predictions out of nowhere. He did the work and he's on the right track. For his sake as well as that of all of us, I hope it's soon!"
123,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1899624-zach,3,"This pseudo-religious, pseudo-scientific tome by one of the world's leading futurists lays out a timeline to a moment when the pace of technological innovation -- specifically, in the power of computer hardware and software -- becomes so rapid that, from our perspective in the present, it occupies a single point in time. Hence, the singularity.Kurzweil's predictions are based primarily upon an observation made by Gordon Moore of Intel: that computing power per dollar will double every 18 months. This isn't exactly what he said; it's actually an expression of transistor density. But the effect that consumers and Kurzweil care about is price-performance, which is doubling every 18 months. Kurzweil looks into the future and extrapolates that $1000 will buy you as much processing power as a human brain by the mid 2020s and more than all human brains in existence by the 2030s. More intriguingly, he also looks into the past and postulates an identical exponential progress, starting with the evolution of DNA and continuing on up through homo sapiens, agriculture, the wheel, and investment banking. This observation, that ""milestones"" in ""progress"" seem to be happening more frequently as time goes by, is the basis of his Law of Accelerating Returns, which is the cornerstone of his belief system. Basically, Kurzweil believes that all evolutionary systems, of which technology is one, increase their ""order"" exponentially. Therefore, it's no coincidence that it took 2 billion years for DNA to evolve, but then only 1 billion years for eukaryotes, then only 500 million years for multicellular organisms, and so on, each milestone occurring in half as much time as it took to achieve the one before it. For reference, see:Canoncial milestones in the SingularityThe foundation for his Law of Accelerating Returns is by far the weakest part of his argument for what the future will be like. He asserts that evolutionary systems inevitably increase their ""order"" exponentially, but never approaches a rigorous definition of the term. This hand-waving approach to his fundamental theory really comes to a head when he talks about the Fermi Paradox, the observation that intelligent life in the universe seems to be uncommon. This flies in the face of Kurzweil's thesis, which is that intelligence inevitably evolves from DNA up through brains through supercomputers, until eventually a civilization is converting all the matter and energy in the universe into one giant computational device at an exponential rate. If such a project is underway on behalf of some other intelligent race, they're being awfully quiet about it. Therefore, a futurist is forced to either 1) apply a universal anthropic principle: we must be the first intelligent (technology-creating) race in the universe; or 2) accept that there's nothing inevitable about the evolution of intelligence or technology. Kurzweil chooses option 1), and while he makes an eloquent case for his choice it's far from airtight. Beetles have been evolving exactly as long as we have -- they're more successful than us by any evolutionary metric -- and yet they possess no intelligence.Kurzweil is at his best when he sticks to the predictions that his objective measures of price-performance of information technologies actually support, and these predictions really are awe-inspiring. We can say with great certainty that the years of the 2020s will in fact give rise to truly earth-moving, paradigm-shattering technologies as a result of cheap, ubiquitous computers. Kurzweil has a lot of specific examples, mostly concerning the augmentation of human intelligence and virtual reality interfaces for the brain, that are best read in the book itself.It's worth noting that Kurzweil doesn't seem to think that peak oil will affect his predictions in the least. James Kunstler's The Long Emergency Surviving the End of Oil, Climate Change, and Other Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty-First Century talks about the diminishing returns of technology, while Kurzweil posits the Law of Accelerating Returns. Clearly, one of these men is a pessimist and one an optimist. The question that concerns all of us is: who is right? I view the singularity and peak oil as a race, with the future of human civilization at stake. Can the exponential increase in technological progress replace our fossil fuel energy before Saudi production peaks? No one knows; Kurzweil is pretty bad at predicting specific applications of technology (he thought we would have glasses that use lasers to paint images onto our retinas by 2009), but his data on the exponential increase in price-performance in information technologies is so predictable as to be considered infallible. There's enough solar energy hitting this planet to replace our fossil fuel use and then some. Kunstler thinks we'll be unable to harness it as a civilization because of the how very little time we have until oil production peaks; but then, he clearly doesn't understand the exponential nature of progress, so his predictions are suspect. Kurzweil, on the other hand, is a self-admitted utopian optimist who sincerely believes that humankind's ascension to the stars is not just likely, but destined, preordained.So to reiterate: should you be investing in canned food or in nanotechnology companies (and virtual pornography firms, of course)? I can't tell you how to live your life, but my personal perspective on this dilemma is as follows: in 20 years we will either be living in the middle of the fantastic future promised by the Singularity; or we'll be back to an agrarian lifestyle and focused mainly on staying alive and killing our neighbors. Since the latter outcome, the total and near-irrevocable destruction of our way of life, is unthinkable, I prefer to believe in the former. In other words, I choose not to invest in canned food, because I can't imagine living in a world where I'll need it.I can't say I recommend this book very strongly, except for those who already have a strong interest in the Singularity. The subject matter is often fascinating and thought-provoking, but the presentation leaves much to be desired. Kurzweil rambles and repeats himself, and multiple times lets his narrative devolve into pages upon pages of bulleted lists. I'm sorry, Mr. Kurzweil, but I could have gotten that on Wikipedia."
124,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3037001-pamela,4,"It's tempting to call this book science fiction since its fundamental idea seems so far-fetched. Much can be said about this book, much has been said. I find it hard to write a review because this book is very big, in length and ideas. Kurzweil is a very smart man who has already made our lives better, he’s an inventor and coder. He developed electronic keyboards, text-to-speech readers, OCR and more. He’s very smart. He’s also written several books about the future, or where humans are headed. The Singularity is Near is nearly a decade old already, but hardly dated. There are a lot of charts that can be updated, but overall the book is still very relevant. I would encourage anyone to read the book. Warning it is not easy, the writing style is dense, sometimes dull. But it’s not quite as long as it appears with about 20% of the book being notes and index. The basic gist of the Singularity is three-fold: GNR. Genetics, Nanotechnology and Robotics, and everything is becoming information. How everything becomes information and the speed at which everything is going to change is due to Moore's Law, which is about exponential growth, and Kurzweil takes it a little further with “Law of Accelerating Returns.” We will have leaps of achievements and ability in genetics and along with nanotechnology, we will repair and renew our bodies, helping to extend our life span. Nanotechnology will end up allowing us to scan and reverse engineer our brain, and ultimately be able to transfer our consciousness (memories and personality) to another substrate, meaning a digital form. Smart A.I. and supercomputers will help us achieve this. After merging with computers, becoming biological and digital, we will have an infinite life-span as our consciousness, our individuality is preserved digitally. The end result is unknown, we as humans, will reach a Singularity where the unknown is unforeseeable because we just can't comprehend what is next. Okay, I probably butchered that summary, skipped a ton but yeah, it’s wild! It's all quite fascinating. Kurzweil thinks we are on the cusp of these revolutions and maybe the baby-boomer generation will see it if they take care of their bodies. People born after 1960 most likely will. Sure there are a lot of reasons to discount this future, and Kurzweil writes a full chapter on responding to critics. (The chapters are quite long!) Since the publication of his book The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence, which has similar ideas, Kurzweil had many critics, and he explains why they are wrong. The first few are the typical: disbelief this is possible, and what about rich/poor gap. He writes that all of this can be overcome, and will. Personally I think Kurzweil discounts a few things a little too readily, such as people or governments putting the brakes on this trend, as well as the rich and poor divide. As he is wealthy it may be hard for him to appreciate the difference between having money and barely surviving. He says that it is irrelevant since in the beginning technology is expensive and doesn't work well, only the rich buy the devices, but as the technology improves it goes through stages until it works great, is ubiquitous and practically free. Perhaps the great lifesaving and body improving technologies will work down to the poor masses but in the short time frame he claims I do have strong doubt. Using his law of accelerating returns, timelines shrink and he claims the time difference will be in a few years instead of decades that we see now. He uses AIDS drugs, cell phones and the internet as examples. Perhaps. All in all, it's a very optimistic outlook on the future of mankind. Take that in contrast to other outlooks, such as Jared Diamond, Thomas Friedman or the countless number of environmentalist's such as Bill McKibben. I have been steeped in those ideas and so this one of Kurzweil's I find quite hopeful. Kurzweil has been spot on with many of his predictions and quite a few of his critics don’t disagree with his conclusions, just the timeline, not never, just a matter of when. Did want to keep this short, but find it impossible. "
125,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86318-amy,2,"Hooooo, boy. Where do you even start with this thing?Stylistically, it has a lot of flaws. Super repetitive. Sputters out at the end, and then as an appendix he throws in a few equations. The hypothetical dialogues interspersed in the text are sometimes eye-rollingly lame, although, to be fair, they just as often directly responded to questions/criticisms the book had raised in my mind.I'm not sure who his audience is supposed to be. The math and theoretical physics stuff was not always sufficiently explained in that I, a fairly intelligent lay reader who at least has vague recollections of high school math and science, just couldn't follow significant portions of his supposed proof. I think most general readers would have the same problem.I don't have the computer science or math background to evaluate a lot of his assertions, so it is hard to tell how much is plausible, if far-fetched, and how much is pure crazy. I am perfectly willing to believe that at some point, advances in technology will render everyday life difficult to recognize. I am on board with the possibility that ""we will be cyborgs."" My mind started to close when he discussed how in a century or so we will have expanded into the galaxy and started spreading throughout the universe, and perhaps beyond, in search of more information processing capacity. While it is an interesting possibility, I'm unclear on how that process will work.His explanation for how a lot of this will be accomplished boils down to: ""We will be supersmart because our computers, with whom we will be merging, will also be supersmart, so while I don't know how we're going to do this, we'll figure it out."" Well, maybe, but you're going to have to do a little better than that.Also, what a dreary view of the future and our potential expansion into the stars. No learning about new environments, or learning about ourselves, really. Just a bunch of boring cyborgs goofing off in simulated environments and using up the materials of the universe (with apparently no thought given to who or what else might be using those materials) to make our processing units run better. And apparently the best use of this knowledge will be: (i) to live indefinitely, (ii) to be supersmart, and (iii) to hang out in virtual reality. What's the point of (i) and (ii) if all you're going to do with it is (iii)?He sort of tries to address, but doesn't really, how you are really alive if your ""consciousness"" is merged with a mechanical substrate while the physical you is stranded in meatspace. Maybe I am a selfish jerk, but I am more concerned about death because it means I won't be alive anymore, rather than because the world will be deprived of the privilege of interacting with me or an exact replica of my personality.He doesn't address more than in passing the real-world political obstacles to the supposed availability of cheap, unlimited resources he says is coming. Sure, sure, the big fossil fuel companies will totally stand by and not try to block cheap solar power, etc. They will cast aside their profit motives because ... more CPUs? I don't know. Similarly troubling is the author's lack of serious discussion of the fact that greater reliance on computers means less jobs. He seems to say that this is cool, because everything in the future will be really inexpensive, but this ignores his own point that information (software forming the patterns, for example, of all those nifty clothes we will create on 3D printers) will be the real commodity.Finally, he disregards some pretty obvious privacy concerns. People flip out about their Facebook settings, but within a century most people will be uploading/merging/sharing their actual consciousness online? He doesn't discuss any methods of or possible desire to keep any of the self separate from this collective consciousness, but wouldn't that be a huge concern for most people? Putting your drunk pictures on the internet is one thing, sharing your brain with the world quite another.For all of that, I did slog through the whole thing, and I kept talking about what I had read, so it definitely raised some interesting points. And I suspect at least some of the author's claims are on point (it was already pretty spot-on about on-board nav systems in cars). But from my (admittedly technically handicapped) viewpoint, it winds up somewhere off the rails."
126,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19648573-mark-locascio,2,"A lot of the reviews here seem to be saying ""it's complicated, so it must be profound."" This is not true. There is no reason for this book to be 650 pages long. Kurzweil's thesis is pretty straightforward: technology advances at an exponential pace. By that logic, there's reason to believe that nonbiological (i.e., computational) intelligence will eventually become much more advanced than human intelligence. This book is essentially Kurzweil's prediction for how great it'll be.I'm not fond of speculation about science... technology rarely evolves the way you think it will. But a well-crafted opinion would still be an interesting read. Unfortunately, this was not well-crafted. The book is long and rambling. There are wild detours that span dozens of pages. Academic research is misinterpreted and extrapolated well beyond what any real scientist would allow. The end-notes are a pain in the nads. The fixation on lactation and virtualized, gender-swapped sex adds nothing but confusion.The book isn't getting a poor review from me because I couldn't understand it. I did graduate research in both nanomechanics and robotics, two of the areas Kurzweil writes about for too many pages. I know enough to know that he's really stretching here. This book seemed like he'd had a lot of conversations with a lot of smart people, and wanted to publish as much of it as he could to appear knowledgeable himself. In the end, it just seemed like he didn't know which book he wanted to write, and wasn't qualified to write any of them.There was some good discussion of the ethics of artificial intelligence, I'll give him that. And for what it's worth, his predictions likely won't be completely wrong. But this book could have benefited quite a bit from a strong editorial influence or some peer-review. Skip it. Go browse his web site and save yourself about 600 pages."
127,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2683760-gary,4,"Rarely I read a book that truly blows my mind. This is one. Noted futurist Kurzweil lays out a radically different view of the future enabled by exponential development of artificial intelligence. A couple of the key milestones on the way to the future he envisions:-By 2029, computers will have advanced so far as to be able to pass a Turing test, which essentially means that they will be able to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of biological humans.-And by 2045, the ""singularity"", meaning merging of biological and non-biological humanity will be a reality.So the singularity is near, but not so near that is going to happen, say, next year. If Kurzweil is even half right, we are in for some incredible advances in genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics, his ""big three"" technological revolutions that will pave the way for the human-machine melding he sees coming.I can't say that I agree with everything presented here, but neither can I refute the powerful argument he makes for the path that our civilization appears to be on: after what will be only several hundred years of having machines in our lives, we basically will have developed them to the point where they are as smart as us, and very soon after that, nearly indescribably smarter than us. Take a listen/read, this is powerful stuff with all sorts of moral implications. It will make you think very hard about what may be to come in the future.**The narrator sounds a bit like one of the old Speak & Spell toys from the 1980s, which is kind of funny given the text-to-speech technology development that Kurzweil has been involved in."
128,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59510129-chris,3,"Kurzweil makes remarkably far-sighted predictions about humanity will change during our lifetimes. The very far-sighted analysis on physical limitation of computation is quite interesting, as are the predictions about the pre-singularity advances in genetics, nanotechnology and robotics. However, Kurzweil quickly dismisses two glaring issues with surprising immaturity. One, he claims that since technologies like self-replicating nanobots will become cheaper at an exponential rate, they will be ubiquitous among the poor seven years later than the rich, so access to resources will be democratized. This opposes all historical precedent and should not be dismissed without much stronger evidence. Two, he claims that Strong AI is not an existential threat because we can also develop a Strong AI immune system to defend against bad actors, and our immune systems work pretty well. He invokes his argument at least three times but fails to state the obvious that people’s immune systems fail sometimes, but we only get one universe. If a Strong AI immune system fails in a vastly interconnected system, it’s not just one person who dies, it’s everybody. Finally, I was disappointed by Kurzweil’s lack of discussion of the societal implications of inevitable rapid technological “progress.” For something that will affect the whole world, he focuses an awful lot on what it will mean for an individual - implicitly, one who can afford it."
129,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/136271-maria,2,"Predicting the future is always hard and Kurzweil whole hypothesis is that there is a point in the future when our technology will shift so dramatically that we can't imagine what it will be like. He then proceeds to explain just what it will be like.

Buddy Read: Where's My Jetpack?: A Guide to the Amazing Science Fiction Future That Never Arrived. The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology might have been more helpful/wonderful a decade ago... but I'm struggling now. That's the problem with predictions about future technology.

Or is it computers reaching human consciousness and far surpassing human capabilities in the immediate future? Actually he makes both claims and the fact that those massive changes are happening exponentially (Ray Kurzweil's Law of Accelerating Returns) in the next 20-30 years, is downright crazy to think of.You know what they say, ""extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"" and Kurzweil provides a fair amount of these and to his defense, in the 15 years that have passed since the publication of this book, several of these predictions (that I know of) have already been materialized. There is much to digest in this book and while the ideas are fascinating, the book itself is a hard read, with some repeated content (for clarity?) and tries to analyze in depth several subjects thus losing the reader's focus from time to time. Still, a classic if you want to dive into the ""Singularity is near"" trend."

Some people have said this book is the Bible of the Singularitianism as new religion.. and that felt true in the way it was mostly throwing affirmations into my face and asking me to just believe them (while implying that if I didn't, it was my own fault from not being enlightened enough)In summary : Glad i read it, gave me a lot to think about...

Among those three I fear an experiment with self-replicating nanobots gone wrong is the most likely to wipe us out. I also think that the time scale may be a bit off but that might just be me not being able to think in terms of exponential growth even though Kurzweil tries to teach me over and over again. It's inevitable that we will (continue to) improve ourselves through genetics, augment us with nanotechnology and invent artificial life and live as mainly information (or ""patterns""). Combinations of these will basically make us immortal and, in my opinion, still human but with way better control of our evolution. The singularity is coming. I just hope I won't miss it."

Even if it all will come to pass. Talking about future with today's terms seems frightful and terrifying, but I'd suggest to cross the bridge when we come to it. It's ok to speculate as a thought experiment, because it's also cool and exciting, but don't get an heart attack about something that doesn't make any sense with the current information.But that said, I cannot wait to get cheap quality replacement/upgrade parts to by biological organs.

The information is quite heavy and technical to digest from the first time (especially if you are a non-scientist). Second, Ray is of course brilliant, but there is just too much. It's like he is trying to write about everything, at the same time. Third, the future is scary. In the future, human will be part human part machine. Ray is trying to be optimistic about the convergence of both, but somehow shows only the positive sides of it. For example, even now we have medical technology that can do miracles but unless you have good insurance, you won't have access to it. So what are the guarantees that future advances in technology will be accessible to all, not just the richest 1 percent. Overall, most of the book is wishful thinking - or living in ones head."

I don't think he is off by much, but his optimistic predictions do not realistically account for political, economic and other social factors that can slow many of this down. When we landed on the moon, just ten years after the first man in space, everyone assumed much faster growth of space-faring technologies, but out political will was just not there, and 2001 Space Odyssey still remains a science fiction. However, I too strongly believe that a technological evolution of humankind is not too far off. The next hundred years is going to be the most exciting period for our species."

I do not agree with all what he has to say (technology is not available to all and will likely create as many problems as it solves, do we really want to become demi-gods, immortal and living only for intellectual pleasures?), but it sure is an interesting read."

It is well researched and chock full of ideas and an inherent optimism about the future, which is refreshing after reading so many bleak sci-fi novels (like mine).The writing is somewhat dry however, and very little commentary or opinion is presented, instead piling on facts, research, maths, and graphs.

Kurzweil is an inventor, not a scientist, and it shows in this book of his - he even harps on about how technology is ""an extension of biological evolution.""

Kurzweil compares the faster or exponential pace of technology compared to biological evolution and concluded that singularity , a vast growth in intelligence resulting in reshaping of the universe, is somewhere near 2045. His prediction is based on the eloquent comparison of slow biological intelligence growth compared to exponential technological intelligence. He argues that nanotechnology is an essential contributor to understand the brain and thereof advance in non biological intelligence based on the former information processing. I was fully immersed in this book especially when the author describes how human will overcome their biological limitations and become transbiological and then pure machines. The hypothetical debates between ethicists and materialists is captivating, the one between him, Darwin, Frued and Molly about consciousness is mind blowing . Whether his predictions are accurate or not, Ray is an ultimate genius and this book takes you into an intellectual journey, I will definitely read all his books."
151,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2021836-george,5,"HEAVY DISCLAIMER: this review will require a lot of repetition to stress a few important points. To properly convey the information will require that I take Kurzweil's side since I do not intend to do much in the way of refuting or debating his ideas.I have thoroughly enjoyed reading the predictions that Ray Kurzweil makes for the future of the human race. His track record of technological predictions to date has been very accurate and I expect that many of the things he forsees in this book will happen. But, I am also certain that many human beings are not ready for the technologies that he describes. Along the way to any potential technological Singularity, there will be a great deal of upheaval in many human arenas. Perhaps I should explain the notion of the Singularity first.The term is borrowed from a few disciplines and has multiple meanings within each of those fields. The general application of the term is a situation that describes a point beyond which anything is unknown. In math this is a formula with a solution so large as to be currently impossible to calculate but not infinite. In astrophysics this is what lies beyond the event horizon (the exact point where nothing can escape) of a black hole in space. In the case of the technological singularity it is the point where biological human technology surpasses the understanding of even the most brilliant humans.Kurzweil's overall belief is based upon his mathematical analysis of exponential growth of all information, from nature's DNA to the code behind Microsoft Windows and therefore ultimately information technology (not the IT profession). He's spent years developing formulas that have allowed him to safely make predictions about the core outcomes of information technology and he suggests that everything humans do is becoming information technology. This is already the case in the medical, entertainment and increasingly the manufacturing industries.But exponential growth is not limited to productivity. It also applies to world knowledge and the economy. Which are also information technologies. Technological growth affects world knowledge growth. We can easily see this in the much larger amount of information available to a larger segment of the world population thanks to the web. Indeed, I would not have been writing this review, nor would you be reading it now if the technologies that form the internet and support the web on top of it had not been developed. More world knowledge and information sharing also increase exponentially as well as bringing about new ideas and further technological progress. While there are still many who don't yet have access to the web, think about those who do today. People who didn't even have access to basic education only a decade or two ago now have access to a wide variety of information and educational opportunities that didn't exist a short time ago. This is one of Kurzweil's main points.The other point is that the exponential growth of technology combined with the exponential growth of world knowledge cause exponential growth of the world economy. Granted that there are currently many problems with the US economy, Kurzweil points to the surprisingly large numbers of people in developing nations who have come out of poverty just in the 15 years before he wrote this book. Like technological and knowledge growth, the expanding global economy provides more resources to further develop technology worldwide.Yet another point that he stresses is that the exponential growth of information technology is itself also grouwing exponentially. Where technological developments used to take decades to become reliable and widely used, the time has now shortened to less than a decade. Smart phones and digital music players are examples of faster development and adoption of new technologies. If his predictions are correct, technologies like this will continue to become reliable and ubiquitous in less than five years as we traverse the current decade.He spent more time discussing these things near the end of the book rather than the beginning. But I chose to explain them first to give you some concepts which may help you understand why he believes in the more startling predictions he makes for the 21st century. These predictions are not likely to sit well with many people and as a result they will either deny the possibility, or argue against them from the current day mindset.The Singularity is Near is a very information dense book. Nearly 500 pages are used to explain, postulate and defend the idea that the ultimate form that humanity will take is non-biological. He predicts that this will happen in the second half of the 21st century. So some of you reading this may live through this transformation. As much as it sounds like science fiction his predictions are well within the bounds of reality. For example, he suggests that as we replace more and more of our bodies with non-biological components (we already do this) our machines will simultaneously become less and less machine-like and more and more human. This will occur to such an extent that making the distinction between ""human"" and ""machine"" intelligence will eventually have no meaning.First let's talk about A.I. (artificial intelligence), which is the main technology that promises to give our machines human qualities. Many people believe that artificial intelligence, as a field of development is long dead. Kurzweil counters by pointing out the many things machines do today could only be accomplished with partial or complete human intervention just a decade or two ago. The fact is that A.I. has become so successful that, after A.I. becomes capable of performing yet another previously human only task, it appears completely unremarkable. A.I. has not failed but it is so commonplace in our day to day lives that no one notices, unless it malfunctions. A.I. research continues and makes more progress every year, so more gains of this nature lie in the future.One thing that really struck me while reading this book is that humanity is not ready for many of the things he predicts if you tell people outright what to expect. But, as they live through the changes as they occur, humans adapt. In many cases, people either wonder how they lived without the new technologies or at worst they grudgingly see the benefits, with only a few exceptions.Much as the industrial age shaped much of the late 19th and first half of the 20th century, Kurzweil believes that through the combination of genetics, nanotechnology and robotics the information age will define the first half of the 21st century. I say the first half because Kurzweil predicts that the Singularity will happen somewhere in the 2040s. This is when machines will surpass human beings and their capability for thought and emotion.The changes that I've personally observed over the past three decades are in keeping with his exponential models. The changes of just the past ten years have been considerably accelerated compared to the previous 20, and that's his point. Had you asked someone with little interest in electronics or computers only 25 years ago if they thought that they would ever own a pocket sized device that was a phone that worked almost anywhere and had A.I. in it that would spell check, predict words as they type and allow for hands free voice dialing and touch screens, many of those people would have thought you were reading from a science fiction novel. Between the years 2000 and 2010, I've seen wireless networking develop from large, slow clunky cards for PCs, to small wireless networking radios in SD cards for cameras about the size of a quarter. This is exactly the sort of accelerated change Kurzweil is describing.A philosophical issue that Kurzweil discusses is the concept of consciousness, or what makes us human. If humanity begins to replace biological components to the extent that everyone is eventually non-biological, can we say that they are no longerr human? If you really think so, then ask yourself, what is the cut off point for being human? Replacement of the heart? The brain? A certain fraction or percentage of cells? Kurzweil suggests that what makes us human is our minds including our emotions as well as our experiences and ideas. Because of this, he believes that even if we ""uploaded"" our minds into a virtual reality and were no longer physical, we would still be human. He knows that this will be one of the greater philosophical questions of th 21st century. One that may cause a lot of problems for humans as these changes happen.The other side of the equation are the machines we are building. Once our machines have emotional intelligence and can interact with us just like other humans, can we still say they aren't conscious? No one has developed a way to measure or detect consciousness in humans, so how can we say that intelligent machines that can think and feel like we do, aren't really conscious? Just these two views of consciousness are going to bring about a lot of difficult exchanges among humans and according to Kurzweil's time line, we're only 30 years away from the beginning of that era.Once again, this book is huge and covers a lot of ground. That makes writing a good summary and review quite difficult. I also don't want to give too much away about the book so that anyone interested will have some things to look forward to. But here are a few teasers. What would you think of a human who no longer has a heart or blood? How about clouds of nanomachines that create ephemeral physical manifestations in the real world of virtual items and intellects? Do you think the notion that a future intelligent race originated from humans will eventually have the power to create more computational devices out of the sun itself? Even the entire universe? Just these few hints at what is in the book should give you some idea why I think most people will not accept or relate to these ideas. I think he's pretty close to correct for many of his extrapolations, but there is no guarantee. If any of these ideas intrigue or disturb you, give the book a try."
152,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45322768-adam,5,"I've heard so much said about Ray Kurzweil over the years but never got around to reading this controversial book. I expected to read these fantastical predictions of a future with no basis in reality. Instead this book is a very thorough, well researched, well supported examination of progress and where it is almost certainly inevitably headed.To be sure, the book hasn't aged perfectly in the 14 years since its publication. Kurzweil makes predictions about advanced technologies which he believes will be commonplace as early as the 2020s and, now that the decade in question has started, it seems unlikely these will play out. In that sense, he is a bit optimistic but I don't think he's likely off by that much. His predictions of progress are based on reliable trends. The technologies he suggests are grounded in physical reality. There is no magical leap needed for everything to fall in place. By putting replication of the human mind as the path to the singularity we remove ourselves from the unpredictable path of some software breakthrough which may, or may not, occur first. While Kurweil may assume an aggressive timeline, the timeline itself does not seem to be in question.Kurweil is himself very open to the idea of modifying himself and humanity. I am absolutely on board with this and embrace the type of future he is detailing in these pages. Others I think may not be quite as open to the idea. While he downplays the resistance the average person may have to such things as life extension therapies, I think they will still come just perhaps at a slower pace than he thinks. Something being within our scientific reach doesn't mean it will happen. We've had the technology for human cloning for decades and haven't down anything with it. We currently have the ability to rewrite the human genome and it isn't getting much traction. While people are generally on board with a single life saving technology they don't seem to have much appetite for general life extension. It's a bit like AI. A lot of people are using AI to find solutions to specific problems but not many people are trying to make a general purpose human intelligent AI system. A lot of people are trying to cure cancer or any number of ailments but not a lot of people are looking into fundamentally extending life. Will it happen? Almost certainly. Will it happen in Ray Kurzweil's lifetime? I can't be sure. How many others have gone to the steps he has to extent their lives? Almost none.All around I love the author's approach. He studied computer programming and has an eye for the physical aspects of computing as well as the programming and algorithm side. He approaches a problem with a rational view of it. The book details things in a straightforward way. No doubt that computing will continue to advance. No doubt that nanotech will become more common. No doubt that models of the brain will become better and better. No doubt that we will soon have the computing ability to run a simulation of a mind. Will we be able to simulate a human mind on a computer? The only difficulty will be in scanning and replicating it. There is surely nothing magical about a brain which makes it impossible to duplicate on a computer!Is the Singularity Near? I don't know. I think it's coming, but it's hard to predict just when. Ray Kurzweil isn't pulling his predictions out of nowhere. He did the work and he's on the right track. For his sake as well as that of all of us, I hope it's soon!"
153,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1899624-zach,3,"This pseudo-religious, pseudo-scientific tome by one of the world's leading futurists lays out a timeline to a moment when the pace of technological innovation -- specifically, in the power of computer hardware and software -- becomes so rapid that, from our perspective in the present, it occupies a single point in time. Hence, the singularity.Kurzweil's predictions are based primarily upon an observation made by Gordon Moore of Intel: that computing power per dollar will double every 18 months. This isn't exactly what he said; it's actually an expression of transistor density. But the effect that consumers and Kurzweil care about is price-performance, which is doubling every 18 months. Kurzweil looks into the future and extrapolates that $1000 will buy you as much processing power as a human brain by the mid 2020s and more than all human brains in existence by the 2030s. More intriguingly, he also looks into the past and postulates an identical exponential progress, starting with the evolution of DNA and continuing on up through homo sapiens, agriculture, the wheel, and investment banking. This observation, that ""milestones"" in ""progress"" seem to be happening more frequently as time goes by, is the basis of his Law of Accelerating Returns, which is the cornerstone of his belief system. Basically, Kurzweil believes that all evolutionary systems, of which technology is one, increase their ""order"" exponentially. Therefore, it's no coincidence that it took 2 billion years for DNA to evolve, but then only 1 billion years for eukaryotes, then only 500 million years for multicellular organisms, and so on, each milestone occurring in half as much time as it took to achieve the one before it. For reference, see:Canoncial milestones in the SingularityThe foundation for his Law of Accelerating Returns is by far the weakest part of his argument for what the future will be like. He asserts that evolutionary systems inevitably increase their ""order"" exponentially, but never approaches a rigorous definition of the term. This hand-waving approach to his fundamental theory really comes to a head when he talks about the Fermi Paradox, the observation that intelligent life in the universe seems to be uncommon. This flies in the face of Kurzweil's thesis, which is that intelligence inevitably evolves from DNA up through brains through supercomputers, until eventually a civilization is converting all the matter and energy in the universe into one giant computational device at an exponential rate. If such a project is underway on behalf of some other intelligent race, they're being awfully quiet about it. Therefore, a futurist is forced to either 1) apply a universal anthropic principle: we must be the first intelligent (technology-creating) race in the universe; or 2) accept that there's nothing inevitable about the evolution of intelligence or technology. Kurzweil chooses option 1), and while he makes an eloquent case for his choice it's far from airtight. Beetles have been evolving exactly as long as we have -- they're more successful than us by any evolutionary metric -- and yet they possess no intelligence.Kurzweil is at his best when he sticks to the predictions that his objective measures of price-performance of information technologies actually support, and these predictions really are awe-inspiring. We can say with great certainty that the years of the 2020s will in fact give rise to truly earth-moving, paradigm-shattering technologies as a result of cheap, ubiquitous computers. Kurzweil has a lot of specific examples, mostly concerning the augmentation of human intelligence and virtual reality interfaces for the brain, that are best read in the book itself.It's worth noting that Kurzweil doesn't seem to think that peak oil will affect his predictions in the least. James Kunstler's The Long Emergency Surviving the End of Oil, Climate Change, and Other Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty-First Century talks about the diminishing returns of technology, while Kurzweil posits the Law of Accelerating Returns. Clearly, one of these men is a pessimist and one an optimist. The question that concerns all of us is: who is right? I view the singularity and peak oil as a race, with the future of human civilization at stake. Can the exponential increase in technological progress replace our fossil fuel energy before Saudi production peaks? No one knows; Kurzweil is pretty bad at predicting specific applications of technology (he thought we would have glasses that use lasers to paint images onto our retinas by 2009), but his data on the exponential increase in price-performance in information technologies is so predictable as to be considered infallible. There's enough solar energy hitting this planet to replace our fossil fuel use and then some. Kunstler thinks we'll be unable to harness it as a civilization because of the how very little time we have until oil production peaks; but then, he clearly doesn't understand the exponential nature of progress, so his predictions are suspect. Kurzweil, on the other hand, is a self-admitted utopian optimist who sincerely believes that humankind's ascension to the stars is not just likely, but destined, preordained.So to reiterate: should you be investing in canned food or in nanotechnology companies (and virtual pornography firms, of course)? I can't tell you how to live your life, but my personal perspective on this dilemma is as follows: in 20 years we will either be living in the middle of the fantastic future promised by the Singularity; or we'll be back to an agrarian lifestyle and focused mainly on staying alive and killing our neighbors. Since the latter outcome, the total and near-irrevocable destruction of our way of life, is unthinkable, I prefer to believe in the former. In other words, I choose not to invest in canned food, because I can't imagine living in a world where I'll need it.I can't say I recommend this book very strongly, except for those who already have a strong interest in the Singularity. The subject matter is often fascinating and thought-provoking, but the presentation leaves much to be desired. Kurzweil rambles and repeats himself, and multiple times lets his narrative devolve into pages upon pages of bulleted lists. I'm sorry, Mr. Kurzweil, but I could have gotten that on Wikipedia."
154,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3037001-pamela,4,"It's tempting to call this book science fiction since its fundamental idea seems so far-fetched. Much can be said about this book, much has been said. I find it hard to write a review because this book is very big, in length and ideas. Kurzweil is a very smart man who has already made our lives better, he’s an inventor and coder. He developed electronic keyboards, text-to-speech readers, OCR and more. He’s very smart. He’s also written several books about the future, or where humans are headed. The Singularity is Near is nearly a decade old already, but hardly dated. There are a lot of charts that can be updated, but overall the book is still very relevant. I would encourage anyone to read the book. Warning it is not easy, the writing style is dense, sometimes dull. But it’s not quite as long as it appears with about 20% of the book being notes and index. The basic gist of the Singularity is three-fold: GNR. Genetics, Nanotechnology and Robotics, and everything is becoming information. How everything becomes information and the speed at which everything is going to change is due to Moore's Law, which is about exponential growth, and Kurzweil takes it a little further with “Law of Accelerating Returns.” We will have leaps of achievements and ability in genetics and along with nanotechnology, we will repair and renew our bodies, helping to extend our life span. Nanotechnology will end up allowing us to scan and reverse engineer our brain, and ultimately be able to transfer our consciousness (memories and personality) to another substrate, meaning a digital form. Smart A.I. and supercomputers will help us achieve this. After merging with computers, becoming biological and digital, we will have an infinite life-span as our consciousness, our individuality is preserved digitally. The end result is unknown, we as humans, will reach a Singularity where the unknown is unforeseeable because we just can't comprehend what is next. Okay, I probably butchered that summary, skipped a ton but yeah, it’s wild! It's all quite fascinating. Kurzweil thinks we are on the cusp of these revolutions and maybe the baby-boomer generation will see it if they take care of their bodies. People born after 1960 most likely will. Sure there are a lot of reasons to discount this future, and Kurzweil writes a full chapter on responding to critics. (The chapters are quite long!) Since the publication of his book The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence, which has similar ideas, Kurzweil had many critics, and he explains why they are wrong. The first few are the typical: disbelief this is possible, and what about rich/poor gap. He writes that all of this can be overcome, and will. Personally I think Kurzweil discounts a few things a little too readily, such as people or governments putting the brakes on this trend, as well as the rich and poor divide. As he is wealthy it may be hard for him to appreciate the difference between having money and barely surviving. He says that it is irrelevant since in the beginning technology is expensive and doesn't work well, only the rich buy the devices, but as the technology improves it goes through stages until it works great, is ubiquitous and practically free. Perhaps the great lifesaving and body improving technologies will work down to the poor masses but in the short time frame he claims I do have strong doubt. Using his law of accelerating returns, timelines shrink and he claims the time difference will be in a few years instead of decades that we see now. He uses AIDS drugs, cell phones and the internet as examples. Perhaps. All in all, it's a very optimistic outlook on the future of mankind. Take that in contrast to other outlooks, such as Jared Diamond, Thomas Friedman or the countless number of environmentalist's such as Bill McKibben. I have been steeped in those ideas and so this one of Kurzweil's I find quite hopeful. Kurzweil has been spot on with many of his predictions and quite a few of his critics don’t disagree with his conclusions, just the timeline, not never, just a matter of when. Did want to keep this short, but find it impossible. "
155,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86318-amy,2,"Hooooo, boy. Where do you even start with this thing?Stylistically, it has a lot of flaws. Super repetitive. Sputters out at the end, and then as an appendix he throws in a few equations. The hypothetical dialogues interspersed in the text are sometimes eye-rollingly lame, although, to be fair, they just as often directly responded to questions/criticisms the book had raised in my mind.I'm not sure who his audience is supposed to be. The math and theoretical physics stuff was not always sufficiently explained in that I, a fairly intelligent lay reader who at least has vague recollections of high school math and science, just couldn't follow significant portions of his supposed proof. I think most general readers would have the same problem.I don't have the computer science or math background to evaluate a lot of his assertions, so it is hard to tell how much is plausible, if far-fetched, and how much is pure crazy. I am perfectly willing to believe that at some point, advances in technology will render everyday life difficult to recognize. I am on board with the possibility that ""we will be cyborgs."" My mind started to close when he discussed how in a century or so we will have expanded into the galaxy and started spreading throughout the universe, and perhaps beyond, in search of more information processing capacity. While it is an interesting possibility, I'm unclear on how that process will work.His explanation for how a lot of this will be accomplished boils down to: ""We will be supersmart because our computers, with whom we will be merging, will also be supersmart, so while I don't know how we're going to do this, we'll figure it out."" Well, maybe, but you're going to have to do a little better than that.Also, what a dreary view of the future and our potential expansion into the stars. No learning about new environments, or learning about ourselves, really. Just a bunch of boring cyborgs goofing off in simulated environments and using up the materials of the universe (with apparently no thought given to who or what else might be using those materials) to make our processing units run better. And apparently the best use of this knowledge will be: (i) to live indefinitely, (ii) to be supersmart, and (iii) to hang out in virtual reality. What's the point of (i) and (ii) if all you're going to do with it is (iii)?He sort of tries to address, but doesn't really, how you are really alive if your ""consciousness"" is merged with a mechanical substrate while the physical you is stranded in meatspace. Maybe I am a selfish jerk, but I am more concerned about death because it means I won't be alive anymore, rather than because the world will be deprived of the privilege of interacting with me or an exact replica of my personality.He doesn't address more than in passing the real-world political obstacles to the supposed availability of cheap, unlimited resources he says is coming. Sure, sure, the big fossil fuel companies will totally stand by and not try to block cheap solar power, etc. They will cast aside their profit motives because ... more CPUs? I don't know. Similarly troubling is the author's lack of serious discussion of the fact that greater reliance on computers means less jobs. He seems to say that this is cool, because everything in the future will be really inexpensive, but this ignores his own point that information (software forming the patterns, for example, of all those nifty clothes we will create on 3D printers) will be the real commodity.Finally, he disregards some pretty obvious privacy concerns. People flip out about their Facebook settings, but within a century most people will be uploading/merging/sharing their actual consciousness online? He doesn't discuss any methods of or possible desire to keep any of the self separate from this collective consciousness, but wouldn't that be a huge concern for most people? Putting your drunk pictures on the internet is one thing, sharing your brain with the world quite another.For all of that, I did slog through the whole thing, and I kept talking about what I had read, so it definitely raised some interesting points. And I suspect at least some of the author's claims are on point (it was already pretty spot-on about on-board nav systems in cars). But from my (admittedly technically handicapped) viewpoint, it winds up somewhere off the rails."
156,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19648573-mark-locascio,2,"A lot of the reviews here seem to be saying ""it's complicated, so it must be profound."" This is not true. There is no reason for this book to be 650 pages long. Kurzweil's thesis is pretty straightforward: technology advances at an exponential pace. By that logic, there's reason to believe that nonbiological (i.e., computational) intelligence will eventually become much more advanced than human intelligence. This book is essentially Kurzweil's prediction for how great it'll be.I'm not fond of speculation about science... technology rarely evolves the way you think it will. But a well-crafted opinion would still be an interesting read. Unfortunately, this was not well-crafted. The book is long and rambling. There are wild detours that span dozens of pages. Academic research is misinterpreted and extrapolated well beyond what any real scientist would allow. The end-notes are a pain in the nads. The fixation on lactation and virtualized, gender-swapped sex adds nothing but confusion.The book isn't getting a poor review from me because I couldn't understand it. I did graduate research in both nanomechanics and robotics, two of the areas Kurzweil writes about for too many pages. I know enough to know that he's really stretching here. This book seemed like he'd had a lot of conversations with a lot of smart people, and wanted to publish as much of it as he could to appear knowledgeable himself. In the end, it just seemed like he didn't know which book he wanted to write, and wasn't qualified to write any of them.There was some good discussion of the ethics of artificial intelligence, I'll give him that. And for what it's worth, his predictions likely won't be completely wrong. But this book could have benefited quite a bit from a strong editorial influence or some peer-review. Skip it. Go browse his web site and save yourself about 600 pages."
157,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2683760-gary,4,"Rarely I read a book that truly blows my mind. This is one. Noted futurist Kurzweil lays out a radically different view of the future enabled by exponential development of artificial intelligence. A couple of the key milestones on the way to the future he envisions:-By 2029, computers will have advanced so far as to be able to pass a Turing test, which essentially means that they will be able to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of biological humans.-And by 2045, the ""singularity"", meaning merging of biological and non-biological humanity will be a reality.So the singularity is near, but not so near that is going to happen, say, next year. If Kurzweil is even half right, we are in for some incredible advances in genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics, his ""big three"" technological revolutions that will pave the way for the human-machine melding he sees coming.I can't say that I agree with everything presented here, but neither can I refute the powerful argument he makes for the path that our civilization appears to be on: after what will be only several hundred years of having machines in our lives, we basically will have developed them to the point where they are as smart as us, and very soon after that, nearly indescribably smarter than us. Take a listen/read, this is powerful stuff with all sorts of moral implications. It will make you think very hard about what may be to come in the future.**The narrator sounds a bit like one of the old Speak & Spell toys from the 1980s, which is kind of funny given the text-to-speech technology development that Kurzweil has been involved in."
158,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59510129-chris,3,"Kurzweil makes remarkably far-sighted predictions about humanity will change during our lifetimes. The very far-sighted analysis on physical limitation of computation is quite interesting, as are the predictions about the pre-singularity advances in genetics, nanotechnology and robotics. However, Kurzweil quickly dismisses two glaring issues with surprising immaturity. One, he claims that since technologies like self-replicating nanobots will become cheaper at an exponential rate, they will be ubiquitous among the poor seven years later than the rich, so access to resources will be democratized. This opposes all historical precedent and should not be dismissed without much stronger evidence. Two, he claims that Strong AI is not an existential threat because we can also develop a Strong AI immune system to defend against bad actors, and our immune systems work pretty well. He invokes his argument at least three times but fails to state the obvious that people’s immune systems fail sometimes, but we only get one universe. If a Strong AI immune system fails in a vastly interconnected system, it’s not just one person who dies, it’s everybody. Finally, I was disappointed by Kurzweil’s lack of discussion of the societal implications of inevitable rapid technological “progress.” For something that will affect the whole world, he focuses an awful lot on what it will mean for an individual - implicitly, one who can afford it."
159,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/136271-maria,2,"Predicting the future is always hard and Kurzweil whole hypothesis is that there is a point in the future when our technology will shift so dramatically that we can't imagine what it will be like. He then proceeds to explain just what it will be like. Why I started this book: Another audio from my professional reading list.Why I finished it: Good thing it was an audio, I kept a steady pace and wasn't drowned in the ridiculousness. Buddy Read: Where's My Jetpack?: A Guide to the Amazing Science Fiction Future That Never Arrived. The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology might have been more helpful/wonderful a decade ago... but I'm struggling now. That's the problem with predictions about future technology. You might guess that we'd have hand-held computers but who would guess that we would use them to watch cats, other videos and argue with strangers in thread wars?"
160,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47739629-stefanos,3,"Kurzweil has strong points justifying his (calculated) predictions about us primates rapidly transcending to a (much) higher and more capable species through the help of technology. Or is it computers reaching human consciousness and far surpassing human capabilities in the immediate future? Actually he makes both claims and the fact that those massive changes are happening exponentially (Ray Kurzweil's Law of Accelerating Returns) in the next 20-30 years, is downright crazy to think of.You know what they say, ""extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"" and Kurzweil provides a fair amount of these and to his defense, in the 15 years that have passed since the publication of this book, several of these predictions (that I know of) have already been materialized. There is much to digest in this book and while the ideas are fascinating, the book itself is a hard read, with some repeated content (for clarity?) and tries to analyze in depth several subjects thus losing the reader's focus from time to time. Still, a classic if you want to dive into the ""Singularity is near"" trend."

Some people have said this book is the Bible of the Singularitianism as new religion.. and that felt true in the way it was mostly throwing affirmations into my face and asking me to just believe them (while implying that if I didn't, it was my own fault from not being enlightened enough)In summary : Glad i read it, gave me a lot to think about...

Among those three I fear an experiment with self-replicating nanobots gone wrong is the most likely to wipe us out. I also think that the time scale may be a bit off but that might just be me not being able to think in terms of exponential growth even though Kurzweil tries to teach me over and over again. It's inevitable that we will (continue to) improve ourselves through genetics, augment us with nanotechnology and invent artificial life and live as mainly information (or ""patterns""). Combinations of these will basically make us immortal and, in my opinion, still human but with way better control of our evolution. The singularity is coming. I just hope I won't miss it."

Even if it all will come to pass. Talking about future with today's terms seems frightful and terrifying, but I'd suggest to cross the bridge when we come to it. It's ok to speculate as a thought experiment, because it's also cool and exciting, but don't get an heart attack about something that doesn't make any sense with the current information.But that said, I cannot wait to get cheap quality replacement/upgrade parts to by biological organs. And a full backup of myself would also be much appreciated. Although Ray here might be a bit too optimistic with his time-line, but we'll get there!"
164,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23183558-dina,5,"First of all, I will put this book on the shelf to re-read. The information is quite heavy and technical to digest from the first time (especially if you are a non-scientist). Second, Ray is of course brilliant, but there is just too much. It's like he is trying to write about everything, at the same time. Third, the future is scary. In the future, human will be part human part machine. Ray is trying to be optimistic about the convergence of both, but somehow shows only the positive sides of it. For example, even now we have medical technology that can do miracles but unless you have good insurance, you won't have access to it. So what are the guarantees that future advances in technology will be accessible to all, not just the richest 1 percent. Overall, most of the book is wishful thinking - or living in ones head."

I don't think he is off by much, but his optimistic predictions do not realistically account for political, economic and other social factors that can slow many of this down. When we landed on the moon, just ten years after the first man in space, everyone assumed much faster growth of space-faring technologies, but out political will was just not there, and 2001 Space Odyssey still remains a science fiction. However, I too strongly believe that a technological evolution of humankind is not too far off. The next hundred years is going to be the most exciting period for our species."

While other scientific linked to the society, Ray paints a very bright future for us where GNR (genetics, nanotechnology and robotics) will solve solve all the world problems: medical, environmental, sociological...If I read Kurzweil, I remember why it is fun to be an engineer, combining sciences from all different domains to create new technology to reshape mankind. I do not agree with all what he has to say (technology is not available to all and will likely create as many problems as it solves, do we really want to become demi-gods, immortal and living only for intellectual pleasures?), but it sure is an interesting read."

In some ways that helps the author's case since many of his predictions have already, or about to, become a reality. It is well researched and chock full of ideas and an inherent optimism about the future, which is refreshing after reading so many bleak sci-fi novels (like mine).The writing is somewhat dry however, and very little commentary or opinion is presented, instead piling on facts, research, maths, and graphs. Also, the graphs are very difficult to read on a Kindle, it could have been formatted better."

Kurzweil is an inventor, not a scientist, and it shows in this book of his - he even harps on about how technology is ""an extension of biological evolution."" If you're looking for a well-grounded introduction to how weird, wonderful and dangerous this century will be, my list of recommendations would place The Singularity Is Near close to the bottom of the list."

He goes off the deep end in the middle but ends on a strong note.I still think he is overly optimistic about the reliability of complex software though, as well as his timeline for general AI. Finally, sometimes I think that our exponential progress might be slowed down a bit since some of this generations brightest minds work on social media apps and click bait instead of figuring out how to get to Mars.

I also found Ray Kurzweil's narrative and view of the future to be rather endearing, focusing on these exponential leaps and how humanity will transcend the bounds of biology and I am just READY for the transhumanist technocult.

Kurzweil compares the faster or exponential pace of technology compared to biological evolution and concluded that singularity , a vast growth in intelligence resulting in reshaping of the universe, is somewhere near 2045. His prediction is based on the eloquent comparison of slow biological intelligence growth compared to exponential technological intelligence. He argues that nanotechnology is an essential contributor to understand the brain and thereof advance in non biological intelligence based on the former information processing. I was fully immersed in this book especially when the author describes how human will overcome their biological limitations and become transbiological and then pure machines. The hypothetical debates between ethicists and materialists is captivating, the one between him, Darwin, Frued and Molly about consciousness is mind blowing .

181,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2021836-george,5,"HEAVY DISCLAIMER: this review will require a lot of repetition to stress a few important points. To properly convey the information will require that I take Kurzweil's side since I do not intend to do much in the way of refuting or debating his ideas.I have thoroughly enjoyed reading the predictions that Ray Kurzweil makes for the future of the human race. His track record of technological predictions to date has been very accurate and I expect that many of the things he forsees in this book will happen. But, I am also certain that many human beings are not ready for the technologies that he describes. Along the way to any potential technological Singularity, there will be a great deal of upheaval in many human arenas. Perhaps I should explain the notion of the Singularity first.The term is borrowed from a few disciplines and has multiple meanings within each of those fields. The general application of the term is a situation that describes a point beyond which anything is unknown. In math this is a formula with a solution so large as to be currently impossible to calculate but not infinite. In astrophysics this is what lies beyond the event horizon (the exact point where nothing can escape) of a black hole in space. In the case of the technological singularity it is the point where biological human technology surpasses the understanding of even the most brilliant humans.Kurzweil's overall belief is based upon his mathematical analysis of exponential growth of all information, from nature's DNA to the code behind Microsoft Windows and therefore ultimately information technology (not the IT profession). He's spent years developing formulas that have allowed him to safely make predictions about the core outcomes of information technology and he suggests that everything humans do is becoming information technology. This is already the case in the medical, entertainment and increasingly the manufacturing industries.But exponential growth is not limited to productivity. It also applies to world knowledge and the economy. Which are also information technologies. Technological growth affects world knowledge growth. We can easily see this in the much larger amount of information available to a larger segment of the world population thanks to the web. Indeed, I would not have been writing this review, nor would you be reading it now if the technologies that form the internet and support the web on top of it had not been developed. More world knowledge and information sharing also increase exponentially as well as bringing about new ideas and further technological progress. While there are still many who don't yet have access to the web, think about those who do today. People who didn't even have access to basic education only a decade or two ago now have access to a wide variety of information and educational opportunities that didn't exist a short time ago. This is one of Kurzweil's main points.The other point is that the exponential growth of technology combined with the exponential growth of world knowledge cause exponential growth of the world economy. Granted that there are currently many problems with the US economy, Kurzweil points to the surprisingly large numbers of people in developing nations who have come out of poverty just in the 15 years before he wrote this book. Like technological and knowledge growth, the expanding global economy provides more resources to further develop technology worldwide.Yet another point that he stresses is that the exponential growth of information technology is itself also grouwing exponentially. Where technological developments used to take decades to become reliable and widely used, the time has now shortened to less than a decade. Smart phones and digital music players are examples of faster development and adoption of new technologies. If his predictions are correct, technologies like this will continue to become reliable and ubiquitous in less than five years as we traverse the current decade.He spent more time discussing these things near the end of the book rather than the beginning. But I chose to explain them first to give you some concepts which may help you understand why he believes in the more startling predictions he makes for the 21st century. These predictions are not likely to sit well with many people and as a result they will either deny the possibility, or argue against them from the current day mindset.The Singularity is Near is a very information dense book. Nearly 500 pages are used to explain, postulate and defend the idea that the ultimate form that humanity will take is non-biological. He predicts that this will happen in the second half of the 21st century. So some of you reading this may live through this transformation. As much as it sounds like science fiction his predictions are well within the bounds of reality. For example, he suggests that as we replace more and more of our bodies with non-biological components (we already do this) our machines will simultaneously become less and less machine-like and more and more human. This will occur to such an extent that making the distinction between ""human"" and ""machine"" intelligence will eventually have no meaning.First let's talk about A.I. (artificial intelligence), which is the main technology that promises to give our machines human qualities. Many people believe that artificial intelligence, as a field of development is long dead. Kurzweil counters by pointing out the many things machines do today could only be accomplished with partial or complete human intervention just a decade or two ago. The fact is that A.I. has become so successful that, after A.I. becomes capable of performing yet another previously human only task, it appears completely unremarkable. A.I. has not failed but it is so commonplace in our day to day lives that no one notices, unless it malfunctions. A.I. research continues and makes more progress every year, so more gains of this nature lie in the future.One thing that really struck me while reading this book is that humanity is not ready for many of the things he predicts if you tell people outright what to expect. But, as they live through the changes as they occur, humans adapt. In many cases, people either wonder how they lived without the new technologies or at worst they grudgingly see the benefits, with only a few exceptions.Much as the industrial age shaped much of the late 19th and first half of the 20th century, Kurzweil believes that through the combination of genetics, nanotechnology and robotics the information age will define the first half of the 21st century. I say the first half because Kurzweil predicts that the Singularity will happen somewhere in the 2040s. This is when machines will surpass human beings and their capability for thought and emotion.The changes that I've personally observed over the past three decades are in keeping with his exponential models. The changes of just the past ten years have been considerably accelerated compared to the previous 20, and that's his point. Had you asked someone with little interest in electronics or computers only 25 years ago if they thought that they would ever own a pocket sized device that was a phone that worked almost anywhere and had A.I. in it that would spell check, predict words as they type and allow for hands free voice dialing and touch screens, many of those people would have thought you were reading from a science fiction novel. Between the years 2000 and 2010, I've seen wireless networking develop from large, slow clunky cards for PCs, to small wireless networking radios in SD cards for cameras about the size of a quarter. This is exactly the sort of accelerated change Kurzweil is describing.A philosophical issue that Kurzweil discusses is the concept of consciousness, or what makes us human. If humanity begins to replace biological components to the extent that everyone is eventually non-biological, can we say that they are no longerr human? If you really think so, then ask yourself, what is the cut off point for being human? Replacement of the heart? The brain? A certain fraction or percentage of cells? Kurzweil suggests that what makes us human is our minds including our emotions as well as our experiences and ideas. Because of this, he believes that even if we ""uploaded"" our minds into a virtual reality and were no longer physical, we would still be human. He knows that this will be one of the greater philosophical questions of th 21st century. One that may cause a lot of problems for humans as these changes happen.The other side of the equation are the machines we are building. Once our machines have emotional intelligence and can interact with us just like other humans, can we still say they aren't conscious? No one has developed a way to measure or detect consciousness in humans, so how can we say that intelligent machines that can think and feel like we do, aren't really conscious? Just these two views of consciousness are going to bring about a lot of difficult exchanges among humans and according to Kurzweil's time line, we're only 30 years away from the beginning of that era.Once again, this book is huge and covers a lot of ground. That makes writing a good summary and review quite difficult. I also don't want to give too much away about the book so that anyone interested will have some things to look forward to. But here are a few teasers. What would you think of a human who no longer has a heart or blood? How about clouds of nanomachines that create ephemeral physical manifestations in the real world of virtual items and intellects? Do you think the notion that a future intelligent race originated from humans will eventually have the power to create more computational devices out of the sun itself? Even the entire universe? Just these few hints at what is in the book should give you some idea why I think most people will not accept or relate to these ideas. I think he's pretty close to correct for many of his extrapolations, but there is no guarantee. If any of these ideas intrigue or disturb you, give the book a try."
182,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45322768-adam,5,"I've heard so much said about Ray Kurzweil over the years but never got around to reading this controversial book. I expected to read these fantastical predictions of a future with no basis in reality. Instead this book is a very thorough, well researched, well supported examination of progress and where it is almost certainly inevitably headed.To be sure, the book hasn't aged perfectly in the 14 years since its publication. Kurzweil makes predictions about advanced technologies which he believes will be commonplace as early as the 2020s and, now that the decade in question has started, it seems unlikely these will play out. In that sense, he is a bit optimistic but I don't think he's likely off by that much. His predictions of progress are based on reliable trends. The technologies he suggests are grounded in physical reality. There is no magical leap needed for everything to fall in place. By putting replication of the human mind as the path to the singularity we remove ourselves from the unpredictable path of some software breakthrough which may, or may not, occur first. While Kurweil may assume an aggressive timeline, the timeline itself does not seem to be in question.Kurweil is himself very open to the idea of modifying himself and humanity. I am absolutely on board with this and embrace the type of future he is detailing in these pages. Others I think may not be quite as open to the idea. While he downplays the resistance the average person may have to such things as life extension therapies, I think they will still come just perhaps at a slower pace than he thinks. Something being within our scientific reach doesn't mean it will happen. We've had the technology for human cloning for decades and haven't down anything with it. We currently have the ability to rewrite the human genome and it isn't getting much traction. While people are generally on board with a single life saving technology they don't seem to have much appetite for general life extension. It's a bit like AI. A lot of people are using AI to find solutions to specific problems but not many people are trying to make a general purpose human intelligent AI system. A lot of people are trying to cure cancer or any number of ailments but not a lot of people are looking into fundamentally extending life. Will it happen? Almost certainly. Will it happen in Ray Kurzweil's lifetime? I can't be sure. How many others have gone to the steps he has to extent their lives? Almost none.All around I love the author's approach. He studied computer programming and has an eye for the physical aspects of computing as well as the programming and algorithm side. He approaches a problem with a rational view of it. The book details things in a straightforward way. No doubt that computing will continue to advance. No doubt that nanotech will become more common. No doubt that models of the brain will become better and better. No doubt that we will soon have the computing ability to run a simulation of a mind. Will we be able to simulate a human mind on a computer? The only difficulty will be in scanning and replicating it. There is surely nothing magical about a brain which makes it impossible to duplicate on a computer!Is the Singularity Near? I don't know. I think it's coming, but it's hard to predict just when. Ray Kurzweil isn't pulling his predictions out of nowhere. He did the work and he's on the right track. For his sake as well as that of all of us, I hope it's soon!"
183,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1899624-zach,3,"This pseudo-religious, pseudo-scientific tome by one of the world's leading futurists lays out a timeline to a moment when the pace of technological innovation -- specifically, in the power of computer hardware and software -- becomes so rapid that, from our perspective in the present, it occupies a single point in time. Hence, the singularity.Kurzweil's predictions are based primarily upon an observation made by Gordon Moore of Intel: that computing power per dollar will double every 18 months. This isn't exactly what he said; it's actually an expression of transistor density. But the effect that consumers and Kurzweil care about is price-performance, which is doubling every 18 months. Kurzweil looks into the future and extrapolates that $1000 will buy you as much processing power as a human brain by the mid 2020s and more than all human brains in existence by the 2030s. More intriguingly, he also looks into the past and postulates an identical exponential progress, starting with the evolution of DNA and continuing on up through homo sapiens, agriculture, the wheel, and investment banking. This observation, that ""milestones"" in ""progress"" seem to be happening more frequently as time goes by, is the basis of his Law of Accelerating Returns, which is the cornerstone of his belief system. Basically, Kurzweil believes that all evolutionary systems, of which technology is one, increase their ""order"" exponentially. Therefore, it's no coincidence that it took 2 billion years for DNA to evolve, but then only 1 billion years for eukaryotes, then only 500 million years for multicellular organisms, and so on, each milestone occurring in half as much time as it took to achieve the one before it. For reference, see:Canoncial milestones in the SingularityThe foundation for his Law of Accelerating Returns is by far the weakest part of his argument for what the future will be like. He asserts that evolutionary systems inevitably increase their ""order"" exponentially, but never approaches a rigorous definition of the term. This hand-waving approach to his fundamental theory really comes to a head when he talks about the Fermi Paradox, the observation that intelligent life in the universe seems to be uncommon. This flies in the face of Kurzweil's thesis, which is that intelligence inevitably evolves from DNA up through brains through supercomputers, until eventually a civilization is converting all the matter and energy in the universe into one giant computational device at an exponential rate. If such a project is underway on behalf of some other intelligent race, they're being awfully quiet about it. Therefore, a futurist is forced to either 1) apply a universal anthropic principle: we must be the first intelligent (technology-creating) race in the universe; or 2) accept that there's nothing inevitable about the evolution of intelligence or technology. Kurzweil chooses option 1), and while he makes an eloquent case for his choice it's far from airtight. Beetles have been evolving exactly as long as we have -- they're more successful than us by any evolutionary metric -- and yet they possess no intelligence.Kurzweil is at his best when he sticks to the predictions that his objective measures of price-performance of information technologies actually support, and these predictions really are awe-inspiring. We can say with great certainty that the years of the 2020s will in fact give rise to truly earth-moving, paradigm-shattering technologies as a result of cheap, ubiquitous computers. Kurzweil has a lot of specific examples, mostly concerning the augmentation of human intelligence and virtual reality interfaces for the brain, that are best read in the book itself.It's worth noting that Kurzweil doesn't seem to think that peak oil will affect his predictions in the least. James Kunstler's The Long Emergency Surviving the End of Oil, Climate Change, and Other Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty-First Century talks about the diminishing returns of technology, while Kurzweil posits the Law of Accelerating Returns. Clearly, one of these men is a pessimist and one an optimist. The question that concerns all of us is: who is right? I view the singularity and peak oil as a race, with the future of human civilization at stake. Can the exponential increase in technological progress replace our fossil fuel energy before Saudi production peaks? No one knows; Kurzweil is pretty bad at predicting specific applications of technology (he thought we would have glasses that use lasers to paint images onto our retinas by 2009), but his data on the exponential increase in price-performance in information technologies is so predictable as to be considered infallible. There's enough solar energy hitting this planet to replace our fossil fuel use and then some. Kunstler thinks we'll be unable to harness it as a civilization because of the how very little time we have until oil production peaks; but then, he clearly doesn't understand the exponential nature of progress, so his predictions are suspect. Kurzweil, on the other hand, is a self-admitted utopian optimist who sincerely believes that humankind's ascension to the stars is not just likely, but destined, preordained.So to reiterate: should you be investing in canned food or in nanotechnology companies (and virtual pornography firms, of course)? I can't tell you how to live your life, but my personal perspective on this dilemma is as follows: in 20 years we will either be living in the middle of the fantastic future promised by the Singularity; or we'll be back to an agrarian lifestyle and focused mainly on staying alive and killing our neighbors. Since the latter outcome, the total and near-irrevocable destruction of our way of life, is unthinkable, I prefer to believe in the former. In other words, I choose not to invest in canned food, because I can't imagine living in a world where I'll need it.I can't say I recommend this book very strongly, except for those who already have a strong interest in the Singularity. The subject matter is often fascinating and thought-provoking, but the presentation leaves much to be desired. Kurzweil rambles and repeats himself, and multiple times lets his narrative devolve into pages upon pages of bulleted lists. I'm sorry, Mr. Kurzweil, but I could have gotten that on Wikipedia."
184,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3037001-pamela,4,"It's tempting to call this book science fiction since its fundamental idea seems so far-fetched. Much can be said about this book, much has been said. I find it hard to write a review because this book is very big, in length and ideas. Kurzweil is a very smart man who has already made our lives better, he’s an inventor and coder. He developed electronic keyboards, text-to-speech readers, OCR and more. He’s very smart. He’s also written several books about the future, or where humans are headed. The Singularity is Near is nearly a decade old already, but hardly dated. There are a lot of charts that can be updated, but overall the book is still very relevant. I would encourage anyone to read the book. Warning it is not easy, the writing style is dense, sometimes dull. But it’s not quite as long as it appears with about 20% of the book being notes and index. The basic gist of the Singularity is three-fold: GNR. Genetics, Nanotechnology and Robotics, and everything is becoming information. How everything becomes information and the speed at which everything is going to change is due to Moore's Law, which is about exponential growth, and Kurzweil takes it a little further with “Law of Accelerating Returns.” We will have leaps of achievements and ability in genetics and along with nanotechnology, we will repair and renew our bodies, helping to extend our life span. Nanotechnology will end up allowing us to scan and reverse engineer our brain, and ultimately be able to transfer our consciousness (memories and personality) to another substrate, meaning a digital form. Smart A.I. and supercomputers will help us achieve this. After merging with computers, becoming biological and digital, we will have an infinite life-span as our consciousness, our individuality is preserved digitally. The end result is unknown, we as humans, will reach a Singularity where the unknown is unforeseeable because we just can't comprehend what is next. Okay, I probably butchered that summary, skipped a ton but yeah, it’s wild! It's all quite fascinating. Kurzweil thinks we are on the cusp of these revolutions and maybe the baby-boomer generation will see it if they take care of their bodies. People born after 1960 most likely will. Sure there are a lot of reasons to discount this future, and Kurzweil writes a full chapter on responding to critics. (The chapters are quite long!) Since the publication of his book The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence, which has similar ideas, Kurzweil had many critics, and he explains why they are wrong. The first few are the typical: disbelief this is possible, and what about rich/poor gap. He writes that all of this can be overcome, and will. Personally I think Kurzweil discounts a few things a little too readily, such as people or governments putting the brakes on this trend, as well as the rich and poor divide. As he is wealthy it may be hard for him to appreciate the difference between having money and barely surviving. He says that it is irrelevant since in the beginning technology is expensive and doesn't work well, only the rich buy the devices, but as the technology improves it goes through stages until it works great, is ubiquitous and practically free. Perhaps the great lifesaving and body improving technologies will work down to the poor masses but in the short time frame he claims I do have strong doubt. Using his law of accelerating returns, timelines shrink and he claims the time difference will be in a few years instead of decades that we see now. He uses AIDS drugs, cell phones and the internet as examples. Perhaps. All in all, it's a very optimistic outlook on the future of mankind. Take that in contrast to other outlooks, such as Jared Diamond, Thomas Friedman or the countless number of environmentalist's such as Bill McKibben. I have been steeped in those ideas and so this one of Kurzweil's I find quite hopeful. Kurzweil has been spot on with many of his predictions and quite a few of his critics don’t disagree with his conclusions, just the timeline, not never, just a matter of when. Did want to keep this short, but find it impossible. "
185,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86318-amy,2,"Hooooo, boy. Where do you even start with this thing?Stylistically, it has a lot of flaws. Super repetitive. Sputters out at the end, and then as an appendix he throws in a few equations. The hypothetical dialogues interspersed in the text are sometimes eye-rollingly lame, although, to be fair, they just as often directly responded to questions/criticisms the book had raised in my mind.I'm not sure who his audience is supposed to be. The math and theoretical physics stuff was not always sufficiently explained in that I, a fairly intelligent lay reader who at least has vague recollections of high school math and science, just couldn't follow significant portions of his supposed proof. I think most general readers would have the same problem.I don't have the computer science or math background to evaluate a lot of his assertions, so it is hard to tell how much is plausible, if far-fetched, and how much is pure crazy. I am perfectly willing to believe that at some point, advances in technology will render everyday life difficult to recognize. I am on board with the possibility that ""we will be cyborgs."" My mind started to close when he discussed how in a century or so we will have expanded into the galaxy and started spreading throughout the universe, and perhaps beyond, in search of more information processing capacity. While it is an interesting possibility, I'm unclear on how that process will work.His explanation for how a lot of this will be accomplished boils down to: ""We will be supersmart because our computers, with whom we will be merging, will also be supersmart, so while I don't know how we're going to do this, we'll figure it out."" Well, maybe, but you're going to have to do a little better than that.Also, what a dreary view of the future and our potential expansion into the stars. No learning about new environments, or learning about ourselves, really. Just a bunch of boring cyborgs goofing off in simulated environments and using up the materials of the universe (with apparently no thought given to who or what else might be using those materials) to make our processing units run better. And apparently the best use of this knowledge will be: (i) to live indefinitely, (ii) to be supersmart, and (iii) to hang out in virtual reality. What's the point of (i) and (ii) if all you're going to do with it is (iii)?He sort of tries to address, but doesn't really, how you are really alive if your ""consciousness"" is merged with a mechanical substrate while the physical you is stranded in meatspace. Maybe I am a selfish jerk, but I am more concerned about death because it means I won't be alive anymore, rather than because the world will be deprived of the privilege of interacting with me or an exact replica of my personality.He doesn't address more than in passing the real-world political obstacles to the supposed availability of cheap, unlimited resources he says is coming. Sure, sure, the big fossil fuel companies will totally stand by and not try to block cheap solar power, etc. They will cast aside their profit motives because ... more CPUs? I don't know. Similarly troubling is the author's lack of serious discussion of the fact that greater reliance on computers means less jobs. He seems to say that this is cool, because everything in the future will be really inexpensive, but this ignores his own point that information (software forming the patterns, for example, of all those nifty clothes we will create on 3D printers) will be the real commodity.Finally, he disregards some pretty obvious privacy concerns. People flip out about their Facebook settings, but within a century most people will be uploading/merging/sharing their actual consciousness online? He doesn't discuss any methods of or possible desire to keep any of the self separate from this collective consciousness, but wouldn't that be a huge concern for most people? Putting your drunk pictures on the internet is one thing, sharing your brain with the world quite another.For all of that, I did slog through the whole thing, and I kept talking about what I had read, so it definitely raised some interesting points. And I suspect at least some of the author's claims are on point (it was already pretty spot-on about on-board nav systems in cars). But from my (admittedly technically handicapped) viewpoint, it winds up somewhere off the rails."
186,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19648573-mark-locascio,2,"A lot of the reviews here seem to be saying ""it's complicated, so it must be profound."" This is not true. There is no reason for this book to be 650 pages long. Kurzweil's thesis is pretty straightforward: technology advances at an exponential pace. By that logic, there's reason to believe that nonbiological (i.e., computational) intelligence will eventually become much more advanced than human intelligence. This book is essentially Kurzweil's prediction for how great it'll be.I'm not fond of speculation about science... technology rarely evolves the way you think it will. But a well-crafted opinion would still be an interesting read. Unfortunately, this was not well-crafted. The book is long and rambling. There are wild detours that span dozens of pages. Academic research is misinterpreted and extrapolated well beyond what any real scientist would allow. The end-notes are a pain in the nads. The fixation on lactation and virtualized, gender-swapped sex adds nothing but confusion.The book isn't getting a poor review from me because I couldn't understand it. I did graduate research in both nanomechanics and robotics, two of the areas Kurzweil writes about for too many pages. I know enough to know that he's really stretching here. This book seemed like he'd had a lot of conversations with a lot of smart people, and wanted to publish as much of it as he could to appear knowledgeable himself. In the end, it just seemed like he didn't know which book he wanted to write, and wasn't qualified to write any of them.There was some good discussion of the ethics of artificial intelligence, I'll give him that. And for what it's worth, his predictions likely won't be completely wrong. But this book could have benefited quite a bit from a strong editorial influence or some peer-review. Skip it. Go browse his web site and save yourself about 600 pages."
187,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2683760-gary,4,"Rarely I read a book that truly blows my mind. This is one. Noted futurist Kurzweil lays out a radically different view of the future enabled by exponential development of artificial intelligence. A couple of the key milestones on the way to the future he envisions:-By 2029, computers will have advanced so far as to be able to pass a Turing test, which essentially means that they will be able to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of biological humans.-And by 2045, the ""singularity"", meaning merging of biological and non-biological humanity will be a reality.So the singularity is near, but not so near that is going to happen, say, next year. If Kurzweil is even half right, we are in for some incredible advances in genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics, his ""big three"" technological revolutions that will pave the way for the human-machine melding he sees coming.I can't say that I agree with everything presented here, but neither can I refute the powerful argument he makes for the path that our civilization appears to be on: after what will be only several hundred years of having machines in our lives, we basically will have developed them to the point where they are as smart as us, and very soon after that, nearly indescribably smarter than us. Take a listen/read, this is powerful stuff with all sorts of moral implications. It will make you think very hard about what may be to come in the future.**The narrator sounds a bit like one of the old Speak & Spell toys from the 1980s, which is kind of funny given the text-to-speech technology development that Kurzweil has been involved in."
188,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59510129-chris,3,"Kurzweil makes remarkably far-sighted predictions about humanity will change during our lifetimes. The very far-sighted analysis on physical limitation of computation is quite interesting, as are the predictions about the pre-singularity advances in genetics, nanotechnology and robotics. However, Kurzweil quickly dismisses two glaring issues with surprising immaturity. One, he claims that since technologies like self-replicating nanobots will become cheaper at an exponential rate, they will be ubiquitous among the poor seven years later than the rich, so access to resources will be democratized. This opposes all historical precedent and should not be dismissed without much stronger evidence. Two, he claims that Strong AI is not an existential threat because we can also develop a Strong AI immune system to defend against bad actors, and our immune systems work pretty well. He invokes his argument at least three times but fails to state the obvious that people’s immune systems fail sometimes, but we only get one universe. If a Strong AI immune system fails in a vastly interconnected system, it’s not just one person who dies, it’s everybody. Finally, I was disappointed by Kurzweil’s lack of discussion of the societal implications of inevitable rapid technological “progress.” For something that will affect the whole world, he focuses an awful lot on what it will mean for an individual - implicitly, one who can afford it."
189,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/136271-maria,2,"Predicting the future is always hard and Kurzweil whole hypothesis is that there is a point in the future when our technology will shift so dramatically that we can't imagine what it will be like.

Buddy Read: Where's My Jetpack?: A Guide to the Amazing Science Fiction Future That Never Arrived. The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology might have been more helpful/wonderful a decade ago... but I'm struggling now. That's the problem with predictions about future technology.

190,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47739629-stefanos,3,"Kurzweil has strong points justifying his (calculated) predictions about us primates rapidly transcending to a (much) higher and more capable species through the help of technology. Or is it computers reaching human consciousness and far surpassing human capabilities in the immediate future? Actually he makes both claims and the fact that those massive changes are happening exponentially (Ray Kurzweil's Law of Accelerating Returns) in the next 20-30 years, is downright crazy to think of.You know what they say, ""extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"" and Kurzweil provides a fair amount of these and to his defense, in the 15 years that have passed since the publication of this book, several of these predictions (that I know of) have already been materialized. There is much to digest in this book and while the ideas are fascinating, the book itself is a hard read, with some repeated content (for clarity?) and tries to analyze in depth several subjects thus losing the reader's focus from time to time. Still, a classic if you want to dive into the ""Singularity is near"" trend."

Some people have said this book is the Bible of the Singularitianism as new religion.. and that felt true in the way it was mostly throwing affirmations into my face and asking me to just believe them (while implying that if I didn't, it was my own fault from not being enlightened enough)In summary : Glad i read it, gave me a lot to think about...

Among those three I fear an experiment with self-replicating nanobots gone wrong is the most likely to wipe us out. I also think that the time scale may be a bit off but that might just be me not being able to think in terms of exponential growth even though Kurzweil tries to teach me over and over again. It's inevitable that we will (continue to) improve ourselves through genetics, augment us with nanotechnology and invent artificial life and live as mainly information (or ""patterns""). Combinations of these will basically make us immortal and, in my opinion, still human but with way better control of our evolution. The singularity is coming. I just hope I won't miss it."

Even if it all will come to pass. Talking about future with today's terms seems frightful and terrifying, but I'd suggest to cross the bridge when we come to it. It's ok to speculate as a thought experiment, because it's also cool and exciting, but don't get an heart attack about something that doesn't make any sense with the current information.But that said, I cannot wait to get cheap quality replacement/upgrade parts to by biological organs. And a full backup of myself would also be much appreciated. Although Ray here might be a bit too optimistic with his time-line, but we'll get there!"
194,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23183558-dina,5,"First of all, I will put this book on the shelf to re-read. The information is quite heavy and technical to digest from the first time (especially if you are a non-scientist). Second, Ray is of course brilliant, but there is just too much. It's like he is trying to write about everything, at the same time. Third, the future is scary. In the future, human will be part human part machine. Ray is trying to be optimistic about the convergence of both, but somehow shows only the positive sides of it. For example, even now we have medical technology that can do miracles but unless you have good insurance, you won't have access to it. So what are the guarantees that future advances in technology will be accessible to all, not just the richest 1 percent. Overall, most of the book is wishful thinking - or living in ones head."
195,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,4,"I could agree with most of what he is saying in this well thought out book, except for the time scale. I don't think he is off by much, but his optimistic predictions do not realistically account for political, economic and other social factors that can slow many of this down. When we landed on the moon, just ten years after the first man in space, everyone assumed much faster growth of space-faring technologies, but out political will was just not there, and 2001 Space Odyssey still remains a science fiction. However, I too strongly believe that a technological evolution of humankind is not too far off. The next hundred years is going to be the most exciting period for our species."
196,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4249244-michiel,4,"Ray Kurzweil is prozac for scientists. While other scientific linked to the society, Ray paints a very bright future for us where GNR (genetics, nanotechnology and robotics) will solve solve all the world problems: medical, environmental, sociological...If I read Kurzweil, I remember why it is fun to be an engineer, combining sciences from all different domains to create new technology to reshape mankind. I do not agree with all what he has to say (technology is not available to all and will likely create as many problems as it solves, do we really want to become demi-gods, immortal and living only for intellectual pleasures?), but it sure is an interesting read."

In some ways that helps the author's case since many of his predictions have already, or about to, become a reality. It is well researched and chock full of ideas and an inherent optimism about the future, which is refreshing after reading so many bleak sci-fi novels (like mine).The writing is somewhat dry however, and very little commentary or opinion is presented, instead piling on facts, research, maths, and graphs. Also, the graphs are very difficult to read on a Kindle, it could have been formatted better."

Kurzweil is an inventor, not a scientist, and it shows in this book of his - he even harps on about how technology is ""an extension of biological evolution."" If you're looking for a well-grounded introduction to how weird, wonderful and dangerous this century will be, my list of recommendations would place The Singularity Is Near close to the bottom of the list."

He goes off the deep end in the middle but ends on a strong note.I still think he is overly optimistic about the reliability of complex software though, as well as his timeline for general AI. Finally, sometimes I think that our exponential progress might be slowed down a bit since some of this generations brightest minds work on social media apps and click bait instead of figuring out how to get to Mars. But I have hope that things will get better soon."

I also found Ray Kurzweil's narrative and view of the future to be rather endearing, focusing on these exponential leaps and how humanity will transcend the bounds of biology and I am just READY for the transhumanist technocult. Also of note, I have some of the OCR software that he had created so I appreciate Ray Kurzweil for his contributions towards accessibility. "

Also, the way the book is structured is awfully boring. Most of what he says seems to be repetitive (that may be because I have already read a truckload of articles on the AI revolution, consequently making the longwinded explanations in this book seem unnecessary to me).I‘d rather learn more about this idea from scientific papers, articles and videos than through this book."

Kurzweil compares the faster or exponential pace of technology compared to biological evolution and concluded that singularity , a vast growth in intelligence resulting in reshaping of the universe, is somewhere near 2045. His prediction is based on the eloquent comparison of slow biological intelligence growth compared to exponential technological intelligence. He argues that nanotechnology is an essential contributor to understand the brain and thereof advance in non biological intelligence based on the former information processing. I was fully immersed in this book especially when the author describes how human will overcome their biological limitations and become transbiological and then pure machines. The hypothetical debates between ethicists and materialists is captivating, the one between him, Darwin, Frued and Molly about consciousness is mind blowing . Whether his predictions are accurate or not, Ray is an ultimate genius and this book takes you into an intellectual journey, I will definitely read all his books."
211,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2021836-george,5,"HEAVY DISCLAIMER: this review will require a lot of repetition to stress a few important points. To properly convey the information will require that I take Kurzweil's side since I do not intend to do much in the way of refuting or debating his ideas.I have thoroughly enjoyed reading the predictions that Ray Kurzweil makes for the future of the human race. His track record of technological predictions to date has been very accurate and I expect that many of the things he forsees in this book will happen. But, I am also certain that many human beings are not ready for the technologies that he describes. Along the way to any potential technological Singularity, there will be a great deal of upheaval in many human arenas. Perhaps I should explain the notion of the Singularity first.The term is borrowed from a few disciplines and has multiple meanings within each of those fields. The general application of the term is a situation that describes a point beyond which anything is unknown. In math this is a formula with a solution so large as to be currently impossible to calculate but not infinite. In astrophysics this is what lies beyond the event horizon (the exact point where nothing can escape) of a black hole in space. In the case of the technological singularity it is the point where biological human technology surpasses the understanding of even the most brilliant humans.Kurzweil's overall belief is based upon his mathematical analysis of exponential growth of all information, from nature's DNA to the code behind Microsoft Windows and therefore ultimately information technology (not the IT profession). He's spent years developing formulas that have allowed him to safely make predictions about the core outcomes of information technology and he suggests that everything humans do is becoming information technology. This is already the case in the medical, entertainment and increasingly the manufacturing industries.But exponential growth is not limited to productivity. It also applies to world knowledge and the economy. Which are also information technologies. Technological growth affects world knowledge growth. We can easily see this in the much larger amount of information available to a larger segment of the world population thanks to the web. Indeed, I would not have been writing this review, nor would you be reading it now if the technologies that form the internet and support the web on top of it had not been developed. More world knowledge and information sharing also increase exponentially as well as bringing about new ideas and further technological progress. While there are still many who don't yet have access to the web, think about those who do today. People who didn't even have access to basic education only a decade or two ago now have access to a wide variety of information and educational opportunities that didn't exist a short time ago. This is one of Kurzweil's main points.The other point is that the exponential growth of technology combined with the exponential growth of world knowledge cause exponential growth of the world economy. Granted that there are currently many problems with the US economy, Kurzweil points to the surprisingly large numbers of people in developing nations who have come out of poverty just in the 15 years before he wrote this book. Like technological and knowledge growth, the expanding global economy provides more resources to further develop technology worldwide.Yet another point that he stresses is that the exponential growth of information technology is itself also grouwing exponentially. Where technological developments used to take decades to become reliable and widely used, the time has now shortened to less than a decade. Smart phones and digital music players are examples of faster development and adoption of new technologies. If his predictions are correct, technologies like this will continue to become reliable and ubiquitous in less than five years as we traverse the current decade.He spent more time discussing these things near the end of the book rather than the beginning. But I chose to explain them first to give you some concepts which may help you understand why he believes in the more startling predictions he makes for the 21st century. These predictions are not likely to sit well with many people and as a result they will either deny the possibility, or argue against them from the current day mindset.The Singularity is Near is a very information dense book. Nearly 500 pages are used to explain, postulate and defend the idea that the ultimate form that humanity will take is non-biological. He predicts that this will happen in the second half of the 21st century. So some of you reading this may live through this transformation. As much as it sounds like science fiction his predictions are well within the bounds of reality. For example, he suggests that as we replace more and more of our bodies with non-biological components (we already do this) our machines will simultaneously become less and less machine-like and more and more human. This will occur to such an extent that making the distinction between ""human"" and ""machine"" intelligence will eventually have no meaning.First let's talk about A.I. (artificial intelligence), which is the main technology that promises to give our machines human qualities. Many people believe that artificial intelligence, as a field of development is long dead. Kurzweil counters by pointing out the many things machines do today could only be accomplished with partial or complete human intervention just a decade or two ago. The fact is that A.I. has become so successful that, after A.I. becomes capable of performing yet another previously human only task, it appears completely unremarkable. A.I. has not failed but it is so commonplace in our day to day lives that no one notices, unless it malfunctions. A.I. research continues and makes more progress every year, so more gains of this nature lie in the future.One thing that really struck me while reading this book is that humanity is not ready for many of the things he predicts if you tell people outright what to expect. But, as they live through the changes as they occur, humans adapt. In many cases, people either wonder how they lived without the new technologies or at worst they grudgingly see the benefits, with only a few exceptions.Much as the industrial age shaped much of the late 19th and first half of the 20th century, Kurzweil believes that through the combination of genetics, nanotechnology and robotics the information age will define the first half of the 21st century. I say the first half because Kurzweil predicts that the Singularity will happen somewhere in the 2040s. This is when machines will surpass human beings and their capability for thought and emotion.The changes that I've personally observed over the past three decades are in keeping with his exponential models. The changes of just the past ten years have been considerably accelerated compared to the previous 20, and that's his point. Had you asked someone with little interest in electronics or computers only 25 years ago if they thought that they would ever own a pocket sized device that was a phone that worked almost anywhere and had A.I. in it that would spell check, predict words as they type and allow for hands free voice dialing and touch screens, many of those people would have thought you were reading from a science fiction novel. Between the years 2000 and 2010, I've seen wireless networking develop from large, slow clunky cards for PCs, to small wireless networking radios in SD cards for cameras about the size of a quarter. This is exactly the sort of accelerated change Kurzweil is describing.A philosophical issue that Kurzweil discusses is the concept of consciousness, or what makes us human. If humanity begins to replace biological components to the extent that everyone is eventually non-biological, can we say that they are no longerr human? If you really think so, then ask yourself, what is the cut off point for being human? Replacement of the heart? The brain? A certain fraction or percentage of cells? Kurzweil suggests that what makes us human is our minds including our emotions as well as our experiences and ideas. Because of this, he believes that even if we ""uploaded"" our minds into a virtual reality and were no longer physical, we would still be human. He knows that this will be one of the greater philosophical questions of th 21st century. One that may cause a lot of problems for humans as these changes happen.The other side of the equation are the machines we are building. Once our machines have emotional intelligence and can interact with us just like other humans, can we still say they aren't conscious? No one has developed a way to measure or detect consciousness in humans, so how can we say that intelligent machines that can think and feel like we do, aren't really conscious? Just these two views of consciousness are going to bring about a lot of difficult exchanges among humans and according to Kurzweil's time line, we're only 30 years away from the beginning of that era.Once again, this book is huge and covers a lot of ground. That makes writing a good summary and review quite difficult. I also don't want to give too much away about the book so that anyone interested will have some things to look forward to. But here are a few teasers. What would you think of a human who no longer has a heart or blood? How about clouds of nanomachines that create ephemeral physical manifestations in the real world of virtual items and intellects? Do you think the notion that a future intelligent race originated from humans will eventually have the power to create more computational devices out of the sun itself? Even the entire universe? Just these few hints at what is in the book should give you some idea why I think most people will not accept or relate to these ideas. I think he's pretty close to correct for many of his extrapolations, but there is no guarantee. If any of these ideas intrigue or disturb you, give the book a try."
212,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45322768-adam,5,"I've heard so much said about Ray Kurzweil over the years but never got around to reading this controversial book. I expected to read these fantastical predictions of a future with no basis in reality. Instead this book is a very thorough, well researched, well supported examination of progress and where it is almost certainly inevitably headed.To be sure, the book hasn't aged perfectly in the 14 years since its publication. Kurzweil makes predictions about advanced technologies which he believes will be commonplace as early as the 2020s and, now that the decade in question has started, it seems unlikely these will play out. In that sense, he is a bit optimistic but I don't think he's likely off by that much. His predictions of progress are based on reliable trends. The technologies he suggests are grounded in physical reality. There is no magical leap needed for everything to fall in place. By putting replication of the human mind as the path to the singularity we remove ourselves from the unpredictable path of some software breakthrough which may, or may not, occur first. While Kurweil may assume an aggressive timeline, the timeline itself does not seem to be in question.Kurweil is himself very open to the idea of modifying himself and humanity. I am absolutely on board with this and embrace the type of future he is detailing in these pages. Others I think may not be quite as open to the idea. While he downplays the resistance the average person may have to such things as life extension therapies, I think they will still come just perhaps at a slower pace than he thinks. Something being within our scientific reach doesn't mean it will happen. We've had the technology for human cloning for decades and haven't down anything with it. We currently have the ability to rewrite the human genome and it isn't getting much traction. While people are generally on board with a single life saving technology they don't seem to have much appetite for general life extension. It's a bit like AI. A lot of people are using AI to find solutions to specific problems but not many people are trying to make a general purpose human intelligent AI system. A lot of people are trying to cure cancer or any number of ailments but not a lot of people are looking into fundamentally extending life. Will it happen? Almost certainly. Will it happen in Ray Kurzweil's lifetime? I can't be sure. How many others have gone to the steps he has to extent their lives? Almost none.All around I love the author's approach. He studied computer programming and has an eye for the physical aspects of computing as well as the programming and algorithm side. He approaches a problem with a rational view of it. The book details things in a straightforward way. No doubt that computing will continue to advance. No doubt that nanotech will become more common. No doubt that models of the brain will become better and better. No doubt that we will soon have the computing ability to run a simulation of a mind. Will we be able to simulate a human mind on a computer? The only difficulty will be in scanning and replicating it. There is surely nothing magical about a brain which makes it impossible to duplicate on a computer!Is the Singularity Near? I don't know. I think it's coming, but it's hard to predict just when. Ray Kurzweil isn't pulling his predictions out of nowhere. He did the work and he's on the right track. For his sake as well as that of all of us, I hope it's soon!"
213,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1899624-zach,3,"This pseudo-religious, pseudo-scientific tome by one of the world's leading futurists lays out a timeline to a moment when the pace of technological innovation -- specifically, in the power of computer hardware and software -- becomes so rapid that, from our perspective in the present, it occupies a single point in time. Hence, the singularity.Kurzweil's predictions are based primarily upon an observation made by Gordon Moore of Intel: that computing power per dollar will double every 18 months. This isn't exactly what he said; it's actually an expression of transistor density. But the effect that consumers and Kurzweil care about is price-performance, which is doubling every 18 months. Kurzweil looks into the future and extrapolates that $1000 will buy you as much processing power as a human brain by the mid 2020s and more than all human brains in existence by the 2030s. More intriguingly, he also looks into the past and postulates an identical exponential progress, starting with the evolution of DNA and continuing on up through homo sapiens, agriculture, the wheel, and investment banking. This observation, that ""milestones"" in ""progress"" seem to be happening more frequently as time goes by, is the basis of his Law of Accelerating Returns, which is the cornerstone of his belief system. Basically, Kurzweil believes that all evolutionary systems, of which technology is one, increase their ""order"" exponentially. Therefore, it's no coincidence that it took 2 billion years for DNA to evolve, but then only 1 billion years for eukaryotes, then only 500 million years for multicellular organisms, and so on, each milestone occurring in half as much time as it took to achieve the one before it. For reference, see:Canoncial milestones in the SingularityThe foundation for his Law of Accelerating Returns is by far the weakest part of his argument for what the future will be like. He asserts that evolutionary systems inevitably increase their ""order"" exponentially, but never approaches a rigorous definition of the term. This hand-waving approach to his fundamental theory really comes to a head when he talks about the Fermi Paradox, the observation that intelligent life in the universe seems to be uncommon. This flies in the face of Kurzweil's thesis, which is that intelligence inevitably evolves from DNA up through brains through supercomputers, until eventually a civilization is converting all the matter and energy in the universe into one giant computational device at an exponential rate. If such a project is underway on behalf of some other intelligent race, they're being awfully quiet about it. Therefore, a futurist is forced to either 1) apply a universal anthropic principle: we must be the first intelligent (technology-creating) race in the universe; or 2) accept that there's nothing inevitable about the evolution of intelligence or technology. Kurzweil chooses option 1), and while he makes an eloquent case for his choice it's far from airtight. Beetles have been evolving exactly as long as we have -- they're more successful than us by any evolutionary metric -- and yet they possess no intelligence.Kurzweil is at his best when he sticks to the predictions that his objective measures of price-performance of information technologies actually support, and these predictions really are awe-inspiring. We can say with great certainty that the years of the 2020s will in fact give rise to truly earth-moving, paradigm-shattering technologies as a result of cheap, ubiquitous computers. Kurzweil has a lot of specific examples, mostly concerning the augmentation of human intelligence and virtual reality interfaces for the brain, that are best read in the book itself.It's worth noting that Kurzweil doesn't seem to think that peak oil will affect his predictions in the least. James Kunstler's The Long Emergency Surviving the End of Oil, Climate Change, and Other Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty-First Century talks about the diminishing returns of technology, while Kurzweil posits the Law of Accelerating Returns. Clearly, one of these men is a pessimist and one an optimist. The question that concerns all of us is: who is right? I view the singularity and peak oil as a race, with the future of human civilization at stake. Can the exponential increase in technological progress replace our fossil fuel energy before Saudi production peaks? No one knows; Kurzweil is pretty bad at predicting specific applications of technology (he thought we would have glasses that use lasers to paint images onto our retinas by 2009), but his data on the exponential increase in price-performance in information technologies is so predictable as to be considered infallible. There's enough solar energy hitting this planet to replace our fossil fuel use and then some. Kunstler thinks we'll be unable to harness it as a civilization because of the how very little time we have until oil production peaks; but then, he clearly doesn't understand the exponential nature of progress, so his predictions are suspect. Kurzweil, on the other hand, is a self-admitted utopian optimist who sincerely believes that humankind's ascension to the stars is not just likely, but destined, preordained.So to reiterate: should you be investing in canned food or in nanotechnology companies (and virtual pornography firms, of course)? I can't tell you how to live your life, but my personal perspective on this dilemma is as follows: in 20 years we will either be living in the middle of the fantastic future promised by the Singularity; or we'll be back to an agrarian lifestyle and focused mainly on staying alive and killing our neighbors. Since the latter outcome, the total and near-irrevocable destruction of our way of life, is unthinkable, I prefer to believe in the former. In other words, I choose not to invest in canned food, because I can't imagine living in a world where I'll need it.I can't say I recommend this book very strongly, except for those who already have a strong interest in the Singularity. The subject matter is often fascinating and thought-provoking, but the presentation leaves much to be desired. Kurzweil rambles and repeats himself, and multiple times lets his narrative devolve into pages upon pages of bulleted lists. I'm sorry, Mr. Kurzweil, but I could have gotten that on Wikipedia."
214,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3037001-pamela,4,"It's tempting to call this book science fiction since its fundamental idea seems so far-fetched. Much can be said about this book, much has been said. I find it hard to write a review because this book is very big, in length and ideas. Kurzweil is a very smart man who has already made our lives better, he’s an inventor and coder. He developed electronic keyboards, text-to-speech readers, OCR and more. He’s very smart. He’s also written several books about the future, or where humans are headed. The Singularity is Near is nearly a decade old already, but hardly dated. There are a lot of charts that can be updated, but overall the book is still very relevant. I would encourage anyone to read the book. Warning it is not easy, the writing style is dense, sometimes dull. But it’s not quite as long as it appears with about 20% of the book being notes and index. The basic gist of the Singularity is three-fold: GNR. Genetics, Nanotechnology and Robotics, and everything is becoming information. How everything becomes information and the speed at which everything is going to change is due to Moore's Law, which is about exponential growth, and Kurzweil takes it a little further with “Law of Accelerating Returns.” We will have leaps of achievements and ability in genetics and along with nanotechnology, we will repair and renew our bodies, helping to extend our life span. Nanotechnology will end up allowing us to scan and reverse engineer our brain, and ultimately be able to transfer our consciousness (memories and personality) to another substrate, meaning a digital form. Smart A.I. and supercomputers will help us achieve this. After merging with computers, becoming biological and digital, we will have an infinite life-span as our consciousness, our individuality is preserved digitally. The end result is unknown, we as humans, will reach a Singularity where the unknown is unforeseeable because we just can't comprehend what is next. Okay, I probably butchered that summary, skipped a ton but yeah, it’s wild! It's all quite fascinating. Kurzweil thinks we are on the cusp of these revolutions and maybe the baby-boomer generation will see it if they take care of their bodies. People born after 1960 most likely will. Sure there are a lot of reasons to discount this future, and Kurzweil writes a full chapter on responding to critics. (The chapters are quite long!) Since the publication of his book The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence, which has similar ideas, Kurzweil had many critics, and he explains why they are wrong. The first few are the typical: disbelief this is possible, and what about rich/poor gap. He writes that all of this can be overcome, and will. Personally I think Kurzweil discounts a few things a little too readily, such as people or governments putting the brakes on this trend, as well as the rich and poor divide. As he is wealthy it may be hard for him to appreciate the difference between having money and barely surviving. He says that it is irrelevant since in the beginning technology is expensive and doesn't work well, only the rich buy the devices, but as the technology improves it goes through stages until it works great, is ubiquitous and practically free. Perhaps the great lifesaving and body improving technologies will work down to the poor masses but in the short time frame he claims I do have strong doubt. Using his law of accelerating returns, timelines shrink and he claims the time difference will be in a few years instead of decades that we see now. He uses AIDS drugs, cell phones and the internet as examples. Perhaps. All in all, it's a very optimistic outlook on the future of mankind. Take that in contrast to other outlooks, such as Jared Diamond, Thomas Friedman or the countless number of environmentalist's such as Bill McKibben. I have been steeped in those ideas and so this one of Kurzweil's I find quite hopeful. Kurzweil has been spot on with many of his predictions and quite a few of his critics don’t disagree with his conclusions, just the timeline, not never, just a matter of when. Did want to keep this short, but find it impossible. "
215,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86318-amy,2,"Hooooo, boy. Where do you even start with this thing?Stylistically, it has a lot of flaws. Super repetitive. Sputters out at the end, and then as an appendix he throws in a few equations. The hypothetical dialogues interspersed in the text are sometimes eye-rollingly lame, although, to be fair, they just as often directly responded to questions/criticisms the book had raised in my mind.I'm not sure who his audience is supposed to be. The math and theoretical physics stuff was not always sufficiently explained in that I, a fairly intelligent lay reader who at least has vague recollections of high school math and science, just couldn't follow significant portions of his supposed proof. I think most general readers would have the same problem.I don't have the computer science or math background to evaluate a lot of his assertions, so it is hard to tell how much is plausible, if far-fetched, and how much is pure crazy. I am perfectly willing to believe that at some point, advances in technology will render everyday life difficult to recognize. I am on board with the possibility that ""we will be cyborgs."" My mind started to close when he discussed how in a century or so we will have expanded into the galaxy and started spreading throughout the universe, and perhaps beyond, in search of more information processing capacity. While it is an interesting possibility, I'm unclear on how that process will work.His explanation for how a lot of this will be accomplished boils down to: ""We will be supersmart because our computers, with whom we will be merging, will also be supersmart, so while I don't know how we're going to do this, we'll figure it out."" Well, maybe, but you're going to have to do a little better than that.Also, what a dreary view of the future and our potential expansion into the stars. No learning about new environments, or learning about ourselves, really. Just a bunch of boring cyborgs goofing off in simulated environments and using up the materials of the universe (with apparently no thought given to who or what else might be using those materials) to make our processing units run better. And apparently the best use of this knowledge will be: (i) to live indefinitely, (ii) to be supersmart, and (iii) to hang out in virtual reality. What's the point of (i) and (ii) if all you're going to do with it is (iii)?He sort of tries to address, but doesn't really, how you are really alive if your ""consciousness"" is merged with a mechanical substrate while the physical you is stranded in meatspace. Maybe I am a selfish jerk, but I am more concerned about death because it means I won't be alive anymore, rather than because the world will be deprived of the privilege of interacting with me or an exact replica of my personality.He doesn't address more than in passing the real-world political obstacles to the supposed availability of cheap, unlimited resources he says is coming. Sure, sure, the big fossil fuel companies will totally stand by and not try to block cheap solar power, etc. They will cast aside their profit motives because ... more CPUs? I don't know. Similarly troubling is the author's lack of serious discussion of the fact that greater reliance on computers means less jobs. He seems to say that this is cool, because everything in the future will be really inexpensive, but this ignores his own point that information (software forming the patterns, for example, of all those nifty clothes we will create on 3D printers) will be the real commodity.Finally, he disregards some pretty obvious privacy concerns. People flip out about their Facebook settings, but within a century most people will be uploading/merging/sharing their actual consciousness online? He doesn't discuss any methods of or possible desire to keep any of the self separate from this collective consciousness, but wouldn't that be a huge concern for most people? Putting your drunk pictures on the internet is one thing, sharing your brain with the world quite another.For all of that, I did slog through the whole thing, and I kept talking about what I had read, so it definitely raised some interesting points. And I suspect at least some of the author's claims are on point (it was already pretty spot-on about on-board nav systems in cars). But from my (admittedly technically handicapped) viewpoint, it winds up somewhere off the rails."
216,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19648573-mark-locascio,2,"A lot of the reviews here seem to be saying ""it's complicated, so it must be profound."" This is not true. There is no reason for this book to be 650 pages long. Kurzweil's thesis is pretty straightforward: technology advances at an exponential pace. By that logic, there's reason to believe that nonbiological (i.e., computational) intelligence will eventually become much more advanced than human intelligence. This book is essentially Kurzweil's prediction for how great it'll be.I'm not fond of speculation about science... technology rarely evolves the way you think it will. But a well-crafted opinion would still be an interesting read. Unfortunately, this was not well-crafted. The book is long and rambling. There are wild detours that span dozens of pages. Academic research is misinterpreted and extrapolated well beyond what any real scientist would allow. The end-notes are a pain in the nads. The fixation on lactation and virtualized, gender-swapped sex adds nothing but confusion.The book isn't getting a poor review from me because I couldn't understand it. I did graduate research in both nanomechanics and robotics, two of the areas Kurzweil writes about for too many pages. I know enough to know that he's really stretching here. This book seemed like he'd had a lot of conversations with a lot of smart people, and wanted to publish as much of it as he could to appear knowledgeable himself. In the end, it just seemed like he didn't know which book he wanted to write, and wasn't qualified to write any of them.There was some good discussion of the ethics of artificial intelligence, I'll give him that. And for what it's worth, his predictions likely won't be completely wrong. But this book could have benefited quite a bit from a strong editorial influence or some peer-review. Skip it. Go browse his web site and save yourself about 600 pages."
217,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2683760-gary,4,"Rarely I read a book that truly blows my mind. This is one. Noted futurist Kurzweil lays out a radically different view of the future enabled by exponential development of artificial intelligence. A couple of the key milestones on the way to the future he envisions:-By 2029, computers will have advanced so far as to be able to pass a Turing test, which essentially means that they will be able to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of biological humans.-And by 2045, the ""singularity"", meaning merging of biological and non-biological humanity will be a reality.So the singularity is near, but not so near that is going to happen, say, next year. If Kurzweil is even half right, we are in for some incredible advances in genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics, his ""big three"" technological revolutions that will pave the way for the human-machine melding he sees coming.I can't say that I agree with everything presented here, but neither can I refute the powerful argument he makes for the path that our civilization appears to be on: after what will be only several hundred years of having machines in our lives, we basically will have developed them to the point where they are as smart as us, and very soon after that, nearly indescribably smarter than us. Take a listen/read, this is powerful stuff with all sorts of moral implications. It will make you think very hard about what may be to come in the future.**The narrator sounds a bit like one of the old Speak & Spell toys from the 1980s, which is kind of funny given the text-to-speech technology development that Kurzweil has been involved in."
218,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59510129-chris,3,"Kurzweil makes remarkably far-sighted predictions about humanity will change during our lifetimes. The very far-sighted analysis on physical limitation of computation is quite interesting, as are the predictions about the pre-singularity advances in genetics, nanotechnology and robotics. However, Kurzweil quickly dismisses two glaring issues with surprising immaturity. One, he claims that since technologies like self-replicating nanobots will become cheaper at an exponential rate, they will be ubiquitous among the poor seven years later than the rich, so access to resources will be democratized. This opposes all historical precedent and should not be dismissed without much stronger evidence. Two, he claims that Strong AI is not an existential threat because we can also develop a Strong AI immune system to defend against bad actors, and our immune systems work pretty well. He invokes his argument at least three times but fails to state the obvious that people’s immune systems fail sometimes, but we only get one universe. If a Strong AI immune system fails in a vastly interconnected system, it’s not just one person who dies, it’s everybody. Finally, I was disappointed by Kurzweil’s lack of discussion of the societal implications of inevitable rapid technological “progress.” For something that will affect the whole world, he focuses an awful lot on what it will mean for an individual - implicitly, one who can afford it."
219,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/136271-maria,2,"Predicting the future is always hard and Kurzweil whole hypothesis is that there is a point in the future when our technology will shift so dramatically that we can't imagine what it will be like. He then proceeds to explain just what it will be like. Why I started this book: Another audio from my professional reading list.Why I finished it: Good thing it was an audio, I kept a steady pace and wasn't drowned in the ridiculousness. Buddy Read: Where's My Jetpack?: A Guide to the Amazing Science Fiction Future That Never Arrived. The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology might have been more helpful/wonderful a decade ago... but I'm struggling now. That's the problem with predictions about future technology. You might guess that we'd have hand-held computers but who would guess that we would use them to watch cats, other videos and argue with strangers in thread wars?"
220,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47739629-stefanos,3,"Kurzweil has strong points justifying his (calculated) predictions about us primates rapidly transcending to a (much) higher and more capable species through the help of technology. Or is it computers reaching human consciousness and far surpassing human capabilities in the immediate future? Actually he makes both claims and the fact that those massive changes are happening exponentially (Ray Kurzweil's Law of Accelerating Returns) in the next 20-30 years, is downright crazy to think of.You know what they say, ""extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"" and Kurzweil provides a fair amount of these and to his defense, in the 15 years that have passed since the publication of this book, several of these predictions (that I know of) have already been materialized. There is much to digest in this book and while the ideas are fascinating, the book itself is a hard read, with some repeated content (for clarity?) and tries to analyze in depth several subjects thus losing the reader's focus from time to time. Still, a classic if you want to dive into the ""Singularity is near"" trend."

Some people have said this book is the Bible of the Singularitianism as new religion.. and that felt true in the way it was mostly throwing affirmations into my face and asking me to just believe them (while implying that if I didn't, it was my own fault from not being enlightened enough)In summary : Glad i read it, gave me a lot to think about...

Among those three I fear an experiment with self-replicating nanobots gone wrong is the most likely to wipe us out. I also think that the time scale may be a bit off but that might just be me not being able to think in terms of exponential growth even though Kurzweil tries to teach me over and over again. It's inevitable that we will (continue to) improve ourselves through genetics, augment us with nanotechnology and invent artificial life and live as mainly information (or ""patterns""). Combinations of these will basically make us immortal and, in my opinion, still human but with way better control of our evolution. The singularity is coming. I just hope I won't miss it."

Even if it all will come to pass. Talking about future with today's terms seems frightful and terrifying, but I'd suggest to cross the bridge when we come to it. It's ok to speculate as a thought experiment, because it's also cool and exciting, but don't get an heart attack about something that doesn't make any sense with the current information.But that said, I cannot wait to get cheap quality replacement/upgrade parts to by biological organs.

The information is quite heavy and technical to digest from the first time (especially if you are a non-scientist). Second, Ray is of course brilliant, but there is just too much. It's like he is trying to write about everything, at the same time. Third, the future is scary. In the future, human will be part human part machine. Ray is trying to be optimistic about the convergence of both, but somehow shows only the positive sides of it. For example, even now we have medical technology that can do miracles but unless you have good insurance, you won't have access to it. So what are the guarantees that future advances in technology will be accessible to all, not just the richest 1 percent. Overall, most of the book is wishful thinking - or living in ones head."

I don't think he is off by much, but his optimistic predictions do not realistically account for political, economic and other social factors that can slow many of this down. When we landed on the moon, just ten years after the first man in space, everyone assumed much faster growth of space-faring technologies, but out political will was just not there, and 2001 Space Odyssey still remains a science fiction. However, I too strongly believe that a technological evolution of humankind is not too far off. The next hundred years is going to be the most exciting period for our species."

I do not agree with all what he has to say (technology is not available to all and will likely create as many problems as it solves, do we really want to become demi-gods, immortal and living only for intellectual pleasures?), but it sure is an interesting read."

It is well researched and chock full of ideas and an inherent optimism about the future, which is refreshing after reading so many bleak sci-fi novels (like mine).The writing is somewhat dry however, and very little commentary or opinion is presented, instead piling on facts, research, maths, and graphs.

Kurzweil is an inventor, not a scientist, and it shows in this book of his - he even harps on about how technology is ""an extension of biological evolution."" If you're looking for a well-grounded introduction to how weird, wonderful and dangerous this century will be, my list of recommendations would place The Singularity Is Near close to the bottom of the list."

Finally, sometimes I think that our exponential progress might be slowed down a bit since some of this generations brightest minds work on social media apps and click bait instead of figuring out how to get to Mars.

Kurzweil compares the faster or exponential pace of technology compared to biological evolution and concluded that singularity , a vast growth in intelligence resulting in reshaping of the universe, is somewhere near 2045. His prediction is based on the eloquent comparison of slow biological intelligence growth compared to exponential technological intelligence. He argues that nanotechnology is an essential contributor to understand the brain and thereof advance in non biological intelligence based on the former information processing. I was fully immersed in this book especially when the author describes how human will overcome their biological limitations and become transbiological and then pure machines. The hypothetical debates between ethicists and materialists is captivating, the one between him, Darwin, Frued and Molly about consciousness is mind blowing .

241,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2021836-george,5,"HEAVY DISCLAIMER: this review will require a lot of repetition to stress a few important points. To properly convey the information will require that I take Kurzweil's side since I do not intend to do much in the way of refuting or debating his ideas.I have thoroughly enjoyed reading the predictions that Ray Kurzweil makes for the future of the human race. His track record of technological predictions to date has been very accurate and I expect that many of the things he forsees in this book will happen. But, I am also certain that many human beings are not ready for the technologies that he describes. Along the way to any potential technological Singularity, there will be a great deal of upheaval in many human arenas. Perhaps I should explain the notion of the Singularity first.The term is borrowed from a few disciplines and has multiple meanings within each of those fields. The general application of the term is a situation that describes a point beyond which anything is unknown. In math this is a formula with a solution so large as to be currently impossible to calculate but not infinite. In astrophysics this is what lies beyond the event horizon (the exact point where nothing can escape) of a black hole in space. In the case of the technological singularity it is the point where biological human technology surpasses the understanding of even the most brilliant humans.Kurzweil's overall belief is based upon his mathematical analysis of exponential growth of all information, from nature's DNA to the code behind Microsoft Windows and therefore ultimately information technology (not the IT profession). He's spent years developing formulas that have allowed him to safely make predictions about the core outcomes of information technology and he suggests that everything humans do is becoming information technology. This is already the case in the medical, entertainment and increasingly the manufacturing industries.But exponential growth is not limited to productivity. It also applies to world knowledge and the economy. Which are also information technologies. Technological growth affects world knowledge growth. We can easily see this in the much larger amount of information available to a larger segment of the world population thanks to the web. Indeed, I would not have been writing this review, nor would you be reading it now if the technologies that form the internet and support the web on top of it had not been developed. More world knowledge and information sharing also increase exponentially as well as bringing about new ideas and further technological progress. While there are still many who don't yet have access to the web, think about those who do today. People who didn't even have access to basic education only a decade or two ago now have access to a wide variety of information and educational opportunities that didn't exist a short time ago. This is one of Kurzweil's main points.The other point is that the exponential growth of technology combined with the exponential growth of world knowledge cause exponential growth of the world economy. Granted that there are currently many problems with the US economy, Kurzweil points to the surprisingly large numbers of people in developing nations who have come out of poverty just in the 15 years before he wrote this book. Like technological and knowledge growth, the expanding global economy provides more resources to further develop technology worldwide.Yet another point that he stresses is that the exponential growth of information technology is itself also grouwing exponentially. Where technological developments used to take decades to become reliable and widely used, the time has now shortened to less than a decade. Smart phones and digital music players are examples of faster development and adoption of new technologies. If his predictions are correct, technologies like this will continue to become reliable and ubiquitous in less than five years as we traverse the current decade.He spent more time discussing these things near the end of the book rather than the beginning. But I chose to explain them first to give you some concepts which may help you understand why he believes in the more startling predictions he makes for the 21st century. These predictions are not likely to sit well with many people and as a result they will either deny the possibility, or argue against them from the current day mindset.The Singularity is Near is a very information dense book. Nearly 500 pages are used to explain, postulate and defend the idea that the ultimate form that humanity will take is non-biological. He predicts that this will happen in the second half of the 21st century. So some of you reading this may live through this transformation. As much as it sounds like science fiction his predictions are well within the bounds of reality. For example, he suggests that as we replace more and more of our bodies with non-biological components (we already do this) our machines will simultaneously become less and less machine-like and more and more human. This will occur to such an extent that making the distinction between ""human"" and ""machine"" intelligence will eventually have no meaning.First let's talk about A.I. (artificial intelligence), which is the main technology that promises to give our machines human qualities. Many people believe that artificial intelligence, as a field of development is long dead. Kurzweil counters by pointing out the many things machines do today could only be accomplished with partial or complete human intervention just a decade or two ago. The fact is that A.I. has become so successful that, after A.I. becomes capable of performing yet another previously human only task, it appears completely unremarkable. A.I. has not failed but it is so commonplace in our day to day lives that no one notices, unless it malfunctions. A.I. research continues and makes more progress every year, so more gains of this nature lie in the future.One thing that really struck me while reading this book is that humanity is not ready for many of the things he predicts if you tell people outright what to expect. But, as they live through the changes as they occur, humans adapt. In many cases, people either wonder how they lived without the new technologies or at worst they grudgingly see the benefits, with only a few exceptions.Much as the industrial age shaped much of the late 19th and first half of the 20th century, Kurzweil believes that through the combination of genetics, nanotechnology and robotics the information age will define the first half of the 21st century. I say the first half because Kurzweil predicts that the Singularity will happen somewhere in the 2040s. This is when machines will surpass human beings and their capability for thought and emotion.The changes that I've personally observed over the past three decades are in keeping with his exponential models. The changes of just the past ten years have been considerably accelerated compared to the previous 20, and that's his point. Had you asked someone with little interest in electronics or computers only 25 years ago if they thought that they would ever own a pocket sized device that was a phone that worked almost anywhere and had A.I. in it that would spell check, predict words as they type and allow for hands free voice dialing and touch screens, many of those people would have thought you were reading from a science fiction novel. Between the years 2000 and 2010, I've seen wireless networking develop from large, slow clunky cards for PCs, to small wireless networking radios in SD cards for cameras about the size of a quarter. This is exactly the sort of accelerated change Kurzweil is describing.A philosophical issue that Kurzweil discusses is the concept of consciousness, or what makes us human. If humanity begins to replace biological components to the extent that everyone is eventually non-biological, can we say that they are no longerr human? If you really think so, then ask yourself, what is the cut off point for being human? Replacement of the heart? The brain? A certain fraction or percentage of cells? Kurzweil suggests that what makes us human is our minds including our emotions as well as our experiences and ideas. Because of this, he believes that even if we ""uploaded"" our minds into a virtual reality and were no longer physical, we would still be human. He knows that this will be one of the greater philosophical questions of th 21st century. One that may cause a lot of problems for humans as these changes happen.The other side of the equation are the machines we are building. Once our machines have emotional intelligence and can interact with us just like other humans, can we still say they aren't conscious? No one has developed a way to measure or detect consciousness in humans, so how can we say that intelligent machines that can think and feel like we do, aren't really conscious? Just these two views of consciousness are going to bring about a lot of difficult exchanges among humans and according to Kurzweil's time line, we're only 30 years away from the beginning of that era.Once again, this book is huge and covers a lot of ground. That makes writing a good summary and review quite difficult. I also don't want to give too much away about the book so that anyone interested will have some things to look forward to. But here are a few teasers. What would you think of a human who no longer has a heart or blood? How about clouds of nanomachines that create ephemeral physical manifestations in the real world of virtual items and intellects? Do you think the notion that a future intelligent race originated from humans will eventually have the power to create more computational devices out of the sun itself? Even the entire universe? Just these few hints at what is in the book should give you some idea why I think most people will not accept or relate to these ideas. I think he's pretty close to correct for many of his extrapolations, but there is no guarantee. If any of these ideas intrigue or disturb you, give the book a try."
242,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45322768-adam,5,"I've heard so much said about Ray Kurzweil over the years but never got around to reading this controversial book. I expected to read these fantastical predictions of a future with no basis in reality. Instead this book is a very thorough, well researched, well supported examination of progress and where it is almost certainly inevitably headed.To be sure, the book hasn't aged perfectly in the 14 years since its publication. Kurzweil makes predictions about advanced technologies which he believes will be commonplace as early as the 2020s and, now that the decade in question has started, it seems unlikely these will play out. In that sense, he is a bit optimistic but I don't think he's likely off by that much. His predictions of progress are based on reliable trends. The technologies he suggests are grounded in physical reality. There is no magical leap needed for everything to fall in place. By putting replication of the human mind as the path to the singularity we remove ourselves from the unpredictable path of some software breakthrough which may, or may not, occur first. While Kurweil may assume an aggressive timeline, the timeline itself does not seem to be in question.Kurweil is himself very open to the idea of modifying himself and humanity. I am absolutely on board with this and embrace the type of future he is detailing in these pages. Others I think may not be quite as open to the idea. While he downplays the resistance the average person may have to such things as life extension therapies, I think they will still come just perhaps at a slower pace than he thinks. Something being within our scientific reach doesn't mean it will happen. We've had the technology for human cloning for decades and haven't down anything with it. We currently have the ability to rewrite the human genome and it isn't getting much traction. While people are generally on board with a single life saving technology they don't seem to have much appetite for general life extension. It's a bit like AI. A lot of people are using AI to find solutions to specific problems but not many people are trying to make a general purpose human intelligent AI system. A lot of people are trying to cure cancer or any number of ailments but not a lot of people are looking into fundamentally extending life. Will it happen? Almost certainly. Will it happen in Ray Kurzweil's lifetime? I can't be sure. How many others have gone to the steps he has to extent their lives? Almost none.All around I love the author's approach. He studied computer programming and has an eye for the physical aspects of computing as well as the programming and algorithm side. He approaches a problem with a rational view of it. The book details things in a straightforward way. No doubt that computing will continue to advance. No doubt that nanotech will become more common. No doubt that models of the brain will become better and better. No doubt that we will soon have the computing ability to run a simulation of a mind. Will we be able to simulate a human mind on a computer? The only difficulty will be in scanning and replicating it. There is surely nothing magical about a brain which makes it impossible to duplicate on a computer!Is the Singularity Near? I don't know. I think it's coming, but it's hard to predict just when. Ray Kurzweil isn't pulling his predictions out of nowhere. He did the work and he's on the right track. For his sake as well as that of all of us, I hope it's soon!"
243,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1899624-zach,3,"This pseudo-religious, pseudo-scientific tome by one of the world's leading futurists lays out a timeline to a moment when the pace of technological innovation -- specifically, in the power of computer hardware and software -- becomes so rapid that, from our perspective in the present, it occupies a single point in time. Hence, the singularity.Kurzweil's predictions are based primarily upon an observation made by Gordon Moore of Intel: that computing power per dollar will double every 18 months. This isn't exactly what he said; it's actually an expression of transistor density. But the effect that consumers and Kurzweil care about is price-performance, which is doubling every 18 months. Kurzweil looks into the future and extrapolates that $1000 will buy you as much processing power as a human brain by the mid 2020s and more than all human brains in existence by the 2030s. More intriguingly, he also looks into the past and postulates an identical exponential progress, starting with the evolution of DNA and continuing on up through homo sapiens, agriculture, the wheel, and investment banking. This observation, that ""milestones"" in ""progress"" seem to be happening more frequently as time goes by, is the basis of his Law of Accelerating Returns, which is the cornerstone of his belief system. Basically, Kurzweil believes that all evolutionary systems, of which technology is one, increase their ""order"" exponentially. Therefore, it's no coincidence that it took 2 billion years for DNA to evolve, but then only 1 billion years for eukaryotes, then only 500 million years for multicellular organisms, and so on, each milestone occurring in half as much time as it took to achieve the one before it. For reference, see:Canoncial milestones in the SingularityThe foundation for his Law of Accelerating Returns is by far the weakest part of his argument for what the future will be like. He asserts that evolutionary systems inevitably increase their ""order"" exponentially, but never approaches a rigorous definition of the term. This hand-waving approach to his fundamental theory really comes to a head when he talks about the Fermi Paradox, the observation that intelligent life in the universe seems to be uncommon. This flies in the face of Kurzweil's thesis, which is that intelligence inevitably evolves from DNA up through brains through supercomputers, until eventually a civilization is converting all the matter and energy in the universe into one giant computational device at an exponential rate. If such a project is underway on behalf of some other intelligent race, they're being awfully quiet about it. Therefore, a futurist is forced to either 1) apply a universal anthropic principle: we must be the first intelligent (technology-creating) race in the universe; or 2) accept that there's nothing inevitable about the evolution of intelligence or technology. Kurzweil chooses option 1), and while he makes an eloquent case for his choice it's far from airtight. Beetles have been evolving exactly as long as we have -- they're more successful than us by any evolutionary metric -- and yet they possess no intelligence.Kurzweil is at his best when he sticks to the predictions that his objective measures of price-performance of information technologies actually support, and these predictions really are awe-inspiring. We can say with great certainty that the years of the 2020s will in fact give rise to truly earth-moving, paradigm-shattering technologies as a result of cheap, ubiquitous computers. Kurzweil has a lot of specific examples, mostly concerning the augmentation of human intelligence and virtual reality interfaces for the brain, that are best read in the book itself.It's worth noting that Kurzweil doesn't seem to think that peak oil will affect his predictions in the least. James Kunstler's The Long Emergency Surviving the End of Oil, Climate Change, and Other Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty-First Century talks about the diminishing returns of technology, while Kurzweil posits the Law of Accelerating Returns. Clearly, one of these men is a pessimist and one an optimist. The question that concerns all of us is: who is right? I view the singularity and peak oil as a race, with the future of human civilization at stake. Can the exponential increase in technological progress replace our fossil fuel energy before Saudi production peaks? No one knows; Kurzweil is pretty bad at predicting specific applications of technology (he thought we would have glasses that use lasers to paint images onto our retinas by 2009), but his data on the exponential increase in price-performance in information technologies is so predictable as to be considered infallible. There's enough solar energy hitting this planet to replace our fossil fuel use and then some. Kunstler thinks we'll be unable to harness it as a civilization because of the how very little time we have until oil production peaks; but then, he clearly doesn't understand the exponential nature of progress, so his predictions are suspect. Kurzweil, on the other hand, is a self-admitted utopian optimist who sincerely believes that humankind's ascension to the stars is not just likely, but destined, preordained.So to reiterate: should you be investing in canned food or in nanotechnology companies (and virtual pornography firms, of course)? I can't tell you how to live your life, but my personal perspective on this dilemma is as follows: in 20 years we will either be living in the middle of the fantastic future promised by the Singularity; or we'll be back to an agrarian lifestyle and focused mainly on staying alive and killing our neighbors. Since the latter outcome, the total and near-irrevocable destruction of our way of life, is unthinkable, I prefer to believe in the former. In other words, I choose not to invest in canned food, because I can't imagine living in a world where I'll need it.I can't say I recommend this book very strongly, except for those who already have a strong interest in the Singularity. The subject matter is often fascinating and thought-provoking, but the presentation leaves much to be desired. Kurzweil rambles and repeats himself, and multiple times lets his narrative devolve into pages upon pages of bulleted lists. I'm sorry, Mr. Kurzweil, but I could have gotten that on Wikipedia."
244,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3037001-pamela,4,"It's tempting to call this book science fiction since its fundamental idea seems so far-fetched. Much can be said about this book, much has been said. I find it hard to write a review because this book is very big, in length and ideas. Kurzweil is a very smart man who has already made our lives better, he’s an inventor and coder. He developed electronic keyboards, text-to-speech readers, OCR and more. He’s very smart. He’s also written several books about the future, or where humans are headed. The Singularity is Near is nearly a decade old already, but hardly dated. There are a lot of charts that can be updated, but overall the book is still very relevant. I would encourage anyone to read the book. Warning it is not easy, the writing style is dense, sometimes dull. But it’s not quite as long as it appears with about 20% of the book being notes and index. The basic gist of the Singularity is three-fold: GNR. Genetics, Nanotechnology and Robotics, and everything is becoming information. How everything becomes information and the speed at which everything is going to change is due to Moore's Law, which is about exponential growth, and Kurzweil takes it a little further with “Law of Accelerating Returns.” We will have leaps of achievements and ability in genetics and along with nanotechnology, we will repair and renew our bodies, helping to extend our life span. Nanotechnology will end up allowing us to scan and reverse engineer our brain, and ultimately be able to transfer our consciousness (memories and personality) to another substrate, meaning a digital form. Smart A.I. and supercomputers will help us achieve this. After merging with computers, becoming biological and digital, we will have an infinite life-span as our consciousness, our individuality is preserved digitally. The end result is unknown, we as humans, will reach a Singularity where the unknown is unforeseeable because we just can't comprehend what is next. Okay, I probably butchered that summary, skipped a ton but yeah, it’s wild! It's all quite fascinating. Kurzweil thinks we are on the cusp of these revolutions and maybe the baby-boomer generation will see it if they take care of their bodies. People born after 1960 most likely will. Sure there are a lot of reasons to discount this future, and Kurzweil writes a full chapter on responding to critics. (The chapters are quite long!) Since the publication of his book The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence, which has similar ideas, Kurzweil had many critics, and he explains why they are wrong. The first few are the typical: disbelief this is possible, and what about rich/poor gap. He writes that all of this can be overcome, and will. Personally I think Kurzweil discounts a few things a little too readily, such as people or governments putting the brakes on this trend, as well as the rich and poor divide. As he is wealthy it may be hard for him to appreciate the difference between having money and barely surviving. He says that it is irrelevant since in the beginning technology is expensive and doesn't work well, only the rich buy the devices, but as the technology improves it goes through stages until it works great, is ubiquitous and practically free. Perhaps the great lifesaving and body improving technologies will work down to the poor masses but in the short time frame he claims I do have strong doubt. Using his law of accelerating returns, timelines shrink and he claims the time difference will be in a few years instead of decades that we see now. He uses AIDS drugs, cell phones and the internet as examples. Perhaps. All in all, it's a very optimistic outlook on the future of mankind. Take that in contrast to other outlooks, such as Jared Diamond, Thomas Friedman or the countless number of environmentalist's such as Bill McKibben. I have been steeped in those ideas and so this one of Kurzweil's I find quite hopeful. Kurzweil has been spot on with many of his predictions and quite a few of his critics don’t disagree with his conclusions, just the timeline, not never, just a matter of when. Did want to keep this short, but find it impossible. "
245,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86318-amy,2,"Hooooo, boy. Where do you even start with this thing?Stylistically, it has a lot of flaws. Super repetitive. Sputters out at the end, and then as an appendix he throws in a few equations. The hypothetical dialogues interspersed in the text are sometimes eye-rollingly lame, although, to be fair, they just as often directly responded to questions/criticisms the book had raised in my mind.I'm not sure who his audience is supposed to be. The math and theoretical physics stuff was not always sufficiently explained in that I, a fairly intelligent lay reader who at least has vague recollections of high school math and science, just couldn't follow significant portions of his supposed proof. I think most general readers would have the same problem.I don't have the computer science or math background to evaluate a lot of his assertions, so it is hard to tell how much is plausible, if far-fetched, and how much is pure crazy. I am perfectly willing to believe that at some point, advances in technology will render everyday life difficult to recognize. I am on board with the possibility that ""we will be cyborgs."" My mind started to close when he discussed how in a century or so we will have expanded into the galaxy and started spreading throughout the universe, and perhaps beyond, in search of more information processing capacity. While it is an interesting possibility, I'm unclear on how that process will work.His explanation for how a lot of this will be accomplished boils down to: ""We will be supersmart because our computers, with whom we will be merging, will also be supersmart, so while I don't know how we're going to do this, we'll figure it out."" Well, maybe, but you're going to have to do a little better than that.Also, what a dreary view of the future and our potential expansion into the stars. No learning about new environments, or learning about ourselves, really. Just a bunch of boring cyborgs goofing off in simulated environments and using up the materials of the universe (with apparently no thought given to who or what else might be using those materials) to make our processing units run better. And apparently the best use of this knowledge will be: (i) to live indefinitely, (ii) to be supersmart, and (iii) to hang out in virtual reality. What's the point of (i) and (ii) if all you're going to do with it is (iii)?He sort of tries to address, but doesn't really, how you are really alive if your ""consciousness"" is merged with a mechanical substrate while the physical you is stranded in meatspace. Maybe I am a selfish jerk, but I am more concerned about death because it means I won't be alive anymore, rather than because the world will be deprived of the privilege of interacting with me or an exact replica of my personality.He doesn't address more than in passing the real-world political obstacles to the supposed availability of cheap, unlimited resources he says is coming. Sure, sure, the big fossil fuel companies will totally stand by and not try to block cheap solar power, etc. They will cast aside their profit motives because ... more CPUs? I don't know. Similarly troubling is the author's lack of serious discussion of the fact that greater reliance on computers means less jobs. He seems to say that this is cool, because everything in the future will be really inexpensive, but this ignores his own point that information (software forming the patterns, for example, of all those nifty clothes we will create on 3D printers) will be the real commodity.Finally, he disregards some pretty obvious privacy concerns. People flip out about their Facebook settings, but within a century most people will be uploading/merging/sharing their actual consciousness online? He doesn't discuss any methods of or possible desire to keep any of the self separate from this collective consciousness, but wouldn't that be a huge concern for most people? Putting your drunk pictures on the internet is one thing, sharing your brain with the world quite another.For all of that, I did slog through the whole thing, and I kept talking about what I had read, so it definitely raised some interesting points. And I suspect at least some of the author's claims are on point (it was already pretty spot-on about on-board nav systems in cars). But from my (admittedly technically handicapped) viewpoint, it winds up somewhere off the rails."
246,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19648573-mark-locascio,2,"A lot of the reviews here seem to be saying ""it's complicated, so it must be profound."" This is not true. There is no reason for this book to be 650 pages long. Kurzweil's thesis is pretty straightforward: technology advances at an exponential pace. By that logic, there's reason to believe that nonbiological (i.e., computational) intelligence will eventually become much more advanced than human intelligence. This book is essentially Kurzweil's prediction for how great it'll be.I'm not fond of speculation about science... technology rarely evolves the way you think it will. But a well-crafted opinion would still be an interesting read. Unfortunately, this was not well-crafted. The book is long and rambling. There are wild detours that span dozens of pages. Academic research is misinterpreted and extrapolated well beyond what any real scientist would allow. The end-notes are a pain in the nads. The fixation on lactation and virtualized, gender-swapped sex adds nothing but confusion.The book isn't getting a poor review from me because I couldn't understand it. I did graduate research in both nanomechanics and robotics, two of the areas Kurzweil writes about for too many pages. I know enough to know that he's really stretching here. This book seemed like he'd had a lot of conversations with a lot of smart people, and wanted to publish as much of it as he could to appear knowledgeable himself. In the end, it just seemed like he didn't know which book he wanted to write, and wasn't qualified to write any of them.There was some good discussion of the ethics of artificial intelligence, I'll give him that. And for what it's worth, his predictions likely won't be completely wrong. But this book could have benefited quite a bit from a strong editorial influence or some peer-review. Skip it. Go browse his web site and save yourself about 600 pages."
247,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2683760-gary,4,"Rarely I read a book that truly blows my mind. This is one. Noted futurist Kurzweil lays out a radically different view of the future enabled by exponential development of artificial intelligence. A couple of the key milestones on the way to the future he envisions:-By 2029, computers will have advanced so far as to be able to pass a Turing test, which essentially means that they will be able to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of biological humans.-And by 2045, the ""singularity"", meaning merging of biological and non-biological humanity will be a reality.So the singularity is near, but not so near that is going to happen, say, next year. If Kurzweil is even half right, we are in for some incredible advances in genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics, his ""big three"" technological revolutions that will pave the way for the human-machine melding he sees coming.I can't say that I agree with everything presented here, but neither can I refute the powerful argument he makes for the path that our civilization appears to be on: after what will be only several hundred years of having machines in our lives, we basically will have developed them to the point where they are as smart as us, and very soon after that, nearly indescribably smarter than us. Take a listen/read, this is powerful stuff with all sorts of moral implications. It will make you think very hard about what may be to come in the future.**The narrator sounds a bit like one of the old Speak & Spell toys from the 1980s, which is kind of funny given the text-to-speech technology development that Kurzweil has been involved in."
248,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59510129-chris,3,"Kurzweil makes remarkably far-sighted predictions about humanity will change during our lifetimes. The very far-sighted analysis on physical limitation of computation is quite interesting, as are the predictions about the pre-singularity advances in genetics, nanotechnology and robotics. However, Kurzweil quickly dismisses two glaring issues with surprising immaturity. One, he claims that since technologies like self-replicating nanobots will become cheaper at an exponential rate, they will be ubiquitous among the poor seven years later than the rich, so access to resources will be democratized. This opposes all historical precedent and should not be dismissed without much stronger evidence. Two, he claims that Strong AI is not an existential threat because we can also develop a Strong AI immune system to defend against bad actors, and our immune systems work pretty well. He invokes his argument at least three times but fails to state the obvious that people’s immune systems fail sometimes, but we only get one universe. If a Strong AI immune system fails in a vastly interconnected system, it’s not just one person who dies, it’s everybody. Finally, I was disappointed by Kurzweil’s lack of discussion of the societal implications of inevitable rapid technological “progress.” For something that will affect the whole world, he focuses an awful lot on what it will mean for an individual - implicitly, one who can afford it."
249,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/136271-maria,2,"Predicting the future is always hard and Kurzweil whole hypothesis is that there is a point in the future when our technology will shift so dramatically that we can't imagine what it will be like. He then proceeds to explain just what it will be like. Why I started this book: Another audio from my professional reading list.Why I finished it: Good thing it was an audio, I kept a steady pace and wasn't drowned in the ridiculousness. Buddy Read: Where's My Jetpack?: A Guide to the Amazing Science Fiction Future That Never Arrived. The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology might have been more helpful/wonderful a decade ago... but I'm struggling now. That's the problem with predictions about future technology. You might guess that we'd have hand-held computers but who would guess that we would use them to watch cats, other videos and argue with strangers in thread wars?"
250,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47739629-stefanos,3,"Kurzweil has strong points justifying his (calculated) predictions about us primates rapidly transcending to a (much) higher and more capable species through the help of technology. Or is it computers reaching human consciousness and far surpassing human capabilities in the immediate future? Actually he makes both claims and the fact that those massive changes are happening exponentially (Ray Kurzweil's Law of Accelerating Returns) in the next 20-30 years, is downright crazy to think of.You know what they say, ""extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"" and Kurzweil provides a fair amount of these and to his defense, in the 15 years that have passed since the publication of this book, several of these predictions (that I know of) have already been materialized. There is much to digest in this book and while the ideas are fascinating, the book itself is a hard read, with some repeated content (for clarity?) and tries to analyze in depth several subjects thus losing the reader's focus from time to time. Still, a classic if you want to dive into the ""Singularity is near"" trend."

Some people have said this book is the Bible of the Singularitianism as new religion.. and that felt true in the way it was mostly throwing affirmations into my face and asking me to just believe them (while implying that if I didn't, it was my own fault from not being enlightened enough)In summary : Glad i read it, gave me a lot to think about... Even happier to be done with it, painful from a literary standpoint :("

Among those three I fear an experiment with self-replicating nanobots gone wrong is the most likely to wipe us out. I also think that the time scale may be a bit off but that might just be me not being able to think in terms of exponential growth even though Kurzweil tries to teach me over and over again. It's inevitable that we will (continue to) improve ourselves through genetics, augment us with nanotechnology and invent artificial life and live as mainly information (or ""patterns""). Combinations of these will basically make us immortal and, in my opinion, still human but with way better control of our evolution. The singularity is coming. I just hope I won't miss it."

Even if it all will come to pass. Talking about future with today's terms seems frightful and terrifying, but I'd suggest to cross the bridge when we come to it. It's ok to speculate as a thought experiment, because it's also cool and exciting, but don't get an heart attack about something that doesn't make any sense with the current information.But that said, I cannot wait to get cheap quality replacement/upgrade parts to by biological organs.

The information is quite heavy and technical to digest from the first time (especially if you are a non-scientist). Second, Ray is of course brilliant, but there is just too much. It's like he is trying to write about everything, at the same time. Third, the future is scary. In the future, human will be part human part machine. Ray is trying to be optimistic about the convergence of both, but somehow shows only the positive sides of it. For example, even now we have medical technology that can do miracles but unless you have good insurance, you won't have access to it. So what are the guarantees that future advances in technology will be accessible to all, not just the richest 1 percent. Overall, most of the book is wishful thinking - or living in ones head."

I don't think he is off by much, but his optimistic predictions do not realistically account for political, economic and other social factors that can slow many of this down. When we landed on the moon, just ten years after the first man in space, everyone assumed much faster growth of space-faring technologies, but out political will was just not there, and 2001 Space Odyssey still remains a science fiction. However, I too strongly believe that a technological evolution of humankind is not too far off. The next hundred years is going to be the most exciting period for our species."

While other scientific linked to the society, Ray paints a very bright future for us where GNR (genetics, nanotechnology and robotics) will solve solve all the world problems: medical, environmental, sociological...If I read Kurzweil, I remember why it is fun to be an engineer, combining sciences from all different domains to create new technology to reshape mankind. I do not agree with all what he has to say (technology is not available to all and will likely create as many problems as it solves, do we really want to become demi-gods, immortal and living only for intellectual pleasures?), but it sure is an interesting read."

In some ways that helps the author's case since many of his predictions have already, or about to, become a reality. It is well researched and chock full of ideas and an inherent optimism about the future, which is refreshing after reading so many bleak sci-fi novels (like mine).The writing is somewhat dry however, and very little commentary or opinion is presented, instead piling on facts, research, maths, and graphs. Also, the graphs are very difficult to read on a Kindle, it could have been formatted better."

Kurzweil is an inventor, not a scientist, and it shows in this book of his - he even harps on about how technology is ""an extension of biological evolution."" If you're looking for a well-grounded introduction to how weird, wonderful and dangerous this century will be, my list of recommendations would place The Singularity Is Near close to the bottom of the list."

He goes off the deep end in the middle but ends on a strong note.I still think he is overly optimistic about the reliability of complex software though, as well as his timeline for general AI. Finally, sometimes I think that our exponential progress might be slowed down a bit since some of this generations brightest minds work on social media apps and click bait instead of figuring out how to get to Mars. But I have hope that things will get better soon."

I also found Ray Kurzweil's narrative and view of the future to be rather endearing, focusing on these exponential leaps and how humanity will transcend the bounds of biology and I am just READY for the transhumanist technocult. Also of note, I have some of the OCR software that he had created so I appreciate Ray Kurzweil for his contributions towards accessibility. "

Also, the way the book is structured is awfully boring. Most of what he says seems to be repetitive (that may be because I have already read a truckload of articles on the AI revolution, consequently making the longwinded explanations in this book seem unnecessary to me).I‘d rather learn more about this idea from scientific papers, articles and videos than through this book."

Kurzweil compares the faster or exponential pace of technology compared to biological evolution and concluded that singularity , a vast growth in intelligence resulting in reshaping of the universe, is somewhere near 2045. His prediction is based on the eloquent comparison of slow biological intelligence growth compared to exponential technological intelligence. He argues that nanotechnology is an essential contributor to understand the brain and thereof advance in non biological intelligence based on the former information processing. I was fully immersed in this book especially when the author describes how human will overcome their biological limitations and become transbiological and then pure machines. The hypothetical debates between ethicists and materialists is captivating, the one between him, Darwin, Frued and Molly about consciousness is mind blowing . Whether his predictions are accurate or not, Ray is an ultimate genius and this book takes you into an intellectual journey, I will definitely read all his books."
271,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2021836-george,5,"HEAVY DISCLAIMER: this review will require a lot of repetition to stress a few important points. To properly convey the information will require that I take Kurzweil's side since I do not intend to do much in the way of refuting or debating his ideas.I have thoroughly enjoyed reading the predictions that Ray Kurzweil makes for the future of the human race. His track record of technological predictions to date has been very accurate and I expect that many of the things he forsees in this book will happen. But, I am also certain that many human beings are not ready for the technologies that he describes. Along the way to any potential technological Singularity, there will be a great deal of upheaval in many human arenas. Perhaps I should explain the notion of the Singularity first.The term is borrowed from a few disciplines and has multiple meanings within each of those fields. The general application of the term is a situation that describes a point beyond which anything is unknown. In math this is a formula with a solution so large as to be currently impossible to calculate but not infinite. In astrophysics this is what lies beyond the event horizon (the exact point where nothing can escape) of a black hole in space. In the case of the technological singularity it is the point where biological human technology surpasses the understanding of even the most brilliant humans.Kurzweil's overall belief is based upon his mathematical analysis of exponential growth of all information, from nature's DNA to the code behind Microsoft Windows and therefore ultimately information technology (not the IT profession). He's spent years developing formulas that have allowed him to safely make predictions about the core outcomes of information technology and he suggests that everything humans do is becoming information technology. This is already the case in the medical, entertainment and increasingly the manufacturing industries.But exponential growth is not limited to productivity. It also applies to world knowledge and the economy. Which are also information technologies. Technological growth affects world knowledge growth. We can easily see this in the much larger amount of information available to a larger segment of the world population thanks to the web. Indeed, I would not have been writing this review, nor would you be reading it now if the technologies that form the internet and support the web on top of it had not been developed. More world knowledge and information sharing also increase exponentially as well as bringing about new ideas and further technological progress. While there are still many who don't yet have access to the web, think about those who do today. People who didn't even have access to basic education only a decade or two ago now have access to a wide variety of information and educational opportunities that didn't exist a short time ago. This is one of Kurzweil's main points.The other point is that the exponential growth of technology combined with the exponential growth of world knowledge cause exponential growth of the world economy. Granted that there are currently many problems with the US economy, Kurzweil points to the surprisingly large numbers of people in developing nations who have come out of poverty just in the 15 years before he wrote this book. Like technological and knowledge growth, the expanding global economy provides more resources to further develop technology worldwide.Yet another point that he stresses is that the exponential growth of information technology is itself also grouwing exponentially. Where technological developments used to take decades to become reliable and widely used, the time has now shortened to less than a decade. Smart phones and digital music players are examples of faster development and adoption of new technologies. If his predictions are correct, technologies like this will continue to become reliable and ubiquitous in less than five years as we traverse the current decade.He spent more time discussing these things near the end of the book rather than the beginning. But I chose to explain them first to give you some concepts which may help you understand why he believes in the more startling predictions he makes for the 21st century. These predictions are not likely to sit well with many people and as a result they will either deny the possibility, or argue against them from the current day mindset.The Singularity is Near is a very information dense book. Nearly 500 pages are used to explain, postulate and defend the idea that the ultimate form that humanity will take is non-biological. He predicts that this will happen in the second half of the 21st century. So some of you reading this may live through this transformation. As much as it sounds like science fiction his predictions are well within the bounds of reality. For example, he suggests that as we replace more and more of our bodies with non-biological components (we already do this) our machines will simultaneously become less and less machine-like and more and more human. This will occur to such an extent that making the distinction between ""human"" and ""machine"" intelligence will eventually have no meaning.First let's talk about A.I. (artificial intelligence), which is the main technology that promises to give our machines human qualities. Many people believe that artificial intelligence, as a field of development is long dead. Kurzweil counters by pointing out the many things machines do today could only be accomplished with partial or complete human intervention just a decade or two ago. The fact is that A.I. has become so successful that, after A.I. becomes capable of performing yet another previously human only task, it appears completely unremarkable. A.I. has not failed but it is so commonplace in our day to day lives that no one notices, unless it malfunctions. A.I. research continues and makes more progress every year, so more gains of this nature lie in the future.One thing that really struck me while reading this book is that humanity is not ready for many of the things he predicts if you tell people outright what to expect. But, as they live through the changes as they occur, humans adapt. In many cases, people either wonder how they lived without the new technologies or at worst they grudgingly see the benefits, with only a few exceptions.Much as the industrial age shaped much of the late 19th and first half of the 20th century, Kurzweil believes that through the combination of genetics, nanotechnology and robotics the information age will define the first half of the 21st century. I say the first half because Kurzweil predicts that the Singularity will happen somewhere in the 2040s. This is when machines will surpass human beings and their capability for thought and emotion.The changes that I've personally observed over the past three decades are in keeping with his exponential models. The changes of just the past ten years have been considerably accelerated compared to the previous 20, and that's his point. Had you asked someone with little interest in electronics or computers only 25 years ago if they thought that they would ever own a pocket sized device that was a phone that worked almost anywhere and had A.I. in it that would spell check, predict words as they type and allow for hands free voice dialing and touch screens, many of those people would have thought you were reading from a science fiction novel. Between the years 2000 and 2010, I've seen wireless networking develop from large, slow clunky cards for PCs, to small wireless networking radios in SD cards for cameras about the size of a quarter. This is exactly the sort of accelerated change Kurzweil is describing.A philosophical issue that Kurzweil discusses is the concept of consciousness, or what makes us human. If humanity begins to replace biological components to the extent that everyone is eventually non-biological, can we say that they are no longerr human? If you really think so, then ask yourself, what is the cut off point for being human? Replacement of the heart? The brain? A certain fraction or percentage of cells? Kurzweil suggests that what makes us human is our minds including our emotions as well as our experiences and ideas. Because of this, he believes that even if we ""uploaded"" our minds into a virtual reality and were no longer physical, we would still be human. He knows that this will be one of the greater philosophical questions of th 21st century. One that may cause a lot of problems for humans as these changes happen.The other side of the equation are the machines we are building. Once our machines have emotional intelligence and can interact with us just like other humans, can we still say they aren't conscious? No one has developed a way to measure or detect consciousness in humans, so how can we say that intelligent machines that can think and feel like we do, aren't really conscious? Just these two views of consciousness are going to bring about a lot of difficult exchanges among humans and according to Kurzweil's time line, we're only 30 years away from the beginning of that era.Once again, this book is huge and covers a lot of ground. That makes writing a good summary and review quite difficult. I also don't want to give too much away about the book so that anyone interested will have some things to look forward to. But here are a few teasers. What would you think of a human who no longer has a heart or blood? How about clouds of nanomachines that create ephemeral physical manifestations in the real world of virtual items and intellects? Do you think the notion that a future intelligent race originated from humans will eventually have the power to create more computational devices out of the sun itself? Even the entire universe? Just these few hints at what is in the book should give you some idea why I think most people will not accept or relate to these ideas. I think he's pretty close to correct for many of his extrapolations, but there is no guarantee. If any of these ideas intrigue or disturb you, give the book a try."
272,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45322768-adam,5,"I've heard so much said about Ray Kurzweil over the years but never got around to reading this controversial book. I expected to read these fantastical predictions of a future with no basis in reality. Instead this book is a very thorough, well researched, well supported examination of progress and where it is almost certainly inevitably headed.To be sure, the book hasn't aged perfectly in the 14 years since its publication. Kurzweil makes predictions about advanced technologies which he believes will be commonplace as early as the 2020s and, now that the decade in question has started, it seems unlikely these will play out. In that sense, he is a bit optimistic but I don't think he's likely off by that much. His predictions of progress are based on reliable trends. The technologies he suggests are grounded in physical reality. There is no magical leap needed for everything to fall in place. By putting replication of the human mind as the path to the singularity we remove ourselves from the unpredictable path of some software breakthrough which may, or may not, occur first. While Kurweil may assume an aggressive timeline, the timeline itself does not seem to be in question.Kurweil is himself very open to the idea of modifying himself and humanity. I am absolutely on board with this and embrace the type of future he is detailing in these pages. Others I think may not be quite as open to the idea. While he downplays the resistance the average person may have to such things as life extension therapies, I think they will still come just perhaps at a slower pace than he thinks. Something being within our scientific reach doesn't mean it will happen. We've had the technology for human cloning for decades and haven't down anything with it. We currently have the ability to rewrite the human genome and it isn't getting much traction. While people are generally on board with a single life saving technology they don't seem to have much appetite for general life extension. It's a bit like AI. A lot of people are using AI to find solutions to specific problems but not many people are trying to make a general purpose human intelligent AI system. A lot of people are trying to cure cancer or any number of ailments but not a lot of people are looking into fundamentally extending life. Will it happen? Almost certainly. Will it happen in Ray Kurzweil's lifetime? I can't be sure. How many others have gone to the steps he has to extent their lives? Almost none.All around I love the author's approach. He studied computer programming and has an eye for the physical aspects of computing as well as the programming and algorithm side. He approaches a problem with a rational view of it. The book details things in a straightforward way. No doubt that computing will continue to advance. No doubt that nanotech will become more common. No doubt that models of the brain will become better and better. No doubt that we will soon have the computing ability to run a simulation of a mind. Will we be able to simulate a human mind on a computer? The only difficulty will be in scanning and replicating it. There is surely nothing magical about a brain which makes it impossible to duplicate on a computer!Is the Singularity Near? I don't know. I think it's coming, but it's hard to predict just when. Ray Kurzweil isn't pulling his predictions out of nowhere. He did the work and he's on the right track. For his sake as well as that of all of us, I hope it's soon!"
273,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1899624-zach,3,"This pseudo-religious, pseudo-scientific tome by one of the world's leading futurists lays out a timeline to a moment when the pace of technological innovation -- specifically, in the power of computer hardware and software -- becomes so rapid that, from our perspective in the present, it occupies a single point in time. Hence, the singularity.Kurzweil's predictions are based primarily upon an observation made by Gordon Moore of Intel: that computing power per dollar will double every 18 months. This isn't exactly what he said; it's actually an expression of transistor density. But the effect that consumers and Kurzweil care about is price-performance, which is doubling every 18 months. Kurzweil looks into the future and extrapolates that $1000 will buy you as much processing power as a human brain by the mid 2020s and more than all human brains in existence by the 2030s. More intriguingly, he also looks into the past and postulates an identical exponential progress, starting with the evolution of DNA and continuing on up through homo sapiens, agriculture, the wheel, and investment banking. This observation, that ""milestones"" in ""progress"" seem to be happening more frequently as time goes by, is the basis of his Law of Accelerating Returns, which is the cornerstone of his belief system. Basically, Kurzweil believes that all evolutionary systems, of which technology is one, increase their ""order"" exponentially. Therefore, it's no coincidence that it took 2 billion years for DNA to evolve, but then only 1 billion years for eukaryotes, then only 500 million years for multicellular organisms, and so on, each milestone occurring in half as much time as it took to achieve the one before it. For reference, see:Canoncial milestones in the SingularityThe foundation for his Law of Accelerating Returns is by far the weakest part of his argument for what the future will be like. He asserts that evolutionary systems inevitably increase their ""order"" exponentially, but never approaches a rigorous definition of the term. This hand-waving approach to his fundamental theory really comes to a head when he talks about the Fermi Paradox, the observation that intelligent life in the universe seems to be uncommon. This flies in the face of Kurzweil's thesis, which is that intelligence inevitably evolves from DNA up through brains through supercomputers, until eventually a civilization is converting all the matter and energy in the universe into one giant computational device at an exponential rate. If such a project is underway on behalf of some other intelligent race, they're being awfully quiet about it. Therefore, a futurist is forced to either 1) apply a universal anthropic principle: we must be the first intelligent (technology-creating) race in the universe; or 2) accept that there's nothing inevitable about the evolution of intelligence or technology. Kurzweil chooses option 1), and while he makes an eloquent case for his choice it's far from airtight. Beetles have been evolving exactly as long as we have -- they're more successful than us by any evolutionary metric -- and yet they possess no intelligence.Kurzweil is at his best when he sticks to the predictions that his objective measures of price-performance of information technologies actually support, and these predictions really are awe-inspiring. We can say with great certainty that the years of the 2020s will in fact give rise to truly earth-moving, paradigm-shattering technologies as a result of cheap, ubiquitous computers. Kurzweil has a lot of specific examples, mostly concerning the augmentation of human intelligence and virtual reality interfaces for the brain, that are best read in the book itself.It's worth noting that Kurzweil doesn't seem to think that peak oil will affect his predictions in the least. James Kunstler's The Long Emergency Surviving the End of Oil, Climate Change, and Other Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty-First Century talks about the diminishing returns of technology, while Kurzweil posits the Law of Accelerating Returns. Clearly, one of these men is a pessimist and one an optimist. The question that concerns all of us is: who is right? I view the singularity and peak oil as a race, with the future of human civilization at stake. Can the exponential increase in technological progress replace our fossil fuel energy before Saudi production peaks? No one knows; Kurzweil is pretty bad at predicting specific applications of technology (he thought we would have glasses that use lasers to paint images onto our retinas by 2009), but his data on the exponential increase in price-performance in information technologies is so predictable as to be considered infallible. There's enough solar energy hitting this planet to replace our fossil fuel use and then some. Kunstler thinks we'll be unable to harness it as a civilization because of the how very little time we have until oil production peaks; but then, he clearly doesn't understand the exponential nature of progress, so his predictions are suspect. Kurzweil, on the other hand, is a self-admitted utopian optimist who sincerely believes that humankind's ascension to the stars is not just likely, but destined, preordained.So to reiterate: should you be investing in canned food or in nanotechnology companies (and virtual pornography firms, of course)? I can't tell you how to live your life, but my personal perspective on this dilemma is as follows: in 20 years we will either be living in the middle of the fantastic future promised by the Singularity; or we'll be back to an agrarian lifestyle and focused mainly on staying alive and killing our neighbors. Since the latter outcome, the total and near-irrevocable destruction of our way of life, is unthinkable, I prefer to believe in the former. In other words, I choose not to invest in canned food, because I can't imagine living in a world where I'll need it.I can't say I recommend this book very strongly, except for those who already have a strong interest in the Singularity. The subject matter is often fascinating and thought-provoking, but the presentation leaves much to be desired. Kurzweil rambles and repeats himself, and multiple times lets his narrative devolve into pages upon pages of bulleted lists. I'm sorry, Mr. Kurzweil, but I could have gotten that on Wikipedia."
274,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3037001-pamela,4,"It's tempting to call this book science fiction since its fundamental idea seems so far-fetched. Much can be said about this book, much has been said. I find it hard to write a review because this book is very big, in length and ideas. Kurzweil is a very smart man who has already made our lives better, he’s an inventor and coder. He developed electronic keyboards, text-to-speech readers, OCR and more. He’s very smart. He’s also written several books about the future, or where humans are headed. The Singularity is Near is nearly a decade old already, but hardly dated. There are a lot of charts that can be updated, but overall the book is still very relevant. I would encourage anyone to read the book. Warning it is not easy, the writing style is dense, sometimes dull. But it’s not quite as long as it appears with about 20% of the book being notes and index. The basic gist of the Singularity is three-fold: GNR. Genetics, Nanotechnology and Robotics, and everything is becoming information. How everything becomes information and the speed at which everything is going to change is due to Moore's Law, which is about exponential growth, and Kurzweil takes it a little further with “Law of Accelerating Returns.” We will have leaps of achievements and ability in genetics and along with nanotechnology, we will repair and renew our bodies, helping to extend our life span. Nanotechnology will end up allowing us to scan and reverse engineer our brain, and ultimately be able to transfer our consciousness (memories and personality) to another substrate, meaning a digital form. Smart A.I. and supercomputers will help us achieve this. After merging with computers, becoming biological and digital, we will have an infinite life-span as our consciousness, our individuality is preserved digitally. The end result is unknown, we as humans, will reach a Singularity where the unknown is unforeseeable because we just can't comprehend what is next. Okay, I probably butchered that summary, skipped a ton but yeah, it’s wild! It's all quite fascinating. Kurzweil thinks we are on the cusp of these revolutions and maybe the baby-boomer generation will see it if they take care of their bodies. People born after 1960 most likely will. Sure there are a lot of reasons to discount this future, and Kurzweil writes a full chapter on responding to critics. (The chapters are quite long!) Since the publication of his book The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence, which has similar ideas, Kurzweil had many critics, and he explains why they are wrong. The first few are the typical: disbelief this is possible, and what about rich/poor gap. He writes that all of this can be overcome, and will. Personally I think Kurzweil discounts a few things a little too readily, such as people or governments putting the brakes on this trend, as well as the rich and poor divide. As he is wealthy it may be hard for him to appreciate the difference between having money and barely surviving. He says that it is irrelevant since in the beginning technology is expensive and doesn't work well, only the rich buy the devices, but as the technology improves it goes through stages until it works great, is ubiquitous and practically free. Perhaps the great lifesaving and body improving technologies will work down to the poor masses but in the short time frame he claims I do have strong doubt. Using his law of accelerating returns, timelines shrink and he claims the time difference will be in a few years instead of decades that we see now. He uses AIDS drugs, cell phones and the internet as examples. Perhaps. All in all, it's a very optimistic outlook on the future of mankind. Take that in contrast to other outlooks, such as Jared Diamond, Thomas Friedman or the countless number of environmentalist's such as Bill McKibben. I have been steeped in those ideas and so this one of Kurzweil's I find quite hopeful. Kurzweil has been spot on with many of his predictions and quite a few of his critics don’t disagree with his conclusions, just the timeline, not never, just a matter of when. Did want to keep this short, but find it impossible. "
275,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/86318-amy,2,"Hooooo, boy. Where do you even start with this thing?Stylistically, it has a lot of flaws. Super repetitive. Sputters out at the end, and then as an appendix he throws in a few equations. The hypothetical dialogues interspersed in the text are sometimes eye-rollingly lame, although, to be fair, they just as often directly responded to questions/criticisms the book had raised in my mind.I'm not sure who his audience is supposed to be. The math and theoretical physics stuff was not always sufficiently explained in that I, a fairly intelligent lay reader who at least has vague recollections of high school math and science, just couldn't follow significant portions of his supposed proof. I think most general readers would have the same problem.I don't have the computer science or math background to evaluate a lot of his assertions, so it is hard to tell how much is plausible, if far-fetched, and how much is pure crazy. I am perfectly willing to believe that at some point, advances in technology will render everyday life difficult to recognize. I am on board with the possibility that ""we will be cyborgs."" My mind started to close when he discussed how in a century or so we will have expanded into the galaxy and started spreading throughout the universe, and perhaps beyond, in search of more information processing capacity. While it is an interesting possibility, I'm unclear on how that process will work.His explanation for how a lot of this will be accomplished boils down to: ""We will be supersmart because our computers, with whom we will be merging, will also be supersmart, so while I don't know how we're going to do this, we'll figure it out."" Well, maybe, but you're going to have to do a little better than that.Also, what a dreary view of the future and our potential expansion into the stars. No learning about new environments, or learning about ourselves, really. Just a bunch of boring cyborgs goofing off in simulated environments and using up the materials of the universe (with apparently no thought given to who or what else might be using those materials) to make our processing units run better. And apparently the best use of this knowledge will be: (i) to live indefinitely, (ii) to be supersmart, and (iii) to hang out in virtual reality. What's the point of (i) and (ii) if all you're going to do with it is (iii)?He sort of tries to address, but doesn't really, how you are really alive if your ""consciousness"" is merged with a mechanical substrate while the physical you is stranded in meatspace. Maybe I am a selfish jerk, but I am more concerned about death because it means I won't be alive anymore, rather than because the world will be deprived of the privilege of interacting with me or an exact replica of my personality.He doesn't address more than in passing the real-world political obstacles to the supposed availability of cheap, unlimited resources he says is coming. Sure, sure, the big fossil fuel companies will totally stand by and not try to block cheap solar power, etc. They will cast aside their profit motives because ... more CPUs? I don't know. Similarly troubling is the author's lack of serious discussion of the fact that greater reliance on computers means less jobs. He seems to say that this is cool, because everything in the future will be really inexpensive, but this ignores his own point that information (software forming the patterns, for example, of all those nifty clothes we will create on 3D printers) will be the real commodity.Finally, he disregards some pretty obvious privacy concerns. People flip out about their Facebook settings, but within a century most people will be uploading/merging/sharing their actual consciousness online? He doesn't discuss any methods of or possible desire to keep any of the self separate from this collective consciousness, but wouldn't that be a huge concern for most people? Putting your drunk pictures on the internet is one thing, sharing your brain with the world quite another.For all of that, I did slog through the whole thing, and I kept talking about what I had read, so it definitely raised some interesting points. And I suspect at least some of the author's claims are on point (it was already pretty spot-on about on-board nav systems in cars). But from my (admittedly technically handicapped) viewpoint, it winds up somewhere off the rails."
276,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19648573-mark-locascio,2,"A lot of the reviews here seem to be saying ""it's complicated, so it must be profound."" This is not true. There is no reason for this book to be 650 pages long. Kurzweil's thesis is pretty straightforward: technology advances at an exponential pace. By that logic, there's reason to believe that nonbiological (i.e., computational) intelligence will eventually become much more advanced than human intelligence. This book is essentially Kurzweil's prediction for how great it'll be.I'm not fond of speculation about science... technology rarely evolves the way you think it will. But a well-crafted opinion would still be an interesting read. Unfortunately, this was not well-crafted. The book is long and rambling. There are wild detours that span dozens of pages. Academic research is misinterpreted and extrapolated well beyond what any real scientist would allow. The end-notes are a pain in the nads. The fixation on lactation and virtualized, gender-swapped sex adds nothing but confusion.The book isn't getting a poor review from me because I couldn't understand it. I did graduate research in both nanomechanics and robotics, two of the areas Kurzweil writes about for too many pages. I know enough to know that he's really stretching here. This book seemed like he'd had a lot of conversations with a lot of smart people, and wanted to publish as much of it as he could to appear knowledgeable himself. In the end, it just seemed like he didn't know which book he wanted to write, and wasn't qualified to write any of them.There was some good discussion of the ethics of artificial intelligence, I'll give him that. And for what it's worth, his predictions likely won't be completely wrong. But this book could have benefited quite a bit from a strong editorial influence or some peer-review. Skip it. Go browse his web site and save yourself about 600 pages."
277,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2683760-gary,4,"Rarely I read a book that truly blows my mind. This is one. Noted futurist Kurzweil lays out a radically different view of the future enabled by exponential development of artificial intelligence. A couple of the key milestones on the way to the future he envisions:-By 2029, computers will have advanced so far as to be able to pass a Turing test, which essentially means that they will be able to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of biological humans.-And by 2045, the ""singularity"", meaning merging of biological and non-biological humanity will be a reality.So the singularity is near, but not so near that is going to happen, say, next year. If Kurzweil is even half right, we are in for some incredible advances in genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics, his ""big three"" technological revolutions that will pave the way for the human-machine melding he sees coming.I can't say that I agree with everything presented here, but neither can I refute the powerful argument he makes for the path that our civilization appears to be on: after what will be only several hundred years of having machines in our lives, we basically will have developed them to the point where they are as smart as us, and very soon after that, nearly indescribably smarter than us. Take a listen/read, this is powerful stuff with all sorts of moral implications. It will make you think very hard about what may be to come in the future.**The narrator sounds a bit like one of the old Speak & Spell toys from the 1980s, which is kind of funny given the text-to-speech technology development that Kurzweil has been involved in."
278,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59510129-chris,3,"Kurzweil makes remarkably far-sighted predictions about humanity will change during our lifetimes. The very far-sighted analysis on physical limitation of computation is quite interesting, as are the predictions about the pre-singularity advances in genetics, nanotechnology and robotics. However, Kurzweil quickly dismisses two glaring issues with surprising immaturity. One, he claims that since technologies like self-replicating nanobots will become cheaper at an exponential rate, they will be ubiquitous among the poor seven years later than the rich, so access to resources will be democratized. This opposes all historical precedent and should not be dismissed without much stronger evidence. Two, he claims that Strong AI is not an existential threat because we can also develop a Strong AI immune system to defend against bad actors, and our immune systems work pretty well. He invokes his argument at least three times but fails to state the obvious that people’s immune systems fail sometimes, but we only get one universe. If a Strong AI immune system fails in a vastly interconnected system, it’s not just one person who dies, it’s everybody. Finally, I was disappointed by Kurzweil’s lack of discussion of the societal implications of inevitable rapid technological “progress.” For something that will affect the whole world, he focuses an awful lot on what it will mean for an individual - implicitly, one who can afford it."
279,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/136271-maria,2,"Predicting the future is always hard and Kurzweil whole hypothesis is that there is a point in the future when our technology will shift so dramatically that we can't imagine what it will be like. He then proceeds to explain just what it will be like. Why I started this book: Another audio from my professional reading list.Why I finished it: Good thing it was an audio, I kept a steady pace and wasn't drowned in the ridiculousness. Buddy Read: Where's My Jetpack?: A Guide to the Amazing Science Fiction Future That Never Arrived. The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology might have been more helpful/wonderful a decade ago... but I'm struggling now. That's the problem with predictions about future technology. You might guess that we'd have hand-held computers but who would guess that we would use them to watch cats, other videos and argue with strangers in thread wars?"
280,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47739629-stefanos,3,"Kurzweil has strong points justifying his (calculated) predictions about us primates rapidly transcending to a (much) higher and more capable species through the help of technology. Or is it computers reaching human consciousness and far surpassing human capabilities in the immediate future? Actually he makes both claims and the fact that those massive changes are happening exponentially (Ray Kurzweil's Law of Accelerating Returns) in the next 20-30 years, is downright crazy to think of.You know what they say, ""extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"" and Kurzweil provides a fair amount of these and to his defense, in the 15 years that have passed since the publication of this book, several of these predictions (that I know of) have already been materialized. There is much to digest in this book and while the ideas are fascinating, the book itself is a hard read, with some repeated content (for clarity?) and tries to analyze in depth several subjects thus losing the reader's focus from time to time. Still, a classic if you want to dive into the ""Singularity is near"" trend."
281,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19797346-camillejkt,3,"Interesting book that describes a lot of possible future developments of technology, and their possible uses and implications on our lives and society.I just wish Kurzweil had mastered the art of ""conditional speaking""... it gets tiring to go through an entire book of predictions with no single shred of doubt expressed at any point..Whether or not we choose to believe that technology *can* develop that fast (and I think Kurzweil does makes a compelling point that it can and will), I don't think anyone can predict in which direction it will go! Some people have said this book is the Bible of the Singularitianism as new religion.. and that felt true in the way it was mostly throwing affirmations into my face and asking me to just believe them (while implying that if I didn't, it was my own fault from not being enlightened enough)In summary : Glad i read it, gave me a lot to think about... Even happier to be done with it, painful from a literary standpoint :("
282,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15643804-gustav-ton-r,4,"Fascinating and, I believe, accurate description of the future of humankind IF, and this is a very important if, mistakes in genetics, nanotechnology or robotics (AIs) doesn't kill us first. Among those three I fear an experiment with self-replicating nanobots gone wrong is the most likely to wipe us out. I also think that the time scale may be a bit off but that might just be me not being able to think in terms of exponential growth even though Kurzweil tries to teach me over and over again. It's inevitable that we will (continue to) improve ourselves through genetics, augment us with nanotechnology and invent artificial life and live as mainly information (or ""patterns""). Combinations of these will basically make us immortal and, in my opinion, still human but with way better control of our evolution. The singularity is coming. I just hope I won't miss it."
283,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14012525-martti,4,"You know, this is absolutely a great book to re-read once in a while (maybe decreasing the interval by log(n), til you get to the Singularity), but on the other hand don't take it too seriously. Even if it all will come to pass. Talking about future with today's terms seems frightful and terrifying, but I'd suggest to cross the bridge when we come to it. It's ok to speculate as a thought experiment, because it's also cool and exciting, but don't get an heart attack about something that doesn't make any sense with the current information.But that said, I cannot wait to get cheap quality replacement/upgrade parts to by biological organs. And a full backup of myself would also be much appreciated. Although Ray here might be a bit too optimistic with his time-line, but we'll get there!"
284,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23183558-dina,5,"First of all, I will put this book on the shelf to re-read. The information is quite heavy and technical to digest from the first time (especially if you are a non-scientist). Second, Ray is of course brilliant, but there is just too much. It's like he is trying to write about everything, at the same time. Third, the future is scary. In the future, human will be part human part machine. Ray is trying to be optimistic about the convergence of both, but somehow shows only the positive sides of it. For example, even now we have medical technology that can do miracles but unless you have good insurance, you won't have access to it. So what are the guarantees that future advances in technology will be accessible to all, not just the richest 1 percent. Overall, most of the book is wishful thinking - or living in ones head."
285,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20051503-kunal-sen,4,"I could agree with most of what he is saying in this well thought out book, except for the time scale. I don't think he is off by much, but his optimistic predictions do not realistically account for political, economic and other social factors that can slow many of this down. When we landed on the moon, just ten years after the first man in space, everyone assumed much faster growth of space-faring technologies, but out political will was just not there, and 2001 Space Odyssey still remains a science fiction. However, I too strongly believe that a technological evolution of humankind is not too far off. The next hundred years is going to be the most exciting period for our species."
286,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4249244-michiel,4,"Ray Kurzweil is prozac for scientists. While other scientific linked to the society, Ray paints a very bright future for us where GNR (genetics, nanotechnology and robotics) will solve solve all the world problems: medical, environmental, sociological...If I read Kurzweil, I remember why it is fun to be an engineer, combining sciences from all different domains to create new technology to reshape mankind. I do not agree with all what he has to say (technology is not available to all and will likely create as many problems as it solves, do we really want to become demi-gods, immortal and living only for intellectual pleasures?), but it sure is an interesting read."
287,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14711634-peter-laurent,3,"The ideas presented in this book are fascinating, despite now being over 10 years old. In some ways that helps the author's case since many of his predictions have already, or about to, become a reality. It is well researched and chock full of ideas and an inherent optimism about the future, which is refreshing after reading so many bleak sci-fi novels (like mine).The writing is somewhat dry however, and very little commentary or opinion is presented, instead piling on facts, research, maths, and graphs. Also, the graphs are very difficult to read on a Kindle, it could have been formatted better."
288,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1555114-kazuo,2,"At the time I bought this book (right as I was getting into transhumanism), I didn't realize just how much it extrapolates from over-simplified graphs and shallow views of technology trends. Kurzweil is an inventor, not a scientist, and it shows in this book of his - he even harps on about how technology is ""an extension of biological evolution."" If you're looking for a well-grounded introduction to how weird, wonderful and dangerous this century will be, my list of recommendations would place The Singularity Is Near close to the bottom of the list."
289,0143037889,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10280795-julia,3,"If I wanted to write a sci-fi novel, I'd start here. Lots of interesting predictions backed by data and research. He goes off the deep end in the middle but ends on a strong note.I still think he is overly optimistic about the reliability of complex software though, as well as his timeline for general AI. Finally, sometimes I think that our exponential progress might be slowed down a bit since some of this generations brightest minds work on social media apps and click bait instead of figuring out how to get to Mars. But I have hope that things will get better soon."

I also found Ray Kurzweil's narrative and view of the future to be rather endearing, focusing on these exponential leaps and how humanity will transcend the bounds of biology and I am just READY for the transhumanist technocult. Also of note, I have some of the OCR software that he had created so I appreciate Ray Kurzweil for his contributions towards accessibility. "

When this happens, the rate of technological change will approach the infinite. We will already have non-biological bodies by then, and will have the choice of how long to live (or not). What ""Accelerando"" fictionalized, this gives factual data for the likelihood of all of it. Amazing! Astounding!"

Kurzweil has great credentials to make the types of prognostications that fill this book with well-documented facts and me with hope. One of the primary tenets is that technology is progressing exponentially. Inevitably, the examples presented to support that thesis are dated. BUT!

Kurzweil paints a picture of the future that goes well beyond that of even the best science fiction writers.

Also, the way the book is structured is awfully boring. Most of what he says seems to be repetitive (that may be because I have already read a truckload of articles on the AI revolution, consequently making the longwinded explanations in this book seem unnecessary to me).I‘d rather learn more about this idea from scientific papers, articles and videos than through this book."

A great book to boost the understanding of the most important technological advancements, even though future predictions were too optimistic.Book could have been structured better, or proof-read few more times.

The ideas got stuck to the reasons of post-AI intelligence to get more intelligent, and there seemed to be no idea of why? Oh well, if you have to read this book, do it anyway, is not that bad, but other ways, you won't have missed that much."
