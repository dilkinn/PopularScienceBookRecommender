0,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444658-charlie,1,I did not enjoy this book. The main premise was that cooking makes food easier to consume as well as easier to digest. This advancement allowed humans to consume more energy to support a bigger brain.Now you do not have to read this book.
1,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/373579-summer-bock-holistic-nutrition-herbs,4,"From the first page I liked the writing style. I found it easy to follow and understand, although a good knowledge of either nutrition or anthropology will make it a faster and more comprehensible read. According to Wrangham, there are no raw food cultures ever recorded in human history. Yes, people eat foods raw but no culture has ever done this exclusively. Using this and other points, he provides an interesting critique to the raw movement. Throughout the book Wrangham impressed me with the quality of the studies he selected to back up his theorizing. His theories were well supported and well argued. He first shows that the evolution of humans was directly linked first to the use of fire and second to using fire to cook food. Perhaps because he is a primatologist, he draws frequent parallels between humans and animals throughout the book. He uses the comparisons as a way to understanding how we as humans ended up in the unique position of being the only animal that cooks and how this has affected and changed us. In particular, he argues that the process of cooking created a fascinating shift in our anatomy that led to bigger brains and smaller digestive systems. Wrangham also offers an interesting critique of our current method of caloric analysis of foods. In his writing he discusses the actual differences in nutritional values in cooked versus raw food. He also takes into account the amount of work our bodies have to do in order to digest various macromolecules such as protein, fat, and carbohydrates. Fat is the easiest to digest. Protein takes more work to digest if eaten with high fiber foods. Softer food makes you gain weight easier. Harder food takes more work and you will not gain weight as easily. He cites an interesting study in which rats were given the same amount of calories per day. One group of rats had their food pellets ‘puffed’ to soften them, while the other group just ate regular pellets. At the end of the study, the rats that ate the softer pellets weighed more than the rats that ate the harder pellets. The rats that ate hard pellets literally had to burn more calories in order to digest the harder food. Because the puffed pellets were softer, the nutrition and energy from them was incorporated and digested with ease.He had a few random judgments that stood out to me as unnecessary and unprofessional. His comment “Life can be unfair” in regards to how two people can eat the same amount of calories and if your digestive tract works harder (as is the case with most lean people) then you will gain less weight. And vice versa. This flippant and unpleasant side note should have been left out. He also made the statement that you rarely find amenorrhea in women who eat primarily cooked food. Amenorrhea is a pathology where a women stops having her period, which is linked to osteoporosis. He says that it is common among women on a predominantly raw-food diet. I believe these statements to be completely unfounded. I have worked with a number of women with amenorrhea and they are not raw-foodists. I have a hard time believing I have found the very rare ones. From everything I have read, it is not a rare condition in women. All in all, I really thought this was a great read. It got me thinking and his anthropological prospective was a welcome shift from the nutrition centric books I’m usually pouring over. I enjoyed the historical and evolutionary approach to understanding our relationship to food. I also enjoyed learning about the evolution of human anatomy in direct correlation with the foods we eat.I’d like to take a moment to expound upon my own theories on the subject of cooking and raw food inspired by the topics of this book. Keep reading if you are interested in hearing how some of my thoughts shifted from Wrangham’s work....I think all health counselors should read this book to gain a more well-rounded perspective on the history of cooked food and how cooking effects the nutritional value of food. I appreciate the shift in my viewpoint. It filled in a lot of blanks for me with regard to the raw food movement. I love eating raw, but have never quite gotten into it as a full-time dietary change other than a few month-long cleanses. Currently, I eat at least 75% of my food raw and this is fabulous for me. And I also notice that I enjoy the option of eating warm foods regularly. I like how grounded I feel after soup or grains. What if the raw food movement is another dietary fad that is the answer to the high consumption of refined, chemicalized, pesticide-ridden, homogenized, and heavily processed foods. The Standard American Diet laden with meat and animal products left the United States feeling clogged and sluggish. Our country is host to millions of people who have a lot of gunk to cleanse from their intestines and the raw food diet offers this in a great way that doesn’t require you totally fast from food. You are cleansing and eating at the same time, which allows you to cleanse while working or doing your other day to day tasks. I think it is important to eat raw foods, but I also think it is important to stay balanced and build digestive fire. Sometimes a continual diet of raw foods can dampen digestive fire. If you already experience compromised digestive function eating 100% raw foods may be very difficult because it can further impair digestion. When I read raw food books, I seldom see this important issue being addressed. I also get concerned for my clients who experience alienation from their families from eating a healing diet while overcoming health concerns. People connect and come together around food. This builds community and defines culture. For this reason it is important to find common ground within your family and eat food together. This strengthens family and community and creates a place to connect. This has been happening for thousands upon thousands of years. The nurturing of family and community is very important in holistic health. It strengthens our relationships, which are one of the main facets of primary food. "
2,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4705597-maria,3,"I learned so many random facts in the first chapter, including the little-touted fact that raw foodism is unhealthy— eating completely raw doesn't provide the amount of energy necessary, despite the fact that calorie intake is sufficient. Basically, the amount of energy required to digest the fruits and vegetables isn't enough to keep someone alive for a long period of time. This was very good to know, as I'd been thinking of going raw when we got back home (merely to see what it was like). Now, of course, knowing what I do, I'll be staying well away from that— I'm thin enough as it is.In case you don't have time to read the whole book:- Cooking gelatinizes starch, denatures proteins, melts fat, and makes meat easier to chew, all contributing to the extraordinarily short amount of time humans spend chewing and digesting.- This shorter digestion time shortened the gut, allowing more energy to be directed to brain size and growth.- Cooking wouldn't have evolved to the extent it has now if men and women hadn't formed a partnership. Women provide the staples in most cultures, as well as the cooking, while men spend hours away hunting. They come home to a cooked meal, sometimes bringing meat and/or honey. The trade-off for women is that men who aren't their close kin or husbands don't dare steal their food.A few more interesting notes:- A wife is more important for her hearth-side care than sex favors in hunter-gatherer societies. A woman could give out sexual favors to practically anyone… but feeding anyone other than her husband? Absolutely not.- Inuits, who send their men out to hunt for all food, still need women. To cook and make clothes, without which men wouldn't be able to hunt.- The advent of cooking also brought about the sexual inequality that is pervasive in most not-completely-modern cultures nowadays. - People in rich Western cultures now have to find a way to make eating their cooked food healthier.So, in sum, it's a fascinating book which explained to me what damper is (ground grass seed flour made into bread), different cultures, different methods of food preparation, all of which are very helpful for writing. It definitely offers a different way of looking at evolution… and like most theories… it makes sense."
3,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,3,"I'm feeling especially lazy at the moment and not wanting to think enough to write even my standard lazy review, so I'll just say that I thought parts of this were very interesting, and other parts of it were stretching a bit to make things fit the theory. It was well-read though, and I would recommend it, so that's a plus."
4,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/845609-kate,3,"How did australopithecines develop into Homo erectus? The traditional answer has been that the use of tools allowed them to hunt, and that the increased protein in the diet allowed the developmental spurt toward a bigger brain. But there are two, not one, major jumps in development along this road toward Homo sapiens. Richard Wrangham argues that the first, as has been established, resulted from hunting and eating more meat (and not just consuming scavenged meat), but that the second came from cooking food, which implies controlling fire. I almost put the book down after the first chapter, “The Quest for Raw Foodists.” The author denigrates vegetarians and raw foodists in such a way that I wondered whether he had had a relationship with a salad lover that had gone south, which might account for his contemptuous tone. That aside, he uses anecdotal and indirect evidence to suggest that cooked food allowed homo erectus to evolve, and that the species can not longer thrive on a raw food diet for any extended length of time.Fascinating was the report of the Evo Diet, an experiment conducted in 2006 in the UK with patients suffering from life-threateningly high blood pressure. They submitted to a raw food diet for 2 weeks, consisting of 50 kinds of raw fruits, veg and nuts in huge quantities (except for one man, who snuck chocolate in week 2). The all brought their blood pressure down to less dangerous levels, but the diet had an unintended side effect: they all lost weight, about a pound each day. The rest of the book argues that cooked food releases more energy (calories) than the same food would release if it were raw. This is true for both meat and plant-based foods. And the implications of this fact/argument are surprising.1. Cooking softens food, and soft food is more easily digested and requires less energy to utilize than hard food. Among rats that were given hard pellets and the same pellets “puffed” like children’s cereal, the soft-food rats became obese in a matter of months, even through they were consuming the same number of calories as the hard pellet rats.2. Soft food allowed homo erectus to develop smaller digestive organs. Because of the “conservation of total bodily organ mass,” this allowed h.e. to develop much larger brains. 3. In all hunter-gatherer societies, women gather and men hunt. Cooking food further differentiated the gendered division of labor, so that women also became the keepers of the fire and the cooks. This also made women vulnerable, since smoke from a cooking fire can be seen from a mile away. Women received protection and occasional meat from men, and men received a cooked meal from women, and voila, marriage was born. My question though: if men are off hunting, how can they be protecting the hearth at the same time?4. This model challenges the convention, as anthropologists usually see marriage as “an exchange in which women get resources and men get a guarantee of paternity.” In this model, however, men marry so that they are guaranteed a hot meal. I’m not a specialist in this field and would have to do much more reading to evaluate this properly, but I wonder just how many of the ideas presented in this book are Richard Wrangham’s. Ailello and Wheeler had (by Wrangham’s own description) attributted the increase in brain size to the invention of cooking. Furthermore, we’ve known for a long time that large-grain whole wheat bread is less fattening than highly milled white bread (because the whole grain bread costs us more energy to digest, and we eliminate many indigestible particles), and that cooked carrots have a much higher glycemic index than raw carrots (which is why some people choose a raw food diet to lost weight). Richard Wrangham’s greatest contribution might be telling these facts in a series of anecdotes. You’ll have to read about the snake experiments yourself, but I’ll tell you about the Inuit diet. It won’t be too much of a spoiler. The sub-arctic Puiplirmiuts eat frozen caribou dropping like berries (thus raw), whereas most other neighboring tribes find this a waste of good food and take the partially digested lichen pellets (=euphemism) and boil them in blood soup. Maybe the most valuable contribution of this book is that it explains why there are no Inuit restaurants in London. "
5,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11881042-amy-raby,5,"This is a fascinating book! Just so you know, it is NOT the Hunger Games sequel! This is an anthropology/evolutionary biology book that posits the theory that what made us human--that is, what allowed us to develop bigger brains and many of the unique aspects of human culture--was not hunting, but the use of fire to cook our food. And that the acquisition of fire happened much earlier than is generally assumed, at the time of homo erectus, not homo sapiens.There is a really interesting discussion in this book about raw foods and whether humans can survive on them (answer: under normal conditions, no). Every other animal can thrive on raw food, but when humans are restricted to a raw food diet, we lose weight. This also means that our estimates for counting calories are wrong because an apple is considered to be about 120 calories whether cooked or raw, but our digestive system extracts more calories from cooked food than from raw food. We also extract more calories from foods that are highly processed (e.g., ground up). But I've never seen any calorie counter that accounted for these differences.The second half of the book goes into some of the ways that cooking shaped human society in ways that benefited men more than women. In short, the roots of pair bonding and of patriarchy, particularly male exploitation of female labor, go back earlier than homo sapiens, all the way back to homo erectus. This is a rather disturbing chapter of the book. But it explains a great deal."
6,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3557079-donna,2,"Any time you see the phrase ""How _____ made us human"" you know you're going to see a whole lot of over-selling of an idea. Bipedality, language, cooperation, tool use, cooking of food, and many other factors went in to making us the species we are today.How the cooking of food shaped our evolution is an interesting topic but I did not find this a particularly interesting book. Wrangham starts out by spending an inordinate amount of time bashing people who eat raw food diets. It went way beyond presenting evidence that eating an exclusively raw diet is not healthy for humans into bringing up ridiculous crackpot ideas that individuals have had about the benefits of raw food. Every idea he discusses is beat to death as he tries to stretch out his thesis into book length. He barely manages that as the book contains just over 200 pages of text with another 100 as notes. This could have been an excellent long article in a magazine but as a book, it's a fail. The most interesting part for me came at the very end as he discusses flaws in the way we calculate nutritional content information. Sadly, it was too little, too late."
7,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"I know I’ve been reading and reviewing a lot of non-fiction lately, but this is probably one of the more entertaining and accessible of the bunch in style. It’s a convincing idea: what caused humans to be able to evolve such big brains and short digestive tracts, compared to other species? The answer, according to Wrangham: first the ability to hunt and eat raw meat, then control of fire for cooking meat.It’s a very readable book, making all the science and history easy to follow. For me, it was an enjoyable read, though not exactly revolutionary; I was aware of most of the ideas already, since I’m fascinated by human evolution. It pulls together various different threads of the story, bringing together evidence from different ways of understanding human evolution.(Oh, but if you don’t believe in evolution, this… will not be the book for you. That’s definitely an assumption of the book.)Originally reviewed for breathesbooks.com."
8,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1467343-dave-riley,5,"Great review of the possibilities of our origins with a persuasive argument about cooking being a driving force for human evolution. Cross species comparisons make a lot of sense as Wrangham develops his argument.Essential read, especially when he addresses gender issues. He sidesteps the challenge of the origins of language but nonetheless locates humans in the context of changing and challenging environments. "
9,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david,4,"Wrangham's thesis is that fire is what made modern humans. We didn't just learn to use fire because we were so smart: using fire actually gave us an evolutionary advantage which led to our being smart. In a nutshell: cooked food is more nutritious and easier to eat, thus allowing our evolutionary ancestors to acquire more calories for less effort, increasing their survival and also freeing up more time for things like inventing the wheel.At first this may seem counter-intuitive, but Wrangham makes a convincing case, talking about the speed of evolution and how it's plausible that humans could indeed have evolved as a result of our control of fire, which Wrangham dates back to (possibly) up to a quarter of a million years ago. He talks about the physiology of chewing and digestion, how our australopithicene ancestors differed from us in how they ate, and crucial differences between human diets and monkey diets. Lots of talk about how the body handles cooked meat and vegetables differently than raw meat and vegetables. All of this is fascinating and convincing.I think the second part of the book is weaker, as Wrangham goes into evolutionary psychology, which as usual involves a lot of speculation but without much evidence. Many of the later chapters felt a bit padded, like he had an obligation to bring in a social and cultural dimension to the argument. This I found less convincing -- we get a lot of talk about how cooking and food preparation shakes out in ""primitive"" societies, but this is all dealing with homo sapiens in our modern state. It's somewhat interesting but I don't think it really contributes much to his central thesis, which is supported strongly enough by the physical evidence.Overall, a good food science and physical anthropology book.Recommended for: Fans of evolution, monkeys, and cooked food.Not recommended for: Creationists, vegans, or raw foodists."
10,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34702091-jane-louis-wood,4,"This author makes a convincing case for consumption of cooked food and nocturnal fires being the spur to humans developing the physiological characteristics that made them properly human: slow to mature, large of brain and free of fur (n.b. hipsters are not properly human). Wrangham refutes other hypotheses effectively and goes into riveting detail about the consequences of cooking on the evolution of the human body.His theories about how food affected social behaviour, however, are largely supposition and much less convincing. He paints a lovely picture of humans sitting around the camp fire learning to make social chitchat and not annoy one another, skills that weren't needed when they were busy gnawing uncooked roots and grinding their teeth to dust chewing raw bison straight off the carcass. he suggests that older early women cooked up extra food for sisters who were busy nursing. I'm not convinced, given that for most of recorded human society the ones doing the cooking have always been subordinate to the ones doing moist of the eating. The notes are very detailed and comprise almost a quarter of the book which made the end feel oddly abrupt. "
11,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5861984-judyta-szaci-o,4,"""Cathing fire"" is an interesting book. It presents some ideas that are original and thought-provoking about the phenomena that made us human. Some of them are perhaps too far-stretched and the author is too busy focusing on his main subject - processing the food - to notice the conglomerate of many other influences, not rooted in the food (pre)history. In short, the book offers interesting contents, but it is too biased.It is also too repetitive - the same arguments appear dozens of times on its pages. There was a point when I felt almost bored and wanted to put the book aside - but then interesting things appeared, and hardly it became entertaining again, when it ended unexpectedly (I was reading it on Kindle, so that I didin't notice at the beginning that at 60% the book is finished and the rest is just endnotes - which, by the way, do not provide any particular additional entertainment or in-depth knowledge).Overall - not a bad read, quite interesting, but definitely doesn't meet expectations."
12,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10821965-ubiquitousbastard,4,"This basically offered everything I wanted out of it. The book explored how fire affected human development, but went beyond humans, stating it likely that Erectus and maybe even Habilis began our love affair with cooked food. Wrangham didn't just conjecture, but used similar species as well as primitive societies still in existence in order to demonstrate natural inclinations. Sure, it went sort of gender history toward the end, but Wrangham's reasoning did seem rather believable, if slightly off topic in the way that we are human. I don't necessarily think that gender roles are key to what makes us human, but that's just my own view."
13,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8451753-muhammad-nusair,4,Brilliant!
14,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38769686-kevin-keating,4,This was a very interesting book about the harnessing of fire and our becoming human and surviving as a species because of it. Cooked food vs raw food has had a tremendous impact and this book covers very many of the results without being boring. 
15,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1289391-michael,3,"Wrangham presents and defends well the hypothesis that cooking had major evolutionary consequences for the development of anatomically modern humans, including diminishment in size of mandibles, dentition, and intestines. He presents good arguments for the early control of fire and for its use in cooking by at least one group of habilines who then evolved into Homo erectus. His arguments for the evolutionary advantages provided by cooked food (less time spent in chewing, more calories available per unit of food consumed, less energy expended in digestion, more energy available to power larger brains, etc.) are convincing. When he moves into the social development of early humans and the effects of cooking thereon, however, he tends to attribute too much to cooking alone. While the hearth did provide a focus for the ""household,"" there were many factors involved in the creation of the nuclear family and in determining gender roles. There does seem to be a tendency on the part of some scholars to attribute more to single important factors they have identified than the evidence will support. This is a particular danger in explaining social developments, which often result from complex contributing factors for which physical evidence is either lacking or ambiguous. Although the author issues the customary caveats about contemproary hunter/gatherer societies being ""modern"" rather than ""primitive,"" he puts a lot of weight on reasoning backward from observations of the current practices of such groups to the hypothetical social behaviors of early humans. A monograph on his principal hypothesis might have been less sexy than this book, but it would have been more focussed and less speculative. The book has detailed notes and a good bibliography. "
16,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6041498-leanne,4,"Before reading this book, I was leery of the raw food movement, but now I know why. Wrangham exposes the pseudoscientific justifications for the movement, some of which are unbelievably ridiculous (such as that the cessation of a woman's menstrual period is a good thing because it means that the raw foodist no longer has any toxins to clear out of the body). Apparently, a strict raw-food diet would not give a person enough energy to meet his/ her needs. I don't have to feel any guilt for my mostly-cooked vegan diet!Wrangham explains why all human cultures have relegated cooking to the female sex without justifying it. He seems to be saying that although many features of human society are inherited from our distant human and prehuman past, we should not feel bound to perpetuate harmful practices, such as the patriarchal assignment of gender roles or the eating of too much cooked, highly processed foods. We need to cook most foods in order to make the nutrients available to us to fuel our large human brains, but we should incorporate some raw foods into our diet. We should avoid a lot of refined, fibre-poor foods (which our evolutionary history has caused us to crave), since we tend to grow fat on a diet in which glucose is too readily available to us."
17,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1432709-julie,4,"OK, forget the raw food movement. This book presents an interesting theory that a breakthrough moment in human evolution was when man began cooking his food. Cooking the food allowed more calories to be absorbed, changing the shape of primates from having large digestive tracts to large brains. Although the book is very technical, it is presented in a way such that people without a background in biology or anthropology can easily understand. I especially enjoyed the chapters on how social roles developed - males hunting and females cooking. Very informative!"
18,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/781336-matthew,5,"The best popular science books I read are the ones that I'm constantly reminded of while just living my ordinary life, which in a way helps make the point of the author that cooking is a fundamental part of human life and has been for a long time."

20,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7895515-felipe,4,"This book offers a compelling case for the idea that cooking is the main reason why we evolved from australopithecines to Homo erectus and then to Homo sapiens. It challenges at several points the mainstream notion that meat-eating was a keystone of (at least some parts of) this evolution, for having comparatively limited explanatory power. Besides the anatomical changes it uses cooking to explain some things I wouldn't have expected, such as marriage and the sexual division of labor.I thought the point was generally well-argued and at the same time the book provided enough interesting bits to keep a wide audience interested. There are plenty of anecdotes (favorite example: the author adds tough leaves to a raw goat meat meal to test that they make chewing easier), and many references to actual studies in the endnotes for the true nerds.It has a problem that might be unavoidable in this kind of pop-sci book: there's always a lot of uncertainty in modern science (especially in something with as little archeological evidence as fire), but, because the author wants to make their case as persuasive as possible, diverging points tend to be omitted or minimized. As a result, it's sometimes hard to know what's well established and what's controversial. For example, a core point in the book (why is the human brain so unusually large?) relies on the expensive tissue hypothesis. The author does note that it's a hypothesis, but there's no exploration of why it's still one, or how accepted it is in the field."
21,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9908727-laura,3,Some interesting data. My recommendation is to skip over the endlessly detailed chewing section and read the parts that are more idea -related. I take some issue with the conflicting notions that women were nearly valueless but yet critical for survival. Maybe...maybe not. I was amused by an invitation to think about kissing a chimp with it's superior lip skills. And by the idea that Freud thought pissing into stone age fires was a big deal for early man. But mostly this is pretty dry work. Useful if you're examining dietary choices. Worth a read.

26,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/767898-emily,4,"Dr. Wrangham is a British Primatologist over at Harvard and his book, “Catching Fire,” is an interesting science book full of nothing but science. He starts with a basic supposition that something happened on the evolutionary boundary between the habilines, largely shown as Homo Habilis and our buddy Home Erectus. By examining the skull structure, chest cavity, molar structure, and the analysis of diet, nutrition and food science, his theory states that humanity made two major jumps:1. Australopithecine -> Homo Habilis by the introduction of scavenged meat into the diet, well pounded with early tools to make it palatable and digestible.2. Homo Habilis -> Homo Erectus by placing the vegetables and meat in the fire cook the food.He marries primatology with food science to show how cooked meat and vegetables greatly reduces the time to chew and digest food while keeping the exact same caloric and nutritional content of food. Experiments show feeding cooked and easy to chew food to animals, especially primates, results in very fat primates who always prefer cooked food to raw. Raw food consumes an enormous time to chew and requires large molars, which Homo Sapiens no longer has, but cooked food needs a smaller digestive system and smaller molars. It also frees Homo Sapiens from the task of chewing all day to doing other things — a rate of spending 60% of the day chewing down to less than 10%. Energy also is conserved in physiology — all animals across all species and genus with access to easily digested food have reduced gut size and put all that energy into increased brain cavity.Fire provides a whole host of other evolutionary advantages — more hours in the day available to be active, a source of protection at night, a source of warmth, a place for culture to grow and breed, and a clear division of labor between the sexes — hunting and cooking. Dr. Wrangham pulls dozens of examples from many different hunter-gatherer cultures worldwide, from Inuit to Australian aborigines to the !Kung of Africa to South Pacific Islanders, and finds commonalities that involve cooking, meat/vegetable balance, and division of labor and economic trade-offs. All revolves around fire and food.As for keeping a fire going, experiments show that chimpanzees can keep a fire going indefinitely. If a fire, captured, was brought in to a cave or another protected place and was properly venerated as the God it is, certainly a fire could be kept going. Homo Habilis was a tool-maker and tool-user — if Homo Habilis realized using the gold (pyrite-filled) stones to smash instead of the grey or brown ones, fire would start, and it had enough presence to repeat the process, fire could be made and kept going. It’s reasonable to believe mankind made fire and kept fire far before measured time.The arguments make sense and they are well sourced with tons of footnotes, a vast bibliography, and references pulled from other sources. The argument is also persuasive — we can find fire pits up to 800,000 years old and after that there is no trace but that means very little. If one little group became Homo Erectus and survived, we would never find evidence of that one small tribe who lived on. Too many evolutionary advantages match with the archeological evidence. Something happened at that boundary between Homo Habilis and Homo Erectus, something that allowed the gut to shrink and the brain to expand and Homo Erectus to spread all over the world. Keeping fire and cooking food makes sense and the arguments are reasonable.It’s a fairly short, quick read as these sorts of books go at 320 pages. Highly recommended to anyone interested in human evolution and/or food science."
27,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8089601-jodi,4,"The author makes an extremely convincing and logical argument for his theory that cooking food (as well as meat eating) helped make us who we are.Eating raw vegetables makes me feel terrible and has a huge metabolic cost. They just sit in my stomach like a rock - while properly cooked meat and vegetables are digested well. Nuts and seeds are better digested when soaked and then dried as well. I am tired of reading that raw vegetables contain all the enzymes we need to digest them easily, and that raw vegetables are far easier on the digestion than cooked ones. My own experience and that of many people I know, and books on the SCD diet, the GAPS diet and also books on nutrition such as 'Eat Fat, Lose Fat' and books by Dr Sherry Rogers and others just don't bear this out at all.Cooked vegetables are what you very often need, especially if you are very weak and ill and have digestive and/or metabolic issues. Cooked food is also much nicer to eat, easier to eat and tastes better. Don't believe the raw food hype! Especially don't believe the vegan or almost vegan raw food hype!Persevering with such an unnatural eating plan despite feeling awful on it just because you've been convinced (wrongly) that it is the healthiest possible way to eat for all of us, is not a good idea.Having said that, foods very high in enzymes (far more so than raw vegetables) such as sauerkraut and apple cider vinegar are very effective digestive aids, as are properly made enzyme supplements - which do survive the acid stomach environment. Fresh vegetables juices also digest very easily. So while raw vegetables may be low in enzymes as the author states, I disagree with the author that the right sort of enzymes can't make a big difference to digestion and that all enzymes are destroyed by the acid stomach.Just to be picky... I also disagree that some peoples have been very healthy eating 100% plant based diets and some on 100% meat based diets as the author states in the conclusion. (For more information on the lack of any truly vegan peoples, and the importance of animal products such as eggs to health and so on, see the Weston A. Price Foundation website.) The idea that we can be healthy on any type of macro-nutrient ratio we happen to prefer is just not correct. (See 'Good Calories, Bad Calories' and other books on fats and oils and the problems with very high carbohydrate diets and why high calorie intakes alone are not the cause of obesity as the author suggests.)I also disagree that animals can all do well on cooked food diets. (What about the research on calves being fed pasteurised and homogenised milk, and dying from it, or the Pottenger's cat experiments which showed that cats need raw foods?) Confusingly the author says animal don't and DO do well on cooked food diets.The book was very easy to read and quite brief, which I appreciated. I would much prefer a solid but short book than a longer one with huge amounts of padding.This book makes a very good case for eating real food and cooking your meats, eggs and vegetables.I agree with some other reviewers that the final chapter could have been a bit better but overall this book is a very good one and well worth reading. I'd recommend it, especially the first 4 chapters.Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E. "
28,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1194182-liz,4,"10/25/17 For more than half of this book I thought I would be giving it a 4 not because it was so engrossing, but because the science was so good. It was really well supported with everything from fossil evidence to modern studies of primates, to what happens to people who only eat raw food. I thought ""wow! This is one of the first books I've read about speculations on our origins that hasn't left me feeling they hadn't considered other alternative explanations. They've really looked at this from all angles."" Then about 2/3 of the way through they start talking about how cooking created pair bonding and gender roles. No. No on so many levels I have trouble deciding where to start. First off for all those ""traditionalists"" out there anatomically we are not a monogamous species, and I am not just talking about men liking variety. I mean apes have tiny penises despite their enormous size because they do all their sexual competing outside the womb. So if you like having a big penis thank you great great great^10 grandmother for being such a player. Second it has always struck me as odd that despite bonobos being even more closely related to us than chimps, chimpanzees are constantly used as the go to model for early hominin behavior. Chimps tend to be much more aggressive and solve things violently in a male dominated ""society."" Bonobos on the other hand are matriarchal and tend to solve tensions through sex. Despite having the same sexual dimorphism found in chimps (and one similar to humans), it's the females who boss the males not by being bigger, but by sticking together. Why is this not a viable model for early human behavior? Third comparing what hunter-gatherers who have been put under extreme pressure from encroachment on their lands do in unprecedented times does not tell us much about how hunter-gatherers of the past would have behaved. When the world as you know it seems to be ending it's not surprising many take an ""every man for himself"" stance. Wouldn't some of us?Okay, I'm done with this soapbox for now incase anyone needs it."
29,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57901-jerzy,3,"I'm not usually a fan of evolutionary psychology, since much of it is un-provable/un-falsifiable ""just-so"" stories. But some of the ideas in this book seem plausible and have good supporting evidence.Wrangham shows that true raw foodists are very rare. Even hunter-gatherer societies cook their food whenever they get a chance, and they even grind grains into flour and bake things (despite what all the ""Paleo diet"" pseudo-prehistory would have you believe).We seem to get much more out of digesting cooked food than raw: Cooking increases the glycemic index of starchy foods. There have been somewhat gross-sounding experiments comparing digestion of various foods in people whose guts are accessible due to operations or otherwise (the story of Beaumont and St.-Martin is incredible). Soft, well-processed foods make rats fatter than firmer versions of the same food. This part of the book may be useful to dieters and may help explain why less-processed foods tend to seem healthier.However, then Wrangham gets into the evolutionary stuff which is harder to support with evidence... First he suggests that cooking was responsible for a big increase in brain size in one of our ancestor species, which may be plausible enough; but then he talks about how cooking is responsible for the social structure of the family household unit, and it starts to get a bit far-fetched.It's interesting to consider that by creating mealtimes, cooking may have helped to create communities and social structure; and the stereotypical division of labor by sex (men hunt, women gather and cook) may have been the start of trade and economic exchange-based ""efficiency"" improvements. It may well have contributed to these things, but I don't know that I'd say cooking was singlehandedly *responsible* for them, the way Wrangham suggests."

This is when men and women's roles became entrenched (if the physically stronger sex was out hunting, he didn't have time to do the actual cooking and needed a steady and certain source of cooked food ready to consume when he was back) - Wrangham presents a case that the concept of monogamous pairings happened because of this codependence of both genders on developing a certain source of food. Hmmm... I guess this might have been one aspect of it. But one could argue that if all a males needed was a cook, why not just recruit children or weaker men who couldn't hunt? I guess I don't fully buy this argument but happily for 21st century gender politics no one has to do any cooking at all because of drive thrus and SeamlessWeb so men and women live in perfectly harmonious equality now... er..."
31,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7094334-mkb,3,"I enjoyed it for the most part. Wrangham's work with chimpanzees results in totally interesting asides where he discusses his observations about them and then reports back what he found out when he did what they did (chewed raw goat meat with a leaf, etc.). I was also really taken with his chapter on raw food-ism as one hears more and more about it these days. The surveys he looked at seem to suggest it is hard for humans (esp. those who don,t have access to out-of-season, high quality foods year round like we do) to thrive entirely on raw food. This surprised me. I like cooking, but I didn't think of it as not optional!However, at some point he did this thing that sociobiologists do that drives me nuts. He doesn't do this much, but when talking about the gendered division of labour in humans around food-gathering and cooking he looked for examples of females preparing food for males in other species and came up with a bug as the comparison. While the insect story is interesting (she apparently secretes a waxy substance and lets him ride around on her back to eat it!), I am just allergic to things that might seem to justify social arrangements as natural for us because a rat, bat or bug does it that way. Of course, it gives a whole new meaning to waxing one's back. Not just for body-builders it seems."

There were some parts that had me completely engrossed, such as through evolution how our brains grew so large due to our stomachs getting smaller; while other parts just bored the hell out of me and were repetitive, such as softer cooked food giving our bodies more energy. I will say that it was really nerdy and awesome to read about evolution and the role cooking has played in it. For a decent portion of the book it appeared that softer cooked food was considered more ideal, and highly promoted over a raw diet, but I got annoyed because it didn't seem to take into consideration how processed foods have become and how terrible most of the stuff in the supermarket actually is. Lucky for this book's sake, the last page made this point and quoted my hero Michael Pollan. Way to pull me back in BOOK!

43,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69157986-jan,4,"This book was published in 2010, but has received a lot of attention also recently, and for good reason. Its author, Richard W. Wrangham, is a primatologist who has done extensive studies of chimpanzees with Jane Goodall at Gombe Stream National Park.. He has come to the conclusion that humans, with our naked skin, small digestive system and large brains could not have evolved without cooking, more specifically cooking with fire. This means that the current majority opinion, that we evolved large brains first and tamed fire later has it precisely upside down.Most of the book is concerned with hammering home the evidence that humans cannot live on raw food alone. Modern raw food faddists, even though they rely on industrialized food sources that are far more nutritious than what early hominins could hope to eat, are unable to get enough energy through their diet. We simply do not bite, chew, swallow or digest raw meat very well, and grasses that form a staple of our diets need heat treatment to give up its nutrients to us mammals without extra stomachs. This is a solid argument, but also one that begs for more research to confirm or deny it. Archaeologists and paleontologists have been unable to find convincing evidence for human control of fire going back more than around 600,000 years, when our ancestors Homo erectus lived across Africa and Eurasia. There is evidence of fire in association with early humans all the way back to 1.5Mya, but one fire does not prove that it was under control. To support the thesis that cooking made us, we need to push way beyond this and conclude that late Homo habilis, a much more primitive ancestor, tamed fire around 1.8 million years ago. There is no direct evidence for this. Maybe we should not expect to find evidence for a camp hearth so far into the past, but this makes many experts somewhat dismissive about the theory. This reader finds the argument very persuasive, if not fully convincing. But it's a fascinating theory: fire made cooking, and cooking made us. You are, indeed, what you eat."
44,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8082349-kevin,5,"Amazingly original research, which I happen to find convincing. I review the central claims here, https://kevinbinz.com/2019/02/24/cook...Wrangham presents his theory in a 1hr lecture here,https://youtu.be/LXorKMHQP44Besides the main argument, and regardless of whether cooking was invented 2 mya, Wrangham also gestures at the fact that hearths were primarily responsible for uniquely human social structures. Here’s a brief sketch of the gist:===In animal species, the mating system is adapted to the feeding system, rather than the other way around. No matter when it was invented, cooking certainly had enormous consequences on the development of human sociality. Cooking is a conspicuous and lengthy process. In the bush, the sight or smell of smoke reveals a cook’s location at a long distance, allowing hungry individuals who have no food to easily locate cooks in action. If the first cooks were temperamentally like chimpanzees, life would have been absurdly difficult for low-status hominids trying to cook a meal. In modern hunter-gatherer societies, cooking need not be a social activity, but a woman needs a man to guard her food, and she needs the community to back him up. A man relies on a woman to feed him, and on other men to respect his relationship with her. A primitive food-protection regime would have evolve rapidly among early cooks. It is frankly unclear to me how this regime would play out over time. But it seems likely that such interactions caused the emergence of human pair bonding. Indeed, it is interesting to note how easily traditional hunter-gatherers interpret feeding a man with a marriage proposal.No matter when cooking was invented, cooking also presumably played a role in changes to the human life history program. The key reason humans reproduce more than chimps is that we wean at 2-3 years instead of 4-5 years. This lifestyle change was eased by the availability of soft foods (vs raw tubers) for our babies. "
45,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18249040-thark-n,3,"I am writing this months after having read it, so it will be brief. Summary: Wrangham is contending that the advent of cooking was a key driver in human evolution. While i was aware there were qualifiers to the ""a calorie is a calorie"" maxim recited throughout the internet's nutrition repositories (reddit), the role of cooking in caloric bio-availability was surprising. Wrangham begins by pointing to raw-foodists and raw pet food, showing studies that find eaters of unprocessed foods weighing much less than their cooking counterparts. Cooking food increases the calories absorbed into the body hugely in some circumstances, and even more so in humans, who lack proper meat-processing jaws that carnivores have, or the relatively enormous digestive apparatuses of most animals.. The relatives of humans spend much of the daylight hours just chewing, far more than any human. Cooking gives the more reward for the effort, thus saving calories and time. Thus, it's not surprising cooking is a universal in human cultures. Wrangham posits the immediate ancestors of Homo Erectus as the first consistent cooks. These creatures, advantaged by cooking, began an evolutionary line that has resulted in sapiens. The free time allocated was used for dividing the genders and letting the men search for scarcer and more valuable meats, while the women would find and cook gathered plants. High calories and easier digestion let human brains grow at the expense of gut size (is this why so many brilliant people were so sickly?). Cooking is a molder of humanity.I frankly wouldn't recommend the book to most people, it's somewhat disorganized and drones on too long, and if you've read reviews you've probably picked up the important points already."

Better diet means more energy used to meet the high energy costs of a large and well-developed brain, means better tools to obtain prey (and therefore meat) more efficiently, improved diet, more energy for brain, able to use/create fire due to increased intelligence, improved diet (v.i.a cooking), larger brain e.t.c. However, we didn't go full depth about exactly HOW the brain got more energy. Thankfully, this book covered that! Turns out, cooking food with fire decreases the digestion cost, as it makes the food softer, so there's energy left over to use on the brain. Mind = blown.This lead to decreased digestion time, decreased molars and premolars, a delicate jaw e.t.c as natural selection selected Homo's that ate cooked food (as they were more intelligent and were more likely to survive and pass on their alleles/genes to offspring).AMAZING.So happy I picked up this book!

269,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40213679-trish-mclellan,4,Well worth reading and gives us some insight into how we digest food.
270,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70758254-visveswaran-vishnu,4,"“A man does not live on what he eats, an old proverb says, but on what he digests.”—JEAN ANTHELME BRILLAT-SAVARIN'An obvious implication of animals and humans gaining more weight and reproducing better on cooked than raw diets is that when a food is heated, it must yield more energy.'Nicely articulated and at times, repetitive."
271,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83049755-christen,5,"I very much enjoyed this book, especially thinking through what cooking actually entails and how it changes *everything*! The chapter on gender dynamics was especially interesting to me in that regard. And as someone who was once interested in raw-food veganism the information about the superiority of cooked food and the idea that our bodies have adapted to cooked food was also eye-opening. "
272,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67244615-joshua-carney,5,Rich Wrangham writes a compelling book in which he narrates some of the critical development in anthropological history through the hermeneutic of cooking. the take is novel and compelling and has explanatory power to move the discussion forward on a few sociological issues such as sexism and gender. The book is fascinating. 
273,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6272592-mark-field,3,"I devoured this (... see what I did there :)) A great condensed overview of the development of the most primal of man's needs ... food or more the development of how and why we started cooking it rather than eating it raw like our primate cousins. Short, sharp and concise. Plenty of footnotes for those who want to delve deeper.3.5 stars"
274,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50787896-julien-bramel,3,"Easy read, relatively short, informative. But how accepted in the ""Anthropology community"" is this theory (that cooking food made us who we are)? It is hard to tell from the book, and now it's been some years since it was published. "
275,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29919051-marion,1,"The author gives scant attention to fire, which is integral to cooking. Some of the nutritional studies that are cited provide questionable support for the primacy of cooking in evolution, e.g., vegan studies."
276,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67616375-allison-gessner,5,"Fascinating, thorough. I love that the author explores all the different possible explanations and why they do or don't make sense. The explanation of how women became subordinate to men because of depending on cooked food blew my mind."
277,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11745914-anthony,4,An interesting and thought provoking read about the human evolution of mankind and how the use of fire and the ability to cook food has been attributed to the further intelligence and adaptability of humanity from the origins of prehistoric people.
278,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2069906-kaz,3,"An interesting read on the history of cooked food.After reading this book I have a better understanding of the raw food diet and it’s downfalls. Saying that, it is still in the best interest of your health to eat a plentiful diet of raw fruit and vegetables. "
279,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94685573-max-weinhold,3,"An interesting exploration about how the cooking of food made and shapes humans today, offering a compelling explanation for progression of hominids from our tree-climbing ancestors to the highly social, specialized, hunter gatherer societies of yesterday and today"
280,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39894105-nestor-leal,2,I'd rather stay with Michael Pollan's work. The epilogue offered the most useful information from the whole book.
281,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5469227-d-l-morrese,3,"Did fire and the ability to cook help drive human evolution? Quite possibly, it seems. This book can be a bit repetitive, but it offers an interesting hypothesis."
282,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4176715-mckinley,4,Some interesting ideas.
283,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11690463-joseph,5,I strongly recommend this book to anyone with a love of evolutionary biology or food anthropology. 
284,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2458054-frank,3,RW presents well thought out and convincing arguments that the taming of fire and associated changes in diet had a decisive effect on human physical and social evolution.

287,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12666114-v-k,4,Very scientific and thorough. Slow going through book but totally worth the effort
288,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5886505-nicole,3,"Interesting idea, lacking in engaging presentation."
289,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8982990-paul-barnes,4,Vindication for my long espoused retort when proffered salads that what distinguishes man from the ape is that he cooks his food.
290,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53475385-tyler-meester,5,"Very informative!I found myself constantly surprised, and was thankful to learn about the chemical processes that go on in our bodies up to digest food. "
291,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6158293-bruce,4,"Seems well researched, and the thesis is well laid out. Was perhaps a bit dry or slow-moving at a couple of points, but overall an enjoyable listen (Audible edition)."
292,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62387691-augusto,5,"Loved this book! There is so much that i did not know about evolution, primates, digestion, and other topics that are connected in this book."
293,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67208471-zalor-n-za,5,I loved who the author explained the evolution and downfall of the nomadic society. I think that there is a lot to learn about nomadic societies and change some of our ways.
294,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51051403-nabeela-rehman,4,"Overall good but dated- published before anything was known about the microbiome and the effect of microbiome on digestion, inflammation, and psychology."
295,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51535916-alyssa-lee,3,"An informative book which reads like a well researched essay, there were some salient points on how cooking aided our evolution."
296,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70068526-tyler,4,"Very interesting theory on the evolution of Homo Sapiens related to a topic everyone can relate to, but may forget how much it has shaped us."
297,0465020410,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73016811-la-dama-de-ise,5,"THE GOOD:- I think it did a very good work at presenting both sides of the arguments.- Addicting to listen.THE BAD:- Forgot about taking notes. Too much interesting anecdotes and information to keep track...ANYTHING ELSE:- Audiobook- First purely anthropological book I've read. Ended up loving it much more than expected, and super motivated for getting into 'Sapiens' by Harari immediately after."
