We do not know: we can only guess.
Karl Popper originally wrote Logik der Forchung (The Logic of Research) in 1934. This original version—published in haste to secure an academic position and escape the threat of Nazism (Popper was of Jewish descent)—was heavily condensed at the publisher’s request; and because of this, and because it remained untranslated from the German, the book did not receive the attention it deserved. This had to wait until 1959, when Popper finally released a revised and expanded English translation. Yet this condensation and subsequent expansion have left their mark on the book. Popper makes his most famous point within the first few dozen pages; and much of the rest of the book is given over to dead controversies, criticisms and rejoinders, technical appendices, and extended footnotes. It does not make for the most graceful reading experience.This hardly matters, however, since it is here that Popper put forward what has arguably become the most famous concept in the philosophy of science: falsification.This term is widely used; but its original justification is not, I believe, widely understood. Popper’s doctrine must be seen as a response to inductivism. In 1620 Francis Bacon released his brilliant Novum Organum. Its title alludes to Aristotle’s Organon, a collection of logical treatises, mainly focusing on how to make accurate deductions. This Aristotelian method—dominated by syllogisms: deriving conclusions from given premises—dominated the study of nature for millennia, with precious little to show for it. Francis Bacon hoped to change all that with his new doctrine of induction. Instead of beginning with premises (‘All men are mortal’), and reasoning to conclusions (‘Socrates is mortal’), the investigator must begin with experiences (‘Socrates died,’ ‘Plato died,’ etc.) and then generalize a conclusion (‘All men are mortal’). This was how science was to proceed: from the specific to the general.This seemed all fine and dandy until, in 1738, David Hume published his Treatise of Human Nature, in which he explained his infamous ‘problem of induction.’ Here is the idea. If you see one, two, three… a dozen… a thousand… a million white swans, and not a single black one, it is still illogical to conclude “All swans are white.” Even if you investigated every swan in the world but one, and they all proved white, you still could not conclude with certainty that the last one would be white. Aside from modus tollens (concluding from a negative specific to a negative general), there is no logically justifiable way to proceed from the specific to the general. To this argument, many are tempted to respond: “But we know from experience that induction works. We generalize all the time.” Yet this is to use induction to prove that induction works, which is paradoxical. Hume’s problem of induction has proven to be a stumbling block for philosophers ever since.In the early parts of the 20th century, the doctrine of logical positivism arose in the philosophical world, particularly in the ‘Vienna Circle’. This had many proponents and many forms, but the basic idea, as explained by A.J. Ayer, is the following. The meaning of a sentence is equivalent to its verification; and verification is performed through experience. Thus the sentence “The cat is on the mat” can be verified by looking at the mat; it is a meaningful utterance. But the sentence “The world is composed of mind” cannot be verified by any experience; it is meaningless. Using this doctrine the positivists hoped to eliminate all metaphysics. Unfortunately, however, the doctrine also eliminates human knowledge, since, as Hume showed, generalizations can never be verified. No experience corresponds, for example, to the statement: “Gravitation is proportional to the product of mass and the inverse square of distance,” since this is an unlimitedly general statement, and experiences are always particular.Karl Popper’s falsificationism is meant to solve this problem. First, it is important to note that Popper is not, like the positivists, proposing a criterion of ‘meaning’. That is to say that, for Popper, unfalsifiable statements can still be meaningful; they just do not tell us anything about the world. Indeed, he continually notes how metaphysical ideas (such as Kepler’s idea that circles are more ‘perfect’ than other shapes) have inspired and guided scientists. This is itself an important distinction because it prevents him from falling into the same paradox as the positivists. For if only the statements with empirical content have meaning, then the statement “only the statements with empirical content have meaning” is itself meaningless. Popper, for his part, regarded himself as the enemy of linguistic philosophy and considered the problem of epistemology quite distinct from language analysis.To return to falsification, Popper’s fundamental insight is that verification and falsification are not symmetrical. While no general statement can be proved using a specific instance, a general statement can indeed be disproved with a specific instance. A thousand white swans does not prove all swans are white; but one black swan disproves it. (This is the aforementioned modus tollens.) All this may seem trivial; but as Popper realized, this changes the nature of scientific knowledge as we know it. For science, then, is far from what Bacon imagined it to be—a carefully sifted catalogue of experiences, a collection of well-founded generalizations—and is rather a collection of theories which spring up, as it were, from the imagination of the scientist in the hopes of uniting several observed phenomena under one hypothesis. Or to put it more bluntly: a good scientific theory is a guess that does not prove wrong.With his central doctrine established, Popper goes on to the technicalities. He discusses what composes the ‘range’ or ‘scope’ of a theory, and how some theories can be said to encompass others. He provides an admirable justification for Occam’s Razor—the preference for simpler over more complex explanations—since theories with fewer parameters are more easily falsified and thus, in his view, more informative. The biggest section is given over to probability. I admit that I had some difficulty following his argument at times, but the gist of his point is that probability must be interpreted ‘objectively,’ as frequency distributions, rather than ‘subjectively,’ as degrees of certainty, in order to be falsifiable; and also that the statistical results of experiments must be reproducible in order to avoid the possibility of statistical flukes. All this leads up to a strangely combative section on quantum mechanics. Popper apparently was in the same camp as Einstein, and was put off by Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. Like Einstein, Popper was a realist and did not like the idea that a particle’s properties could be actually undetermined; he wanted to see the uncertainty of quantum mechanics as a byproduct of measurement or of ‘hidden variables’—not as representing something real about the universe. And like Einstein (though less famously) Popper proposed an experiment to decide the issue. The original experiment, as described in this book, was soon shown to be flawed; but a revised experiment was finally conducted in 1999, after Popper’s death. Though the experiment agreed with Popper’s prediction (showing that measuring an entangled photon does not affect its pair), it had no bearing on Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, which restricts arbitrarily precise measurements on a single particle, not a pair of particles. Incidentally, it is difficult to see why Popper is so uncomfortable with the uncertainty principle. Given his own dogma of falsifiability, the belief that nature is inherently deterministic (and that probabilistic theories are simply the result of a lack of our own knowledge) should be discarded as metaphysical. This is just one example of how Popper’s personality was out of harmony with his own doctrines. An advocate of the open society, he was famously authoritarian in his private life, which led to his own alienation. This is neither here nor there, but it is an interesting comment on the human animal.Popper’s doctrine, like all great ideas, has proven both influential and controversial. For my part I think falsification a huge advance over Bacon’s induction or the positivists’ verification. And despite the complications, I think that falsifiability is a crucial test to distinguish, not only science from pseudo-science, but all dependable knowledge from myth. For both pseudo-science and myth generally distinguish themselves by admirably fitting the data set, but resisting falsification. Freud’s theories, for example, can accommodate themselves to any set of facts we throw at them; likewise for intelligent design, belief in supernatural beings, or conspiracy theories. All of these seem to explain everything—and in a way they do, since they fit the observable data—but really explain nothing, since they can accommodate any new observation. There are some difficulties with falsification, of course. The first is observation. For what we observe, or even what we count as an ‘observation’, is colored by our background beliefs. Whether to regard a dot in the sky as a plane, a UFO, or an angel is shaped by the beliefs we already hold; thus it is possible to disregard observations that run counter to our theories, rather than falsifying the theories. What is more, theories never exist in isolation, but in an entire context of beliefs; so if one prediction is definitively falsified, it can still be unclear what we must change in our interconnected edifice of theories. Further, it is rare for experimental predictions to agree exactly with results; usually they are approximately correct. But where do we draw the line between falsification and approximate correctness? And last, if we formulate a theory which withstands test after test, predicting their results with extreme accuracy time and again, must we still regard the theory as a provisional guess? To give Popper credit, he responds to all of these points in this work, though perhaps not with enough discussion. But all these criticisms belie the fact that so much of the philosophy of science written after Popper has taken his work as a starting point, either attempting to amplify, modify, or (dare I say it?) falsify his claims. For my part, though I was often bored by the dry style and baffled by the technical explanations, I found myself admiring Popper’s careful methodology: responding to criticisms, making fine distinctions, building up his system piece by piece. Here is a philosopher deeply committed to the ideal of rational argument and deeply engaged with understanding the world. I am excited to read more."

But, it's a good book for any and all graduate students in the scientific field to have on a bookshelf (particularly at the bench). "

4,0415278449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/854451-robb,2,"I volunteered to read this book in my PhD Doctoral Seminar because I thought my German language abilities would help me further understand Karl Popper.It didn't.Here's my review:Grappling with underlying ideas of how science is “discovered” and the underlying problems that exist with new knowledge? Sir Karl Popper’s book, The Logic of Scientific Discovery, directly addresses these issues and additionally tackles a theme important to philosophy – epistemology or the growth of knowledge. A critical examination of the logic behind science is required for the “growth of scientific knowledge.”Popper’s book, published in the early 1930s, elicited a storm of controversy. In fact, the author has since written three novels as well as numerous papers to further explain his views. The premise he makes is that laws of nature, theories and hypotheses should not be and never should be established as “truth”. Instead, they can be corroborated and supported by the observations and systematic tests of science.Of the three organized parts to the book, the first part deals with an introduction to the Logic of Science. The second section, by far the largest, begins to expound upon different components needed to frame his overall thesis. Together, these are arranged into short monologues (85 of them) that dissect the components of theoretical scientific research. The last section of his book contains seven appendices as well as twelve additional appendices added since his first edition. These contain examples and explicit rationale to elaborate upon and delve into those items that he felt would be the most contentious or have since been found contentious by his peers.In short, he spends most of his time reviewing some of the more fundamental problems that philosophers have encountered (and often have chosen to ignore) in the advancement of science. He takes aim at the generally accepted “theory of scientific method”, arguing that most methodological rules, conventions, and approaches taken contain fundamental flaws. Beginning with the theories in use, he observes that the logical problems, often dismissed by assumption or by convention, should not and do not need to be handled in this way. The notion of falsification and the problem of empirical basis are thoroughly discussed. A great deal of space is devoted to the nuances of testability and simplicity followed by two dozen or so pieces on probability. His “Observations on Quantum Theory” are fascinating as he walks the reader through many of theory’s questionable assumptions. Finally, he finishes with several thoughts on “corroboration, or how a theory stands up to tests.”This book is NOT light reading – a good dictionary to assist with the mastery of his subject area is highly recommended. In addition, a college-level education in the empirical sciences and philosophy wouldn’t hurt. Figures such as Kant, Bernoulli, Newton, Einstein and others are used throughout the book to support or reject his theses. He is well versed in his contemporaries’ work and speaks with an ease regarding their research and theories in a way that lends credence to his own views. Contemporaries such as Einstein, with whom he corresponded, were equally familiar and knowledgeable with accepted philosophical tenets as well as in their particular fields of science. Unfortunately, the book’s flow and organization leaves much to be desired. For example, Popper chose to footnote and comment on nearly every monologue he wrote in subsequent editions. (The original had been printed near the beginning of his career.) For many, this is a great boon, because he uses this space to defend his work over time as well as expound even further upon his thoughts. He also acknowledges his mistakes or where he has been convinced otherwise and even encourages readers to skip portions of the book he no longer supports. Publishing a revised and enlarged edition to correct his work might have made things easier for the reader. However, this artifact may simply be a way to show how his thinking has evolved over the years.Owing to the radically provocative nature of his ideas, the many separate books, papers, and symposia this book has spawned, this book has fulfilled its purpose. It has become one of the classics in modern logical thinking by critically examining the underpinnings of modern scientific thought and theory. This book deserves a place in the library of every serious student of philosophy. While writing about logical examination of scientific theories, Popper muses, “Our method of research is not to defend them, in order to prove how right we were. On the contrary, we try to overthrow them.” In essence, his legacy remains: there will always be another set of laws, another set of hypotheses and their accompanying axioms that will absorb existing theories and well established axioms until the next set comes along. And we still have so much to discover."
5,0415278449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1662632-richard,4,"I studied this while in grad school. My thesis, which never got much beyond the notes stage, used Popper and other epistemologies to examine the difference between ""natural"" sciences and ""social"" sciences. The basic hypothesis was that the latter rested on ""essentially contested"" propositions. For example, Galileo's observations of the solar system and the conclusions he drew therefrom depended on the underlying theory of optics being correct. Since both the theory and instruments were new and crude, that was originally probably a pretty formidable attack. However, there is nothing about whether or not the theory of optics is correct that is a direct affront to anyone's ideological holdings. Meanwhile, over in the social sciences, my suspicion is that there will always be unresolvable debates about the essence of things: which is more important, charity or justice? Seniority or quantifiable capability?Popper provided the foundation for much of my thinking, and more. But my thesis advisor thought I was straying pretty far from International Relations and I was finding there was too much more recent epistemology to be read to sustain my interest.I still think I'm right :-) but it doesn't really matter, does it?­"
6,0415278449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,5,"This book gets five stars simply on influence on subsequent philosophers of science. This famous work has Popper explaining a methodology of science based on the falsification principle as opposed to the Vienna Circle's ""verification principle"". It is a superior incite that in one stroke explains how hard sciences (which serves as its model) are done and at the same times solves the demarcation problem in distinguishing between whether a concept is scientific or not. The falsification principle is a principle that a scientific theory sticks its neck out and shows ways it could be proven false through experiment. This is something that Freudian psychoanalysis, for example, doesn't do since any result found in it can explain away any observable. Such concepts never leave themselves exposed to the possibility of being falsified and hence are not scientific ideas. Popper also defends his frequentist theory of probability against more subjective versions of probability. The book seems to have been superseded by more recent philosophy but that is only because we stand on Popper's shoulders. "

8,0415278449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,4,"His reputation preceding him, with a pretty good idea of what the main arguments of the book are, it is a daunting task to read Popper in the original. But it soon becomes clear that there is enough value, ingenuity and originality in ""The Logic"" to merit reading the original book in lieu of, or in addition to, later clarifications, commentaries and critiques (including some by Popper himself). First, a warning. The logical complexity and mathematical sophistication of his arguments, combined with the author's engagement with the partially outmoded terminology of the positivists and probability theorists, means that some sections of the book will almost certainly appear, to all but the most savant of savants, varying degrees of impenetrable, inscrutable and unreadable. The dense appendices, full of logical and mathematical proofs, can happily be skipped. It is also clear that some parts of the main text of the book have become severely outdated, especially the sections on quantum mechanics (cf. the Heisenberg-Bohr interpretation and its implications). The low point of the book, from a readability perspective, namely the 70 dense pages devoted to probability theory, especially that of J.M. Keynes, and refuting its implications for science, seem to be of little interest to contemporary debates, and only marginally relevant to Popper's main arguments. So I would not fuss about reading every chapter, footnote or appendix. The main gist of the book can be expressed in non-technical terms. And Popper himself does a wonderful job explaining his position in the few opening chapters. So it might even be enough to read through chapters I-VI.At his best, Popper is a very lucid philosopher of science, whose revolutionary doctrine, that scientific doctrines can never be ""verified"" or deemed ""true,"" but only temporarily more or less corroborated, is carefully argued for, using a combination of natural language and technical terminology (which is sometimes helpful, although never absolutely necessary, or so it seems to me). The fact that he spends considerable time attacking his contemporaries - the inductionists, the positivists, the Vienna Circle, the pragmatists, the conventionalists, etc. - means that he occasionally gets bogged down in technical minutiae, but the main thread is luckily never lost.Disentangling the the fact that he revolutionized the history of the philosophy of science from the particular arguments advanced in the book is a difficult task. As Popper himself always emphasized, there are no isolated observations that are ""theory-free"", but we are always carrying with us some ""metaphysical"" assumptions (strictly speaking untestable, unscientific and unempirical). Thus, before reading the book, the reader will almost certainly have been introduced to Popperian methodology via some circuitous route, e.g. a commentary, a philosophy course, or a later critique. These form a king of ""background halo"" through which the reading experience will be refracted. Some of the ""baggage"" that I personally brought to the reading experience - in additional to a deep respect for Popper's critique of inductive science - was the importance and value of some of the criticism that has been targeted against him. This is no time to go through the theories of Kuhn or Feyerabend, for example, but I'm sure the reader will find the time to go read those authors. The fact that Popper has influenced subsequent scholarship is vital to understanding him. It WILL colour the reading experience, but not in the sense of ""tainting"" the pure original picture, but ""motivating"" the reading experience with a combination of prejudiced respect and curiosity.However, I wish to offer one major criticism that I have with Popper's wonderfully stringent theory: I worry that Popper offers too much of an ""idealized"" version of science. He proceeds logically to devise an ideal system that bears little resemblance to actual science. More concretely, Popper's ""system"" (if we can call it that) contains a realist component and an idealist component, and these two aspects do not mix easily. In fact, they are often in dire conflict with each other. The realist component, which I admire, is embedded in his notion of how hypotheses and theories come about. The idealist component, which I see as the problem, is embedded in his notion of how hypotheses and theories are supposed to be put into the test (ideally of the potentially falsifying ""crucial experiment""). Overall, Popper's view of science describes an ideal scientific practice, whereby theories - motivated by WHATEVER source, be it rational belief or irrational flight of fancy - are devised, and crafted, in such a way that they meet the maximum criteria of universality, simplicity and testability (i.e. falsifiability). This is certainly a difficult task, but Popper insists on it. In this view, doing anything else - i.e. devising ""ad hoc"" explanations to explain weakness, or devising metaphysical tautologies to explain strengths - is frowned upon, and the practice of science is hopefully purified of such bad methodologies. But we have a problem, since there is no guarantee that the scientists, who are psychologically very much invested and often in love with their own theories, will, absent strong institutional incentives, be motivated to design their theories in such a manner. This assumes too rosy a picture of humanity. In his ""Open Society and its Enemies"", Popper has accused social scientists of being naively optimistic. But in ""the Logic"", Popper seems to fall for the same fallacious view of human motivation and capabilities. Even if Popper acknowledges his logical focus, he SEEMS to be implying that devising such a system of science, where fallibility and falsifiability are crowned king and queen, is theoretically possible.But human beings have a psychology that is fighting hard against such devises. Scientists, like other humans, will carry their irrational and self-serving practices, which motivate their quest for knowledge, and their desire to build metaphysical systems, all the way to the experimental stage; and only a strong community of peer pressure and external criticism can build sufficient safeguards against building theories that are impervious to refutation, or, which comes to the same thing, of being reluctant to accept studies that threaten one's cherished theories. Whether such strong institutional studies can be built is an empirical question; even if Popper provides a good way for an ideal scientific community to be structured, it is dubious whether it ever will be. A more reasonable assumption is to assume that science will, hopefully, come to approximate a system of perfect competition, where systems (theories, hypotheses) can be freely tested. Even if most scientists will be reluctant to set their theories to the test, peer pressure can, ideally, force it on them. This seems to me to be the only way to rescue Popper's methodology from the pitfalls of human self-deception. And indeed, Popper knew this: he references ""natural selection"" and ""freedom"" as prerequisites of science, since they foster competition that can lead to the rejection of bad habits and theories. Indeed, Popper's insistence on falsifiability ONLY makes sense if embedded into this context. But such a context does not preclude pragmatic, instrumental or positivistic theories, either, which seems to make Popper's insistence on a particular methodological commitment metaphysical (which he readily admits); and, more dangerously, superfluous, if RESULTS are what matter. (And results can be obtained using probabilistic logic, positivistic induction, or any other methodology.)Even if Popper's original formulation of scientific practice can be criticized, and has been with justification, this is partly missing the point. The value of Popper's insight is that even though it contains many outdated and outmoded paragraphs, it opened up a whole new methodology. Very few thinkers have been able to set up a new paradigm that challenges the very foundations of our commonly held beliefs and practices, but Popper certainly did, and he did so with rigorous logic. Great thinkers are often ones who use reason AGAINST reason, use logic AGAINST logic, i.e. to show the limits of reason and logic, and this is exactly the greatest contribution of Popper's critical method. He does not leave us with debilitating skepticism, but with exhilarating awareness of the imperfections of our knowledge, the constantly challenging nature of reality, the critical nature of science, and the ""irrational rationality"" of our own drives, beliefs, faith and curiosity."

10,0415278449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32553593-elliott-bignell,5,"Popper enjoys a reputation as the greatest philosopher of the 20th Century. This book, in which he elucidated the doctrine of falsification still espoused by prominent scientific commentators like Richard Dawkins and endorsed by most scientists, went a long way to establishing that reputation. I would go so far as to say that you cannot understand a keystone in the philosophy of science without reading this work.This is not an easy book to read - it is a little mathematical here and there, and there is a lengthy section on probability that is frankly a lot of effort. There are also copious footnotes and some very mathematical appendixes. However, this is philosophical history as it was made and is worth the extra work. Popper actually corresponded with the likes of Einstein about the correspondence of his ideas to real science, and modified some of his positions after publication. That evolution is reflected in footnotes that acknowledge weaknesses without correcting them. This, it seems to me, is a paragon of intellectual honesty.There are insights of startling clarity, and a few which seem counter-intuitive on first blush. Popper explains very neatly how the falsifiability and therefore the scientific utility of a theory stem from the range of statements that it rules out. The theory that planets move in ellipses requires at least three points to falsify; a theory that they moved in circles might be falsified with only two. Epicycles might have needed hundreds. Ad hoc hypotheses make theories more complex while increasing the range of statements that they accommodate - Ockham's Razor drops out of falsifiability before our eyes. Probability statements cannot be falsified by single experiments, but probability in theories is still falsifiable - so long as one cannot reliably predict a deviation from probabilistic behaviour!Ultimately, the value of such a piece of work must be seen historically, and Popper's doctrine is now orthodoxy. This is a classic of Western thought."
11,0415278449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/442654-andrew,0,"90% of the value of Popper today, especially for the non-scientist is in the first part of the book. Popper reconciles Kant's observations about how the world is ultimately filtered through the lenses of space and time with a fundamentally empiricist, materialist sense of reality. While I disagree with some of his assertions-- especially his complete disavowal of inductive reasoning, and his general disregard for non-scientific knowledge-- I respect his method and, as a fellow empiricist, believe that his scientific (but definitely NOT his political) philosophy has made the world a better place, and paved the way for the pioneering efforts of Kuhn, Lakatos, and others. Read the Logic of Scientific Discovery if you're at all interested in the nature of inquiry. Philosophy of science emerges as a mature discipline, and science itself gets its best definition.My lack of technical knowledge prevented me from fully understanding large sections. My limited knowledge of quantum theory and probability, along with my complete lack of knowledge about the works of Bernoulli and others, made the latter half of the Logic of Scientific Discovery utterly impenetrable. However, it's still very much worth reading the first part."
12,0415278449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4497443-tom,4,"This is a difficult book. Popper assumes a lot of knowledge in the reader regarding probability theory, quantum mechanics, and logic. It's not a work for the layman. As such, the entire chapter on probability (the lengthiest chapter, if I recall) was beyond my grasp. As was the chapter on quantum theory. Many of the appendices were highly technical in nature and were, too, incomprehensible to me. Regardless, Popper's demarcation criterion of falsifiability separating empirical science from metaphysics is monumentally important and deserves a special place in the philosophy of science. I'm not sure if I'm convinced, however, of his complete rejection of induction, but his arguments are compelling (if, at times, difficult to follow.) All in all, this is definitely worth reading for anyone interested in the subject matter. It might be advisable to skim over the heavy-duty math portions, though."

If you don't, but have the interest and willingness to learn, it is a good book about the nature of scientific knowledge and its implications. It proposes that no matter how many experiments you do, you can ever prove a theory. However, an experiment, that can be reproduced, can actually disprove one. I took a Philosophy of Science Couse in college that explained the key concepts in this book, without having to read this book, meaning that it runs longer and appears more complicated than was necessary. That said, it is a critical book for scientific philosophers in the quest for scientific validity and related fields like metaphysics."

16,0415278449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7336012-samuel,3,"At first sight, one might be tempted to think that science, which has solid roots on experimental, and thus empirical, verification, could dispense with metaphysical claims. In fact, nowadays one hears the quote by so many famous popularizers of science - 'philosophy is dead'. Science stands on its own, as a self-contained structure that is immune to metaphysics and psychologism. This, I think, is a complete perversion of how science is conducted; and so does Popper. He argues that science does not go from the particular to the general, but keeps itself at the general level. In other words, Popper defends that science starts only with universal claims - that is, with general theories that attempt to describe the world. No amount of inductive thought can give birth to scientific theories, which have a general, law-like nature that cannot be found in the empirical world - the logic of science is then deductive, not inductive. The question then arises - if science works at the level of abstractions, and the world is experienced at the level of the particular, how can one distinguish science from metaphysics? The explanation goes as follows: general theories, although they retain the character of metaphysical claims, in the sense that these can never be verified, they can be falsified by any singular instance that contradicts the given theory. Instead of arguing that scientific theories can be verified by experiments - and thus validating induction as a method for producing general theories - Popper argues that scientific theories are never true, but only corroborated up to a certain point in time. This is the origin of the asymmetry between science and metaphysics - the first can be falsified, the latter cannot.The other question that arises is: how are scientific ideas born? Popper was careful not to expound on this point, which goes beyond his thesis. In fact, it might the case that the origin of scientific theories is purely metaphysical and psychological; that there is no justification to be found in the world of experience, and in induction, for how and why we create abstract theories. Once falsifiability is added as an ingredient, metaphysics precipitates as a theory which can be put to test - science is born.It is completely unwise to attempt to eliminate philosophy from science. It is not that philosophy is dead - it is that we rest on such a solid philosophical ground that this has become our default state. To refute this, one could argue that the scientific method - the practice of systematic testing - is impervious to philosophy and only relies on experiment. But how can one attempt to test anything without some generalized notion, or theory, as to how the world behaves? Why is such a generalization worth pursuing? The fact that science starts from preconceived theories, even if ill-defined, seems to me irrefutable.Finally, I have a harsh criticism to weave against Popper. Whenever he attempts to formalize his notions in a mathematical fashion, things go wrong. His examples are unnecessarily complicated; his understanding of some physical theories, such as quantum theory, are partially flawed (something that he recognized latter on). However, his ideas are original and have been quite fruitful; the idea that science is deeply rooted in deduction, rather than induction, seems to have escaped the eyes of most philosophers."
17,0415278449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43592939-leopold-benedict,4,"Karl Popper's (1902-1994) influence on our current conception of science can hardly be overestimated. He tackles the problem of induction, which was originally evoked by David Hume (1711-1776). Induction describes the process that single observations lead to the formulation of a universal rule. The problem is that induction assumes that past processes stay the same in the future and that causality links two points of observation. Both assumptions cannot be proven. We cannot assume that the laws of nature still stay the same, because induction gives us no knowledge of its inner workings. Causality cannot be established because the observation may be caused by factors out of our sight.Popper argues that inductive reasoning is unscientific. He proposes the alternative model of deductive testing of theories. According to him, it is impossible to verify a theory because there could be an unlimited numbers of cases out of our reach, which could disprove the theory. For example, Newton's laws of gravitation have been proven accurate in uncountable experiments in over 200 years, until Einstein discovered the domain of quantum physics, where Newton's laws don't hold anymore. This illustrates that we can never be completely sure that a theory is valid, no matter how many empirics we have to support the theory. Thus, the duty of a scientist is to deduct predictions from his theory that can be falsified. Hypotheses are only valuable when they are clearly true or false. The scientist should construct experiments that are most likely to disprove the theory. When the theory survives this falsification test, it is corroborated. Theories that do not survive the falsification test, should be discarded and new theories that have more explanatory power should be established. Researchers who try to verify a theory suffer from confirmation bias and should not be considered scientific. This method of scientific inquiry, which emphasizes the limits of human knowledge, is called critical rationalism. Popper's ideas on scientific research dominate social science today. He has to be credited for developing a mode of science that incorporates the principle of failure and error, or more than that, makes it its highest principle. However, Popper's concept leads to a narrow understanding of science and limits the amount of questions that can be asked. For example, psychoanalysis by Freud is an influential and fascinating approach to explain human behavior. But because it cannot make clear and falsifiable predictions for human behavior it is deemed worthless by Popper. In my own field of political science, this leads to the tendency to avoid normative questions and comprehensive theories. Instead, researchers ask boring but scientific questions like why an EU directive is implemented faster in one country than in another country. Against this backdrop, the book 'The Structure of Scientific Revolutions' by Thomas S. Kuhn (1922-1996) provides a different angle on the progress of science."
18,0415278449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2529578-m-pereira,5,"There is too much to say about this book so I might summarise the real highlights:1. Popper elucidates and defends against critics the thesis of Falsificationism. 2. As well as the idea about falsification that everyone knows about, Popper constructs a probability model which is made from the tools of modern logic to create an epistemology of science, its very complicated stuff and I only understood about 2% of it.3. Popper should be understood in terms of the people he is responding to: JM Keynes and his work on probability, Carnap and his work on the structure of reality, Kant and Hume are very much in the background in Popper's theory of science. 4. This book has about 250 pages of appendixes and so much of it is full of logical proofs and such. Not only did Popper take great pains to respond to his critics in this degree, there's also another book about defending this thesis fully concerning the objections!I can't emphasise how amazing this book is. This is perhaps the best and most important book in philosophy next to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason and Aristotle's Categories."
19,0415278449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2975107-tim-patrick,2,"This book is not for the faint of heart. It is a serious book discussing the philosophy of scientific experimentation, and is filled with formulas, Greek letters, and hundreds of pages of end notes. Just to be clear: Einstein liked this book, so you need to be prepared for its complexity. His core idea is that theories are only actual science when they can be subjected to falsifiable experiments. That is, you have to be able to prove a theory wrong for it to be valid, at least in terms of good science. Most of the content is only of interest to hardcore scientific philosophers, but it does have an impact on our lives and the news cycle. For example, Popper says that the Theory of Evolution is not true science because it cannot be falsified. (He says the same for theories of Creationism, so young-earthers can't call on him for support.) But when a state legislature is determining that only actual science can appear in a science textbook, do you use Popper's definition of actual science, or some other definition?"

21,0415278449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51462656-wandi-suhendi,4,the philosophy of science and the falsification theories by Karl Raimund Popper
22,0415278449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15191353-cameron,3,"What more is to be said of this historical work? Popper does not waste time with a lead up to the significance of falsification in scientific discovery. However, to someone who has not studied logic before, it is not clear where he is coming from and whether his is a true discovery. Indeed, falsification is based on a logical rule of inference known from ancient times called modus tollens (MT) (P then Q; not Q, therefore not P). It highlights the asymmetry between verifiability and falsifiability, an asymmetry resulting from the logical form of universal statements. In other words, if the consequent of an argument is denied, then its antecedent is also denied. This is the logical gist of Popper's logic of scientific discovery. During the early decades of the 20th century, new scientific theories, especially those concerning relativity and quantum physics, necessitated a fundamental re-evaluation of reality and the logic of scientific reasoning. While science was becoming prestigious because its theories appeared to ""work"" and the fruits of science were there for all to see, the same theories were being dismantled as false. Early 20th-century science began to describe a world that was completely different from that described by 19th-century polymath scientists. Unlike their predecessors, practicing scientists during the early 20th century were less interested in philosophical explanations of their works than the successes of their discoveries. From the late 1950s, historians of science began to recognize that science was forwarding judgements that were actually interpretations, not essentially factual or logical. The ongoing logic of discovery in the scientific community amounted to something like the formal (post hoc) fallacy of affirming the consequent (P then Q, Q, therefore P); ""our results confirm that our theories are correct, do they not?"" Also, there were surely scenarios (perhaps still are) such as: ""we have new data from our new apparatus, let's see what hypothesis we can forward to account for it."" Enter Popper with his Logik der Forschung in 1935 (English translation: The Logic of Scientific Discovery, 1959). Although MT has been used since ancient times, Popper does not give any historical background to its practical applications and the uninformed reader could mistakenly presume that it was his own device. We know of MT at least from the time of Euclid ca. 300 BCE (e.g. Euclid's proof that there is no greatest prime number, where he began by assuming the contradiction). We also read of its applicability in the 13th century via Robert Grosseteste, who used falsification to supplement Aristotle's approach to hypotheses, specifically to support his hypothesis about the generation of the sun's heat.Without denying the importance of Popper's book at the time it appeared, with the benefit of hindsight it seems to be a reminder to practising scientists of logical ideas that are now rarely a feature of a scientific education. Personally I believe that Popper could have been much clearer and conveyed his ideas without being so rigidly formal. I am sure this reflects the changing times. For example, I found Chapter 8 (Probability) very confusing and lacking in perspective. What I have found more informative are more clearly written modern texts on the subject of logic itself. What a satisfying subject logic is in its own right and what better books we have today! Popper also satisfied me as to why parsimony is favourable in theories. It may seem obvious, but why should we favour Ockham's lex parsimoniae and why should we presume that nature be simple? According to Popper (p. 128), ""Simple statements, if knowledge is our object, are to be prized more highly than less simple ones because they tell us more; because their empirical content is greater; and because they are better testable."" Therefore, we may prefer parsimonious theories because they are more amenable to falsification. Instead of repeating generally founded accolades about Popper's The Logic, I have collected a series of further quotes that also inspire me:""My view may be expressed by saying that every discovery contains ‘an irrational element’, or ‘a creative intuition’, in Bergson’s sense. In a similar way Einstein speaks of the ‘search for those highly universal laws . . . from which a picture of the world can be obtained by pure deduction. There is no logical path’, he says, ‘leading to these . . . laws. They can only be reached by intuition, based upon something like an intellectual love (‘Einfühlung’) of the objects of experience.’ ""(pp. 8-9).""Strictly existential statements, by contrast, cannot be falsified. No singular statement (that is to say, no ‘basic statement’, no statement of an observed event) can contradict the existential statement, ‘There are white ravens’."" (p.48)""The asymmetry here described, with its consequence, the one-sided falsifiability of the universal statements of empirical science, may now perhaps seem less dubious than it did before (in section 6). We now see that no asymmetry of any purely logical relationship is involved. On the contrary, the logical relationships show symmetry. Universal and existential statements are constructed symmetrically. It is only the line drawn by our criterion of demarcation which produces anasymmetry."" (pp. 49-50). ""A clear appreciation of what may be gained (and lost) by conventionalist methods was expressed, a hundred years before Poincaré, by Black who wrote: ‘A nice adaptation of conditions will make almost any hypothesis agree with the phenomena. This will please the imagination but does not advance our knowledge.’"" (pp. 61-62)""The introduction of an auxiliary hypothesis should always be regarded as an attempt to construct a new system; and this new system should then always be judged on the issue of whether it would, if adopted, constitute a real advance in our knowledge of the world. ""(pp.62).""The statement, ‘Here is a glass of water’ cannot be verified by any observational experience. The reason is that the universals which appear in it cannot be correlated with any specific sense-experience.... Universals cannot be reduced to classes of experiences; they cannot be ‘constituted’."" (p76).""Science can be viewed from various standpoints, not only from that of epistemology; for example, we can look at it as a biological or as a sociological phenomenon. As such it might be described as a tool, or an instrument, comparable perhaps to some of our industrial machinery. Science may be regarded as a means of production—as the last word in 'roundabout production'... And even if we look at it as gratifying our intellectual needs, its connection with our experiences does not differ in principle from that of any other objective structure. ""(pp.81-82).""The inductive logician who believes that all science starts from stray elementary perceptionsmust be puzzled by such regular coincidences; they must seem to him entirely ‘accidental’. He is prevented from explaining regularity by theories, because he is committed to the view that theories are nothing but statements of regular coincidences. ""(p.89).""On the contrary, scientific method presupposes the immutability of natural processes, or the‘principle of the uniformity of nature’."" (p.250).""Thus if we try to turn our metaphysical faith in the uniformity of nature and in the verifiability of theories into a theory of knowledge based on inductive logic, we are left only with the choice between an infinite regress and apriorism. ""(p.252).""And although I believe that in the history of science it is always the theory and not the experiment, always the idea and not the observation, which opens up the way to new knowledge, I also believe that it is always the experiment which saves us from following a track that leads nowhere: which helps us out of the rut, and which challenges us to find a new way. ""(p.266).""We need not say that the theory is ‘false’, but we may say instead that it is contradicted by a certain set of accepted basic statements. ""(p.274).""Science is not a system of certain, or well-established, statements; nor is it a system which steadily advances towards a state of finality. Our science is not knowledge (episteme): it can never claim to have attained truth, or even a substitute for it, such as probability. ""(p.278).""The old scientific ideal of episteme—of absolutely certain, demonstrable knowledge—has proved to be an idol. The demand for scientific objectivity makes it inevitable that every scientific statement must remain tentative for ever. ""(p.280).""Science never pursues the illusory aim of making its answers final, or even probable.

23,0415278449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4532721-alexander-weber,3,"This book was hard to read, so I wanted to give it a 2/5 stars. However, it's important for introducing the idea of falsification as the benchmark for demarcating science against pseudoscience, even if today that stands on shaky ground (see Feyerabend, someone whose work I plan on reading next). And for that I wanted to give it a higher rating. So 3/5 it is.I found a LOT of the text in this book to be obscure, not only in its writing style, but also allusions and references which were probably more clear for anyone reading this 80 years ago than today. He gets his argument against induction out quickly, and introduces falsifiability as a replacement shortly thereafter. Great. I think that was all done in the first 10 pages. Then there is a slew of chapters and text that was way over my head and didn't seem all that interesting anyways.I liked the chapter on probability, even if it is a little outdated as well (for example, no mention of a Bayesian interpretation of probability). I've read that Popper later came to have a propensity interpretation of probability (yay C.S. Pierce!). Regardless, the whole interpretation of probability is interesting, and well worth the read here.The next chapter, on quantum mechanics, which is the second last chapter, was also pretty fun. Turns out Popper's experiment wasn't tested until 1999 (!), where, to their surprise, they found the results corroborated his predictions. However, turns out this doesn't mean what Popper thought it would mean... for reasons I'm not really familiar with. It all seems very interesting... but who has the time? I also think that this chapter may have inspired the Bell tests (?), which is sort of amazing. 2015 was a big year for these tests, as some folks from the Kavli Institute of Nanoscience say they performed a ""loop-hole free Bell test"" ... although even that statement probably isn't true (but close!)Anyways, fun book, but really obscure and boring for a LOT of it. I wish it had been written by someone like Richard Rorty, Daniel Dennett, or Ian Hacking. Although that's impossible, as they came after Popper.I don't recommend reading the full thing. Instead,  try this condensed version. text, but then read the full chapters on probability and quantum mechanics.I'll end this review with the last few paragraphs from the book:My investigation has traced the various consequences of the decisions and conventions—in particular of the criterion of demarcation—adopted at the beginning of this book. Looking back,we may now try to get a last comprehensive glimpse of the picture of science and of scientific discovery which has emerged. (What I have here in mind is not a picture of science as a biological phenomenon, as an instrument of adaptation, or as a roundabout method of production: I have in mind its epistemological aspects.) Science is not a system of certain, or well-established, statements; nor is it a system which steadily advances towards a state of finality. Our science is not knowledge (epistēmē): it can never claim to have attained truth, or even a substitute for it, such as probability. Yet science has more than mere biological survival value. It is not only a useful instrument. Although it can attain neither truth nor probability, the striving for knowledge and the search for truth are still thestrongest motives of scientific discovery.We do not know: we can only guess. And our guesses are guided by the unscientific, the metaphysical (though biologically explicable) faith in laws, in regularities which we can uncover—discover. Like Bacon, we might describe our own contemporary science—‘the method of rea-soning which men now ordinarily apply to nature’—as consisting of ‘anticipations, rash and premature’ and of ‘prejudices’.But these marvellously imaginative and bold conjectures or ‘anticipations’ of ours are carefully and soberly controlled by systematic tests. Once put forward, none of our ‘anticipations’ are dogmatically upheld. Our method of research is not to defend them, in order to prove how right we were. On the contrary, we try to overthrow them. Using all the weapons of our logical, mathematical, and technical armoury, we try to prove that our anticipations were false—in order to put forward, in their stead, new unjustified and unjustifiable anticipations, new ‘rash and premature prejudices’, as Bacon derisively called them.It is possible to interpret the ways of science more prosaically. One might say that progress can ‘. . . come about only in two ways: by gathering new perceptual experiences, and by better organizing those which are available already’. But this description of scientific progress, although not actually wrong, seems to miss the point. It is too reminiscent of Bacon’s induction: too suggestive of his industrious gathering of the ‘countless grapes, ripe and in season’, from which he expected the wine of science to flow: of his myth of a scientific method that starts from observation and experiment and then proceeds to theories. (This legendary method, by the way, still inspires some of the newer sciences which try to practice it because of the prevalent belief that it is the method of experimental physics.)The advance of science is not due to the fact that more and more perceptual experiences accumulate in the course of time. Nor is it due to the fact that we are making ever better use of our senses. Out of uninterpreted sense-experiences science cannot be distilled, no matter how industriously we gather and sort them. Bold ideas, unjustified anticipations, and speculative thought, are our only means for interpreting nature: our only organon, our only instrument, for grasping her. And we must hazard them to win our prize. Those among us who are unwilling to expose their ideas to the hazard of refutation do not take part in the scientific game.Even the careful and sober testing of our ideas by experience is in its turn inspired by ideas: experiment is planned action in which every step is guided by theory. We do not stumble upon our experiences, nor do we let them flow over us like a stream. Rather, we have to be active: we have to ‘make’ our experiences. It is we who always formulate the questions to be put to nature; it is we who try again and again to put these question so as to elicit a clear-cut ‘yes’ or ‘no’ (for nature doesnot give an answer unless pressed for it). And in the end, it is again we who give the answer; it is we ourselves who, after severe scrutiny, decide upon the answer to the question which we put to nature—after protracted and earnest attempts to elicit from her an unequivocal ‘no’.‘Once and for all’, says Weyl, with whom I fully agree, ‘I wish to record my unbounded admiration for the work of the experimenter in his struggle to wrest interpretable facts from an unyielding Nature who knows so well how to meet our theories with a decisive No—or with an inaudible Yes.’The old scientific ideal of epistēmē—of absolutely certain, demonstrable knowledge—has proved to be an idol. The demand for scientific objectivity makes it inevitable that every scientific statement must remain tentative for ever. It may indeed be corroborated, but every corroboration is relative to other statements which, again, are tentative. Only in our subjective experiences of conviction, in our subjective faith, can we be ‘absolutely certain’. With the idol of certainty (including that of degrees of imperfect certainty or probability) there falls one of the defences of obscurantism which bar the way of scientific advance. For the worship of this idol hampers not only the boldness of our questions, but also the rigour and the integrity of our tests. The wrong view of science betrays itself in the craving to be right; for it is not hispossession of knowledge, of irrefutable truth, that makes the man of science, but his persistent andrecklessly critical quest for truth. Has our attitude, then, to be one of resignation? Have we to say that science can fulfill only its biological task; that it can, at best, merely prove its mettle in practical applications which may corroborate it? Are its intellectual problems insoluble? I do not think so. Science never pursues the illusory aim of making its answers final, or even probable. Its advance is, rather, towards an infinite yet attainable aim: that of ever discovering new, deeper, and more general problems, and of subjecting our ever tentative answers to ever renewed and ever more rigorous tests."
24,0415278449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101555902-rosie,4,"Quality of the writing: 5Quality of the content/organisation/research: 5Impact on my perspective: 4Personal resonance: 1Rereading potential: 3Overall score: 4The reason I read it: Researching the classic philosophy of science texts. I'd also wanted to read it for a few years and was scared of not understanding it. The problem with reading books that you've known for ages you really should read and which seem to be referenced everywhere, but which you've been putting off because any time you open them you're confronted with a tangle of equations and nonce words, is that if you do ever manage to staple yourself to a chair and hack your way through them, they're usually really good. So then you commit to reading more classics, buy a bunch, and go through the same ordeal of guilt and duress. Anyway, The Logic of Scientific Discovery was one such book. I procrastinated reading it for ages, only to regret not having read it sooner. Popper's main premise is that induction (using specific statements to draw broad conclusions) is not a valid basis for science. Instead, science must use 'the deductive method of testing', which is based on falsification. A researcher puts forward a hypothesis. Then they do everything they can to disprove it. If they don't succeed and neither does anyone else, the hypothesis gets to stick around for the time being, like a virgin bride in a fairy tale who doesn't get murdered on her wedding night because she starts telling a fun story. Popper's most difficult and controversial take is that nothing is ever proven true, it just doesn't get falsified for the time being. We can't even say a theory is likely to be true. Researchers shouldn't try to preserve their ideas, they should try to kill them as hard as possible. For Popper, the way to define science is as the practice of falsifying hypotheses. Anyone doing anything else is not doing science. If a theory can't be proven false (e.g. psychoanalysis), it's pseudoscience. This is probably the best non-scientist lesson from the book: if you can't imagine a piece of evidence that would cause you to stop believing something, you're not being rational. Really, the world would be 50% better if we all stopped believing things we wouldn't ever stop believing. This took me the best part of a week to read. I wrestled with it, sweating, looking up half a dozen names or definitions per page. At a certain point, I feared I wouldn't be able to get more from it than the superficial summary of Popper's ideas I'd encountered in my pre-reading research. But, after the first reading, the pieces were all there in my mind. On the second reading, everything came together and a lot of things are clearer for having exposed myself to Popper's ideas. This book could be structured better. I don't find the arrangement of the chapters to be intuitive and there are two whole chapters that seemed irrelevant (no one ever seems to mention them in writing about this book, except to say they're irrelevant, so I think I'm right about that.) For a lay audience, most of the value is in the first 50–100 pages of the book. Interesting tidbits:-'If we ignore what other people are thinking, or have thought in the past, then rational discussion must come to an end, though each of us may go on happily talking to himself.'-'Now it is far from obvious, from a logical point of view, that we can be justified in inferring universal statements from singular ones, no matter how numerous; for any conclusion drawn in this way may always turn out to be false: no matter how many instances of white swans we have observed, this does not justify the conclusion that all swans are white.'-'I am inclined to think that scientific discovery is impossible without faith in ideas which are of a purely speculative kind, and sometimes even quite hazy; a faith which is completely unwarranted from the point of view of science, and which, to that extent, is 'metaphysical.''-'…a subjective experience, or a feeling of conviction, can never justify a scientific statement, and that within science it can play no part except that of an object of empirical (psychological) inquiry.''Scientific theories are perpetually changing. This is not due to mere chance but might well be expected, according to our characterization of empirical science.'-'Science can be viewed from various standpoints, not only from that of epistemology; for example, we can look at it as a biological or as a sociological phenomenon. As such it might be described as a tool, or an instrument, comparable perhaps to some of our industrial machinery. Science may be described as a means of production - as the last word in 'roundabout production.''- 'Science does not rest upon a solid bedrock. The bold structure of its theories rises, as it were, above a swamp. It is like a building erected on piles. The piles are driven down from above into the swamp, but not down to any natural or 'given' base; and if we stop driving the piles deeper, it is not because we have reached firm ground. We simply stop when we are satisfied that the piles are firm enough to carry the structure, at least for the time being.'"
25,0415278449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90945992-ben-chugg,4,"An appetizer to his more wide-ranging and substantial works, The Logic of Scientific Discovery illuminates Popper’s early thinking on knowledge, progress, and truth. While many of the core ideas in this work were later expanded and clarified, Popper’s clear and decisive thinking are still on display. Side-stepping useless arguments about the meaning of words, the “essence” of concepts, or whether there exists an ultimate logical foundation for everything, Popper argues that progress entails making bold conjectures and criticizing them as harshly as possible. In this way, only the best explanations are left standing. The most exciting contributions of the book are not actually the ideas he generates, but those he dismantles. Popper delivers mortal wounds to verificationism and inductivism—-the view that knowledge is generated by generalizing from past experience. Or at least, what should be recognized by everyone as mortal wounds … unfortunately, the inductivists have made a resurgence, largely in the form of Bayesianism. We get an introduction to Popper’s idea of content: the set of logical consequences of a statement. He demonstrates that theories with high content are the most valuable, which translates (counter-intuitively) to theories with low probability. If what we cared about was generating the most probable theories, we would go as little beyond the evidence as possible—-indeed, science would be reduced to uttering tautologies. Instead, of course, we want novel theories. We want explanations which posit different realities, the corroboration of refutation of which tells us ever more about the structure of the world. While I would not suggest that The Logic of Scientific Discovery be someone’s first introduction to Popper, it should certainly be read by everyone who has an interest in his work, and in the production of knowledge more generally."
26,0415278449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13269556-brian-powell,4,"The Logic of Scientific Discovery is Karl Popper's great work in which he lays out his thesis of deductivism -- a logical approach to science based on the falsification, rather than confirmation, of hypotheses. The act of confirming a hypothesis cannot be made deductively valid, because it commits the logical fallacy of affirming the consequent (if hypothesis H predicts observation O, it is incorrect to conclude that observing O implies the correctness of H). The act of falsification, on the other hand, can be made deductive via modus tollens: if H predicts O, then observing ~O (not O), we conclude ~H (not H, that H is wrong). This, quite simply, is the heart of Popper's philosophy. It is easy to understand this asymmetry between confirmation (or verifiability) and falsifiability. Scientific theories and laws generally take the form of universal statements. The problem of induction asserts that such universal statements can never be derived from singular statements, for example, upon observing several white swans, we are of course not logically justified in extending this property to all swans (nor can we search the whole universe to check). On the other hand, such universal statements can be contradicted by singular statements, for example, the claim that all swans are white can be refuted by the observation of only a single black swan -- ""consequently it is possible by means of purely deductive inferences (with the help of the modus tollens of classical logic) to argue from the truth of singular statements to the falsity of universal statements."" (p. 19) Popper's confidence in this realization encouraged him to promote falsification as the line of demarcation between science and pseudoscience: ""it must be possible for an empirical scientific system to be refuted by experience."" (p. 18) Objections to Popper's program tend to center around the perceived negativity associated with the act of falsification; call it a psychological aversion to refutation. More practically, the concern is that science is not about what doesn't work -- how can we hope to improve our knowledge of the world if we cannot confirm, or verify, scientific hypotheses? Shouldn't science be constructive, rather than destructive? How else are we supposed to establish scientific laws? Popper counters that our view as scientists should not be that our theories are correct, only that they aren't wrong. He believes in a relentless, vigorous assault on all hypotheses and scientific proposals with the hopes of striking down those that miss the mark; he envisions a sort of selection process in which the ""unfit' hypotheses are weeded out and the best ones selected by ""exposing them all to the fiercest struggle for survival"" (p. 20). So Popper does have some semblance of confirmation in mind -- he evidently associates it with the notion of fitness. Importantly, though, Popper views the cycle of conjecture and refutation as generative, as one that puts scientific hypotheses through a sort of optimization process in order to develop theories that, though ultimately incorrect, are the very best possible prototype of the truth: ""Theories are nets cast to catch what we call 'the world': to rationalize, to explain, to master it. We endeavor to make the mesh ever finer and finer."" The fitness of a theory is established through the process that Popper terms corroboration: ""A positive decision can only temporarily support a theory...but so long as the theory withstands severe tests and is not superseded by another theory, then we say it has been corroborated by past experience."" (p. 10) To corroborate a theory, it must withstand more extensive and rigorous testing than its competitors. In short, it must be more ""testable"", or equivalently, more ""falsifiable"". The reason testability is important is because it is logically related to the empirical content of the theory: ""the more a theory forbids, the more it says about the world of experience."" What this means is that theories with more universal or precise statements are more testable because there are more opportunities for a misstep, more places for them to go wrong. For those of us who have ever been torn between two competing explanatory models for a set of data, we might have relied on various heuristics of model complexity, like the number of free parameters or predictiveness of the model. These are precisely the ideas Popper has in mind when he advocates for empirical content. It is striking that the modern statistical basis of hypothesis testing and model selection was so accurately anticipated by Popper. Recall Salmon's suspsicion over Popper's process of corroboration, in particular, his assertion that Popper was smuggling in some induction in order to make ampliative statements about the world. Indeed, Popper's description of conjecture and refutation as a matter of life and death in the face of experiment, and the steady climb towards the fittest explanation of a given set of data must be ampliative. After all, the process of corroboration essentially optimizes the information content of passable theories. But is this induction? Popper would say, ""no"", but I believe this is a point that deserves considerable thought. Popper's ideas, if nothing else, have made it OK to accept that science is not about being certain, that, as scientists, all we can really be certain about is the inadequacy and ultimate imperfection of our theories. Karl Popper argued passionately and I think decisively that this is not the weakness but the hallmark, the unique power, of the scientific enterprise in comparison to other modes of inquiry. Indeed, ""...it is not his possession of knowledge, of irrefutable truth, that makes the man of science, but his persistent and recklessly critical quest for truth."""
27,0415278449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1924813-dan,3,"This is not for the general reader, even one particularly interested in philosophy or science, as am I. It addresses the philosophy of science in a manner similar to Wittgenstein's later characterization of his ""Philosophical Investigations"" as his attempts to untangle various confusions besetting discourse in that field.Popper's tools are largely formalizations of scientific process and interpretation. This tends to give it somewhat the flavor of Whitehead's ""Principia Mathematica"", with some of its same advantages and disadvantages. With the advantage of formal exactitude comes the disadvantage (to the general reader) of having to deal with set theory, propositional logic, math and numbing precision about words. Also it seems that the more highly formalized is a system, the less interesting (even to philosophers and mathematicians) it comes to be, except as it may resolve major entanglements. Has anyone ever opened the ""Principia"" for help in solving a physics problem?Fortunately, Popper does some untangling in a few interesting areas. For one, he demonstrates the supreme scientific importance, in a universal theory, of its falsifiability, and he shows the illogic of trying to formally prove any such theory. He shows also that it is not logical to assign a formal probability to the truth of a universal theory, even though some assessment can be made based on how easily a theory might be falsified and on how rigorous have been attempts at falsification.Popper also emphasizes the importance of forming (falsifiable) hypotheses, quoting Novalis: ""Hypotheses are nets; only he who casts catches"". He concludes that there can be no formal process of generating them.Popper also shows that (hypothesis aside) true induction in scientific analysis is an illusion and is in fact, where useful, deductive (mathematical induction notwithstanding; it is tautological).I agree with Popper in so far as I follow him, but I sense that his major contributions here have already been accepted and entrained within current philosophy of science, making his arguments here primarily of historical importance today. He published originally in 1939, rewrote the book in English and re-published in 1959, and has added multiple and extensive appendices. He discusses therein (among many other things) the Einstein Podolsky Rosen paradox, obviously without mention of John Stewart Bell's 1964 paper and its relation, if any, to some of Popper's suggestions about entanglement.A philosopher of science who has not read this book, if there be one, will want to add a star or two both for her greater appreciation of the formal arguments and for the historical aspects of interest."
28,0415278449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19055948-steve-dewey,2,"Umm, how do I review a book like this? I can't say I ""enjoyed"" it. It's not a book for enjoying. And it's a book I could understand better with several readings -- however, as I'm not an academic by day, and have many other things to read, I will never read it many more times. There are also parts of it I will never understand without a more thorough grounding in mathematical logic or propositional logic. In the end I skipped whole sections of the book that were going in one eye and out of the other.I read the book because I've had, since student days, an interest in the philosophy of science, and Popper is seminal. I'd read Popper second-hand through other authors, but felt the need to approach him directly. The first part of the book is interesting, and lays out the issues with induction and his ideas about falsification clearly enough. There were two serious problems, however -- at least for me. The first is the aforementioned maths. About halfway through the book, Popper begins to deal with problems around probability (quantum mechanics relies on it, and it is tied into induction), and he attempts to prove many things about probability that I couldn't follow. Secondly, the edition was a later edition that had been revisited and edited by Popper. Where Popper had changed his mind on a subject since the first edition, rather than rewrite the book, he added footnotes, or appendixes. Sometimes there are footnotes to footnotes. This made the book disjointed for me - following an argument and worrying about whether I should read a footnote now or later, or wondering whether the argument I was trying to follow was about to be interrupted by a footnote telling me the argument was now wrong, were not conducive to easy reading.This footnoting of footnotes, this revisiting of arguments, was another reason I skipped the maths chapters. I began to worry, given the number of footnotes, that the logic-based arguments were completely wrong even after extensive footnoting. I knew through previous reading that there are arguments against Popper's philosophy of science; I was not, however, aware of his efforts in creating a philosophical underpinning of the utility of probability in science. So i have recently skimmed the Web looking for articles about Popper and probability, and it seems I was right to be wary.So... an important book, and. if you are interested in these topics, well worth reading, but perhaps only the early chapters. It is certainly not, however, an easy read, an easy ride, or even an engaging read."
29,0415278449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31833834-alexander-smith,3,"This book has been said to be one of the modern fundamentals of philosophy of science. Seeing as the logic of this book has been considered an adoration of social and natural scientists alike, I felt a moral obligation to read it. Upon completion, in short, I thought Popper make a few very clear and solid points (largely in Part I), however they were not without faults of social, behavioral ignorance of scientists.This book is very approachable and science friendly. It's no wonder scientists love this book. It easily justifies fallibility in the face of a formerly 'scientific induction-heavy' epidemiological view. It was very easy, in some ways, for scientists to simply switch their statements from ""Point A must be true as we could not prove point A false,"" to ""Point A still stands a potentially useful theory upon empirical evidence."" This book reads to the scientists as a scientific ethics book on how to present the scientific discipline. However, it is a very simple theory that Popper does try to make more complex with examples of ""dimensions of basis"" and ""dimensions of falsifiers"" among other ideas that largely were loosely constructed, and not very meaningful. To put it in a Popperian epistemology, the class of the axiometric basis greatly outstripped the class of falsifiers.If anyone has read any other thought on epistemology thereafter would note that much of what Popper claims is the empirical scientist's job is in fact much more time consuming than the average scientist would be willing to put forth. Such a point requires a social dimension to discovering the meanings of scientific developments."
30,0415278449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3291681-cris,4,"An elegant although highly idealistic response to Hume's problem of induction. Popper is interested in reclaiming the objectivity of science, and while it's not obvious he succeeds, he writes with great conversational clarity, which makes this an exhilarating and unexpectedly fast read. Basic knowledge about Hume, Kant, Newton, Einstein, 20th century Positivism (Note: Popper is not a fan of positivism) would be helpful when first approaching this, but even though the book's arguments can get dense and complex, it's very easy to follow the thread that runs through each chapter; anyone can (and should!) read this. If you want to understand problems of demarcation (what is scientific and what is un-scientific?), the problem of the growth of knowledge (what makes science peculiar in this regard? why is science so fertile?), and Popper's famous epistemology of falsification, then The Logic of Scientific Discovery should be on your radar. With that being said, Kuhn's ""The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"" is a superior reading of science as it is. The Logic of Scientific Discovery is more concerned with revolutionary science than with normal science."
31,0415278449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8703029-pete,4,"The middle section is too technical for me. I am reading a book on logic in the hope it might help me. It is worth sticking with as popper sums everything up well at the end. i knew the ideas, but had forgotten them in my work. the belief in induction is still very prevalent among young scientists who feels constrained by the feeling that they cannot speculate about things and that science is a dry subject that progresses in small incremental steps devoid of wonder and imagination. for popper science is darwinian and the myth of induction is like Lamarckism. some key counter intuitive points:1)the statement which is less well testable is the one which is logically more probable (very different meaning to ""the probability that the statement is true""!). 2) a logically improbable statement is one that is the most testable3) induction cannot determine the degree of probability of the truth of a statement"
32,0415278449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64256337-laurent-dv,3,"Good presentation of Popper's deductive science theory that avoid the problem of induction and solve the problem of demarcation. We can only know definitively (in a scientifically way) that a theory is false (or falsified) and that something exist. By bringing together these two elements, one can have Popper's scientific method. We can never know for sure that an strict universal statement is real but we can falsify for good it with existential statements. So the point is this : we use existential (or non existensial) concepts that contradict a theory to falsify this theory. Still the chapters on his probability theory and his application of falsification to quantum theory are difficult to read for the lay person (I didn't understand much about it). But everyone can read all the chapters preceeding these two and the late chapter : it is largely sufficient to grasp Popper's idea.I read the book in french but I found translation very annoying and heavy compared to the english one. "
33,0415278449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14734538-roberto-rigolin-f-lopes,5,"We are in 1934, Popper is remembering us that when a scientist finishes writing down a theory the community starts a race to falsify the theory so to find progress. In a sort of recursion, Popper starts with the hypothesis that a good theory is therefore a theory that can be falsified. This subtle focus on falsification allows us to demarc what is in the realms of science and what is superstition (works in hindsight). Brillant. Guess what he does as soon he finishes writing down his theory? Yes, he goes about trying to falsify it comparing with conflicting theories. He is deeply influenced by quantum mechanics engaging in a long discussion around probability and logic to construct adventurous theories (his own definition). Takeaway: was pleasing see a philosopher using precise terms and simple language. "
34,0415278449,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4246240-fil-krynicki,0,"I must admit, I gave up 25% through Karl Popper's formulation of probability theory. It seemed to be retreading a great deal of ground quite slowly. I don't doubt that there is value there, but I am perhaps not so interested in a logically-based theory of probability as I supposed. I hope to return to this, some day, if only to read his thoughts of the decideability of probablity statements, which was that which motivated me to foray beyond falsification in the first place.The core tenet of falsification as a criteria for hypothesis evaluation was a good one, and something I shall keep in my back pocket in the future. I do get the feeling that I failed this book, but I do not know where to place the blame."

When you hear scientists refer to Popper they are referring to this book.He also delves into the thinking behind probability theory and interestingly questions some of the fundamental assumptions there, and then goes on to apply those ideas to quantum physics and questioning some of the fundamental thinking there. I don't know enough about quantum to be sure but if Popper is right then it might make it simpler to understand."

But this what I got: In short, you do not seek to prove a hypothesis right, you must prove it wrong instead. Falsifiability, the method develop by him, distinguishes Science from Pseudo-Science; its the foundation of modern experimental sciences. That way, Freud and psychology is pseudo-science since his observations only confirm his theories by looking back, whereas Einstein is genuine science since he predicts the future by means of falsifiability. I will get back to it later... "

Of particular note, of course, based on the conversations about Popper's work, is his discussion of how a scientific theory must be falsifiable if it is to be truly scientific. Unfortunately, I think that his detractors have focused on their disagreement with this principle and failed to follow his argument through to its end. I think that any non-scientist who is interested how modern science is moved forward and has read Kuhn's landmark work on The Structure of Scientific Revolutions might benefit from reading Popper, too."

The basic concept is falsification, which in my understanding is theory cannot be proved but only can be found that its wrong. How to apply this in real science activity is I don't know. In reality, its more complicated than that, but as an effort to have a universal approach to science is worthed. In the beginning, I am motivated to see the dead philosopher that he mentions from Plato to Kant, however more and more pages I feel that this is more a math philosophy."
