0,0060889659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2735247-katherine,1,"This is a prime example of the problems with science books written for a lay audience. The author regularly presents hypotheses/hunches than he believes as if they're well-supported by scienceI picked this book up because it spent time on my field of study, infectious disease. The first chapter was okay, but then it just went downhill from there. The type 1 diabetes chapter that posits that it aids in survival in a cold climate is laughably implausible. Moalem states that ""some scientists"" believe that type 1 diabetes is autoimmune. One would be hard pressed to find a biologist who does not think that T1D is autoimmune, the evidence is just that strong. T1D occurs in people with certain alleles of the HLA gene. These genes are involved in the immune response; immune-related genes tend to become more diverse quickly, so it's unlikely that these HLA haplotypes are present in modern humans because they improved survival in the cold 12,000 years ago. Also, there is the point that untreated, type 1 diabetes is fatal very quickly. Before Insulin was developed, the only way to keep these patients alive was through an extreme starvation diet.There are also a lot of sloppy mistakes such as the mix up of virus and bacterium (possibly an editing error?) and the use of the term gene when ""allele"" is correct -- it's not that hard to explain the difference.My other main complaint is the reliance on speculative sources rather than sources where someone has done the actual experiments and gotten actual results one way or the other."
1,0060889659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12689701-travis,3,"It was not a bad book and it was a quick read, but I was a little disappointed for two reasons.The first, not the authors fault, is that I didn't learn much new -- the general principles and ideas the author was articulating about biology, genetics, and evolution, were not really new to me, although some of his examples were new.The second was that I thought the author was playing a little too loose with facts. Even though the target audience was a popular audience, I don't think that is an excuse to make points that sound like certainties that are not. An example is his claim about sunglasses affecting the body's ability to protect against sunburn. It sounded plausible, but my own further reading on his claim shows that there is very little evidence to support it (in fact, it was really just speculation). In other cases, the author would go on about a particular hypothesis, and only just throw in at the end that, oh yea, scientists don't really know if this is true.In short, if you're not familiar with a lot of the latest research in evolution and genetics, the book may be an interesting read for you, just be careful not to give too much credence to any particular hypothesis expressed in the book."

Everything out there is influencing everything else. Dancing and consuming with my eyes/ears Moalem’s Survival of the Sickest: A Medical Maverick Discovers Why We Need Disease was not as fluid yet intrigued me as how the human species adapts to the environment. A common disease does have an etiologic relationship to the cold, and such is Diabetes he states. Erudition via the way streptococcus has molecular mimicry and are invaders to the body. Voles are a paradigm as to the predictive and adaptive response of babies born into good environments or volatile ones---in-vitro maternal response.“...in 1397 the plague begins it march across Europe. People who have the hemochromatosis mutation are especially resistant to infection because of their iron starved macrophages…though it will kill them decades later.”---Sharon Moalem, MD, PhDAccording to Moalem, hemochromatosis protected people from the plague. Our relationship to disease is more complex than previously realized. Cadence of this book is not such that I accustomed to as---perhaps being weaned on Gawande and Marsh imparts a Zeiss-like lens and a lofty end point or outcome only genius can achieve. Writing is not scientifically slanted and more appropriate for a common audience. In brief this implies that jargon is a rare animal and not found within. Presentation is one that delights the common reader with monosyllabic treasures. If a gumbo pot from worms to diseases and jumping genes sounds engaging, then this is a read for you. "
3,0060889659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/765208-chris-keefe,4,"Very good.As I wrote to Dr. Moalem,Dear Dr. Moalem,I found your book, Survival of the Sickest, on a table in the bookstore that employs me. The title and concept intrigued me. The material has proved fascinating, and, for the large part, very well researched. I am concerned, though, with a statement you make on page 87, regarding psoralen production in organically grown celery. It reads, Farmers who use synthetic pesticides, while creating a whole host of other problems, are essentially protecting plants from attack. Organic farmers don’t use synthetic pesticides. So that means organic celery farmers are leaving their growing stalks vulnerable to attack by insects and fungi – and when those stalks are inevitably munched on, they respond by producing massive amounts of psoralen. By keeping poison off the plant, the organic celery farmer is all but guaranteeing a biological process that will end with lots of poison in the plant. Within these few sentences, whether by intent or by oversight, you perpetuate a very dangerous fallacy. Your subtext implies that organic farmers, because they choose not to use synthetic pesticides, fungicides, etc, are in some way failing to protect their plants, and in turn the consumers of their foods. The crucial word here is “synthetic.” Even glancing research into the nature of organic farming will yield a wealth of information on natural pest control. For example, using companion planting (e.g. garlic and marigolds protect crops planted near them), natural pest-prevention methods (e.g. ladybugs to manage aphids), and perhaps most importantly, effective crop rotations and management strategies, effective organic farmers are often capable of creating an environment or ecosystem that is simply less accessible to animal, fungal, and even microbial predators. With proper management, the system protects itself without the need for synthetic help.  You might be interested to know that genetics play a strong hand here as well. Plant species, like the marigold, that have developed natural defenses have greatly multiplied their species’ success by harnessing the help of human agriculturalists. The flower helps the garden, the gardener breeds the flower. In the same way, the growth of corn provides structure for the growth of beans, and shade for the growth of squash. The beans fix nitrogen in the soil for use by the other plants, and the squash provides ground cover which minimizes weed growth. By carefully selecting the plants and animals he cultivates, and thereby manipulating the ecosystem he manages, an organic farmer uses naturally occurring genetic predispositions, in diet, toxicology, and even plant structure to the benefit of all of the partners in the system.On the other side of things, conventional industrial monocropping, and, admittedly, most organic industrial agriculture, bring their own inherent dangers to bear on the celery plant. Machine weeding, machine spraying, machine fertilization, and machine harvest, not to mention preparation, packaging, storage, and shipping, all tend to batter the plants. It is rare that I see conventionally grown, bagged, and shipped lettuce at my local supermarket without a chunk or two taken out of it somewhere during it’s trip from seed to shelf. I would hazard a guess (admittedly, an uneducated one) that at least the pre-mortem processes listed here drive psoralen production as strongly as the odd bug bite does.In looking through your notes and cited sources, your citations of two papers discussing adverse reactions to celery (with exposure to UV radiation) did catch my eye. Admittedly, I was not able to track down the second of the two articles. Unless its title fails to disclose its focus, though, it does not appear to concern itself with the “organic versus conventional” debate you spark with the throwaway comment quoted above. My apologies if my own failure to read your cited sources has provoked unmerited criticism, but your careless choice of words, and/or your failure to provide discussion of psoralen levels in organic and conventional produce lead me to find your “celery comment” reactionary, at best.Please, Dr. Moalem, take a deeper look into the subtext of your statement above before you decide to publish the next edition of your book. Even if there were data that implied higher psoralen levels in some organic celeries, your writing goes beyond this in discrediting the work of organic growers. You equate the use of highly toxic, environmentally and politically unsustainable synthetic pesticides with pest control. You then equate the use of any other system with a failure in pest control. To quote, “Organic farmers don’t use synthetic pesticides. So that means organic celery farmers are leaving their growing stalks vulnerable to attack by insects and fungi”.(Moalem 87,my italics) The logical fallacy here is one produced by not taking into account all of the variables present. You left this out: Organic farmers use effective alternative systems for managing environmental stresses on their plants. Please, as a published expert, and as a future medical doctor, do not let a lack of research, or an unqualified judgement like that quoted above, turn good reporting into dangerous, normative spin. And otherwise, thank you for your book. It was a wonderful read.Sincerely,Christopher Keefe"
4,0060889659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1258248-chris,1,"Many APBio teachers assign this as summer reading, so I had been looking forward to reading it. I HATED this book. I was reading it on vacation and had to set it aside because it made me so angry. This is my attempt to explain why without sounding like a ranting lunatic.1. The author was a terrible writer. Even with a co-author this book was fragmented, disorganized, and packed with clunky metaphors.2. Unable to engage the reader using his literary skills, he resorted to sensationalism. The chapters were packed with exciting fringe theories and the contradicting evidence was presented in passing, if at all. Most readers would probably leave the book with some crippling misconceptions about evolution and natural selection. 3. It was self-promoting. The author (sorry, the ""medical maverick"") had one or two interesting findings that had been published in mid-tier scientific journals. He then added on additional theories and research, without being clear in the text (he did have endnotes) that the findings were not his. It seemed like the point of the book was to establish himself as a talking head rather than to inform the reader. At the time of writing he was represented by William Morris. He then went on to shill biotech companies.I think that many readers still place excessive trust in authors with ""Dr."" in front of their name, and I really HATE it when authors abuse this trust."
5,0060889659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8678116-muhammed-hebala,5,"This is a book which is simply incredible and super entertaining .It amazes me that human beings can live through such huge changesIt talked about how specific common diseases and conditions (like diabetes and high cholesterol) actually may have been naturally selected because they provided an adaptive advantage in a particular environment.Hemochromatosis may have helped Europeans to survive the black Death ,andDiabetes may have been there evolutionary solution to avoid freezing inthe ice age, And Favism was our weapon against Malaria.I enjoyed reading about diseases, genetics, immunity, Epigenetics and history.This is a fascinating read and a wonderfully-written book .Very enlightening!==========================Attention undoubtedly will be centered on the genome, withgreater appreciation of its significance as a highly sensitiveorgan of the cell that monitors genomic activities and correctscommon errors, senses unusual and unexpected events, andresponds to them, often by restructuring the genome._________________________Where there is folklore smoke, there is medical fire."
6,0060889659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1104532-thomas,5,"A slick production this is. The musical transitions are snappy and the narrator converts what might have been prosaic pitfalls to satisfying conversational tidbits. Yes, the book has sentences like, ""Compromises, compromises."" Probably, some readers will find the tone condescending. Even worse, some readers will feel they have read everything before. So why did I rate this book so highly? This is a wonderful book because it ties together disparate facts from the world of modern biology. Books like Why do Men Fall Asleep After Sex ask and answer similar questions, but they lack the cohesive theory behind Survival of the Sickest. Furthermore, almost all readers will find something new, although it may be sketchy. For instance, do you know why humans are hairless? Why Lamarckism is a misleading term? What frogs and Norwegians have in common? One last comment, since I have no better location for it. The book suggests that high stress and low life expectancy increases the chance that a woman will give birth to a daughter, while great expectations increase the chance of a son. If only King Henry the Eighth had known, he might have adopted another strategy. "
7,0060889659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1106803-kevin-denham,4,"Marketing looked like a complete ripoff of Freakonomics. Style reads like Freakonomics with a personal health/medicine spin. Too boldly mixes well accepted medical observations: Sickle Cell Anemia is related to genes that provide resistance to Malaria. Get one you're good, get two you're screwed.With absolutely left field speculation: African-Americans have high incidents of hypertension and heart disease due to a artificial selectional pressure exerted on them by their ancestors' passage across the Atlantic during the slave trade. Being given very small rations of water created a selectional pressure for those that could retain salt, thereby retaining water and surviving. Seems to make logical sense but there is nothing to back this up."
8,0060889659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4481148-sue,4,"It's science -- made simple! I got to indulge my inner geek without having to overexert my brain cells. (Well, okay, I did have to read a couple of pages over again to get it, but hey, I was really, really tired that night.) Seriously, I was fascinated by the subject matter -- the interplay of genetics and disease -- and the writing style was wonderfully accessible to the lay reader. If I had read this book in high school (which would have been impossible, since these discoveries hadn't been made yet), I would have a different career today. Yes, I found it THAT interesting.In a nutshell, the disease that runs up your medical bills today may be the very disease that saved your ancestors long enough to reproduce, and consequently, contribute to your existence. For example, because I know my genetics (I told you I have an inner geek), I know that I am a carrier for a disease that, over time, causes too much iron to accumulate in major body organs. (Don't worry about me, I'm only a carrier -- I'm fine.) What I didn't know is this: the fact that I have this gene means my ancestors -- at least some of them -- must have survived the Black Death that swept across Europe in the Middle Ages, because having this gene makes one more resistant to the bubonic bad guys. (So if the plague makes a reappearance, I'm good!)If you found that last tidbit interesting, then you will like this book. And if you want to feel hopeful for your grandchildren's future, reflect on this: the day is coming when the drugs you are given for the things that ail you will be individually created just for you and your genotype, increasing the odds that they will be swift and effective. And that's just downright amazing!  "
9,0060889659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1223953-natasha,3,"The interconnectedness between disease and certain populations of individuals is extremely interesting and the writing in this book is very entertaining. However, I was bothered by the author's arrogance. It was almost distracting while reading -- the subtitle says it all...""A Medical Maverick Discovers..."". ""Medical Maverick"" is a bold statement when really, the author did a bunch of research and none of his own experiments (or if he did, that wasn't clear from reading the book). And ""discovered"" implies he came across something no one else knew, when in reality, he took a bunch of concepts that other people figured out and combined those ideas into an entertaining and well-written book.If you have even a basic understanding of biology, you'll get along with this book fine. If you can ignore other people's boasting, you'll get along with it even better. While I do happen to be sensitive to the author's attitude, I do recommend reading this book if you have even a passing interest in why we get sick."
10,0060889659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2613975-phair,5, This was the most interesting book I've read in a long time. I liked the breezy style- kind of 'popular science' approach. Covered a wide variety of diseases & conditions and the genetic & environmental reasons they have remained in the human gene pool. Background on how much of the human make-up is really not human at all but largely viruses in a symbiotic relationship was creepy but interesting. Very cool book. Read again in '08 for f2f discussion group.
11,0060889659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1227039-chris,5,"This book is one of the best books I've ever read. I learned so much and have recommended it to so many people (and have given it as gifts). I learned things I would have never known...so many pieces came together in this book. I would suggest it to anyone who needs a break from their ""novel"" reading. Switch it up and read this book. You'll be glad you did!"
12,0060889659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1402401-randy,2,"I suppose I judged this book by it's cover, making it a little disappointing when I read it. The author also goes off on some random tangents that I found distracting. That being said, there were some interesting parts -- particularly the discussion of how many genetic diseases are with us because they offered a survival benefit to our ancestors."
13,0060889659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/128497-mark,3,"I wish Moalem would have taught my Genetics 101 class, he did a much better job than my professor. This is definitely more of a book to make you ooh and ahh, which is to say that its not very scientific.Moalem would be shot dead by anyone who believed in logic. The man seems to love a good conspiracy, and he's great at telling them. I'm not saying that he's wrong all the time, but the way that this book could be written, in a less persuasive way, would be:There's a 20% chance that A is true; A is true. That A leads to B is possible with a 12% confidence. B is true. A+B = C, with 4% confidence, but, well, we're already this far!, C must be true as well! And so on, down the alphabet. I gave up being annoyed just because the stories were actually really Scientific American!Turn your brains off for this one, and enjoy. It's for the masses, not for science."
14,0060889659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46878-james,2," The thesis sounds interesting, but the author doesn't provide very many examples, and for those he does, the evidence is speculative at best. Do people have diabetes today because it ""may"" have helped during the ice age? Prove it. While he tries to explain the past, he offers no ideas as to how things may change now that the ice age is over and plague is rare. He cites his sources, but if you check them out, many turn out to be ordinary newspapers like US Today. These are not valid sources of scientific discovery/information.He reminds me of Susan Faludy in that style of ""research"". The author has a smart-alecky style of writing at times that makes me think he's writing for a 12 year old audience. There are better books on evolution and medicine."
15,0060889659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1091987-erin,5,"One of the best books I've ever read. Not only do the authors have a thoroughly entertaining writing style, they seriously expanded my understanding of evolution on both a macro and micro level. If I were back in college, this book might have inspired me to switch majors!"
16,0060889659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30828885-laurent,2,"The primary purpose of Moalem's work is to explore our physiology and its relationship to the world around us; its overarching message? Never to stop questioning.This is a noble message, and one that we must all take to heart in everything that we do. Sadly, it is also something that the reader must keep in mind, almost at every turn, while reading the book itself. Moalem's lack of transparency regarding the factual emptiness of his ambitious conjectures is staggering. Only in the last chapter does it become clear that the book relies on a series of mere guesses and 'what ifs,' none of which can, as of yet, be backed with factual information. Furthermore, the book itself seems to follow no identifiable path: it flits from one topic to another, disappointingly failing to explain why we 'need' disease, as it advertises on its cover. As a post-script I would add that, in fact, several of the theories advanced in this book have been refuted by the scientific community, most significantly his speculation that Type 1 Diabetes has developed in humans as a result of the rapid onset of the last known ice age. In short, a trivially interesting read for a layman, but by no means satisfying, enlightening or thoroughly composed. "
17,0060889659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6506088-elyse,3,"One of the most interesting things I learned in this book is that, like a toaster, humans have planned obsolescence. Toaster manufacturers want to sell new toasters and Mother Nature wants new people at a fast clip to replace old people full of disease who can no longer reproduce. I always thought people just got worn out and died. Not so - our DNA is programmed to make us die. This book is full of ""fun"" facts like this. The author is enthusiastic about life and his interests. The only slight negative is that he toots his own horn a bit too much for me. He has interesting things to say and gives credit to those who first introduced the ideas he describes."
18,0060889659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6424859-dominic-carlin,1,"Look, you don't need to read much of this to say it's crap. The writing is crap and the end of every section/chapter seems to sign off with a pithy comment. The author has 'Dr' in front of their name on the front cover, which should have raised alarm bells long ago. And the science/medicine is speculative at best. This could have been a half-decent New Scientist article, it didn't need much more than that. -Dr Baby Hamster PhD"

A little wordy or slow at times, but an informative, engaging read. "

23,0060889659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"This book was EXCELLENT! Despite being written in 2007, this book is as up to date as any book about evolution. In fact, it's even better than his 2014 book Inheritance. If you are tired of reading books that work very hard to preserve the image of the selfish gene and are looking for a book that celebrates the newer information researchers have gained since the 1970s, I highly recommend reading this. Geneticist Sharon Moalem examines the role that jumping genes, parasites and viruses, and epigenetic modification play in evolution. Currently there is a battle raging in academia about whether or not to update the ""Modern Synthesis of Evolution,"" put forward in 1942 by Julian Huxley and supported by Dawkins' work in the 1970s and beyond. Dawkins and his crowd have worked hard to attack anyone who works to update this synthesis with the myriad data that have poured in since his time in the spotlight, which is a shame because the work on this front is mindblowingly good! The field of evolution research needed this book. Helping to get this information to the masses is extremely important if there is any hope for a paradigm shift to a more accurate, updated, and complete understanding of how evolution works. This book will go a long way to helping that shift occur. Unfortunately, this book makes no mention of one of the researchers who fought the hardest to bring awareness of epigenetic modification to the public. Her name is Eva Jablonka, and Moalem should have mentioned her, but even with that oversight, this book was truly great! Moalem covered McClintock's jumping genes in wonderful detail (better than almost anything I have read to date). These little genes provide a lot of diversity and are the descendants of amazingly clever viruses. He also covered work by Luis P. Villarreal that is extremely current. Villarreal's ideas took some time to catch on. He proposes that viruses work to add diversity to DNA. If DNA were slowly mutated over time, we would not see the change we do. Villarreal's work shows how viruses act like software that add novel instructions to the DNA's more rigid and fixed code. Since this book was written in 2007, you might want to watch Villarreal's more recent talk. Here is the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amWRu...Moalem also looked at hypermutations in e. Coli. In many experiments (still controversial today), researchers have found that jumping genes as well as regular genes seem to respond to environmental factors and can order up a faster mutation rate or increased need for genes to jump and fix a problem. Very exciting to think about! He also covered various epigenetic modifications of genes. Each subject is written about in an easy to understand and extremely entertaining manner. I can't think of a better book to introduce people to what will undoubtedly be the new modern synthesis of evolution. "
24,0060889659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14919045-s-prakash,4,"This book essentially discusses about the bad genes which are responsible for the life threatening /debilitating diseases like hemochromatosis, diabetes, malaria etc. In the first instance what circumstances have led to these genes to originate, was there an exigent purpose for this? Numerous examples of the origin of many of such bad genes have been explained in detail. One of them is that the advent of ice age has initiated a mutation which rose the sugar levels to enable the blood not to freeze during the extended periods of extreme colds. This has helped the human race weather the extremity and survive. Thus the bottom line is that every bad gene which got evolved had a noble purpose of helping the human race survive. For, the ultimate purpose of any species is to SURVIVE and REPRODUCE.The book poses many “Why’s” with respect to evolution of the human race and answers them with a sound logic. Some of the Why’s are…..Why do so many Europeans inherit a genetic disorder that fills their organs with Iron?Why do the majority of the people with type 1 diabetes come from Northern Europe?Why does malaria want us in bed but the common cold want us at work?Why do we have so much DNA that doesn’t seem to do anything?The second question of course, is, “what can we do with that?”What can we do with the idea that hemochromatosis protected from the plague?What can we do with the possibility that diabetes was an adaptation to the last ice age?What does it mean for me to understand that malaria wants me laid up and the cold wants me on the move to help them each spread?And what does it mean that we have all this genetic code that probably came from viruses and sometime jumps around our genome?Quite an interesting read for the inquisitive and for those who are inclined to take up medical professions."

The author does make a lot of surprising arguments, which inspired some Deep Thoughts, but the justifications didn't often feel complete. For one thing, he makes some points with very little supporting evidence: ""In the mid-1990s an Argentinian pediatrician reported that three healthy women all gave birth to children who had neural tube defects after using indoor tanning beds during their pregnancies. Coincidence? Probably not."" This wouldn't fly in an undergraduate lab assignment, so why should it fly in a published book? I was also concerned by the author's over-simplification of physiological concepts that I know to be extremely complex and interconnected. Considering my own experiences as a science student: explanations that seem to follow logically are nearly always more involved and interwoven than they at first appear. ...Regardless, I did use this book as a reference on a lab report..."
26,0060889659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/282403-laura,5,"This is a fascinating read. Reminds me of _Freakonomics_ in that both authors don't take ""accepted wisdom"" for granted. Instead, they investigate the situation with fresh eyes.Moalem and his colleagues have found that many of the genes that make us prone to long-term illnesses ALSO protect us from deadly acute ones. For example, the gene that makes us prone to Alzheimer's also protects us from bubonic plague.Moalem also address an issue that has long annoyed me about evolutionary biology. From what I've read and heard to date, evolutionary biologists assume that we humans are virtually identical to our ""caveman"" ancestors. This makes no sense to me, given how many generations have elapsed in that time, and how rapidly bacteria and viruses can become drug-resistant. Moalem notes that the genes of populations under pressure will keep trying to find a successful adaptation -- during one lifetime -- and then will pass that new adaptation to the offspring. In other words, evolution is both rapid and slow, depending on the environmental pressures involved."
27,0060889659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3115449-nina,3,"Lots of fun little biology tidbits. I especially liked his possible explanation for why some people (like me) have autosomal dominant compelling helioopthalmic outburst syndrome (aka ACHOO), which compels them to sneeze when they go outside on a sunny day or are exposed to bright light. This likely evolved to help clear molds and microbes from the airways of our ancestors as they exited their caves. Similar reasons are provided for lots of other disorders, diseases, and biological traits, indicating why something as harmful to us as diabetes in modern industrial society helped our ancestors survive in the harsher climate of the Younger Dryas.Though I enjoyed reading the book and highly recommend it, much of what was included seemed more speculative than factual and should probably be taken with a grain of salt. Also, it is definitely aimed more at the lay audience than at scientists working in the various disciplines described and therefore lacks depth. Still, it's a fun little book and a quick and easy read."
28,0060889659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46048976-blake-hanley,4,"I enjoyed this book. Hopefully this will help me with ap bio. As it talked about how evolution and natural selection worked. Like the people who survived in extreme cold conditions and that resulted in some people with a natural tendency to have diabetes descend from people from the younger dryas. My favorite topic that he went over was chap 5 Of microbes and men. This explains how they came up with the rod of Asclepius. This also explained how the folklore of werewolves came about and how you could combat some diseases. Although I enjoyed the book and information it contains, it's not the best written. Talking about unrelated topics in his stories. Also the book isn't necessarily complete fact and just what Mr. Moalem has conceptualized. So you shouldn't fully agree with everything that he has to say. "

Could they have stayed in the gene pool because they offer a benefit that outweighs the damage they do? Sharon Moalem answers this question in an intriguing way for a number of diseases, such as hemochromatosis (the plague), diabetes (the little Ice Age), and high cholesterol (the Vitamin D/Folate dance). The theories are provocative and the science is well-explained. I found it a little too informal and dumbed-down at times--way too many exclamation points--but a very engaging book."
30,0060889659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,4,"Understanding genetic disease from an evolutionary point of viewWe really don't ""need"" disease. This is a bit misleading. It just so happens that some genetic disorders, such as sickle-cell anemia, favism, diabetes, hemochromatosis, the tendency to obesity, etc., confer on the afflicted compensatory advantages. Thus a predilection for getting fat is adaptive if a drought or a long winter beckons, or a person with a genetic tendency toward sickle-cell anemia is less likely to get malaria, and so on. Note that it is only diseases caused by genetic mutations that Dr. Moalem is talking about. (It might be true that we “need” disease in the sense that prey animals need predators—but that is another matter.)One of the techniques our bodies use when fighting infection is to reduce the amount of iron available to the invaders. Bacteria need iron to reproduce. If there is a lot of it available their numbers can grow quickly. Without iron they can't reproduce at all. Iron is a limiting factor for many kinds of life. Vast stretches of ocean support little in the way of life because the microorganisms that begin the food chain can't grow where there is so little iron. As Dr. Moalem reports in this wide-ranging and eyebrow-lifting book, sprinkle some iron onto those patches of ocean and they will quickly turn green with microorganisms.So it is a bit of an irony that people who have hemochromatosis, a genetic disorder that causes them to retain large amounts of iron in their bodies, are able to survival infections like the plague. This is because they starve the invading microbes through ""iron locking."" They have a lot of iron in their bodies, but they keep it away from the bacteria. Other people who have low levels of iron in their bodies are able to withstand bacterial attacks because they also keep what little iron they have away from the germs. In fact, one of the body's initial responses to microbial invasion is to limit the amount of free iron in the system.Genetic coding for levels of iron in the body is an example of evolutionary adaptation, part of the ongoing arms race between us and the microbes that live in and on our bodies. This is just one of several interesting and new ideas coming from the growing science of evolutionary medicine that I found in Survival of the Sickest. Incidentally, one way to manage hemochromatosis is through donating blood on a regular basis, which explains in part why physicians of old were sometimes successful when they bled their patients.This got me to thinking about ""only women bleed"" which led me to think about hemorrhoids (which prove that it isn't only women who bleed). Perhaps bleeding instead of retaining blood, which seems like the more natural thing for our bodies to do, has adaptive value in some people in some environments.Another interesting idea is this from page 58: ""ACHOO syndrome--its full name is autosomal dominant compelling heliopthalmic outburst syndrome."" It is a ""disorder that causes uncontrolled sneezing when someone is exposed to bright light, usually sunlight, after being in the dark."" Dr. Moalem suggests that ""way back when our ancestors spent more time in caves, this reflex helped them to clear out any molds or microbes that might have lodged in their noses or upper respiratory tract."" Now this may sound a bit far fetched, but I have suffered from low grade allergies all my life, and used to have asthmatic attacks. I came to believe that the buildup in my lungs and the sneezing were signals to me to move on! Of course now I clean and vacuum like a germaphobe, but the idea is the same. My symptoms were adaptive. They more or less forced me to reduce the level of potential irritants and microbes in my environment.But there is more. I noticed long ago that sometimes the sun in the morning would cause me to sneeze. I never figured out why until I read the above from Dr. Moalem. I am just the kind of person who would need to sneeze those molds out.Later on in the book Moalem returns to an evolutionary idea that has been kicking around for decades. Beginning with the work of Elaine Morgan from the 1970s the public became aware of the notion that we humans had an aquatic past. She got the idea from marine biologist Alister Hardy. Through such books as The Descent of Woman (1972) and The Aquatic Ape: A Theory of Human Evolution (1982) Morgan argued that some of our unusual adaptations came about because we had an aquatic past. Taking up the idea, Moalem writes, ""Every hairless mammal is aquatic or at least plays in the mud--think of hippos, elephants and the African warthog. But there aren't any hairless primates."" (p. 198) Furthermore we have fat directly under our skin to help keep us warm just as aquatic mammals do. Also, Moalem notes, ""the ability to survive on land and sea"" gives us adaptive flexibility. If ""chased by a leopard, the semiaquatic ape could dive into the water; chased by a crocodile, it could run into the forest."" (p. 199)These ideas are familiar but what I didn't know was that an aquatic past could have figured in our evolution toward bipedalism. ""[S]tanding upright in water allowed...[aquatic apes] to venture into deeper water and still breathe, and the water helped to support their upper bodies, making it easier to support them on two feet."" (p. 199)This is an easy to read book, aimed at a general readership. An earlier, slightly more technical book that covers some of the same territory is Why We Get Sick: The New Science of Darwinian Medicine (1994) by Randolph M. Nesse and George C. Williams, which I also recommend. --Dennis Littrell, author of “The World Is Not as We Think It Is”"

46,0060889659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7240015-stephen,4,"Ask the man on the street about evolution, and assuming he doesn’t connect it to Pokemon, he’ll probably identify it as something that happened long ago. But creation is never finished, either underground where tectonic plates grind against one another, producing mountains, or above where endless forms most beautiful prowling around continue to change. We know this well from medicine, because the attempt to conquer a given disease is often frustrated by the sheer pace at which a given bacteria population can. But what if some illnesses continue to be pervasive because it’s beneficial to us? Such is the argument advanced by Sharon Moalem in this, one of the most interesting biology books I’ve read in a while.How can being susceptible to a disease help us? Diseases are often debilitating, sometimes confining the affected to bed – not exactly a place to take one’s stand in the eternal struggle for existence. But suppose a trait that warped cells ever so slightly – a bad thing, on the face of it — had the effect of preventing an invasive parasite from being able to use those cells, damning it to a death as soon as it had gotten a look around your circulatory system? So it is that sickle cell anemia, which only occurs when two people with those warped cells have a baby, persists in Africa and other places where malaria is common. More people survive malarial attacks than die from it because they’re in possession of those slightly warped cells. (Sickle-cell anemia results when two people with the affected cells have a child, and their child’s cells are so altered they slow the flow of blood.) Another sickness, in which cells horde iron to the point of poisoning their own bodies, is a similar adaptation against malarial infections….but unlike with sickle-cell anemia, those with hemochromatosis can find relief from their internal oxidation by donating blood. These genes persist because, given the odds, they’re more likely to help persons carrying them than to hurt them.After exploring other cases like this, including a speculative argument that the European propensity for diabetes is an adaptation to the northern climes during the last glacial period, Moahem shifts an even more fascinating topic: methlyation, or the processed by which traits expressed by your genes can be turned off and on, or otherwise modulated, because of factors in the environment, both prenatal and postnatal. We encounter mammals who give birth to different colored offspring depending on how much light the mother is exposed to — allowing her to bear white babies in winter, when snow is on the ground, and brown ones during the summer. Human mothers’ environments also change them: when on a starvation diet, or when eating mostly nutrient-poor junk food, they give birth to small babies that grow up with horders’ metabolisms. Why this has happened is fairly easy to guess: children born in times of famine need to hold on to every scrap of spare glucose they can. Towards the end, Moalem shifts a little off topic to examine other environmental effects on our genes and their expressions, sharing the argument of some that human beings have been partially shaped by a maritime environment, driving our hairlessness and bipidalism.Survival of the Sickest has been on my to-read list for many years now, and I’m extremely glad to have finally sat down and taken it on. It’s in the same vein as Randolph Nesse’s Good Reasons for Bad Feelings and Why We Get Sick, the former of which I plan on reading before too long."

I read 2, i got a super good day!After reading Moalem's Inheritance: How Our Genes Change Our Lives—and Our Lives Change Our Genes, i got so much info and decided to read this book to make this Saturday very fruitful. It really doesn't disappoint me. I found it super informative and though i have known quite a few of info inside but still i got to learn more new stuff.Mutation shapes our evolution constantly, i learn the coded genes of humans are 96% identical to chimps, but our coded genes are merely 30% among our gene pools (means 70% are what we called junk genes, but they are actually not junks, they are just not active and not coded.)Hip-hop genes : These genes hop around from one location to another within a chromosome, inserting themselves into different regions, both changing the DNA and activating/inactivating the normal functions of nearby genes. (https://www.carolina.com/teacher-reso...)I learned today: HFE hereditary haemochromatosis could actually saved our ancestors from plague, even played some roles in diabetics after post ice age. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HFE_her...)Parasite mode for some insects to mind controlling another kind to build up guarding zone and even became slave. After the cohabitation for some time, the babies were grown up, eating the slave. mission done.Parasite virus has lived in our DNA since long!During war time or stressful traumas like 911 in 2001, women tend to have girls as babies more than boys, because baby boys is after all more alien/strange for mother and more fragile, miscarriage happened under stress or bad time among baby boys.DNA methylation: plays a very important key on cancer. It's like a switch to determine if the cells would keep multiply or not. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_met...)During the first few weeks' pregnancy, if the mother ate only junk food, then baby would be born smaller and lighter, but after they grow up they tend to become obese and have heart problem. because the first few weeks of pregnancy, fetus detects the mal nutrition and switch to ""economic"" kind of body (which would be nice to survive in food shortage time, but would on the contrary causes obesity in food abundance time). Same for the father if he smoke in adolescence then his son would have highly chance to be obese before 9 years old.Such an interesting book that i think very useful for everyone to read. "
48,0060889659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63439076-sarah,4,"It is no surprise that I found this book interesting, since I find both evolution and genetics fascinating. Many other reviewers have pointed out that it sometimes is not clear what is established by science and what is merely speculation. There are also sometimes places where the author, presumably in order to simplify things, misstates some basic genetic principals, of which I am sure he is aware. The best example of this is on page 76 where the author writes, ""For a woman to have serious G6PD deficiency, she has to have the mutation on both X chromosomes. [fair enough] If she has it on only one chromosome, some of her red blood cells will have the normal gene and some won't, and she should produce sufficient G6PD to avoid favism"". The author states quite clearly elsewhere in the book that human somatic cells contain the entire genome of that human, so every cell in this woman would contain BOTH genes. Except, of course, that mature blood cells don't contain any chromosomes at all, being basically oxygen carrying machines with no nucleus at all. So, wrong on two counts. In trying to explain why women are less affected by favism than men, the author muddied the water with these inaccuracies, and I really don't know why he made that choice. This annoyed me enough that I almost stopped reading at that point, but I'm glad that I didn't. I am old enough that much of the information on epigenetics was new to me. A lot of this stuff wasn't known when I was in school, and apparently I haven't kept up. This book prompted me to pick up my daughter's biology textbook and do some brushing up. It is fascinating stuff, and I appreciate this book for spurring me to learn more. I also appreciate it for getting me thinking again about genetics, evolution, and the way that our body interacts with disease causing organisms. This book would be a good one to read after reading ""The Selfish Gene"" by Richard Dawkins, because it covers some similar ground, but with an updated understanding of how genes are turned on and off."
49,0060889659,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27300058-ralph-zoontjens,4,"This book opens the eyes towards the actual complexity of life, especially how it is driven by relationships between microorganisms, hormones and other chemicals, and ultimately ruled by evolutionary pressures.The author clearly has a scientific background and connects different stories about disease to make the point that some strange phenomena, however not beneficial to the individual, does support the species as a whole. He especially goes in depth concerning hemochromatosis since this relates to his own experiences and research. The book is also a good brush-up on how DNA works not as a static instruction, but as a complex network, taking into account latest research on junk DNA, methylation, punc-eqe and jumping genes. It makes the reader understand the biochemistry of human beings more like software, always evolving, sometimes rapidly mutating, and under influence of many factors.However I do not disagree with it, it is a bit out of place to end the book with the aquatic ape hypothesis as the point is about the benefit of waterbirths. Pregnancy is not a disease as far as I am aware unless the author fiercely believes the planet is overpopulated.Fun Facts:- The optic nerve plays a role in the skin's production of melamine, so by wearing sunglasses you will tan less.- Kinine is an active component of tonic and can treat malaria.- The snake / esculape in medical symbols could originally be a worm since these were removed from the body by slowly winding them onto a stick.- Some genes are inhibited by green tea to stop fighting cancer (so this is very good!).- It appears very possible to stop cell ageing, but evolution has not wanted it so up to yet.- The proboscis monkey is a good example of another ape that has evolved towards aquatic environments with a downward facing nose opening.- The drive to escape from an island where a group of apes got trapped may have been an evolutionary pressure as support for the aquatic ape theory."

The author puts forth theories to explain how diseases might help some survive.There's probably some debate of whether his theories are valid (after all, one can find just about every opinion on the internet), but I loved the book regardless. The writing is engaging, reading more like a murder mystery or thriller--seeking insights from various leads--than a dry non-fiction book.In fact, when I shared some of the details of the first two chapters with my family, they all declared: ""Stop spoiling it! I want to read it when you're done."" We don't usually think of a non-fiction book as being ""spoil"" worthy. ;)I love stepping back and seeing the big picture behind ideas, and that's what this book is all about: the dance of evolution and genetics not just within ourselves, but also in tune with our physical and emotional environment around us--from ice ages and plagues to stress and gut bacteria. Due to my recent health issues and struggles with bad reactions to medications and an antibiotic-triggered C.Difficile infection, I can appreciate how the medical and genetic fields are in their infancy of understanding how everything influences and affects everything else.

She spends a lot of time talking about how interconnected humans are with bacteria, viruses, and parasites as well as how Lamarckian ideas (passing down learned traits ex: if you lift weights you will have children with large muscles) that have been ridiculed by science are now being reconsidered in light of new evidence.I like the novelty of the ideas she is presenting. The book is interesting and written for a non-scientist to easily understand. However, I also feel like the author also presents a lot of hypotheses as conclusions/facts. She explains them well, but they are untested claims and therefore some of her scientific epiphanies seem a little blurry/unconvincing to me and leave me feeling skeptical. Overall, a good read, if only to open my eyes to the possibilities out there and to point out how much we still don't know about science and our own genetics!"

He starts this examination because his grandfather had an iron surplus, so he decides that gave his ancestors an advantage against the black death. Then he concludes that diabetes stops us from freezing to death. Really, it was pretty interesting to read, and think about not only how we evolve but how viruses evolve and whether we can engineer situations where it is in the viruses best interest not to kill us as was done accidentally in one Latin American outbreak of something (cholera?)

The issue that I've read many reviewers have with this book is that it presents theories as facts. I'm not well-read in scientific literature, but throughout the book, it felt as if Moalem was presenting his ideas as theories, not hard facts.

There are currently several models/hypotheses for the rise of bipedalism, not all of which still hold draw any considerable support. The point is, it is not a strict dichotomy. There was probably a multi-factor cause for the rise of habitual bipedalism in Homo sapiens anyhow.Otherwise, mostly interesting and decent read.

He also uses some corny jokes and I am a huge fan of that. One chapter even discusses the evolution of viruses and how they adapt to make a human more or less sick in order to figure out how to spread the virus the best.
