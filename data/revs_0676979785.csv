0,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28854579-glenn-sumi,4,"Have you ever experienced an “ear worm” – i.e., a melody “stuck” in your head? Have you ever found yourself humming or whistling a tune for no reason, then thought back to the lyrics or theme of that song and realized it had something to do with what’s on your mind? Have you ever tried to remember what letter comes after another in the alphabet and found yourself singing that “ABC” song from childhood?Check, check and check.All of these are explored in Musicophilia, a fascinating series of essays by Dr. Oliver Sacks (Awakenings, The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat). His writing is clear, civilized and genial, if occasionally repetitive and dryly scientific. (A more ruthless editor might have helped.)Drawing from more than half a century of clinical work as a neurologist, Sacks recounts tales of patients whose conditions have something to do with music. Among his subjects are people who:• have musical hallucinations (they constantly hear songs, often Christmas carols or marching tunes)• associate certain notes or musical intervals with colours or pictures• suddenly discover, after an accident or some other incident, that they have an aptitude for music or, conversely, lose their musical abilitiesThere are some absorbing case studies, such as Martin, who was born “normal” but contracted meningitis at three and succumbed to seizures, limiting his intelligence and physical abilities. As an adult, he had a low IQ but remembered 2,000 operas and all of Bach’s cantatas, including melodies and what each instrument and voice played.I was also intrigued by the woman who can remember pages of text, but only when they’re associated with a melody. (Her professor, recognizing his own lecture notes written verbatim on an exam, thought she was cheating until he discovered her gift.)And there are eye-opening tales about composers like Ravel, whose famous Bolero, with its relentless repetition, might have been influenced by his frontotemporal dementia, and Shostakovitch, who refused to have a piece of shrapnel removed from his head because it mysteriously provided him with music which he then incorporated into his compositions.Also included is the incredibly moving story of concert pianist and teacher Leon Fleisher, whose loss of the use of his right hand for three decades transformed his life and approach to art. Sacks’s description of Fleisher playing a transcription of Bach’s “Sheep May Safely Graze” (the pianist regained use of his hand later in life through Botox treatments) for him alone will bring tears to your eyes.And what about those people who hate or feel indifferent towards music? One of them was the great writer Vladimir Nabokov, who wrote: “Music... affects me merely as an arbitrary succession of more or less irritating sounds… The concert piano and all wind instruments bore me in small doses and flay me in larger ones.”Before reading this book I didn’t realize that music crops up rarely in the works of Sigmund Freud, or the two James brothers, philosopher William and novelist Henry, although all three were sensitive to other varieties of human experience and expression.In a work filled with jaw-dropping stories, one of the most incredible happened to Sacks himself. One day he woke up from a musical dream, which followed him throughout the day.
I found something deeply disturbing and unpleasant about the music, and longed for it to stop. I had a shower, a cup of coffee, went for a walk, shook my head, played a mazurka on the piano – to no avail. The hateful hallucinatory music continued unabated. Finally I phoned a friend, Orlan Fox, and said that I was hearing songs that I could not stop, songs that seemed to me full of melancholy and a sort of horror. The worst thing, I added, was that the songs were in German, a language I did not know. Orlan asked me to sing or hum some of the songs. I did so, and there was a long pause. “Have you abandoned some of your young patients?” he asked. “Or destroyed some of your literary children?”“Both,” I answered. “Yesterday, I resigned from the children’s unit at the hospital where I have been working, and I burned a book of essays I had written…. How did you guess?”“Your mind is playing Mahler’s Kindertotenlieder,” he said, “his songs of mourning for the death of children.” I was amazed by this, for I rather dislike Mahler’s music and would normally find it quite difficult to remember in detail, let alone sing, any of his Kindertotenlieder. But here my dreaming mind, with infallible precision, had come up with an appropriate symbol of the previous day’s events. And in the moment that Orlan interpreted the dream, the music disappeared; it has never recurred in the thirty years since.
Amazing.Near the end, Sacks provides an illuminating and moving chapter on the connection between grief and music. How come some compositions provide consolation and catharsis? And there’s a touching chapter on patients with Williams Syndrome, people who tend to have IQs less than 60 but who have universally friendly personalities and extraordinary musical ability.There’s no overarching thesis or direction to Musicophilia – how could there be, really? – but there are plenty of studies and stories that will make you think twice next time you find yourself turning on Spotify.**Fun fact: I noticed Sacks cites a study by a Simon Baron-Cohen. I Googled and, sure enough, the scientist is Borat’s (Sacha Baron Cohen) first cousin!"
1,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48216-sarah,4,"Sacks is, for me, a perfect meeting of a science writer and a writer of creative non-fiction. He has an equal interest in telling an affecting, human story and with exploring how (and why) the brain works. While lots of science writing is dry and objective (as it should be) and while mainstream feature writing often ignores the more complicated science stuff, Sacks is a rare talent who has a penchant for story telling and for explaining the newest research on the brain. He doesn’t condescend, and he doesn’t mind forming personal relationships with his subjects.In Musicophilia, Sacks focuses on the mysterious and fascinating connection between music and the brain. Through studying musical oddities in patients, he hopes, we can hope to better understand our greater relationship with music - something that, although it is universal among cultures, doesn’t seem to have a clear function or origin.For example, the book opens with a middle-aged man who is struck by lightening. He isn’t badly hurt, but since the accident, he’s been obsessed with the urge to play the piano. He’s never really played before or had an interest in music, but suddenly he’s up all night composing and trying to get better. Why has this happened? Why is unaffected except for this urge, which takes over his life? Brain scans show that his left frontal lobe has been damaged and Sacks hypothesizes that the left hemisphere of the brain might actually inhibit the more creative and musical right side of the brain. Left brain damage might lead to more “freedom” in the right brain.The book moves on from there to cover a huge spectrum of diseases, phenomenones, and rarities - spanning from music therapy for those with dementia and Alzheimer’s, to people who suffer from musical hallucinations, to people with perfect pitch, to people with amusica (to them, music sounds like noise - Nabokov suffered from it), to musical savants. The structures of the chapters are very satisfying to me: they start with a story of an individual and then, by the end of the segment, lead to a more general description of the science behind the patient’s symptoms.One of the more fascinating chapters covers children with William’s Syndrome, which affects about one out of 10,000 people. These people, who all have strangely elfin features, suffer from severe mental disabilities: they can’t ad 5 + 3, they can’t draw a square, they can’t tie their shoes. They have IQs around 60. However, they also tend to be very verbal, very social, and exceptionally musical. Most have perfect pitch and start composing as toddlers. Unlike some cases of severe autism who show a more mechanical and isolated musical talent, patients with William’s Syndrome love to play music in groups - within a community. Sacks visits a camp for children with William’s Syndrome - which is a constant drum circle, sing-along, and musical wrapped up in one.As in all of his tales, Sacks is sure to find the hope and humanity in even the most difficult patients. One man, an amnesiac who has a short-term memory of only a few seconds, can only stay present within himself while he plays the piano.More importantly, Sacks doesn’t see his patients as freaks or abnormalities who are simply interesting to read about, but rather as windows into how we can collectively understand how we function. In Musicophilia, I was truly moved by what I read - both by the humanity of the patients and by the awesomeness of the science."
2,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24882791-india-m-clamp,4,"Sacks relives the pathologies of musical response in his patients while working at Beth Abraham Hospital. He describes music as a panacea and says, “they were liberated by music.” This applies to patients with dementia and those suffering from Williams Syndrome. Despite low IQ, he honors them in kind descriptive terms: having wide mouths, upturned noses and a true adoration of music. “We humans are a musical species no less than a linguistic one...we perceive tones, timbre, pitch intervals, melodic contours, harmony (perhaps most elementally) rhythm. We integrate all of these and “construct” music in our minds...” ---Oliver Sacks, MD Sacks' deeply warm and sympathetic study is about pathologies of musical response and erudition gained from a ""normal"" faculty of music. In addition, within are new findings from anatomy. We also learn “how is the musicians mind different than others?” There is the curious case of Harry S. having a perfect tenor voice yet he showed no emotion, except when he sang---as if music brought him to life. Exceptional study and storytelling by Dr. Oliver Sacks. The connections that music impart and patient studies (L-Dopa) are in “Awakenings.” I found interesting the case study of a 42-year-old man struck by lightning, then he developed an exigent thirst for music learned to play piano and compose. Truly an effervescent account of life. Found personal “drug use” confessions by Sacks surprising. Read and explore your reaction to music."
3,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,2,"This book was interesting, I guess. Lots of anecdotes about the effect of music on behavior and personality, but not enough analysis. Sacks usually is more of a story teller than a hardcore neuroscientist in his popular book – at least in the other two that I’ve read by him – but in this book he fails to be a good story teller too. Too many tidbits and little stories. I definitely recommend This Is Your Brain on Music over this book if you’re interested in a real scientific analysis of music and our obsession with it.Every time that I read a book by Sacks or something similar I get a depressing feeling of being a slave to my brain. It just reinforces the idea that we are our brains. You don’t need to have any of the weird and often fascinating problems that Sacks’ patients have. Even in us “ordinary” people, our personality and behavior are governed by our brain chemistry and neural connectivity. Anatomy is destiny, as Freud said, if anatomy is to mean brain. The positive side is that this way of looking at people can lead to a better understanding and acceptance of others. Next time that you encounter someone with an unpleasant personality trait, or an annoying behavior, or a different outlook to life than yours, just remember that he has a different brain organization from yours. He’s just different from you. This helps to accept people and become less judgmental. "

With those three lines sang over and over again to a heavy dance laden beat they make a good soundtrack for the content of this good read on music and the brain. Author Oliver Sacks, I suspect, would not have known who The Chemical Brothers were but I think he would have understood the meaning considering the depth of subject. Music has played a huge part of my life. Not as a player, very poor 3 chord thrash as a youth was about it, but as a huge consumer. My parents had a diverse mix of classical and jazz for me to devour as a young boy. My mum’s sister was a Beatles fan and my dad’s brother was a musician of some ability who played Sax and Clarinet and even made it onto TV talent shows. My first recording purchased with my own pocket money was a 7” single, Coz I Luv You by Slade. I must have been 11 or 12. It has been a long journey to now paying via download my latest purchase (Sarah Mary Chadwick) such is the way we now procure music. As I say to anyone that asks, over the years my tastes have been truly eclectic, I listen to all genres and all artists, Abba to Zorn one might say. When I purchased this book back on 24/2/2009 (the receipt was found tucked into the back page on finishing) I was ready to devour it. The trouble was I read Sacks’ more famous “The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat” first, a book I also had at that time. I did not enjoy Hat at all! It was dense in terminology, lacking in focus and with uninspiring writing did little to hold my attention. Hence this read was placed way back of the reading pack. So now started and finished I have to say that I have enjoyed this a little bit more than I expected to. The writing can still be a little uninspiring though the focus is obvious, a focus that is no bad thing for the likes of me. Sacks’ covers a lot of territory. Why we may like, dislike or even be indifferent to music. Amnesia and Dementia and why those that suffer may have an affinity with music. Why at some gigs/concerts some musicians spend an inordinate amount of time tuning their instruments between just about every song. There are many interesting anecdotes. Clive Wearing suffered herpes encephalitis of the brain causing amnesia. Clive has been the subject of a documentary called “The Man With the Seven Second Memory”. I recommend looking at a youtube of Clive who has as little as 30 seconds memory at best, can hardly recall the subject of a sentence in discussion but then can still play the piano at a remarkable ability. Sacks thought that Clive had semantic memory as apposed in the absence of explicit and episodic memory but was not that sure. William’s Syndrome was another. I had to admit that I had never heard of this affliction but Sacks discussion and explanation was first rate. In the end though, this will be my 2nd and last book by Sacks. As much as I have enjoyed this one I know it was the subject matter that was attractive. When getting into his own field of Neurology in explanation of his thoughts on the subject of music and the brain his writing was a little too dense for me. I understand that the subject matter needs certain scientific explanation but as a lay reader I did need to reread sentences a couple of times and internet search medical terms. The bibliography would be useful to the specialist in the field but not so much the layman such as I. Footnoted galore but then some of them are half a page long and as interesting as they can be at times it seemed more like he had footnoted an event he was keen to include in the narrative but knew not how. I do recommend this very interesting book though. If one is curious as to why music and the brain can work together in mysterious ways this will be more than useful. My Personal Musical Extras.As I wrote this review I was on forced leave due to the company I work for having its income collapse due to Corvid -19. Time will tell if I return. I hope I do as I enjoy my work. I have my own small office and have a 30 year old battered boom box in the corner to play CD’s on as background. Yes I could go digital but the monstrosity still works and I have so many CD’s from the old day. I packed up about 100 as I left work and then reflected on them, a mix of Classical from Beethoven and Mussorgsky to modern composers such as Glass and Nyman. Jazz was covered too with The Atlantic Years by John Coltrane through to a crazy set of compilation CD’s that I got in the 90’s for jazz in all its subvarieties. When I was in the mood for a certain genre I was covered. The very good Underworld got a serious play in the last week as they seemed perfect for the times, repetitious experimental beats that hit the mark while our office staff discussed our futures. I work for a printing company and we have a few old Heidelberg cylinders. Whenever I had to go to the production factory they were clunking away in a never ending rhythm that had my brain singing along to whatever suited its 4/4 time. “I need it I don’t want it I need it I don’t want it I need it I don’t want it I need it I don’t want it I need it I don’t want it I need it I don’t want it” was the sound it sang to me on my last visit, a cadence for Mortiis black metal ambient tune called This Absolution. It seemed just right considering the circumstances. Each evening after work I had always gone for a 30 minute walk. Headphones on, the music of choice had always had an atmospheric bent, Dead Can Dance, This Mortal Coil are just a couple of examples. Now with lockdown there are few reasons to leave the house though excuse is engaging alone for physical exercise. I now get out in the morning and walk for a couple of hours in a local forest. I have found that I do not want to listen to music. That is a strange feeling. I have realised that I needed the sound of the forest, the birds singing and the crunch of the path under my feet. No music seems to suit the present circumstances. This may be the first time in my life that I have felt like this."
5,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2447803-jason,4,"It’s not a common characteristic, but I recommend this book for all environments where you read. Coffee shop, living room, park bench, subway, or to ignore your spouse--it receives my seal of 4+ stars. Musicophilia is a lurid, but respectable, look into the brains and lives of people that appear normal on the outside, but have strong, strange and intractable relationships to music. The relationship is sometimes harmful, often incomprehensible, sometimes therapeutic, even charming, but always unforgettable. And that’s the bottom line here for this book--incredibly interesting, highly readable, and, after reflecting about people in your lives with contagion to music, totally unforgettable.- Why do some people hear every musical tone in irrepressible color, like fireworks?- Why do snippets of songs lodge in the brain for days, weeks, years, even a lifetime?This is my introduction to Oliver Sacks. A renown neuroscientist with over 5 decades of experience, and a talent for presenting case studies to a plebeian reading public. The great majority of writers are not good writers. And, they’re not neuroscientists either. Sacks, however, is both.- What about the man with a 60 IQ who knows each note of 2500 symphonies?- Why do people with gross stuttering speak perfectly when they sing? Every human has a disease. Sometimes that disease is visible on the outside, and we stare and point, and tell our friends what we saw today--an alien rheumatoid hand, a debilitating kyphosis, a piebald psoriasis scar. Sometimes the affliction is in the mind and worn outside, like an Obsessive Compulisive Disorder, a neurodegeneration or a crippling social phobia. But, for the most part, we all have something--an undiagnosed disease or affliction--something we can manage to hide from everyone (so that people don’t point and stare and go home and tell their friends about what they saw in us today). Perversion, narco, nympho, criminality, victim, depression, protein mutation, future Alzheimer, next year’s dementia, next week’s suicide, next month’s spousal abuse, future diabetic, compulsion, addiction. We all mix together. Some of it’s our fault, some not. But it’s there. And most of it’s in the brain. I like reading psychological analysis of material cases. Psychology ‘levels’ the playing field, in a manner. It helps to know you’re not the only one that suffers from hidden affliction.- What about the man with amnesia so severe he can’t remember anything beyond 7 seconds ago, yet he plays the piano flawlessly when he never could before?- Why does music induce epilepsy? Based on a lifetime of personal interaction with patients, the author reveals scores of cases regarding music-related idiosyncrasies. Like a barbell, on the left are people who cringe at the sound of music, on the right are people who fail to thrive without music, and both sides are connected by a continuum, balanced through the middle. Musicophilia is a compilation that highlights a very recent surge in psychoanalytic and neuroscientific interest in music-based ailments and music-based therapy. There are fantastic new insights to how the brain compartmentalizes music, and how music is integrated as a global cortical tool. Apparently the brain has allocated a large--a mysteriously large--global amount of neurons to music, and we are only beginning to understand how and why. Medicine and science are beginning to pay attention to these emergent signs and symptoms. What was once overlooked and ridiculed, a mere footnote in the literature, is now a fertile growth area in psychoanalysis.- Why do only 1 in 1000 people have perfect pitch?- Why can music penetrate depression and dementia when human voice cannot?This book may not be a watershed event in science, but it was for me. I am amusical, arhythmic, and dysharmonic. It was refreshing to read that many people are like me, on the left side of the barbell. For every person that sings out loud or under their breath at work, there are 2 or 3 of us that can’t carry a tune and refuse to karaoke. It’s not that I don’t like music or can’t be moved or buoyed by music; it’s simply that I don’t have a complex relationship to music, and for the most part, I can take it or leave it. I listen to music about 45 minutes a week, mostly on radio during commute. I don’t collect music, stay current with music, play music, or talk about music. It’s quite common, even though you music-o-philes gasp incredulously at my hideousness. My parents are like this, my wife, my siblings, many of my friends. If I was imprisoned, I would miss reading and exercise, but not music. - Why is the prime symptom of Williams Syndrome an indefatigable attraction to music?- Why do humans have music hallucinations?Perhaps I was attracted to the title Musicophilia subconsciously. I know I’m socially deficient regarding things music, and maybe I wanted to discover what power music holds over people. Perhaps I wanted to apply definitions and causes to my amusia. Alas, I’m not deficient. My brain appreciates music, but has developed in other ways. Despite Oliver Sack’s covering cases like mine, I was quite interested to learn how important, indeed life-sustaining, music is for certain brains.- Why does music cause such a constellation of emotion in humans?- Why does a brain on music light up like cherries during CAT scans?My recently deceased grandfather had dementia near the end. A lanky nonagenarian with a full shock of white hair. He forgot a lot of things, including our names and when to urinate, but he didn’t forget how to polka or whistle or play the harmonica. Musicophilia will tell you why, but I like to think it’s because Gramps had something special I can’t yet find.I would have awarded 5-stars, but there was no transition between the chapters. Sometimes that works, but in non-fiction I like to see a framework guiding the book. I discovered a loose organization, but each chapter could stand independently in a journal like Neuroscience, Scientific American, or Psychology Today. Still...great take-aways.

I was flying forwards. Bewildered. I looked around. I saw my own body on the ground. I said to myself, ‘Oh shit, I’m dead.’ I saw people converging on the body. I saw a woman – she had been standing waiting to use the phone right behind me - position herself over my body, give it CPR … I floated up the stairs – my consciousness came with me. I saw my kids, had the realization that they would be okay. Then I was surrounded by a bluish-white light … an enormous feeling of well-being and peace. The highest and lowest points of my life raced by me. No emotion associated with these … pure thought, pure ecstacy. I had the perception of accelerating, being drawn up … there was speed and direction. Then as I was saying to myself, ‘This is the most glorious feeling I have ever had’ – SLAM! I was back.”
I will never cease to be amazed by books. This above account was given by Tony Cicoria, forty-two, very fit and robust, and a well-regarded orthopedic surgeon in a small city in upstate New York. He survived an experience of being struck by lighning. He continued his work but from this time on he had the most incredible need to connect with music. He was subsequently divorced and continued with his incredible sudden love for music and composition.I am not religious and I am not a believer, as such, but I know there is another life after death. I cannot describe it. It is certainly not faith but a certainty from what I have experienced during the last two years that tells me, yes, life continues after death. Many will believe that I am an absolute idiot but I really don’t care. We come from nothing (but there is no proof about this) indeed with birth, but we do indeed go to an illustrious future.Oliver Sacks has made the most incredible research of people with neurological conditions and all of these case studies are riveting. You can literally pick up this book and look at whatever page and find something amazing. It is really a remarkable reference book and I was just so enthralled to see individuals with evidently insurmountable problems and yet who managed to overcome these through music.Music is a wonderful thing and it indeed takes up a large part in our brain and so we must enjoy it. Well I do anyway.It was fascinating when Sacks said that there are certain musical pieces that he has to listen to over and over again before he moves on to a new composer. I can so relate to that. I am on “overkill’ at the moment with Grieg and Sibelius but there are indeed other composers waiting in the wings to enthrall me. Music – my… What else can I possibly say!I absolutely loved this book and continually look at it. It is in my library and there to stay."

10,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66632-matt,5,"Oliver Sacks has been one of my favorite authors ever since I first read The Man Who Mistook his Wife for a Hat. I still completely amazed, and a little bit disturbed, when I think back to his account of the woman who lost her sense of proprioception - the internal body sense that lets you know your body is there, even when you have your eyes closed. No other author (since Proust) has explored the nuances of consciousness so carefully, nor pointed out how tenuous the our grip on reality can be.I've enjoyed his other books that I've read, but his lost something since he wrote Man.."". His subjects in that book were all his patients at one point - and that kind of clinical closeness gave a depth to his analysis that is slightly lacking in some of his later writing. The sense of amazement is still there, but it seems slightly shallower.Musicophilia may have the same problem, but it more than compensates with the sheer enthusiasm that Sacks brings to the project. His love of music permeates the whole book, and his obsessiveness regarding the subject brings back the depth that he lost with clinical distance.Certain chapters, such as the one on Synesthesia, rank as some of the best Sacks has written. He gives scientific backing to an idea often dismissed as myth, while at the same time bringing his usual humanistic bent - I was particular enchanted by a description by a synesthete of a conversation in his first grade class, in which he said he was ""counting the colors until friday."" Really fantastic stuff."

First, although marketed to a popular audience (even making it to the best sellers list), there are massive amounts of musical jargon and a background of musical knowledge would be extrememly helpful. Second, the books seemed to lack cohesive threads or narritive. I found it extremely disjointed with every few paragraphs changing to a different patient with very few being fully developed or resolved. Third, I was also disappointed that specific discussion of music was usually about classical music. No mention of the effects of more popular musical genres was made in the portion I read.Other than a few interesting accounts and facts, I obtained little enjoyment or education from this book that seemed so promising."

Through a series of fascinating narratives, the author--dubbed “poet laureate of medicine” by The New York Times--explored a variety of unique musical phenomena. Sharing observations and insights, Sachs revealed the nature of music and the roles music plays in the lives of individuals struggling with medical, psychological, and social issues.

As a musician and music teacher, I was interesting in this topic.The book covers a variety of cases involving music’s effects on the brain. There’s the man who was struck by lightning and suddenly became obsessed with music. There are people with perfect pitch while others are tone deaf. But mostly music can be used as therapy for a variety of disorders. People with Tourette’s and Parkinson’s often find relief with music. People with amnesia and Alzheimer’s can remember music when they’ve forgotten everything else. And those with aphasia can use music to recover speech skills. Those with mood disorders tend to “self-medicate” with music. Often it has to be the right kind of music.Performing music is the only activity (I’m told) that uses both hemispheres of the brain equally. So even with brain damage, the ability to enjoy music is rarely lost. Those with right-hemisphere damage can still appreciate the forms and structures of music. Those with left-hemisphere damage, unable to carry a tune, still have an emotional reaction to music.There are a lot of unanswered questions and some cases that are still a puzzle. Why are we such a musical species? What makes us like some music and not other kinds?Music is part of being human, and there is no human culture in which it is not highly developed and esteemed. Its very ubiquity may cause it to be trivialized in daily life: we switch on a radio, switch it off. hum a tune, tap our feet, find the words of an old song going through our minds, and think nothing of it. But to those who are lost in dementia, the situation is different. Music is no luxury to them, but a necessity, and can have a power beyond anything else to restore to themselves, and to others, at least for a while. Book Blog"
15,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/87082395-andrew-howdle,5,"Sacks writes (as ever) from the margins in an attempt to shed light on the centre of human existence. He infuses his case studies with empathy and humour. Starting from the scientific claim that music plays no part in human evolution, he raises the question of exaptation and a possibility that human health covers more than a forward looking sense of  fitness . Music is not an aspect of survival, yet it plays a vital role in our mental survival. Sacks investigates the value of rhythm to humans with Parkinson's and how melody can awake comatose patients. He builds from a neuropsychology of music towards an understanding of how and why music influences the human mind. He is well aware that this is only half the story -- the other half would be a study of music itself. Even so, this is a truly emotional and insightful book. Musicophiia swells with speculations and anecdotes. For example, a day came when Sacks himself felt a continuous strain of music inside his head, a pull that became a mental strain. An endless song. He sang the tune to a friend who asked him a question. Have you ended an emotional job or destroyed some of your essays, your literary children? Sacks explained that he had done both a few days before. His friend identified the melody as Mahler's Songs for Dead Children . Though Sacks disliked Mahler, the brain had gone into mourning by selecting an appropriate musical theme for his conscious actions.In this book, as elsewhere, Sacks demonstrates why he was one of the greatest of our humanitarian thinkers and writers."
16,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67550-liz,3,"I wasn't hugely impressed with this. Sacks's writing sometimes gets extremely dry as he goes into the technicalities of how the brain functions. I found his other books, with chapters each covering a variety of conditions (""Anthropologist on Mars,"" ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat""), to be much stronger, even though they were less consistent thematically. It seemed that at times Sacks had to stretch to find patients with some of the musical conditions he described -- not a good sign, since some of his best work consists of describing individuals' conditions and then working out what might be causing them. He also borrowed heavily from cases described in his other works. It made me wonder, what would motivate someone to write a book if he didn't have the necessary new material?...infants at six months can readily detect all rhythmic variations, but by twelve months their range has narrowed, albeit sharpened. They can now more easily detect the types of rhythms to which they have previously been exposed; they learn and internalize a set of rhythms for their culture. Adults find it harder still to perceive ""foreign"" rhythmic distinctions."

So I was really pumped to read a book about how music affects you.But the thing is, all these concept aren't explored. I feel like too many topics were squeezed into one book. Even more, some of them are very repetitive. In this book, I've read in so many chapters about how people with certain disorders and illnesses have a special reaction to music. Yes, there are many diseases, but it just got really repetitive. I even ended up skimming some of these chapters. But I did learn some new things. I wasn't anymore convinced that music is amazing, because I already knew that, but I did learn some new things neurologically speaking about music. But this book really was so repetitive and boring.

It *almost* makes the issues dealt with in the book pleasant.In a nutshell, this book is about the power of music, backed by many accounts from the medical perspective of the interaction between music and the brain. It's hard to tell without a lot of background knowledge on mr sacks and his previous works, but it seems as if in part this book is a culmination of much of his previous works and observations.A peripheral discussion that continued to dance through my head while reading this book is what is the ""best"" music to listen to? I kind of got the impression that classical music was most close to the primal drummings of the soul, but perhaps not. I mean mr sacks is an older fellow, and much of his observations were of patients from his earlier days practising, so is it fair to assume that classical music had a more august position in those days and was thus more clearly regarded as the truest form of music? Would any music do, any beat and rhythm that strikes a cord with the individual?I came away from this book wanting to listen to less podcasts and more music. I came away yet again regretting that I've never tried to play an instrument in my life. Ultimately, though, I came away with much more reverance for the power of music, more convinced that music just might be the surest and most direct path to self and the soul."

He retells the stories of his clients throughout his books, always with references to his other work. This isn't entirely bad, but I had to speed through some parts that were a tad bit repetitive. The subject matter is fascinating, and perfectly delivered for the layman(Which I happen to be). I have a newfound respect for the power of music therapy and music itself."

21,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291009-alex,4,"Musicophelia is an enchanting read, though one is struck more by the phenomena depicted—amusias, musical hallucinations, comatose patients suddenly ""awakened"" by nothing more than a familiar melody—than the manner of their depiction. Sacks has always been lauded for his fluid, personable style, and for good reason, but in the wake of classics such as The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Uncle Tungsten, his writing seems excessively florid and repetitive—neither tight enough nor substantial enough to match the subject he loves so well.My other criticism is that for all it's heartstopping wonder, Musicophelia rarely buckles down to the core of things. Only at specific points does Sacks truly explore the philosophical or psychological implications of his subjects. I confess I've encountered many of these ""clinical tales"" in his earlier books and articles, and hence, the net result feels to me more like a compendium or ""greatest hits"" album rather than a fully realized examination like Migraine. The key questions—what do organized tones mean to us? why have we evolved to perceive and celebrate rhythm? what is the relationship between music and language?—are touched upon, but only superficially discussed."

The real heft arrives halfway as Sacks starts pulling together the real research and making implications.The message here is that music is not some frivolous side effect of our neurology. Rather, music is processed by dedicated machinery in our brains and can affect us in profound and surprising ways.There are tantalising implications that humans have the capacity for much greater musical ability, if it were developed correctly. One suggestion is that people in Western countries miss out on developing 'perfect pitch', because our languages are agnostic to the tone of voice used - unlike the sing-song tonality of say, Chinese.Evidently one of the few books around on the subject - worth a read but not Sacks' best."

This book was first published in 2007, a time when much was not yet known about music and the brain. First come the antedotal, a good amount Sacks has recorded here. Then comes the first assessments, a good many Sacks has written about here. Among other topics Sacks describes the connection between various medical conditions and music, including Cochlear damage AmnesiaDementiaDepressionAutismWilliamson Syndrome.This popular science book allows non scientists an opportunity to know something intelligent about music and the brain."
25,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6991670-bob,4,"Summary: Renowned neurologist Oliver Sacks chronicles the neuroscience of music–the various ways music affects the brain, and the unusual effects of various neurological conditions on our perception, performance, and experience of music.Oliver Sacks died on August 30 of this year. A few months earlier, my son gave me this book, and it seemed especially appropriate to pull it off the “to be read” pile and acquaint myself with the work of this neuroscientist and physician. Before opening the book, I had one of those heart-stopping moments as I found myself staring at the cover picture of Sacks and thought I was looking at a doppelganger! I guess balding men with graying beards, glasses and a certain shape of head can look a bit like each other.What Sacks does is chronicle the fascinating ways music and the brain interact and some of the unusual conditions that involve unusual responses to music. In the course of this book he explores a range of phenomena beginning with a sudden onset of musical interest following a lightening strike, the ways music might evoke seizures or suppress the tics of Tourettes or the shaking of Parkinson’s. He wonders whether the advent of iPods will result in more brainworms–those tunes we can’t get out of our heads.He describes musical hallucinations, where one hears music in one’s head even when none is playing.He explores musicality from tone deafness to perfect pitch (which occurs more in musical families and where musical training begins early) and synesthesia, where music is associated with color. He explores the connections between music, memory and movement. He describes Clive, who because of brain infection that affected his temporal lobes lives in a perpetual present with no memory of past moments. Yet somehow he remembers music he knew in the past.Perhaps a highlight of the book was his description of a camp for people with Williams syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects the development of the brain resulting in low IQs and yet incredible verbal and musical skills. He describes the delight these people had in talking and making music with one another.In one of the concluding chapters he describes the work done with Alzheimer’s patients and how, for them as well, music is a connection to memories of the past, and an anchor to their no-longer remembered lives that is profound. He talks about “the loss of self” and how music helps Alzheimer’s patients connect to some sense of “self” when the other memories are gone.The book left me in wonder at the intricacies of the human brain and how the neural circuitry related to our perception, memory of, and making of music interact with speech, thought, emotion, and other memories. And it reminded me of the power of music–a power to evoke emotions, memories, and even to address troubling neurological conditions. It reminds me of how when I am learning, singing and performing a piece of music, I find myself tapping into a different aspect of who I am from when I am simply speaking or writing or reading. And I found myself thankful for the life of Oliver Sacks, who cared for people with troubling conditions and brought together his love for his patients, his skills in research, and his own musicality and life history into this fascinating narrative of music and the human brain."
26,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10174911-syed-ashrafulla,1,"I know this book is cute to its readers because it makes them feel intelligent. ""Hey look at me now I understand music from a brain perspective."" This book is far far too narrow to pull that off. It's actually a terrible message to send to readers that music is inherently related to brain damage. The obvious question to ask is whether every good musician is mentally damaged, a question to which Sacks would answer yes apparently. He continually insinuates that great musicians probably had small mental issues which were a side effect of their genius.That is just bad bad storytelling. I am not knocking anecdotal evidence; anecdotal evidence is very strong because unlike controlled experiments anecdotal evidence is data found in real-life with the conditions of real-life rather than contrived conditions. I am knocking the construction that Sacks makes between music and deformed brain conditions. This doesn't account for the numerous musicians who do not have a defect yet still show the same musical abilities. The lack of a counterfactual is because Sacks is a neuroclinician; he's not going to see people who have non-pathological brains.This is a very frustrating point to make because it is fairly obvious to me. If a mental condition is associated with music it implies that a) music requires the sacrifice of mental faculties, and b) those who have non-pathological brains are insinuated to be ""lesser"" musical beings. Neither of these things are true and neither of these things make any sense whatsoever. Yet somehow Sacks and his readers (the book I read was a new edition with notes from multiple readers) find it fascinating that there is this association which doesn't exist. I disliked the entire message of this book, which is why I downgraded it so much."

I loved how Dr. Sacks covered many different items relating to clinical aspects of music on different kinds of people. Indeed this book is for those who love brains and neuroscience, yet I think it stresses on the importance of music for everybody. "
28,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna,3,"This is nonfiction neuroscience.....about the brain and music and how each of them can effect the other. Some of the science was fascinating. I also enjoyed the plethora of (case studies) stories the author cited. All the examples were different. I really felt for some of these patients because some of this sounded like awful afflictions, not a gift. "
29,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2658311-notgettingenough,0,"I wrote to Sacks just after starting this, suddenly thinking he was the man to answer a question I'd been asking musicians for years.When I was little I played violin and piano to a high standard, but although I was technically supposed to be equal in both, the fact is I was a fine violinist and a crap pianist. I never really liked the piano. Being lefthanded, it never surprised me that I was good at the violin, since, after all, the left hand does more or less everything whilst the right hand saws away with the box. Righthanded violinists hate it when you say this. They all think sawing away is the important bit, but obviously it isn't.When I was first learning the violin, my parents wondered if I should learn on a left-handed violin, so that I was playing as a righthander would. Luckily they did not choose that path for me.However. I have subsequently had an idea that this is exactly what they should have done for me as a pianist. In general the left hand, the bass, goes boom, boom, and the right hand does all the work. So quite clearly, it suddenly seemed to me some years ago, if I'd been able to play piano in reverse, maybe I would have felt it was part of me, the way I did the violin. Maybe I wouldn't have sucked at piano.Nobody has ever answered this question for me, much as everybody thinks it is interesting.However, just yesterday at lunch, Luke, a man with an IPhone and a net connection looked it up and now there is a pianist, lefthanded, who felt exactly as I did. Christopher Seed, an accomplished professional pianist decided he'd play even better if his left hand could do all the work.Question answered, though more data would be ince.Sacks never responded. I'm still going to read the book, but."
30,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/614700-k,2,"I had been meaning to read this book for years, mostly to know what a well regarded trade book about music and brain pathology looked like. You see, I'm interested in discourses of madness and disability and Sacks seemed like a good place to start. But wow... ""The man who mistook his patients for a literary career"" is right! Many people admire Oliver Sacks, and I don't begrudge them that sentiment, but as someone both heavily invested in music and disability politics, this book is disturbing. Why is a solely intellectual engagement with music viewed as a deficiency? I'm also really troubled by his clear bias towards Western art music. The discussion of absolute pitch was especially glaring in this regard, but it's clear to me that Sacks never once questioned the narrow musical tastes of either himself or his patients. Apart from the chapter on Tourette Syndrome and drumming, there's almost no discussion of any popular music, or for that matter, non-Western music. At all. Considering how tiny the Classical music audience is in comparison with everything else, how can we actually talk about such essential arguments about brain function when the only examples are coming from one very small set of practices?There is a strangely derivative quality to this book. I get the impression that he decided to go back through all of his old case files and revisit all of his most favorites from the perspective of music and then spice it up with some newer findings from Diana Deutsch, Daniel Levitan, and Ani Patel. I mean, why do any new research yourself when you are that famous? I think armchair research extends to examples when scholars keep recycling decades old research. So yeah... the overwhelming feeling about this book is disappointment."
31,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/236810-rachel,5," In his characteristic compassion and curiosity Oliver Sacks looks at what seems to be the infinite ways that music interacts with our brains- from the worms that play maddeningly in our heads to the power of music as an aid in communication with people who either from birth or from stroke or other life altering situation have lost the ability to vocalize. And okay, this blows my mind, that people who otherwise cannot remember the sequence of basic routines in life, like getting up, shaving, making coffee etc. can do so once they're aided in creating a little song about it.  At one point Oliver Sacks writes that when he first encounters someone who has been struck nonverbal by stroke or epilepsy or whatever he often starts singing ""happy birthday"" to them and invariably evokes a response. There's a story of a woman who had lost the power of one of her legs, but would notice an involuntary tapping response when she was listening to jigs and other boisterous fiddle music who was able to walk again. And it goes on.  It almost seems like this is a best of Oliver Sacks, where he goes back to a life's work, from Awakenings to the Man Who Mistook His Wife for A Hat and onwards to explore the ways the music played a role in working with each individual or groups of individuals he encountered. It's a beautiful book for anyone to read. It also reminded me that once upon a time I was interested in becoming a music therapist, and so may have set me on a hopefully very good course for the next chunk of years. "

Yes, many times it became so boring that I didn't even want to continue, and yes, the idea of dropping this title came to mind multiple times. I'm glad that I didn't.Oliver sacks went over many cases that weren't even close to the condition that I have, i.e. many cases of brain tumors, seizures, anesthesia, brain strokes and infections, musical hallucinations, Williams syndrome, and so on. Most of the time the barrage of technical vocabulary became a burden to let me just continue with the stories. But at the end of covering each case, chapter, and story, Sacks reminded me this wasn't about me. This was about the beauty and magic of the music and its effect on us. There came numerous times and I needed to pause the audiobook, close my eyes and connect the dots to fill the pouch of point of view that I decided to fill at the end of the book, and boy oh boy, this was a good one!""The power of music, whether joyous or cathartic, must steal on one, unawares.

This allows him to use case studies of people with musical afflications and neurological disorders to tell stories of the amazing complexities and mysteries of the human brain and the profound mysteries of music from a scientific perspective, but mostly the more mysterious, and absolutely inexplicable, ways in which music affects the brain.In Musicophilia, Dr. Sacks has provided a thoroughly fascinating journey into music and the mind. If you are a lover of music and are the least bit curious to know just a little bit more about how music affects and can affect our human brains, this book is a delightful must read."

After a read of the preface, afterward, and several chapters, I thought I'd better abandon it. 　　 The book seemed to me a mere collection of anecdotes without scientific researches nor proofs. In addition, there was nothing about ""being musical"" - those integrated human potentials/capabilities - but a (sudden) love or passion for music. Music, being abstract by nature and a bit like languages, has infinite varieties. Sacks overly simplified a subject of aesthetics, tastes, emotions, and thoughts. His 360-page sketch on weird music maniacs might be interesting in the beginning but soon turned into a bore. I didn't see anything musical or neurological.At its best, the book could serve as a case reference manual for capable neurologists. And I strongly believe basic knowledge in musicology is a must. Other than that, it is just an upgraded text to fascinate those who are happy about the sort of Mozart-makes-your-baby-smarter tales."
39,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56464899-joseph-vanburen,3,"Very fascinating subject matter in a poorly executed book. If you enjoy learning about how the brain processes music, especially in people with various mental disorders, this book is worth reading. There are a few things about it that I did not like: 1. Though the stories are about interesting people, the writing is mostly dry and lifeless. 2. There is no logical flow of narrative throughout the book. It just seems like a bunch of related essays thrown together. 3. In these stories about people with uncommon conditions, Sacks insists on referring to those without the condition as ""normal."" This seems like insensitive language for a professional to be using. 4. Sacks constantly plugs his other books. Constantly. These complaints aside, I was happy to read this book if only to be introduced to the story of Clive Wearing. There is a great video on Youtube about him that I found because of this book. So I am grateful for that. I don't think I'll be reading any other books by Sacks, even though I now know all their titles by heart."
40,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4763420-kaelan,2,"Auden once called Awakenings (Sacks' sophomore effort) a masterpiece. So I expected a lot from Musicophilia—a book which combines my (aficionado) interest in music with my (amateur) interest in neuroscience. I was indeed fascinated by the ailments described therein, but found the writing dry, formulaic and even a bit sloppy. (On occasion, Sacks repeats—verbatim—a previous passage, suggesting some cut-and-paste style edits.)Every chapter (i.e., case study) began the same way, with a quaint description of the patient (e.g., ""Tony Cicoria was forty-two, very fit and robust, a former college football player who had become a well-regarded orthopedic surgeon in a small city in upstate New York""), followed by a page or so on the issues that led the patient to seek medical attention, Sacks' correspondences with the patient and then a general overview of the science. Ten or so patients in and, despite the neurological particularities, they all started to blend together."

I always feel I learn something from Sacks, and this book is no different in that respect. Now finished. I love Sacks. I always learn something. His 'stories' or examples are terrific. And there is an underlying humanity to him that always seems to understand what is good about someone, no matter how serious the neurologic, etc. defect. In this book, he explores the power of music and how it can make life almost acceptable for folks with Alzheimers or some other neurological problem. But this book is more than that, and if you have interest in music and or liked ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,"" then this book is worth the time."

While this book does contain some interesting, and sometimes gripping stories about real people and their gifts and struggles and how music has helped them in different ways, the author drenches these stories in talk about frontal lobes and cortexes, making the material all but inacessible for people other than those with degrees in neurology.I did not finish the book, and after a few chapters I found myself looking at the index, skimming through chapters that sounded interesting and eventually abandoning the book altogether."

He is passionate about music, and so am I (as a listener, I am not a performer). I expected to be more engrossed with this book than I was. Perhaps it didn't cover quite as much unfamiliar ground for me as most of his other books have, and I was therefore interested, but not riveted by it.It's still vey good.

Just one anecdotal story after another about someone who has a brain injury (or insult as he puts it) and the effect on their perception of music.Gets boring real fast. Not very interesting, and only anecdotal in nature. No introduction, no conclusion. Simply too many short stories in succession and then the book abruptly ends. I would rather have fewer stories with more depth. I could not recommend this book. Want to read a good book on this topic try ""This Is Your Brain On Music""."

The premise seemed interesting and I’ve never read anything by this author, so I thought it would be an excellent opportunity. This is essentially a compilation of stories that Sacks explains with very little scientific basis. The author reports several cases that he had observed or read in articles. It becomes quite repetitive and boring at times. Also, you never truly understand what actually exists has scientific evidence between music and the described diseases. It is interesting, but not brilliant. For me, the ratting was 2.5."

While the book was certainly enjoyable to read, it fell a little flat for me. Sacks is a very good writer and storyteller - he has a great deal of warmth and compassion that combines well with his clinical knowledge and scientific assessments. However, Musicophilia lacks any strong unifying themes or arguments beyond how fascinating and complex the human brain's musical mechanisms and capacities are. Sacks does not delve terribly deep into any of the issues raised by his collection of stories, or into what they can tell us about the role of music in human development and existence. In addition, as other reviewers have noted, Sacks' stories are heavily centered on people whose experiences (pathological or otherwise) center on western classical music. Perhaps this is an artifact of when and where Sacks practiced medicine, but I would have liked more of an effort to discuss how these symptoms would play out in people whose main musical activities and tastes centered around jazz or popular music, and also how these same disorders manifest in other parts of the world where the music and musical culture is very different."
48,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11735735-in-s-draaijer,2,"Musicophilia started off as a really interesting book about a topic that I hadn't read much about and so I was really eager to learn from. The book explores a lot of particular conditions and brain functions related to the perception of music and is really complete in this regard. However, I soon grew weary of the way too many anecdotes that Mr. Sacks presents in order to reinforce the many theories that are presented. Soon I found myself skipping through them just to get to the next chapter and learn something new, and this just became a process too tiring to keep up until the end of the book, so I left it at 50%. Maybe someday I will finish it and complete this review but, for now, it has left me with the sensation that I am just wasting too much time in exchange of some tidbits of real knowledge here and there."
49,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7792186-ma-a,3,"I like Sacks's way of telling a story. The anecdotes are intriguing, full of life, and offer a way for more in-depth studies. As far as educational value goes, it's not as informative as I'd like. But gosh, I'd like to have known this man! "
50,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27348874-sagar-vibhute,4,"I'm a musical person. Doesn't mean I'm working on concert piano pieces or mastering the jazz trumpet, but music is a part of everyday life. I usually plug into music during work - this depending on what work I'm doing can be either a distraction or the complete opposite and totally shut out everything except my work - or when reading, or working out, or traveling on the bus (a game of mine is to match the beat of the song with hitting a pothole or speed bump, yes so much fun, OK back to the review now) and this is of course not unique to me. Feet tapping, finger snapping, humming, pretend dancing ... the works ... most of us do these when listening to music. Put on a favorite song of yours and you'll know everything about it as if the song were walking out of your brain: The exact moment when the drums roll in, the crazy guitar solo note-for-note, of course the lyrics ... we can do this for hundreds of songs, but we don't really memorize them bit by bit. The song just gets in and stays there.For many of us it is harder to do this 'recreation' if the song is not playing along side, unless the song has burrowed into your brain and you can 'hear' it every waking second, exactly the way it sounds coming out of the music player. Now, I also fiddle around on my guitar a bit - it is near impossible for me to translate the notes I'm hearing quite clearly in my head onto the correct sound on the guitar. If instead I'm hearing the song, from a music player and my ears are involved, the same task is quite simple.There are hundreds of such oddities I can think about my own musical experience, some big while some almost too small to be noticed. After having read Musicophilia I can also safely say that as puzzled as I am by the outcome of my small experiments, the manner in which music profoundly affects lives is at the very least humbling in so many ways that are so difficult to comprehend. The savants who can't tell you the time of the day but can recreate note-for-note any complex classical song, retrograde amnesiacs whose lives have been transformed in a small but important way by remembrance through music, discovering the lost ability of meaningful speech through song lyrics ... there are hundreds of such heart-warming stories throughout the book. People whose lives have been enriched by music, or in some cases completely torn apart by it.The book of course isn't about the stories alone. Oliver Sachs does equal justice to his neurologist self along side his musical one, delving into the medical research on nearly all of these cases, their causes, effects, symptoms and more. Sachs draws from his personal experience, experiences of his colleagues, patients that he has seen and even case histories from around the world in his field.Fantastic book. Loved it all through."
51,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1758594-patrick-gibson,3,"I hear music on color. Doesn’t everyone? Mozart is blue; Bach canary yellow; Mahler is purple and maroon; Berlioz lime and Elgar is beige. Stravinsky is a Jackson Pollok and Janacek is a Rothko. I know you know what I mean.Since my life has one of the longest continually running soundtracks on record “Musicophobmyass” seemed like it should be something in a major key for me. It has a few wrong notes but by and large it is a pleasant minor opus. More like Barber’s “Essay for Orchestra” than Verdi’s “La Forza.”Like all of his books, Sacks records some interesting cases and expounds equally interesting theories and hypothesis. I did find out why “Turkey in the Straw” gets stuck in my head after the ice cream truck goes by. You can pick and choose your interest as you read—there is no sequential flow to the book. This means you can open it up and start singing—I mean reading—anywhere the conductor gives you a downbeat.For me, the Overtures opening measures (first case) were the most interesting: the doctor who was struck by lightning and began composing classical music is quite amazing. I am definitely going out in more thunderstorms because theory was my worst subject. Sacks take on savants, however, was only slightly more interesting than something on the Discovery Channel. He’s covering some pretty broad strokes here (an art metaphor, damn) so I’m not complaining.Dyskinesia, cantillaion and aphasia anyone? I bought this book because I noticed a chapter on music therapy and Parkinson Disease and I found it enlightening (i.e. quite a few ‘ah-hah’ moments). Once you read the book through, you will probably find yourself going back to specific sections for a re-read (this would be :// in musical terms).I was hoping the chapter on ‘Musical Madness” would explain why opera singers are so dyspeptic. Did you know there are people who have seizures upon hearing even a few notes of music? Wow, and I thought it was just from Neil Diamond.Tchaikovsky flows in various shades of crimson; Haydn puce (not a big fan) and Bruckner is Presbyterian (if that were a color). “Musicofeelmehearmeseeme” is a masque in many scenes. High notes, low notes, loud and soft. Pick your own tempo.Did you know I once mistook my hat for a wife?"
52,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/241691-kay,3,"This book wasn't what I'd hoped it would be, but it was fairly interesting, nonetheless. I was hoping it would be more of a general exploration of how the brain processes and perceives music, but the emphasis here is largely on neurological case studies, many of them recycled from Sacks' previous books such as An Anthropologist on Mars, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, and The Island of the Colorblind, all of which I have read and enjoyed at various times but which, frankly, I hadn't needed or wanted to hear about again. However, Musicophilia did strike a chord (pun intended) in many ways as it made me think more deeply about my own involvement with music and my own brain's peculiarities, limitations, and features. Sacks is a tireless explorer and chronicler of his own mind, and at times I wished I possessed his tenacity of purpose. What intrigued me most was his hypothesis that when one hemisphere or portion of the brain is damaged, other sections may ""step it up"" to compensate. Indeed, the examples he provided of how patients coped with and adapted to extremely debilitating conditions were fascinating and heartening. As I age and deal with hearing issues, for example, it is useful to understand the mechanisms behind hearing loss and to learn of how others cope with far more striking afflictions. While many of the cases that Sacks details are interesting, about halfway through the book hearing of one case after another became repetitive. What I was hoping for, but never really got, was a deeper analysis of how the ""normal"" brain perceives and relates to music. His neurological patients are the exception, not the norm, and he focuses almost exclusively on fairly talented (or, indeed, brilliant) classical performers and composers. There are few examples of people involved in, say, jazz or rock. This reflects Sacks' own interests and experiences, of course, but it seemed like a significant shortcoming.Ultimately, I couldn't really complain, though, as the title says it all: this is a collection of 
tales
 of music and the brain. The book does not claim to be a comprehensive examination of the topic. "
53,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13239516-kara-of-bookishbytes,3,"Musical instincts are universal, but we do not understand why. Nor do we understand how the brain processes music. Mr. Sacks is a neurologist with decades' worth of patients and in this book he has collected the stories of some of his patients and other people he has met whose brains give some insight into how we process music. Some of the stories focus on savants with fantastic musical abilities, but who are incapable of taking care of themselves. Some of the stories focus on regular people who've suffered an injury or illness and become suddenly far more musical than they ever were before. There are stories of people who are serious musicians but then lose their musical sense or skill. There are stories of people who hallucinate music and synesthetes who ""see"" or taste music. And there are stories of people who appear to be completely or partially devoid of musical sense or skill.The stories are quite interesting, frankly, but eventually I wanted more than just stories. I wanted some conclusions or wisdom to apply to my life. So by the end of the book, I became bored and finished it quickly. Several times during my reading of Musicophilia I felt that I would have benefited from having a broader base of classical music knowledge. (All of the patients described in the book were classical musicians, none were popular musicians, that I can recall.) I imagine that this book would have greater interest for those who have more musical background than I do. My five years of piano lessons still left me feeling like I had no context for several of the anecdotes."
54,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12690693-jim-goodrich,4," This book contains a collection of clinical case histories and fascinating anecdotes that highlight the relationship between music and the brain. The book doesn't just focus on positive association with music: it also explores cases where people have had neurological damage that leads to conditions such as amusia (the inability to recognize musical tones) or where the person suffers from musical hallucinations that plague them incessantly. The section on absolute pitch was particularly interesting as he went into more depth about some of the related causes such as how it is much more frequent in people that speak tonal languages and also more common in people that were blind early in life. The neural plasticity of the brain that reclaims the part of the cortex dedicated to vision and uses it to heighten other senses is also discussed. Furthermore, Sacks discusses cases of synesthesia where people see colors or experience certain tastes when they hear music. He also tells the story of a man named Clive Wearing who can't form any new memories and who has forgotten nearly all of his past memories. For him, every moment is experienced as if he has just awoken. He kept volumes of diary entries in which he would repeatedly say he had just awoken for the first time. However, interestingly he could still play and improvise on the piano. I could go on and on about all of the interesting facts and stories in this book. I will be reading more of Oliver Sacks books."
55,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65436618-sophy-h,3,"3.5 stars for this I think. Oliver Sacks' books are always a joy to read and he comes across as a really caring, nurturing, compassionate individual, with lots of time and empathy for his patients and people he meets through his work. Musicophilia was interesting and told tales of the weirdly wonderful, however I think that the 3.5 stars comes from the subject matter being fairly narrow. Whereas The Man Who Mistook His Wife For a Hat is varied and diverse in clinical cases and thereby held my undivided attention; Musicophilia deals purely with music related cases, some of which feel similar and therefore a little repetitive. The subject matter is still fascinating but I did feel my brain drifting distractedly at times! The section on earworms or brainworms (pieces of music that get stuck in your head and repeat over & over) was by far the most interesting as I get them a lot!! The only bugbear I have with Mr Sacks is his overuse of voluminous footnotes! Half a page sometimes of teeny tiny little writing that feels as though you're reading a whole separate mini book! Anyhoo, if you're a musician or a chorister or musically minded, you'll no doubt find this book amazing. If you're just wanting something unusual, check out the brainworm chapter! Enjoy!"
56,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/124136-pamela,3,"I've never read any of Sacks's other collections, so perhaps Musicophilia rates so highly with me because I've never read The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat. Despite Sacks's overwhelming bias towards classical music as the only kind of music worth discussing as well as his suspicious extensive personal history of music-related neurological phenomena, I found this collection to be an interesting and diverse set of case studies. I'm kind of a sucker for psychological and neurological oddities, so I found Sacks's range of patients (from a guy whose musicality began after he was struck by lightning to a music camp for children with Williams Syndrome) fascinating. If you read this collection straight through, you may be at risk for Musicophilia exhaustion (e.g. ""We get it—music can have a profound affect on people""), but taken bit by bit, these case studies are a treat."
57,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1178748-ibrahim,3,"Anybody can read Oliver Sacks; he is not dense to read but, if anything, he is the kind that you start reading and want to read some more, and more, and more, and he keeps you engaged by the stories he tells. At the same time, you know that you are for sure in the presence of a scientist, a neurologist, a scholar of the finest kind who meets us all at the point where we are in all humility and great sense of humor that comes so natural to him.Still, I really expected more out of this book that I am not getting. Like Paul Bryant, my friend here on goodreads, I get the feeling someone calls up Dr Sachs and says ""I found a good one for you, over in Montana, twin 70 year old sisters who all talk backwards and live in a house they made out of Herman's Hermits albums"" and Dr Sachs is out of the door already, flagging down the nearest taxi, his laptop aquivering."
58,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/664522-jim,0,"Have just dipped in to this, another excellent entry from humanist neurologist Oliver Sacks. This book deals with music and its effect on the brain and by extension on our lives as humans. Sacks has the ability to take you inside states of mind that you might not have been able to imagine before. What puts him a cut above is his passionate humanism. He is always interested in the people he treats, not as clinical subjects, but as complicated and beautiful people with long histories, loves, hates, and deep personalities. His goal is always to free the person from whatever debilitating brain problems they might be experiencing. Here, that is sometimes accomplished with music. The stories are many and varied. Looking forward to a rewarding read."

I stood out because I swayed left when the choir swayed right, clapped out of time, and my singing was considered remarkable, but not in a good way. All this is to say that I have the musical talent of a jellyfish. Oliver Sacks shows how music affects the brain, and vice versa. This is fascinating, especially when he draws on experiences from his own distinguished career as a neurologist, and those of his colleagues, as he did in most of his other books.If you love music and understand all the musicological terminology, all the better. But even a jellyfish can enjoy it."

I might also look into the audiobook so that I might be exposed to the material again.I highly enjoyed the parts specific to those with Autism, Williams Syndrome, and Tourettes. I have witnessed a young boy become alight through music when he might otherwise be (nearly) nonverbal. I suspect him to possess perfect pitch and look forward to more of his milestones.Additionally, I liked the tales about those with Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and dementia having some alleviation via music. As always I love Sack's writing and material. It feeds curiosity and often brings hope. It more than just interesting."
61,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21381864-anatoly,3,"Dr. Sacks was an amazing storyteller and the book is filled with interesting anecdotes and facts and is very well written. But, at times I felt a bit lost. I don't think you need a background in neuroscience in order to appreciate or understand the book, but a knowledge in music will definitely make the read a lot more flowing. Again. you don't have to have the knowledge (it`s not a book about Musicology) but at least for me at times I felt lost when reading about octaves and rhythm (just a small example).But still, a very enjoyable read and I will absolutely continue reading more of his great and important work. "
62,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/321673-jamie-collins,3,"An interesting book, probably even more so for people more musically inclined than I am.I was most fascinated by the stories of patients with severe amnesia or dementia who were able to recall songs or play music quite well; as if musical memory were stored in a separate, undamaged portion of the brain. Also very interesting were the theories on why only some people have perfect pitch, and the stories of people with Williams Syndrome, who are gregarious, verbally expressive and often very musical, while having IQs so low that they can’t count to five or draw a simple geometric figure."
63,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5142696-jeff-crompton,4,"This book is filled with amazing stories about the connection between music, the brain, and our sense of self. The stories are interesting, sometimes inspiring, and often frankly terrifying. In the latter category are the accounts of involuntary musical hallucinations, focal dystonia (which sometimes ends the careers of musicians), amusia (the inability to respond to music), and amnesia. Sacks perhaps covers too much ground and doesn't delve deeply into the various subjects, but his book is certainly interesting to anyone who loves music."
64,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11387686-carrie-ann,4,"A wonderfully eye-opening book about the power of music. It's a must-read for music therapists, but as a music educator, I found it to be valuable as well. It helped me to realize that I may have students with special conditions that make it difficult to nearly impossible for them to be successful at a task I give them in music class. With this in mind, I can be more sensitive to the wide range of neurological packaging each child comes with. The stories are truly remarkable and really highlight how undeniably important, powerful and valuable music is to the brain."

This propensity to music -this ""musicophilia""- shows itself in infancy, is manifest and central in every culture, and probably goes back to the very beginnings of our species'This book, topic of musical brain was more intimidate,due to the author, Oliver Sacks' personal love/understanding for music (classical). As someone with not much musicality, but non-the-less, very fond of classical music, I was envious when the author explained 'absolute pitch' (not author), being able to hear whole symphony in your head (Dr. Sacks senior), and play full Mazurka by Chopin. It is like you have another type of sense- wonder what music would sound like with such ability.The book does not explain how 'normal (typical)' brain works with music (or function of music to let us to enjoy it), rather he explains abnormal brain and music. How music helps with certain difficulties with damaged or atypical brain (dementia, autism). Also how our musical brain can go wrong; brain-worm, music hallucination. It was surprising to see how 'musicality' can come out with such a wide range of brain anatomy and functions."
69,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1870260-ninny,4,"I bought this years ago at the secondhand book market on the South Bank and finally decided to read it after being reminded of the Imagine program that was made to tie in with its original publication in 2007. In it, the presenter (Alan Yentob) takes part in an experiment wherein his brain is viewed via MRI while he is listening to different kinds of music - one he is indifferent to, one he actively dislikes, and a piece of music he feels a strong emotional connection to. When they played him the latter - an aria from Madame Butterfly - the image of his brain lit up like a firework as it flooded with blood. This has stayed with me for well over 10 years, as I am one of those people who couldn't imagine a world without music and don't understand people who don't feel an intense emotional connection to certain songs and melodies. The book is Sacks' usual standard - anecdotes about patients of his, or ones of his contemporaries, whose specific pathology he finds interesting but nonetheless manages to retain their individualism and humanity while describing their various neurological issues. He was as gifted a writer as he was a physician. "
70,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37650802-kara,4,"Musicophilia unites two of my favorite topics, neurology and music — plus it's written by Oliver Sacks — so I knew I was going to like it. This book is an excellent investigation of the power of music on a neurological level, and how it can either be enhanced or go awry under various circumstances. Musicophilia is a denser read than some of his other texts, and even though the chapters are on the shorter side I found myself have to take a break every few chapters to absorb the information and give my brain a break. Having some level of familiarity with both neurological and musical concepts/terminology will be helpful to readers, as Sacks focuses more on the individual cases than on background information. You don't need to be an expert, but I don't think I'd recommend this book if you're just beginning your foray into neurology."
71,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54399136-jessica,4,"Musicophilia is another delightful collection of Oliver Sacks' essays through which he examines the relationship between music and universal human activities. As most other Sacks' books, this one is an amalgamation of personal anecdotes, case histories, theories, and empirical research. Some of the topics covered in this book include non-stop musical hallucination, musical synesthesia, music and brain development, tonal aphasia, hearing loss and/or damage, music therapy, music and physical performances, etc. As someone who grew up playing the piano, I find this book particularly interesting and relatable. In my totally biased opinion, it deserves 4 solid stars from me. However, people who aren't as familiar with the classical music might miss references made to specific piece of music or classical composers (and there are a lot of them) in this book. "
72,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/889171-alesa,4,"I really enjoyed this book about the neurology of music, and learned a lot. I have been intrigued with music lately, and have been studying different facets of it. Some of the medical information in the book was a bit over my head. Also, the author focuses mostly on strange neurological phenomena, rather than on how ordinary humans experience, remember, enjoy and understand music.Sacks poses a lot of questions, such as why humans have such a universal passion for music (and other species don't). Or why music can be such a powerful force for healing. Or why we get tunes stuck in our heads. But I didn't really feel that he answered them -- or at least, not in a way that a lay person could understand."
73,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/976531-angie,4,Super interesting stuff! Easily understandable. Sometimes I wanted more information about the brain functions that explained what was happening to the people in the case histories. I think sometimes there wasn’t enough because the experts don’t know yet either. There was quite a bit though. Super-intriguing! I do have a small disquiet now about all the many and varied way one’s brain can go awry. 😬 I listened to this from Penguin Audio read by John Lee and was at first annoyed by the reader’s accent and over-annunciation. It didn’t take me long to become use to his way of spiraling though. Production very good. 
74,0676979785,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1177657-carrie,4,"Sacks is a perennial favorite of mine and I love everything he wrote. His approach to music and the brain is more academic than usual, and at times I had trouble grasping the deeper meaning because of my lack of formal music education. Playing guitar in mass and fiddling with my family's piano as a kid didn't prepare me for the technical passages. Still, as usual his writing pulls you in and shares the profound mystery of the human mind like no one else can."

It’s a good mix between thought-provoking tales and scientific explanations and theories. I will say, you need a healthy interest in abnormal disorders, psychology, neuroscience, music, or some combination of those topics to really stick with the book. Sacks does do a good job of making it read like a story most of the time while still exercising his scientific knowledge throughout."

Somehow it seems to lack the warmth of Sacks' other work, feeling more like a collection of dry case studies, and I struggled with it.

I guess stories about people who music-related neural problems can only go so far. The stories get more interesting when they involve other neurological issues like amnesia and other issues.

I like listening to music, but a very narrow type of music. Classical music just sounds like tinkle, tinkle, tinkle to me. I don't know what an interval is, musically speaking. He doesn't really explain anything, but just assumes you're at least partially a musicophile. It just missed for me, and it's certainly my loss."
