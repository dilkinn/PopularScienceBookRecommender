Even though I was already familiar with research behind habit formation, reading through this book helped me approach habits I’m trying to adopt or break in my own life from different angles.But the book suffers from the same problems that seem to plague all self-help books. In the chapter about tracking habits, the author shares an anecdote about Benjamin Franklin’s habit of carrying a journal everywhere to track thirteen virtues. If you care to know more about that story, Franklin tried to make a habit of his thirteen virtues by turning it into a thirteen week course where he would work on a different virtue every week and track his progress. The author conveniently leaves out the fact that Franklin quickly found this method impractical and abandoned the project before getting through all thirteen virtues. There’s a lot of irony in including this anecdote in a chapter that talks about the importance of not “breaking the chain”. So while the author isn’t entirely wrong, I found it off-putting that he would retell this story in a manner that fit his narrative. This is a vice that is found all too commonly in self-help and pop science books that make you question the author’s intellectual rigour.Another criticism I have of this book is that it could have been even shorter. The last few chapters under “Advanced Tactics” that deal with the topic of mastery were the weakest in the book. While there is an obvious connection between habits and mastery, trying to tie in a topic as complex as mastery was perhaps too ambitious.The three star rating I am giving this book doesn’t reflect how important I consider habits to be. I completely agree with the author that habits are the cornerstone of your life. If you want to change your life in any meaningful way, the only dependable way I know is to build good habits. If you need convincing that habits are important, I would strongly recommend this book. If you are already convinced but struggling to adopt or break habits, racing through this book will give you some good ideas about how you can make changes stick."

This book is filled with practical steps and examples. Yes, there are plenty of habit-building books out there (just as there are plenty of diet books but yet there are still more new books published every year). Plenty of people are seeking the right book that resonates with them. The key points in this book are:* Compound Effect - Very small changes over time will have a big impact.* Habit Building Techniques - Make good habits into routines; use positive reinforcements and other techniques outlined in the book.* Monitor and Measure - Keep track of your progress and improvements."

You fall to the level of your systems.""- The best way of building a habit is making it part of your identity.- Make it easy to start: Habits are the entry point - not the goal. ""Read 30 books"" ⇒ ""Read before bed every night"" ⇒ ""Read one page"". Reduce a habit into a 2-minute first step.- Stick to the plan: ""Professionals stick to the schedule, amateurs let life get in the way."" Don't be a ""fair weather runner"" if you want to run a lot.- Make it hard to do the things you want to avoid.Most modern ""American self-help books for engineers or entrepreneurs"" (it is a category for me) are too repetitive and too long. Atomic Habits is not! It does have the category-required set of stories of American (mostly men) who built a great habit and got to the top - but just the right amount. ----- NOTES -----*Identity*The three levels of change - the lower the more ""fundamental"":3.

This book, Atomic Habits, has a completely different approach. James Clear focused on writing a book that goes deep into every single step of habit creation from a practical point of view. At the end of the day, who we are and what we will achieve depends so much on these small habits that we do every day. James Clear argues, that focusing only on improving those habits will lead to much bigger changes and accomplishments.My top 3 takeaways from this book are:* Forget about goals, focus on the system instead.* Change your identity to change your habits.* Motivation is overrated. Design the environment to support your habits.From this book, I distilled 21 strategies and principles on habit creation, and also I wrote a detailed book summary that you can read here: https://www.mentorist.app/books/atomi..."

Atomic also in one regard: As long as it works, it´s perfect down to the smallest part, each atom. If it fails, it´s radioactive and self cannibalizing, -destructing- and demotivating. To exaggerate, we can develop great working, social. and creative habits or destroy ourselves with neuroticism going haywire, find great ways to optimate oneself or madness, just read anecdotal filled pop psychology/science/philosophy books one can read without the danger of the hard work of really changing something or choose the difficult way and this book.The 1st Law Make it obviousRepetition and consequence, as if it wasn´t so shamefully obvious, is one of the key elements to everything, a skill, foreign language, school, degrees,… and the funny thing is that successful people use learning, creativity, memo-, techniques to perfect their skills, but forget the motivational, critical thinking, analytic retrospection, optimization, meditation-,… techniques, and, most importantly, to recapitulate, criticize oneself, let others criticize oneself, reflect, and develop. There is always some space left toward top performance but without modifying or even changing habits, they won´t be possible and nothing is more painful than stopping a working, well known, perfected, but ineffective habit, using an oldfashioned program, modify a schedule, use knowledge and expertise in a new, complicated, unknown way, etc. The brain is a bit bitchy, nagging, and one´s worst enemy, because it´s a lazy manipulator, not wanting one to do something that means real work for it, trying to make it feel as uncomfortable as possible, wanting easy stagnation instead of sweaty evolution. The 2nd Law and 3rd Law Make it attractive and easyAs if this wasn´t already painful and difficult enough, the self experimental subject now has to implement unused, and thereby for the crying, sobbing, angry brain very painful, new neuronal integrated circuits because, as one knows, reptile stem brain and monkeys social anxiety wants one to run far away from everything new, different, possibly dangerous. Here the inner demons have to been disguised as angels to make the whole agony as attractive as possible, a kind of hopeful masochism. Detecting the deficits has already wasted vast resources of willpower and now one doesn´t even have the legitimation to kill and destroy positive change with anger and negative emotions, but the new mind baby has to be raised next to the rascals one has to be tolerant and sympathetic towards.The 4th Law Make it satisfyingReaching this point is tricky, as one needs the stamina, perseverance, and resilience not to resign. As the old behaviors often aren´t directly harmful, just unproductive and used, they will come whispering and trying to get a hold of the subconscious mind to develop back towards the beginning. Humans are creatures of habit and whenever one just loses track and motivation for a second, their siren calls will try to lure you into old behaviors whose reminiscences are still lurking behind each screen, interaction, or working process.And as if all of this wasn´t torture enough, it should come with personal development and vivisecting one´s personality, thoughts, memories, all these things that seemingly aren´t directly related to work, too. Because hidden in the chasms of each simulated reality lies the key to boosting the occupational performance even more by eliminating all the mental corpses of complexes, childhood traumas, anxieties, phobias,… As long they are not overcome, they keep holding one down, interrupting the workflow, reducing concentration, focus, the quality of sleep,… even changing the obvious problems won´t unleash the full potential.A tip, after I´ve read a few of the most highly recommended DIY self brainwashing mind penetrating behavioral modification endeavor books for dummies, I´ve come to the conclusion that most of the theory, techniques, and schedules can easily be found during a longer google search, a Wikipedia or special wiki and Reddit, Quora walk, just using the essential keywords, bookmarking a few dozens to hundreds of pages of interest, copying the subjectively most essential and useful elements and still begin with the 1st law. But it would at least have cost you nothing. It´s getting a bit anecdotally and subjective now, even personal (cause people seem to like that stuff for whatever reason) and, of course, misanthropic, so don´t be shy to stop reading here and saving time and eye power that could be focused on reading something profound. Seriously, I´ve warned you.One of my main advantages is that I am naturally neurotic, a bit of still under control and productive, not negative elements of perfectionism, some might say soft OCD, but who listens to people, pedantic; a bit antisocial, and cold, rational, things very helpful when implementing new behavioral patterns because one doesn´t care about whatever other people think.  I am a bit biased here, because I have the, depending on the standpoint, positive or negative tendency to overachieve and excessively focus on one thing for weeks and months up to 12 or 14 hours a day, obsessive might be an understatement, let´s call it possession instead. Afterward, it´s often difficult to say how the final results, ideas, solutions paths developed, but conditioning oneself to combine focus and flow to hard fun and gamification, optional collaborative learning, yuck, might be a good alternative to just partying hard. This leads me to the extroverts that might face massive deficits in this regard, as they have the unfortunate tendency to spent much unproductive time with other people, leading to excessive, exponentially growth of sympathy, friendship, contact, dangerous pheromones, endorphins, territorial alpha behavior,… manipulating logical thinking, in the worst case not just resulting in friendships, but love, relationships, and kids bringing the distraction in your home, permanently, reproducing and multiplying it and giving it names, all things that make one ineffective, cost time. So start avoiding people, feel cold, sad, and dead inside; and whenever you are doubting, compare what the introvert vs extrovert forever achieving score lists brings in comparison, all science and technical evolution that is human history vs all BS, war, extremism, tradition, all evil isms. Doesn´t an empty, lonely life seem a small price for helping primate progress? Don´t forget thanking me for ruining your socialization with these stupid tips, lol. But seriously, social life is another prime example of habit, one becomes the people she/ he is in regular contact with and attracts more of these people, a dynamic one should not underestimate, and they all feed on you lifetime by craving for your attention, just compare how much one can get from articles and books in comparison to real life drivel filled with small talk, redundancies, errors,..., heck even the better memorization and internalization of content by social contact can be achieved with sophisticated learning techniques. To continue the isolationist standpoint (joke), it´s of course meanwhile absolutely unnecessary to make anything face to face and not in home office, VR, AR, psi transfer remote perception,... the technological singularity in general makes it more and more useless to leave the home castle.

I am always very skeptical of self help books because they often do no get to the root of issues. This one did. James Clear's main arguments are that habits are the compound interest of self improvement and that your identify emerges out of your habits. So, you must expereince a shift in identity for your habits to hold. This made a lot of sense to me, but I do think that Clear should have addresses deeper emotional issues and gave readers resources so as not to mislead them into believing that they can change their identity by action (repeating new habits) alone.

“The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. If you’re proud of how your hair looks, you’ll develop all sorts of habits to care for and maintain it. If you’re proud of the size of your biceps, you’ll make sure you never skip an upper-body workout. If you’re proud of the scarves you knit, you’ll be more likely to spend hours knitting each week. Once your pride gets involved, you’ll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits.”

 Why do I keep doing this to myself? I keep picking up these tired pop-psychology books just because they have high ratings and I keep hoping they might have something good. I should know better by now. This one was as much of a disappointment as the rest of ""personal development"" books I've read this year. It's the same superficial, regurgitated information I've been stumbling across on self-help blogs for the past 10 years. Robotic writing, highly repetitive, anecdotes taken out of context to conveniently prove the author's point, some shoddy ""science"". Most of the ideas in this have already been covered by other authors, in greater depth and with more skill. For me it read like an informational. This is essentially was this was, another platform to enhance his brand and add to his ""passive income"".The advice caters, as always, to this very specific group of people, the lifestyle-hacker extraordinaire - Tim Ferris wanna-bes.

How can I build a large collection of habits that are healthy—that are correct—and save them to RAM in my head so that I don’t have to think about them? I would like to have that done by the end of my 20s. I’d like to be in a good place in terms of body composition, in terms of what I eat, in terms of how I work, so that I can spend the rest of my life not thinking about that stuff.I heard this a few weeks before the New Year, and I got to thinking about which habits I might want to build or break in 2019. I found the perfect companion to this reflection in James Clear’s new book, Atomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Break Bad Habits & Build Good Ones.The motivating idea behind the book is that habits are the compound interest of behaviour. Get 1% better each day and you will rarely notice a change on any given day, but by the end of a year you will be 38 times better than when you started (1.01^365 = 37.8). It’s often not possible or useful to try to quantify your skill level—maybe you just want to remember to floss—but the insight is that huge long-term differences can be born from barely perceptible but consistent short-term differences. Hence, atomic habits: pennies that grow into a fortune.Clear explains that all habits, good or bad, play out in four stages:- The cue. You perceive a specific signal. You see cookies on the kitchen table.- The craving. You feel a rush of desire for a specific reward. Your mouth starts watering as you imagine the chocolate chips melting in your mouth.- The response. You perform an action. You pick up a cookie and bite into it.- The reward. You experience pleasure as your desire is satisfied. Your taste buds send gushing thank-you notes up to your brain.Each stage of this cycle is a lever you can pull to influence your behaviour. To build a good habit, pull them one way; to break a bad one, pull them the other way. This is the essence of Clear’s method.To build a good habit:- Make it obvious (the cue)- Make it attractive (the craving)- Make it easy (the response)- Make it satisfying (the reward)To break a bad habit:- Make it invisible (the cue)- Make it unattractive (the craving)- Make it hard (the response)- Make it unsatisfying (the reward)The book is broken into four sections, one for each stage of the habit cycle. Each chapter begins with a short vignette about a historical figure, and then dives into a related piece of advice. If you’ve done some thinking or reading about habit formation before, then you might be familiar with many of these ideas already. This was the case for me. However, even if you feel like you know the landscape well, I think you would find at least one actionable idea in the book. For the rest of this post, I’ll describe the ideas that I’ve implemented myself since reading it.Habit stackingOne of the easiest ways to build a new habit is to attach it to an existing one. By resolving to start performing a new habit directly following another one that is already ingrained, you turn the old habit’s reward into the new habit’s cue; you make it obvious. After enough repetitions, the new habit is woven into your life.Last year, I developed a stable habit of doing push-ups and kettlebell swings after every 25-minute work block throughout my workday. When I read about habit stacking, I recognized an opportunity to use these existing habits as foundations for a new one: drinking more water. Now, every time I do my push-ups and kettlebell swings, I drink a small glass of water. I’m more hydrated than ever.Implementation intentionsIn a study, two groups were asked to make to-do lists, but one group was given a small tweak that resulted in them accomplishing many more tasks than the other. They were told to write down with each task the time and location where they intended to complete it. They created an implementation intention. This is another way to make a behaviour more obvious, this time by associating the action with a context that can be perceived as the cue.I’ve started writing down implementation intentions every time I add an item to my to-do list. Instead of Call the bank to order a new debit card, it’s Call the bank to order a new debit card in the living room on Saturday morning. While there are still plenty of overdue tasks on my to-do list, this new habit of writing down where and when I intend to complete each task has helped me cross a number of them off.Prime your environmentI first learned the value of this lesson three years ago when I lived in a tiny coach house in Welland, Ontario. I had always struggled to get out of bed on time, but I was teaching courses of my own for the first time and couldn’t afford to be late for class. So I came up with a solution. Each night before bed, I prepared my stovetop espresso maker and put it on the stove, alongside a clean mug and my phone (my alarm). When my alarm started ringing, I had to get out of bed and walk over to the stove to turn it off. Immediately, I would turn on the stove element and go back to bed for a snooze. Ten minutes later I would be woken again by the gurgling of the espresso, as well as the fear that it would boil over if I didn’t get up to turn off the element. My reward for getting up the second time was a fresh cup of coffee. Ever since then I’ve been completely cured of my snoozing habit.As Clear explains, priming your environment for its next use is a great way to make a desirable behaviour more obvious as well as easier. After reflecting on this, I’ve been experimenting with a few changes:- Pumping up my bike tires as soon as I get home from my evening bike commute. (This makes it easier to choose the bike as my mode of transport the next day.)- Repacking my gym bag as soon as I get home from the gym. (This makes it easier to go for a work-out whenever I feel like it.)- Filling up a big water jug next to my desk at the end of each work day. (This makes it easier to stay hydrated the next day. Note that putting the water jug there also makes my drinking habit more obvious.)- Placing a novel on my pillow after making my bed each morning. (I’m trying to build the habit of reading fiction before bed because I find that it helps me sleep.)Make it smallI’ve used various habit trackers for about four years now, and I’ve just about settled on TaskLife as my favourite. I define a list of behaviours, and each day the app asks me whether I’ve done them. The beauty of it is that I can choose the frequency with which I want to perform each task, as well as the time period over which to calculate that frequency. It’s like Andy Matuschak’s system of smoothly ratcheting targets with teeth, minus a bit of smoothness and all the teeth.The most common reason that I’ve failed to hit my target frequency has been the size of my tasks—they have been too hard. For example, it’s often hard to find the time and motivation for one full hour of writing, so I would often skip that habit. Even before reading Atomic Habits, I had recognized this problem and made some changes, like cutting 60 minutes of writing down to 10. But Clear offered many more ways to break down a complex or challenging behaviour into a task that can be completed in under two minutes. Since getting started is by far the hardest part of most habits, I decided to change all my habits in TaskLife to 2-minutes-or-under tasks as a way of making it easier to spend time on the things that matter to me. Here is the current list of questions that TaskLife asks me each morning about my previous day, along with the frequency with which I aim to complete those tasks over a rolling window of 21 days:- Did you study at least one flashcard? (70%)- Did you read at least one page of fiction? (70%)- Did you write at least one sentence? (55%)- Did you read at least one Pocket article? (50%)- Did you play at least one chord on the guitar? (50%)- Did you write at least one sentence in your journal? (50%)- Did you go to bed by 9:30pm? (50%)- Did you send at least one message to a friend? (50%)- Did you read at least one page of nonfiction? (40%)- Did you walk through the doors of the gym? (25%)Automate itLastly, the easiest way to make a task easier is to delegate it to a machine. As a data scientist, I have obviously implemented this one before, too. I’ve automated my health insurance payments, my donations to charity, my bus pass top-ups, my memorization efforts, my sleep tracking, my exercise tracking, and my rebalancing calculations in my investment accounts. But there are always more things to automate, and Clear’s chapter on the subject got me to reflect on what else I could do. Since reading the chapter, I’ve set up automatic payments on all of my regular bills, and on my to-do list (with an implementation intention!) is the task of setting up automatic monthly transfers into my investment accounts.In summary, I recommend Atomic Habits. If the topic of habit formation is new to you, I think this book is probably the best general resource you’ll find. And if the topic is already familiar, you’ll find that the book is a quick and engaging read with dozens of fresh ideas that you can consider implementing in your life.This review is also posted on my website."
9,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7309374-romanas,4,"This is a dual review of two books about habit. Habits are important things in one’s life and there are numerous books on the subject. The classic book, a must read, is The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey. Another two popular books about habits are The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg and Atomic Habits by James Clear, that came out very recently. Having read all three of them I combined my notes for the last two in this post. No matter what stage in life you are, it is always good to review one’s habits and behaviour – these books provide a good framework for doing it.One of the habits I’m struggling with is to get rid of the reading of self-help books. Thus, reading The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg and parallelly Atomic Habits by James Clear became a sort of a meta enterprise. Would these self-help books about habits help me to get rid of the habit of reading self-help books? There’s nothing wrong with the self-help genre per se. I believe, everybody should strive to become a better version of themselves. Evidently, there’s a lot of great wisdom in this type of books – many prominent figured refer to them when they tell the story of their success. However, having read tons of them, one would usually circle around the same known stuff and shabby ideas wrapped in different narratives and supported by different anecdotes. The trick here is to know when to stop and, actually, go out and do something by using the knowledge and inspiration gained.My own habit of falling back to self-help books is, obviously, grounded in the alluring products of the habit loop driven by the craving for knowledge on self-improvement. We can use the basic members of the habit loop – cue, routine, and reward – well covered in the Duhigg’s book and analyse the situation with the reading of self-help books. For this type of products, the cues (triggers) are everywhere, and who can ignore the wish for excellence? Then, the routine is easily carried out – the messages in those books are straightforward that doesn’t require a very deep thinking and reading between the lines. It just assumes the acceptance in many cases, and, finally, the reward is instant – the feeling of getting something very valuable – a digested wisdom and not seldom a bit of inspiration. It can be compared to junk food (which by the way is almost gone from my life thanks to this kind of books). However, my point is not to pick on this genre, but rather to stress the importance of not getting stuck in it, as in my previous point. Habit as a phenomena humans and other living creatures are equipped with is one of my favourite subjects. I strongly believe, in the end, habits defines us and our destiny. The subject of habit covers several interesting areas as neuroscience, biology, psychology, and more. The basic mechanics of habit system can be described through the theory of operand conditioning, a term coined by B.F. Skinner back in 1930. It is a technique of learning that occurs through reward and punishment for behaviour. Through operand conditioning, an individual makes an association between a behaviour and a consequence. A relatively simple feedback loop forming habits of an individual can be described in terms of drive, stimulus, response, reward with different kind of reinforcers – positive or negative. What was lacking in the model of operand conditioning was other influencers like feelings, thoughts, and, very importantly – beliefs. Moreover, human behaviour is so complex that factors as the environment and group psychology are of crucial importance when it comes to the habit science. Modern behavioural science takes these terms into account and they are very important in the habit theory. The authors of both books did a great job addressing these factors in their respective methodologies.Based on the early theory of operand conditioning, different models around habits and behaviour (in my interpretation, behaviour is a series of actions evoked by habits) are developed and fundamental terms are just called different names. Charles Duhigg in The Power of Habit grounds his model on the habit loop consisting of cue-routine-reward parameters which are driven by craving. James Clear in Atomic Habits suggests his model consisting of four steps called cue, craving, response, and reward. These factors are systematically analysed by respective author and the steps how to build good habits and remove the bad ones based on these models are suggested. In both books I found some valuable and interesting points as well as good tips on how to keep one’s habits on the right track.As one can see from the parameters in each model, there’s a difference in the arrangement of them making some differences in application of the methodologies of habit treatment. Duhigg sees the term craving as a driving force for the members in the habit loop – cue, routine, reward. Clear suggests that craving is simply a second stage in his model of habit. This is the main difference, and I need to admit I haven’t put enough time to analyse which model is right – both make sense. We would need some deeper diving in relevant disciplines and get help from ontology of the actual things here. Anyhow, I tend to believe that a craving lies above cue, routine, and reward. Cues alone without craving are meaningless. Nevertheless, both models are very useful for working on one’s habits. Duhigg argues that the way of changing or replacing of habit is to focus on the routine parameter, or the response part according to the terminology or Clear. Clear gives a lot of examples on how the cue and reward steps can be worked on. I completely agree that even these parts can be influenced, whereas Duhigg argues that the most important thing is to focus on routine leaving cues and rewards unchanged. I believe, we can remove unwanted triggers. Like making the tempting things like candies hard to reach and out of sight, etc. This has been well researched in a very interesting work by Richard H. Thaler for which he was awarded the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2017. Then, we can reprogram our brain to think about rewards differently – change the mode of them or reinforce the distant rewards requiring immediate sacrifice by some direct reward. Clear has a lot of good examples how to do it.Habit should be seen as one of the essential parts forming an individual. A brilliant quote by Margaret Thatcher shows the operational importance of habits: “Watch your thoughts, for they will become actions. Watch your actions, for they'll become... habits. Watch your habits for they will forge your character. Watch your character, for it will make your destiny.” If we put those terms it in a different order, we can see that habits are very important, perhaps more important than one’s thoughts, because they are operational tools defining which actions one will take and what destiny those actions will form.In summary, if you are somehow unsatisfied with any of your habits and would like to actively and effectively change them and thus become an individual you’d like to be, I strongly recommend both books. I would read The Power of Habit book first, this book is longer, has more stories, and has more research behind it. Atomic Habits book is easier to get through, especially after reading Duhigg’s book. Both books, as you might have guessed, are clear, easy to read and grasp. They will give you the right mindset to approach your behaviour and provide valuable tools to shape your personality."

To create a good habit, author James Clear suggests:  - Make it Obvious - Make it Attractive - Make it Easy - Make it SatisfyingWhile at first glance these may seem overly simplistic, Atomic Habits delves into each of these concepts and also describes how these same ideas can be inverted to break bad habits. The content is easily digestible. Different parts are likely to resonate with different readers but I found a lot of helpful information in this book, especially in one of the final chapters about how to stay motivated — Mastery requires practice. ”The only way to become excellent is to become endlessly fascinated with doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.”Atomic Habits is a read I recommend for anyone trying to step up their game, in any facet of life, with the reminder that refinement and improvement are continuous, long-term processes."

James Clear wanted to read a lot of books and make a summary of the concepts he would implement for self-improvement. He also made a point in improve himself in the most hacky way possible. Instead of keeping the summary as personal notes, he published it. The fact that the author boasts about being a writer only makes it worse. You can actually smell the cheap tools he uses to put words into text and build chapters out of thin air. I wanted this book to get better, but it doesn't, up to the very end the author repeats the same choice pattern:* Tell them what you are going to tell them, tell them, tell them what you told them.* Simplify science to the border of being wrong. * Abuse of ""as such person said ___INSERT QUOTE HERE____""* Build each chapter out of unacknowledged (stolen/refurbished) concepts, coming from other writings that predate this book.The last point is particularly annoying and the book is plagued by them. He even uses the same graphics and plots as the originals! He includes verbatim whole poems by Lao Tse or writings by Seneca. At least these are attributed and not refurbished. If you are somewhat familiar with the literature, avoid this book.If you are thinking about reading this book, think about the books the author got the content from. Go and read those, you will get the original content without the coarse editing by James Clear. You will also get better foundations for growing a mindset instead of implementing hacks.Start with Why - Simon SinekMastery - George LeonardOutliers - Malcom GladwellThe Tipping Point - Malcom GladwellGetting Things Done - David AllenThe Element - Ken RobinsonBehave - Robert Sapolsky [Science communication written by experts in the field]Thinking Fast and Slow - Daniel Kahneman [Science communication written by experts in the field]"

I heard about this book from different sources which propelled me to put it on hold. My usual scepticism was pretty quickly sent to smithereens. First of all, Clear is a very good narrator, he's got a lovely voice and accent. Second, he didn't try to sell me anything.

It could be a fine book if it’s the first self-improvement book you have started to read. The science is also flawed. He presents the following elements for habit:1. Cue2. Craving3. Action4. Reward Not to mention that its a skewed copy of principles presented in Power of Habits (to authors credit, he mentions it), craving starts to appear strongly only when your brain has learned to associate the cue, action, reward which happens with repetition.

It’s something you can actually put into practice in your life. I think that all of the concepts in the book are good and useful to know but some of the action points I think are slightly oversimplified. If you take the action points in some chapters and modify them to your specific situation you can still apply most of them but you do have to do some critical thinking with the material. I like that the book is simple and straightforward. James Clear doesn’t bog you down with a lot of conceptual material. He starts each chapter with an example (some are better than others), gives you the concept plainly, and then gives you concrete actions to apply the concept in real life. It’s a nice formula. Each chapter is roughly 15-20min.This book is worth reading. It’s easy to apply the knowledge and action steps. Even if it doesn’t completely change your behavior, it will make you more aware of yourself. It provides a good lens that you can use to view yourself and others. I would recommend it to anyone who is trying to really set an airtight routine. If you follow the book you can definitely make something a habit. I’m a fan of James Clear. I have read his newsletter for about 2yrs now. His newsletter is one of the best I’ve read because it’s interesting and well researched and always has some take away for me. His book is really an expansion on a lot of things he’s covered in his newsletter. There are some chapters that I was already very familiar with because I had read his previous material on it. This doesn’t detract from the book. He expands on most things he’s written about before. The book is laid out like a road map and builds upon itself, which is something you don’t really get from the newsletter. The intro is pretty graphic. It’s about a personal injury the author has faced. I recommend being prepared for that. Once you get through that it’s all good. "

“Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.”
I've read a number of books on how to form positive habits, including The Power of Habit by Duhigg, and in my opinion, Atomic Habits by Clear ranks as the best. It covers what could be considered as ideas of common sense, but presents these ideas in a well organized and logical way. Basic concepts include the notion that you should focus not on the end goal, but rather forming the habit which will ultimately get you to your goal. The author notes that we as a society are too absorbed by short-term gratification; bad habits (like smoking or overeating) satisfy in the near term, but take us away from the person we really want to be in the long-run. Good habits, however, often involve short-term discomfort (going to the gym), but move us toward our goals over time. Other points: keep habits small at first, and again forget about short-term progress. For example, it doesn't matter how hard you work out, just so long as you go to the gym; avoid finding excuses not to go. Another: make bad habits more difficult; remove the batteries from your TV remote if you want to stop watching the tube. Also, employ the power of habit tracking for positive reinforcement. Personally, I love the HabitBull app on my phone which I use to track habits.The book shares numerous great tips. My only gripe is that the author has a habit (sorry) of stating repeatedly that more info is available on his website. After 20+ times it became annoying."

28,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,4,"A clear, practical guide to developing good habits. The information in this book is fairly solid and worth reading for most people. My only concern is whether the information is presented in a way that is effective: that is, after reading this book, what percentage of people will actually change their behavior? I suppose this is the ultimate question of all self-improvement books, but I found that this one in particular, while effective at organizing and presenting information, didn't do it in such a way that I was immediately motivated to act on it. In short, I found it to be an educational book, but not an inspirational one.However, an important note: before reading this book, I was already reasonably good at building good habits. For example, about 6 years ago, I got myself into the habit of taking notes whenever I read nonfiction, and after finishing a book, summarizing those notes on GoodReads as part of my review; in fact, that's what you're reading here right now! I've managed to keep this habit for years and have now written reviews and summaries for hundreds of other books. Oddly enough, it was this habit—writing the very notes you're reading now—that got me to act on some of the advice in Atomic Habits (namely: I'm starting a habit journal and focusing on slower progress in fitness). But if I didn't already have this habit, would this book have helped me make any changes in my life? I'm not sure.That said, it's still a useful read. Here are some of the key takeaways for me:1. Your life today is the sum of your habits.- ""Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. You get what you repeat.""- If you get your habits right, the rest will follow. Therefore, you should be more concerned with your trajectory than your current position.- The 4 stages of forming a habit are cue, craving, response, reward. The cue triggers your brain to initiate some action; the craving provides the motivation to take a specific action; the response is the action you actually take; and the reward is what you get in response for that action. For example, the cue might be a stressful day at work, which makes you crave a relief from all that anxiety, which leads to the response that you head outside and smoke, which gives you the reward of getting away from work and the relaxation you get from the cigarette. - If you want to create good habits, you need all 4 of those ingredients in sufficient qualities: you need something to trigger the habit, you need it to produce a strong enough craving to motivate you take act on that habit, the response must be easy enough that you actually do it, and the reward must be satisfying enough that you keep doing it. The inverse is also true: if you want to break a bad habit, you can do it by interfering with any of these 4 ingredients.2. Small habits add up to something big.- Small habits are like compound interest. If you keep investing, even just a little bit, over time, the returns are exponential.- The best way to form habits is typically to start small—so small, that it may seem inconsequential. To get yourself to exercise, you might start with just 5 minutes of exercise per day; to get yourself to write more, you might start with writing just 1 paragraph per day. Just about everyone can take these tiny first steps, and sticking with easy habits is, well, fairly easy. And while the initial habit mmight not have much effect, the important part is that it got you started.- To make progress, you need to continue making tiny tiny little steps forward: 1% improvements, like adding 1 more minute of exercise each week, or 1 more paragraph of writing. Again, taking small steps forward is fairly easy, but these tiny improvements can add up astonishingly fast. A 1% improvement each day may not seem like much, but it adds up to a ~37x improvement over the course of a year. Exponential progress is powerful.3. Exponential progress is hard to see, initially.- One of the trickiest things with forming habits around small steps and exponential progress is that in the early days, it's hard to see any effect at all, which can be very demotivating. E.g., You won't see much change in your body from just 5 minutes of exercise per day, and you won't become a famous writer with just 1 paragraph of writing per day.- However, even though you can't see it, those investments are making a difference. Think of an ice cube in a room that starts at 20 degrees and is slowly warming up. As the temperature goes to 21 degrees, 22, 23, etc, you initially see no changes in that ice cube whatsoever. And yet, progress is being made. It's only when you finally get to 30 degrees, 31, and 32 that, suddenly, a dramatic change is visible. Almost all the change is only visible at the end, but you couldn't have gotten there without investing all the energy in the beginning an middle. - Much of life works that way. That's why it's essential to form habits now and keep investing, even if it doesn't seem to be making a difference initially. The effect of compound interest is delayed. 4. Patience is essential.- Because progress is so hard to see, patience is an essential part of success. The media loves to tell sensational stories of overnight success, but the reality is that almost all great accomplishments take a long, long time. - In fact, small, incremental progress is typically more effective and sustainable than large jumps, even if you think you have the ability to make a large jump. For example, if you have a habit of weight lifting, and one day, you try to make a 30 pound jump in your squat, there's a chance you'll injure yourself, or even if you don't, make yourself exceptional sore, either of which can be a setback and even break your habit. If you instead stay patient and stick with much smaller increments—e.g., just a 1 pound increase from your last workout—you'll almost always succeed, the risk of injury is low, and over time, these small increments add up shockingly quickly, and you'll far surpass the person trying to do bigger jumps. 5. Focus on systems more than goals.- Much of the modern world is obsessed with setting and accomplishing goals. But it's far more important to focus on putting in place a system to achieve your goals than the goals themselves.- That's because, when life gets tough, you don't rise to the level of your goals; instead, you fall to the level of your systems. If you don't have a good system in place, you'll never accomplish your goals; but if you have a good system in place, then the score will take care of itself. Get the inputs right, and the outputs will work out.6. The best way to put a good system in place is to make it part of your identity.- If you want to form a new habit to accomplish some goal, instead of focusing on the goal itself, focus on becoming the type of person that can accomplish that goal.- Example: instead of focusing on trying to lose weight, become the type of person who never misses a workout. Make it part of your identity, and your own pride will help you turn it into a habit.- To make something part of your identity, you need to gradually show yourself evidence that that person is really you. For example, start with a small exercise habit (e.g., 5 minutes of exercise) that is easy to succeed at. Seeing yourself exercise every day will let you build up some evidence that you're the type of person who never misses a workout. You then gradually ramp the workouts up, and each time you succeed and get some exercise in, you'll see yourself more and more as the person who never misses a workout. You'll start telling others that. You'll start being that person. And once it's part of your identity, it becomes a much easier habit to maintain.- Note that this can be a double-edged sword. Bad habits can also come from some part of your identity. E.g., If you identify yourself as someone who is bad at math or someone who can't remember names, then because you've made those bad habits part of who you are, it'll be hard to change them. So be very careful with what you make part of your identity!7. Trigger new habits with existing ones. - Examples: when I have my first cup of coffee in the morning (existing habit), I will do 2 minutes of meditation (new habit); just before heading to lunch each day (existing habit), I will do 10 push-ups (new habit). - The existing habit becomes a trigger for your new one. By leveraging behaviors you already do, and especially behaviors you enjoy, you can make it easier to pick up new behaviors.- Note: try to be very specific when identifying the trigger. For example, ""do 2 minutes of meditation in the morning"" is not nearly as good as ""do 2 minutes of meditation when I have my first cup of coffee"", as ""in the morning"" is a vague time period that won't be nearly as effective of a trigger as ""first cup of coffee.""8. Make the habit satisfying.- Triggers can help you start doing a habit, but to reinforce that habit so you keep doing it over the long term, it needs to be satisfying in some way. Some habits are inherently satisfying (e.g., you might starting getting a ""runner's high"" once you start running), but for those that aren't, or where the satisfaction won't be visible until much later (e.g., after years of training), you'll want to deliberately add some sort of reward.- Example: each time you manage to go to the yoga studio and do a good hour of stretching, reward yourself with a tasty snack from their cafe. Your brain will then slowly associate Friday the reward of yoga with yummy food, and it'll become a fun outing, rather than a chore.9. The environment has a huge impact on your habits.- People who are good at creating new habits don't necessarily have better willpower than others; instead, they are just better at structuring their environment so they don't have to exercise their willpower in the first place. You should strive to design your world so that it's easy to do the right thing.- For example, if you walk into the kitchen, and there is a plate of cookies on the table, you might be tempted to eat one, even if you're not hungry. If you're trying to get into a habit of eating healthy, using your willpower to try to resist those cookies every single time you walk into the kitchen is going to be a losing battle. A far more effective technique is to get those cookies out of sight; or even better, not have them in the house in the first place. - It's also a good idea to try to tie each environment to exactly 1 habit, and to avoid mixing. For example, if you're trying to get into a healthy sleeping habit, don't watch TV or do work in the same place you sleep (i.e., your bed). Instead, create a separate environment for TV (e.g., your living room or your couch) and another separate environment for doing work (e.g., your office or your desk). That way, each time you're in an environment, it triggers one habit, and only one habit: e.g., I'm at my desk, so I'm doing work, or I'm at my bed, so I'll go to sleep.10. Tracking habits can help reinforce them.- Tracking your progress and making what you've accomplished more visible can be a powerful way to reinforce habits.- Example: a calendar or habit journal where you put an ""X"" every day you succeed at a habit (e.g., go to the gym or meditate). After a while, you'll see a long streak of X's, which is satisfying, as you get a visual representation of your progress (which, as you may remember from earlier, is hard to see, especially early on). Moreover, it reinforces the habit, as you'll be tempted to keep doing the habit just to avoid breaking your streak of ""X's"". - Example: get two jars, and put a bunch of paperclips in one of them. Each time you succeed at a habit, move a paperclip from the full jar to the empty one. Over time, as you do the habit more and more, the empty jar will fill up, giving you another great visual sense of progress. You may start doing the habit more and more just to fill up that jar.- Note: tracking your habits is yet another habit to develop, so there is a cost to this, but it's the type of habit you invest in once, and then it pays dividends when working on all your other habits.11. Never miss twice.- Eventually, everyone fails at their habits. You'll have a bad day, or get sick, or just screw up.- The key is not to give up just because you failed. Since all success takes a long time, a single failure along the way will likely have no measurable impact on the final outcome. So don't stress it, and immediately get back on track. The goal is not to be perfect, but to be consistent.- In other words, it's OK to miss once now and then, but never miss twice in a row."

But this document, which is already only a 45-page free-to-download ""ebook"", is too long and could be synthesized in a 3 page tryptic. Although the intention is good and the concept an important one, and the proposals described to get rid of bad habits and attain desired ones are with no doubt good ones, it's a full blown action of ""copy-writing"": self-help mumbo jumbo that goes over and over again through the same concepts in an attempt to spin out something akin to a book to get people to give their emails in exchange of a free copy.I do appreciate the contents, I certainly don't appreciate that I need to skim through the text searching for the meat. Fortunately this is not a full-blown book, which I am sure some authors would pull off delivering exactly the same meaningful information. Moreover, it promises on talking about ""the science of habit"" and there is nothing even close to science or scientific references on it. The only references are other books on habits which presumably don't have sources in them either. I am not saying it's nonsense, I apply the techniques described in it and I can attest to its effectiveness, but there's no scientific proof here if that's what you are looking for.Whoever is interested in an abridged version of the WHOLE thing, here it is:How to build new habits: Three step process (3 Rs): - cue/reminder: don't wait to be motivated, associated an habit with an every-day trigger. - routine: do it, no matter what, even if it's a minimal version of what you want to achieve. - reward: associate doing it with a reward, which can simply be saying ""success"" to yourself.Start small, make it easy so you never avoid the habit.Identity-based habits:The goal must not be the habit itself, nor what people think of you, or a deadline nor even what you want to achieve. Focus on who you want to be (or go back to being) and work towards that through the habit. (I.e. ""I want to loose 10 kg"" wrong, ""I want to be a person that eats less junk"" right).Set schedules (habit), not goals (achievement).How to break bad habits:We have bad habits because we are rewarded by them. They are normally associated with stress and boredom. Thus, ""just stop doing it"" never works. You need to substitute a bad habit with a different one. How to: - Choose a substitute. - Cut out the triggers. - Don't do it alone, commit to it with or in front of other people. - It's ok to slip, just keep at it.That's it. You may find some other things, but this is the important part, really."

The concepts are really simple and straight-forward, yet profound in their ability to change lives. I plan to purchase it in eyeball-reading form so I can actually put these concepts into action since doing so in the car on my way to and from work doesn't really make sense.In my experience and with some of my recent reads on addiction and dealing with many addicts in my line of work, I can say that these concepts really make sense. I've worked with people breaking alcohol addiction and some of the same practices were used that are described here, such as brushing your teeth or drinking grapefruit juice when you have a craving. Atomic Habits doesn't tell you to brush your teeth or drink juice, but tells about the cues that cause us to fall back into habits.Habits govern so much that we don't even realize. I hear a pop of a can and suddenly I'm looking to grab a Dr. Pepper and that's just one of so many things I realize in my own life let alone those that I don't realize.Self-examination is tough, but I would highly recommend reading this book, especially if you are stuck in a rut and can't figure your way out. But even if not, it's good to take a look at how habits are affecting your day-to-day life.

Power of Habit was more so the importance and impact habits have on you, as oppose to Atomic Habits which I found more practical in the sense that how you can make or break productive or unproductive habits.

You just have to make the next action you take, be one that is an action you want your ideal person to take3) A 1% improvement a day, can lead to a 37x improvement at the end of the year! (the compounding effect of habits)4) It's more important to show up than to actually get something done, because showing up is the hardest part (using activation energy to make yourself takes small steps to build your habit first)"
36,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28266634-liza-fireman,4,"I really liked this book. It is very practical and interesting. It did remind me a little bit of The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business by Charles Duhigg. It included a lot less of the story telling, but included much of the advice of changing habits. It also reminded me of The Happiness Advantage: The Seven Principles of Positive Psychology That Fuel Success and Performance at Work by Shawn Achor. A really great book, that mentions adding friction to make it harder to go with bad habits (remove the remote control batteries, and it will probably make you think more about turning on the tv).  The author suggests that you should decide who is the person you want to be, and that habits make you who you are. Your habits shape your identity, and you can change your habits and identity (not sure that I am super happy with that phrasing, but there was much in the book that was really good, so I'll be willing to look away on this phrasing :)). I really loved his system: How to Create a Good HabitThe 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious.The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive.The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy.The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying.And:How to Break a Bad HabitInversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible.Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive.Inversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult.Inversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying.It is worth mentioning that James Clear had a really terrible accident in baseball, and a serious head injury. He had been hit in the face with a baseball bat, and got into a comma. But this injury probably had a part of who he is today. This injury was one of mine, and the experience taught me a critical lesson: changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits. With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible. His parents were no strangers to the hospital, since his sister had cancer a decade earlier. Oh my, poor parents.Clear puts an emphasis on starting, even with a little tiny easy thing. Habits for the most part is doing something that you started, whether it is sitting on the sofa, or going to the gym. Habits are like the entrance ramp to a highway. They lead you down a path and, before you know it, you’re speeding toward the next behavior. It seems to be easier to continue what you are already doing than to start doing something different. He gives the example of running starting with tying your running shoes.I really liked this book. Practical and nicely written, with some great advice. 4 stars. "
37,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"This was excellent. Full of common sense advice on how to change your habits, one tiny step at a time. The ideas are simple and easy to follow, and he gives concrete examples and even templates for things like habit tracking and evaluating your habits. James Clear also explains the psychology behind his system, sprinkled with interesting, but not too many, real life examples. For example, we are wired for immediate satisfaction, but most good habits have delayed gratification - so he suggests finding an immediate reward. Some simple techniques are habit stacking - i.e. connecting a new habit to an existing one, or the 2 minute rule - that a new habit should not take longer than two minutes. First, establish the habit, later refine or add to it. Very useful. I have listened to it, but ordered a copy and will review it in print, so I can make notes. Highly recommend to every procrastinator out there - of whom I am a major example."

40,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24619582-achilles,5,"5 Star Knowing that one should look upon one’s habit is one thing, but to get the answer like “What”, “When”, “Where” and “How”- is what the book “Atomic Habit” does. The book has a plethora of real-life events that portray “Habits are like compound interest”. James started with his own-not-so-happy-incident from his life and how subsequently he went on to the quest of creating the Atomic Habits empire.The essence of the whole book is put into a nutshell of four life-defining rule:•	Make it Obvious (Cue)•	Make it Attractive (Craving)•	Make it Easy (Response)•	Make it Satisfying (Reward)To achieve big in life it’s not necessary that we do only big things. A small percentage of improvement on a daily basis can also achieve the same thing. One has to overcome his/her “Plateau of Latent Potential”- as the author suggests. It’s good to have goals in life but do not focus on goals rather accrue your potential to create a “belief system” to achieve that goal. Winners and Losers have the same goals but what differentiates them is “System” they followed to get the goal.Every rule begins with a spellbound example from the annals of successful history. Be it entertainment, sports, medicine, scholar – every example is so inter-related with the habit that it feels unbelievable that a minute habit can have a remarkable impact. James also gave few strategies to practice this in our daily life like “Habit Score Card”, “Habit Stacking”, “Habit Contract” and many more. One of my fav. concepts from the book is “The Goldilocks Rule”: It says, “The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty.”The amazing thing I liked in the book is how meticulously James observed the nuance in once behaviors. How one’s habit gets created and shaped in the society he/she lives, whom they talk, whom they listen, and what object they use. The book is not targeted only for a particular sect of society but it encapsulates the whole of mankind. I think this is the book one must have on their shelf."
41,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65666930-atharva-amdekar,5,"I generally tend to avoid reading self-help books because I believe its more natural to learn from your own past experiences rather than someone else's, which is why I always found it difficult to relate to, and apply the lessons written by self-help authors. However, reading this book was certainly a different experience. The author provides a cogent, and a scientific approach, unlike the philosophical approach of most self-help books. He breaks down the formation/destruction of good/bad habits into easy-to-understand and easy-to-apply systematic components. This book also taught me a lot on how the human psyche works in tandem with our environment. He talks about how our brain is wired to overvalue radical changes in our behaviour as against the undervaluation of small changes over a longer period of time, which was the most important lesson I picked up from this book. A must-read for anyone who wants to form/break good/bad habits. However, I'd suggest to read only a few pages everyday so that you are able to apply those learnings as you go along. Reading this book like a story book and aiming to apply everything after completing it in its entirety will probably do you no good."
42,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13717595-jake,2,"I once had a teacher who used to grumble about self help books under his breath. He was most eminently aggravated by this entire genre for being, as he used to like to say with poise: ""trash"". His sentiment regarding them seems to be pretty prevalent among many thinking people. I think there is a truth in the idea of seeing this genre as trashy, and a folly as well.While it certainty is the case that most books in this category are bereft of serious scholarship and deep thought, there are generally useful tidbits that can be gleaned regarding how to practically achieve a couple of your goals. Carnegie's advice may get you attacked by a mob, but in another context they may very well aid you into understanding people on a level that would never be mentioned in a psych 101 course. These books, are, in my view always practical. And on that note, I still read them even if at times their mediocre understanding of philosophy, science and history make my eyes roll back in my head.So? Atomic habits. Eh. This is a solid book, despite its lack of self awareness - as many people have come before clear and said the same thing in more articulate ways. A good resource for this is Maria popova's blog : https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03.... She has been writing about these ideas prob before duhigg' s power of habit. In short, clear contends that one should start with smaller goals, rather than massive ambitions. ANd by doing life little by little. That being, changing our individual habits, we will find ourselves gaining more control over our lives. As it is in fact the case that we are - in a sense what we do - it therefore is more accurately expressed 'we are what we do habitually.' Change your habits - change your lifeClear states at the end that the architecture of habits are broken down to two phases. We then must learn about ourselves and recondition our behaviors. 1. The problem phase  1a. cue (find a trigger/learn old triggers)1b.craving (impulse to do thing after trigger)2. Solution phase2a. response (respond to trigger)2b reward (receive reward for doing thing)I would like to take this time at the end of the review to quote a small part of the text which I found stimulating by its silliness.""In 1936 psychologist Kurt Lewin write a simple equation that makes a powerful statement: Behavior is a function of the person in their environment, or B= f(p,e)"". Im fairly certain that a well seasoned researcher of psychology would never write this pseudo mathematical sentence. This was ok. Recommended for:-people who like listening to Tony Robbins - those who want a run down of the concept of habit- those struggling to move who want an idea"

I started reading  Atomic Habits  on my Kindle and just 15% in I felt I had highlighted and underlined basically every line, so much so I had to go out and get a physical copy of the book so I could go through slowly. WHAT A BOOK! This is a must read book for everyone! Jame Clear really gets to the heart of what it takes to build healthy habits and what it takes to get rid of the unhealthy ones. I think everyone could benefit from reading this book and putting into practice the advice given. For me, I love how clear James Clear was in this book in the work that goes into forming healthy and getting rid of unhealthy habits. Clear offers practical advice on how to build these habits, in ways that aren't overwhelming. I love how feasible his suggests were and I look forward to putting them into practice.  It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.  This is a major thing for me. I get so caught up in having a defining moment that I lose sight of making the small improvements on a daily basis that leads to these defining moments. I liked that Clear focus on how you can tiny improvements on a daily basis that will lead to major improvements. Finally, if you are like me, I focus on the big goals... I get lost in trying to achieve that goal and I dont focus on what can lead to me achieving these goals. In Atomic Habits, James Clear talks about the process that leads to the goals and how we need to focus more on putting process and systems in place to achieve these goals. This is a solid read and I recommend this books to anyone who is struggling to put in place new healthy habits and get rid of unhealthy ones. Please grab a copy and change your life. "

All I want is a productive little audiobook to listen to while I work, helpfully filled with tips to improve my life. All I get is priviledged white people recycling the same old advice over and over. This book is especially grating as it's filled with cute little platitudes like ""the same boiling water will soften a potato and harden an egg"". I already know how boiling water works, thanks, can we get to the part where you tell me something I haven't heard from seven other productivity books already?At one point Clear writes, ""I get my assistant to do this for me every week, but if you don't have an assistant..."" I love how some of these productivity authors neglect to mention all the outside help they hire. It's like that other woman who suggested hiring an au pair for when your primary nanny is taking her vacation days. He also suggests doing things like paying for grocery delivery instead of going to the store to save time. He tells the story of one guy who paid his personal trainer $500 every time he forgot to log his food for the day.The real productivity hack seems to be to hire someone to do all the little day-to-day tasks for you so you can focus on other things. This is great if you're fabulously rich, but, if you're like me and don't currently have a full time assistant, and people to do your housework and your meal prep for you, then you may have to look elsewhere for more practical advice.

At the end of each chapter, there's simplified notes for easy reference.If you want to step up your game on creating a disciplined and successful life, I suggest you go and read Atomic Habits.

Interestingly, it contradicts ""the willpower instinct"" in a few places (e.g. re whether you should hide cues for bad habits). I wonder who is right? Likely subjective.One drawback is that the author kept quoting the Dilbert guy in a role model way, which rubbed me the wrong way given his famous misogynistic rants... Not sure that's someone I really want to emulate or hear about."

It might just be that he’s found the proper mix of real world examples, easy to apply manual-like instructions and just the right amount of brain science to get his point across.Of course, now that I think about it, I guess that the cocktail he made here will appeal to certain types of personalities more than to others, and I'm not even going to try to guess which, since I don't really know where I stand to begin with. Heck, maybe I'm the kind of people that it appeals to: those who can't be bothered to do some introspection. Or better yet, who do introspect, but never reach an actionable conclusion. But enough about that. The point is, if you feel that you might need a bit more order and structure in your life, or if you're annoyed that you can't stick to healthy or productive habits, then this might actually help. For me, there were at least a few takeaways. One thing that I'm pondering is how to design my environment to help me stick with a habit. And it's as easy as placing a glass full of water on the nightstand before you go to bed if you want to drink water first thing in the morning. Another cool trick is using down-time to do small chores. Like cleaning the toilet while you wait for the water in the shower to get warmer. You're already there in the bathroom and doing nothing, might as well make the most of it.That said, there are also some weaker parts. He does have a few moments throughout the book where he feels the need to do some life coaching, which, in my opinion, he could have scrapped. I always feel that funny moments are more memorable than personal confessions (and the confessions here never stop), so I would have liked more jokes instead. But, then again, not everybody can make jokes work, so, I guess that, here too, he plays to his strengths. (or avoids his weaknesses)Good book, easy read and just about the right length. Now I’ve got to find a good place to put some weights so I can stumble over them in the morning. (#workoutgoals)"

The system is quite rigid and similar to the one found in ""The Power of Habit"".

I've been reading about productivity and habits for a while now and I think this book does a great work of gathering everything together and presenting in a nice form.I think I liked it even more because I already apply many of the tips written here and I can assure (at least to myself) that it actually works. I have to say that it was really great to hear a confirmation of what I've been doing for years. :)If you read the Power of Habit, you will see some references in this book but it will add other tips that you didn't see there. I also found this book to be less dense.Here are my notes for this book:* The aggregation of marginal improvements. If you break all actions and improve them separately, you will have again when you put all of them together* You will only notice the value of good habits and the price of the bad ones 5 or 10 years from now* Small improvements may not be seen at the moment but they compound with time* Habits compound with time as you repeat them* Small change in the path may be very meaningful in the destination* You should be more concerned about your current trajectory than your current results* If you're a millionaire and you spend more than you earn, you're in a bad trajectory. If you're broke but save some money every month, you're on the trajectory of financial freedom, even if it's slower than you expected* One big change is not the result of one single action but the aggregation of many others. You should not give up because you're not seeing changes in the first stages, sometimes it takes a long time for you to shape what you want* Fix the input and the output will take care of itself -- it's the same idea of ""The score takes care of itself"" book* When you meet your goal, there is a chance that you will not keep yourself motivated to keep your system running. e.g. a racer will not keep training after the race is gone* An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system* If you want better results, forget about setting goals, focus on your system instead* Sew things give you better results than changing your daily habits* Changing outcomes is the first layer of habits (most of the goals you set). The second layer is changing your process (improving your system, like preparing a better workout for the gym). The third level is about identity (change what you believe)* We should focus our change on identity habits and think about who we want to be* A behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last. You have to assume you're the person you want to be and become it.* The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when something becomes part of your identity. When you say ""I'm this"", you reached this goal.* The goal should not be to read a book but to become a reader. Is should not be to run a race, but to become a racer* When your behavior is aligned with your identity, you don't have to force yourself to do things, you are just being yourself* Be careful with ""that's not who I am"" mentality. If you repeat to yourself that ""you're not good with names"" many times, you will accept that as truth and will not improve* Habits are how you embody your identity. Your identity is your ""repeat beingness"" (translating from Latin)* First, decide the type of person you want to be and second prove it to yourself with small wins* You can start with your goals (have six packs) but them think about WHO is the type of person that can get there (gym enthusiasts?)* Whenever you face a problem repeatedly, your brain starts automating it to get the reward with less effort* The goal of a habit is to solve life's problem with as less effort and energy as possible* Most people think they lack motivation but they lack clarity of when and where to execute what they want* Fill the following sentence: I will [behavior] at [time] in [location]* Stack habits: you can use the habit as the cue for another one. e.g., after coffee, I will meditate* Habits scoreboard: list all your daily habits (wake up, look into the cellphone, brush the teeth, take breakfast, etc.) and add a minus sign to the ones you think are not good for you, a plus sign to the good ones and an equal sign to the neutral ones* Use something like your scoreboard to list everything that you do each day without fail (wake up, brew a cup of coffee, take kids to school, etc.) then list everything that happens to you every day (sunrise, lunch, sunset, a song you're listening to ends, etc.). With that list, you will be able to find the best time and place to stack your habits* Make your cues obvious on your environment. If you want to eat apples, keep them on sight so you will not forget them* We usually connect the place with the habit. You can train yourself to link a particular habit with a particular context* Associate places with activities. e.g., an office for work. The couch to rest and have fun, etc.* ""I've never seen someone sticking to positive habits in a negative environment"".* Reduce exposure to the cues causing bad habits. Move the television out of the bedroom. Move your cellphone out of the office. Etc.* Make the cues for bad habits invisible* ""Make attractive"". The whole market uses it in their favor. Fashion with pictures of models really modified, food over caloric to trigger the brain, porn that is not something you can usually do, social media gives much more likes than you would receive in a real environment, etc.* ""We have the brains of our ancestors but temptations they didn't have to face.""* Without the desire the action stops (experiment with ""dopamine free"" rats)* Temptation bundling is when you tie something you want to do with something you need to do (pedaling to watch Netflix)* The more attractive something is, the easier it is to build a habit* Try to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do* Behaviors are attractive when they help us to fit in a group* Our friends and family provide some sort of peer pressure that pulls us in their direction. Peer pressure is only bad when you're surrounded by bad people* The higher the IQ of your friends at the age of 12, the higher will be your at the age of 20+* The best thing to do to have better habits is to join q culture where the desired behavior is the norm* Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have. You culture set your expectation for what is normal. You will rise together.* There's a tremendous internal pressure to adhere to the norms of the group. The reward of being accepted is often higher than looking smart or winning an argument* We usually go with the flow, even when the group is wrong. You can be different and don't care about what people think, but it takes work* When change goes with the tribe, the change is attractive. When it goes against the tribe, it's unattractive -- I'm not sure if it's always true for me* Once we fit in, we find a way to stand out of the crowd* We imitate the people we envy (because they already stand out the crowd)* We try to imitate three different groups: the close (family), the many (groups), the powerful* Some underlying motives: conserve energy, obtain food and water, find love and reproduce, connect and find bonds with others, win social acceptance and approval, reduce uncertainty, achieve status and prestige, etc.* The successful products today are not creating new motivations, they are just bonding themselves to the underlying motives of humanity. Examples: find love (tinder), reduce uncertainty (Google), connect with others (Facebook), look for approval (Instagram), etc* A craving is the sense that something is missing, is the desire to change your internal state. When you do something (e.g., browsing social media) you're looking for the feeling of change on your internal state (feel accepted? Feel part of the group? Escape? )* When a habit addresses a motive, you will feel the craving to do it again* Habits are attractive when you associate them with good feelings. You can use that in your advantage* You can reprogram your brain to associate hard habits with positive experiences -- f*ck, I do that all the time. Just realized it now 😱* Motivation ritual example: if you play the same songs to have sex, you will begin to associate the music with the act. After some time, you can just play it to get in the mood.* Find something you love to do and create a ritual for that. You can then use this same ritual to get some boost of happiness.* If you can reprogram your predictions, you can transform a hard habit into an easy oneMotion and action are two different things. Motion is brainstorming a book. The action is writing that book. In motion, it looks like you're making progress, but you're not doing much. Be careful with that.* Particular regions of the brain get bigger when they are used and reduced when not used, just like muscles* When you do more of something you learn with your mistakes, train your brain and get better. * Don't theorize much, plan and act.* It doesn't matter how much time it takes to form a new habit, but how many times you have to do it to become a habit.* We tend to do things that don't require much effort. If you can make your habits more convenient, you have a better chance to stick to it.* Environment building: prepare your environment, so it benefits you to accomplish your habits. Example: if the gym is between you and your work, it will be easy to plan for it* Prime your environment. Whenever you finish something, prepare the environment for the next use so there's no friction to do it again and it will always be tidy and clean* Use friction to avoid bad habits. Example: remove the battery from the remote control to avoid watching television. If the friction it high enough you will forget it* Habits are the entry point, not the endpoint. They are what guide you to the gym, not the exercise* To start a new habit, start with something that only takes two minutes (scale down if it takes more, so it takes only two)* Positive experiences cultivate habits, negative ones destroy them* Use immediate rewards to help with delayed gratification. To save money for the future, you can stop eating out. Every day you eat out, get the money you spare and move to a savings account. You will have the immediate reward of savings.* The more a habit becomes part of your identity, the less you will need reinforcement. The identity becomes the reinforcement* Don't focus on having six packs, but instead focus on being the person who exercises the abs X times a week* Never fail twice. If you don't, e.g., go to the gym one day, go there in the next one* Sometimes we just improve what we are measuring, but we may be measuring the wrong thing* Make bad habits unsatisfying. If you break your chain of good habits (creating a bad habit) make it unsatisfying by punishing yourself in a way you think fit the situation. It should be unsatisfying.* Genes do not determine your destiny, but they determine the chance of you to excel in a particular area (Phelps has a good body for swimming, but not for running)* Choose the habits that interest you, not the most popular* Pick the games where the odds are on your side. You get more satisfaction when things are going good and easy for you. * Combine your abilities to create your own niche. The guy behind Dilbert is not the best cartoonist and doesn't have the best jokes, but the combination of both of his skills is awesome* Build your own category of study/work, the one that combines your skills and makes yourself to be the best candidate* Who can handle the boredom of doing the same things over and over usually are the ones who become masters* You need just enough winning to experience satisfaction* When habits become routine, they become less challenging and less satisfiable* Don't make any single part of your identity a big portion of who you are. If you lose (or have to change) this part, you will have an existential crisis and lose a big part of your identity"

It’s a great book, isn’t it? Well, Atomic Habits takes what you learn in The Power of Habit and builds upon it in an astronomical way. The best part is its practicality. There are many pieces of advice you can apply in your life.Honestly, when I first started reading Atomic Habits for a book club called Book Brewers in Surabaya, Indonesia that I helped co-found I wasn’t expecting anything different from any other self-development book. But then I realized after reading and discussing it at Book Brewers’ second meeting that this is not just ‘some’ ordinary book. James Clear has done a superb job of mixing learning about habits and embodying lifelong learning. He’s a pretty sneaky guy because most people don’t want to read about lifelong learning unless they’re interested in lifelong learning specifically. But a lot of people are interested in building better habits and stopping bad ones. It’s in actuality a book about lifelong learning disguised as a book about habits. Well, good for James Clear. It’s about time someone stepped up to the plate and delivered an actionable product. That’s what Atomic Habits is. An actionable product. YouTube: https://youtu.be/SA0uDtQ5siQBook Blog: http://bookmattic.com/reviews/atomic-...How to Approach Atomic HabitsThe best approach you can take while reading this book is to try different strategies to find out which one works best for you. Don’t try them all out at once. As Mr. Clear put it, these are the strategies he’s tried applying in his life but may not work for every person. You’ll have to do some experimentation and find out what works best for you. The most important takeaway you can get from Atomic Habits is that small changes seem unimportant at first, but then start compounding over time. Any good habit that is continuously repeated over time, no matter how small, will have a positive impact on your life in the long-run. The most important thing you can do is to show up. In order to make a habit stick, you must make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, and make it satisfying. These are the four laws of building a habit.25 Discussion Questions, Quotes, Strategies and Book Recommendations From Atomic HabitsThesis: Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them. Key Features:Cue     Craving     Response     RewardOne: Make It ObviousTwo: Make It AttractiveThree: Make It EasyFour: Make It Satisfying Best Quote for this club: BOOK BREWERSOne of the best ways to become better is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.

62,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28263682-rajanikanth-bijigiri,5,"One of the most insightful book. Though one still needs the decision and will to put these into action for improving oneself, the knowledge that is offered in the book helps in realization and gives immense satisfaction.Summary below:Introduction:People overestimate the importance of one defining moment for becoming successful. But in reality, it's most times aggregation of daily improvements even at a small scale.Habits cause meaningful transformation but at a slow pace. This is the main reason good habits don't stick but also bad habits seep in to life. Slow pace means one realises the bad or good caused only when they look back after long time like 2-5 years.Habits have a compounding effect. They reduce cognitive load and free your mental capacity. Initially gains seen will be very less but habits need to persist to clear platue of latent potential (time with invisible gains). Build a system that is in line with your goals and then focus only on the system and not on the goals. Habits form part of this larger system. Adopting a habit should be a change that drives from inside to outside. You have to become the kind of person who does the actions that are part of the habit. The more times you perform the habit, your identity as this habit holder reinforces. Decide what you wanna be and prove this with small wins at a time.There are 4 major steps in how a habit gets formed. First is cue: something that alerts the brain to initiate a behaviour by predicting a reward for that action. Cue triggers craving, a desire for change from your current state. This craving leads to Response that is the action you perform. The response provides a reward that satisfies craving and this teaches the brain that this cue will lead to this reward and you will repeat this action. To make habits stick, make the cue obvious, craving to be more attractive. Response to be easy and the reward to be satisfying. And the reverse is true if the need is to get rid of existing habit.To achieve this, following activities can be very useful. 1st law: Make it obvious: Raise your awareness of your current habits by making a 'Habits scorecard'. List all current habits in a column and assess their contribution in you being effective by marking +,-,= for being effective, not effective and not much effect respectively. Make note of cues for each of the habits. Habits scorecard will form basis for adapting new good habits and getting rid of old bad habits.-While starting a new habit, fix specific time & place for that activity. This will be useful as with enough repetitions this place & time gets associated with this habit that when it is that time and place, the activity just happens without pondering over why.Habit stacking: Pair a new habit that you are tying to adapt with a current habit. This way habit sticks with fewer repetitions as end of current habit will act as cue for the new habit. Specific and immediately actionable cues work best in habit stacking.This can be extended to apply to general situations by associating a cue with a particular action. Eg. Taking stairs in your apartment if you see them. Environment around you is filled with many cues that are associated with some or the other habits. So to make intended habits stick, fill your environment with positive cues for these. Avoid or remove the cues that are associated with bad habits. It is easier to associate new habits with a new place or object than conflicting with older ones. If space is limited, rearranging the current space works just fine. Stable and predictable environment is key for stable and sustained habits.Don't introduce old bad habits they you are trying to get rid of in new environment. Even addictions could spontaneously dissolve this way. Secret of self control is that you don't need to have much will power and self control if you are disciplined. Discipline ensures that you don't face many circumstances that you need to resist.Bad habits foster the feelings that they are trying to numb. Subconsciously your brain will try to encourage these situations that cause you to go easy on some habits that you would like to follow. Eg. If you tend to watch Netflix when you feel bored, this will cause you to feel more and more bored when you are not watching Netflix. Self control is short term solution, habits are the correct answer for a happy life.2nd law: Make Habit irresistible:Habits are dopamine driven feedback loops. As dopamine spikes, motivation to act increases. Once a habit is formed, dopamine rises when reward is anticipated. Not when reward is experienced. The dopamine spike during wanting makes habits irresistible. This can be used to our advantage by linking an action you need to do with an action that you want to do. This can be appropriately positioned in habit stack.We try to fit in with family, friends the society in general. Choose a social environment where your desired environment is the norm and is valued. When changing habits means fitting in, then change is attractive. To fix bad habits, each cue that is causing it needs to be reframed to highlight the bad things because of that habit.3rd law: Make it easy to perform the habit:Don't get bogged down for optimal plan. You can not master a habit that you don't have. When you realise that you procrastinating for long time in planning a habit, stop all sophisticated plans and start immediately with some rough plan. Repetitions are the key to master a habit. We are motivated to do what is easy. To sustain a new habit, start it always with its simplest version of it. For first few days, any new habit should take less than 2 minutes to do. Eg: If target is to do 100 push ups, start the habit with 1 pushup to make sure doing pushups becomes a routine. It is essential to Ritualize the beginning process of the habit. Eg. Limit the habit to just wing your shoe in the morning and takingb few steps away from your room.Design your environment for least friction such that doing the right thing is as easy as possible. This can be achieved by priming your environment for immediate use. Eg. Keeping utensils washed after each use such that there is one less obstacle when you need to cook at home. On similar line, little increase in friction can avoid lot of bad behaviour. Habits are only a gateway, but they shape next actions that may continue for hours that. Handful of decisive moments decide how long time periods are spent everyday.This is because people feel easy to continue doing what they are doing than to do something different. Eg. If immediate action after returning from office is to switch on TV, next few hours may be spent watching it.Here switching on TV is the habit that is gateway to how next few hours are spent. Lock in your future behaviour using techniques like commitment devices and other technology. Use Technology to automate whatever can be. Then spend time on what things technology can't do. Mobile phones and internet like technologies make you jump from easy task to easy task while pushing important works for later.4th law: Make it satisfying:Immediate reward is intrinsically preferred by us. This causes slipping in of bad habits whose consequences are delayed. So one can't rely on brain's good intentions to do the right thing. Add little bit of immediate pleasure at the end of habits that pay off in the long run. Reward yourself each time you avoid temptation of a bad habit. Change is easy if it is pleasurable.Visual measures to track progress on a habit help in avoiding steak. Don't miss any habit twice. One can track important habits in an excel or a notebook. Track only important habits so that teaching itself doesn't become a burden. Update in the tracker immediately after a habit is performed. Tracking can act as cue for the next action, motivates to continue a habit by seeing the progress. It can be satisfying to cross off things from to do list. We avoid an experience when it is painful and if the pain immediate. Make cost of procrastination to be more than cost of action. Punishment should be painful and it should be enforced for it to have effect. Having a habit contract with a friend or someone close to you can help in enforcing things like these. You may state to them your commitment and punishment of missed. Knowing someone is watching helps in motivating you to continue. Choose your goals in line with skills you are good at. This way building habits for these targets will be easy. You will enjoy these habits and they stick. You will get praise for doing a good job and it will further motivate you to do better. Will give satisfaction.Don't spend your full time only on things that you already know. Exploit the skills that you are good at but explore new skills at least for 10 percent of your time. Find what comes naturally to you and what feels like fun to you. Developing these skills by combining these with other useful skills will give you unique expertise that is extremely valuable."

Like a complete nerd. I have 2 habit tracking apps. 2 planners: one is a journal/to-do list planner and one is a ginormous calendar. I watch productivity videos 24/7 too, my favourite YouTubers include Thomas Frank, Matt D’Avella, Michelle B, Med School Insiders, Ali Abdaal etc. I watch Tedx videos like an addict. Suffice to say, I’m obsessed with habit-formation and self-improvement. And yet, James Clear taught me so so many things with this book. I am so glad I decided to pick this one up. It completely revolutionized my understanding of self-improvement. Right before “Atomic Habits” I read “The Power of Habit” by Charles Duhigg which I am sure had great impact on Clear’s work. Right after Atomic Habits, I read “You are a Badass” by Jen Sincero. Neither of these works are even CLOSE to being as precise, informative, and helpful as Clear’s book. I am sure I will cherish my copy for years to come — it is already furiously highlighted. I’ll have to read again with a pencil in hand. I won’t shut up about this book, I’ll tell it to anyone who will listen. I learned so much about how to break bad habits, how to build new ones, how to change my environment, and more. I can’t wait to implement all of these in my journey of self-improvement and goal-setting.6/5 stars really!!"

Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.I really liked this one, and we successfully implemented some new systems in our home since reading it. This is one I'll revisit again. There is much to take in and digest. One of the most interesting ideas in this book is the link between identity and actions. That notion changed my mental maps forever. Fascinating. "

For everything to work, you mainly need two things: a system and a process. They may not be perfect; you can start small and then scale the system and refine the process.It is a very practical book that offers tools and strategies to build a better system and shape better habits. The author put a lot of effort and time to write this book.Small habits are tiny, sustainable improvements that compound.""It's easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.""The book starts with James Clear's story, which is inspirational and engaging.He tells us how and why he decided to work on that topic and also how the book will benefit us.""Atomic habits"" is not a scientific paper on academic research. It's more of an operational manual, having lots of tips, small pearls of wisdom and some fascinating stories. The step to step approach can help you to improve yourself and the area you wish to build your habits on, be it wealth, productivity, health or relationships.There are a few inspirational stories of famous comedians, businessman and athletes. The chess story of the famous Polgar sisters and this of the British National Cycling Team are genuinely amazing.The author introduces us to the Four Laws of Behaviour Change: cue, craving, response and reward.  1. First law - Make it obvious (cue)Use visual measures. For example, moving paper clips or writing down in a table - provide clear evidence of your progress. It's surprising here that I already do that for my sports activities. 2. Second law - Make it attractive (craving)""To pick a good habit, surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself. You will rise together.""Reframe your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind and make a habit seem more attractive. Instead of telling yourself 'I need to go run in the morning,' say ""It's time to build endurance and get fast."" 3. Third law - Make it easy (response)""When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.""""A habit should be established before it's mastered."" ""Standardise first and then optimise.""""Reduce friction - minimise the steps between you and your good habit."" 4. Forth law - Make it satisfying (reward)Establish a system for reflection and review - this will tell you how you improve in the long run. The author also advises us to keep a ""decision journal"".But be careful with the reflections because if you do them too frequently, it would have the opposite effect: ""Worrying for every daily choice is like looking yourself in the mirror from an inch away - you can't see the big picture.""Here is some analysis of the Four Laws proving how complete they are.""If a behaviour is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit.Eliminate the cue, and your habit will never start.Reduce the craving, and you won't experience enough motivation to act.Make the behaviour difficult, and you won't be able to do it.And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you'll have no reason to do it again in the future.""I was less interested in breaking the bad habits, so I don't have many quotes on that, but there are plenty in the book if you are interested.And that's the inversion of the Four Laws of Behaviour Change for breaking a bad habit:First law - Make it invisibleSecond law - Make it unattractiveThird Law - Make it difficult Forth Law - Make it unsatisfyingTools:1. Identity-based tools - you build your identity first and then sync all your habits around it. From there, you expand and upgrade your identity. Every action you take is a vote for the person you want to become.""Do you want a cigarette?"" - ""No, I'm trying to quit them."" vs ""No, I don't smoke""Another example: ""What would a healthy person choose to eat - a burger or a salad.""""Choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be.""2. Implementation intention toolsHaving clarity and making a specific plan on your actions makes it easy to follow through. For example: ""I will run tomorrow morning at 8 at Cremorne Park"".The implementation intention tool could work for various scenarios and goals:Social skills: When I walk into a party, I will introduce myself to someone I don't know yet.Finances: When I want to buy something over $100, I will wait twenty-four hours before purchasing.Healthy eating: When I serve myself a meal, I will always put veggies on my plate first.Minimalism: When I buy a new item, I will give something away.3. Habit stacking tools - making a plan for your habits. ""After I make one sale, I can check my personal email.""The formula is: ""After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].""4. Commitment device toolsLet's explain this one with a story from the book. Victor Hugo created a commitment device for finishing his book on time. He locked all his clothes so he can't go outside looking presentable. Also, a commitment device can be prepaying a yoga class or gym.Other takeaways:	1. Getting better with 1% every day counts for the long run.	2. Habits are double-edged swords - they work for you or against you.	3. Focus on systems, not goals. ""Goals are useful for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress.""	4. Progress requires unlearning.	5. Master the art of showing up (even for 2 mins).I highly recommend this book if you are interested in habits building and its related areas in biology, neuroscience, philosophy and psychology.There are so many notes I have:""Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within six weeks.""""The costs of your good habits are in the present. The costs of your bad habits are in the future.""""Babies who turn toward noise are more likely to grow up to be extroverts. Those who turn away are more likely to become introverts.""""Really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom."

Let's do some habit stacking: ""After I finish a book, I will review it on Goodreads"" (wish me luck)
I liked basically everything about this book. I listened to the audiobook and had a great time with it. James Clear explained habits and their formation in a very straight-forward, easy to grasp way and there was zero condescension or judgment in his tone. The balance between story-telling/historical anecdotes and science findings followed up by practical and actionable advice was pretty good. I mean, I could probably do without any anecdotes about past American presidents in self-help books but I understand that sometimes a story can support your point or make it easier to remember and at least it wasn't excessive as in some other books. I enjoyed learning more both about some concrete strategies like habit stacking as well as about more abstract issues like the connection between your habits and your identity. I really appreciated the chapter summaries aka TL;DR (but I did read the whole thing haha). It also hit the spot in terms of being inspiring and motivating, which is something I look for the most in personal growth books. I definitely want to get this book in a physical form so that I can come back to it whenever I need a refresher on these concepts. Booktube channel | Twitter | Bookstagram"

But also, and specifically about listening via audio, is that it gave me an audio cue/heads up that the chapter was wrapping up soon, which was so helpful. I wish all non fiction audiobooks would do this! Made for a very enjoyable and informative reading experience."

79,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26822529-lily-jamaludin,3,"Nothing particularly new here, but a pretty good overview of consistent habit formation techniques (make it obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying) and ways of framing the development of new habits (thinking about habits not as working towards a goal, but towards building your identity as a certain type of person). Good nuggets to take with you if you are building your own new habits, and an easy book to work through.Just another thought on books like this -- I usually avoid them, I realise because underlying these books is often a sense of ableism, and the need to discipline, order, and regiment our bodies. This obviously is not possible for those with chronic illness or other disabilities, also for those who face multiple structural oppressions. I mean to say, something that would be great to see in the future is books that engage how to approach these things from a disability framework -- how to build better habits that enhance our life, but also are compassionate to our imperfect and unruly bodies?"

83,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5148911-devika,4,"Atomic Habits lived true to its name – breaking down the finer details of the framework that makes a habit sticky. The essence of most behavioral science driven books is to acknowledge that are brains remain similar to that of our Paleolithic ancestors, even though our reality has evolved much further. We intrinsically are driven by instant gratification, so we need to design our habits to fit who we are rather than forcing ourselves into a mould. The central idea of the book is to follow the framework of cue, response, routine, and reward (further extending Duhigg’s framework by adding ‘response’). The implications are as follows:•	Cue – make the habit obvious•	Response – link the habit to an inherent craving•	Routine – make the habit easy to follow with a two-minute rule and a tracker•	Reward – make the habit satisfying, with the tracker also providing gratification for maintaining a ‘habit streak’ Essentially, it’s more important to show up and follow through on the habit rather than waiting for a perfect time or way. Going from 100 to 150 means 50% progress, but it only takes a 33% decrease to go from 150 to 100. This is why missing a habit streak hurts more than showing up and doing less. So even on days with low motivation, show up for a 5-minute workout or reading that 1 page (or even paragraph!)But then, it seems, we are predisposed to certain habits due to our genes. Genes don’t determine our destiny, but they do determine our areas of opportunity. The aim, according to the author, is to align our ambition with our ability, and build habits that work with our personality. Notice a slightly amusing irony here: I read this book because I realised that there are certain habits I must build (like meditation) but struggle to do so. If I only target habits that work well with my personality, then I’ll naturally build them and won’t need this book! This is a very simple read, and probably a great introduction to behavioural science applications. We can automate our habits so that our System 2 (analytical brain) does not have to strain itself by consuming energy in simply following through. Automation means making habit second nature and System 1 (reflex/stimulus brain) driven. This is why repetition is key. Despite having read quite a bit on behavioural science already, I’d recommend it because it’s one of the most palatable and practical books if you’re looking to get started with this subject."
84,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59737478-amine,4,"Great book. Well researched, simple, straight forward (for the most part).I would recommend this book to any who look at the title and think ""I could use that"" because it lives up to its title. If you struggle with building or breaking habits, this book will offer useful insight on how to do that, or at least help you understand why it is that way. In case you are already familiar with the research behind the study, you could still benefit from seeing how that study can be put into action.I think the magic of this book lies in how close to home it hits, James Clear knows his stuff.The downside is that at a certain point things start to get blurry, while most of the book is well organized and clear, could be just a personal experience of mine. Besides that, some points which clearly need more in-depth discussion are not given enough light. It depends whether that was the best option, to not complicate things. All in all, definitely worthwhile, I learned much of this book. Maybe the trajectory of my life just shifted."

The stories shared on habits and performance from the British cycling team to Chris rock helped drive the message through."
86,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72021544-a-bibliophile-s-compendium,1,"The book is a rehash of other authors' work, skimmed off the top. There are useful basic ideas in the book but if you look at it closely, you can see that the author is lacking a real understanding of these concepts. He doesn't explore them in depth and his conclusions are based on what he's learned from reading and then applied to his own life. He experiments on himself and then concludes ""I did it, so it must be true"". For example he says ""Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last."" What about addiction? Everything we know about addiction clearly contradicts the above statement from Clear. He also says ""Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity."" Baseless bollocks with no scientific grounds. Sure, this maybe the case for him but he has absolutely no evidence to back-up to generalize this claim. I understand he might be coming from a good place, he clearly believes he is doing good but this work is undone by the large number of statements that are untested, unquestioned or just plain false based on the current scientific evidence. What I could tell from this book and his online presence is that he is very skilled at copy-writting / summarizing other people's work and at self-promotion. Even though he considers himself to be a writer, he is not. Again, he is a copy-writer, a marketer, not a scientist, not a writer. And I get how he might seem like a great starting point if this is the first time you're stumbling across these ideas. But I say, read more books from more reputable sources, backed-up but more than an audience of subscribers and then come and see how your really feel about this content. Or not, it's really your choice. If the book came from a different perspective I could have disregarded all of this and cherry picked the good. If he would have built it like ""this is my experience, this I what I've learned throughout my life through learning and experimentation, it might work for you"". But it wasn't written like this. It's written with certainty that everything he says is true, scientifically proven and applied to everyone. He attaches his opinions to scientific facts twisting into his own version of the truth. The two quotes alone should make you question his credibility but if you don't believe me, feel free to see for yourself.Overall, a lot of hype, not a lot of substance."
87,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14122535-vivek-aithal,5,"This is an excellent book for people (like me) who want to design more efficient and long lasting habits in their lives. This may seem trite to many folks, but it unlocks greater mindspace for more creative, interesting tasks. Also, habits are the best way to get compounding benefits (meditation, exercise, relationship etc). This is a user manual, more than a passive read. I read this after 'Power of Habit', which made it more enjoyable, I think. Do implement! Memorable Quotes and Thoughts - you get what you repeat- plateau of latent potential- when nothing helps, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two. And I know it was not that last blow that did it - but all that had gone before- focus on systems and not on goals- implementation intention - specific location and time- habit stacking - one habit on top of the other existing ones- environment is everything, for habits to develop- it's easier to avoid temptation than to resist it- it is the anticipation of the reward, not the fulfillment of it, that gets us to take action- the greater the friction, less likely the habit- habits are the entry point, not the end point. They're the cab, not the gym.- figure out gateway habits- the problem isn't knowledge, it is consistency- what is immediately rewarded is repeated and what is immediately punished is avoided- frequency >>>>>> time for building new neural pathways- missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit- first rule of compounding - never interrupt it unnecessarily- goldilocks rule - be at the edge of your abilities- handle boredom in the face of repetition- the greatest threat to success is not failure, it's boredom- variable reward - this keeps people hooked, by simulating the goldilocks rule - candy crush?"
88,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8580024-pam,4,"4.5*I found this book to be extremely helpful, even on the first day that I started reading it. I immediately changed the way I think about myself (organized and productive vs. unorganized and lazy) and created a plan to change my morning habits. It was much easier to do than I imagined. Mostly, I think it is because I wanted the change. I don't think there are any ideas in this book that I've never considered or didn't try BUT it was the presentation of ideas and the explanation of why we act the way we do (e.g., the cues and rewards) that were most helpful. The specific bad habits that I can relate to (most importantly) include time spent on social media and watching TV (even just having it on in the background). I already have lots of good habits but I like the author's idea of habit stacking (building on those habits). I had not thought of it that way, even though I do it. I am more likely now to consciously (with a plan) habit-stack, to incorporate the good habits I want to form.The author has presented practical solutions to addressing different behaviors. Some are more draconian than I need but by telling myself I will resort to those measures, that alone is already changing my behavior. (E.g., I do not want to delete my GR app from my phone!) I've had 2 successful days at changing my morning routine and I feel really good! I have other areas to work on but, for me, that is the most important time of the day and a great start. Thank you James Clear for writing this book! I feel like it was the push that I needed. I don't know where I heard about this book but I requested my library to purchase it, which they did! So, I also thank the Albuquerque Library System for adding this book to their on-line collection."
89,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50883989-lech-kaniuk,0,"Atomic HabitsA powerful thought in Atomic Habits, except of all the great examples of how to create and maintain good habits - is the fact that many very small habits will compound over time and give great effect and results. 1. Make it obvious. 2. The environment matters.3. Create barriers for the stuff you don’t want to do automatically and expose and make it easier to do the things you want to do. For example, if you want to eat less sweets and more healthy, hide the sweets and put a bowl of fruit on the table instead. 4. Try the 2-minute rule. For example, instead of committing to long workouts or meditation from start, commit to a 2-minute session as a start. It will be easier to get going and you’ll see that the sessions will last longer than 2 min very quickly. 5. Make it attractive. Track your progress or create some kind of reward for doing what you want to do.6. Make it satisfying. The 1000 Books Challenge: 168/1000"
90,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75306141-rhett-reisman,5,"This book does a good job of combining common self improvement ideas from other books - making this seem like a 2019 definitive edition of self improvement. The thesis is: “small habits don’t add up, they compound” or getting 1% better everyday makes you 37 times better every year, getting 1% worse will deplete you. James comes up with a four step framework to create new habits and get rid of old bad habits by starting small. This approach resonates with me as it confirms my experience of creating a gym habit. I started by doing 10 pushups a day, that was really easy and I wouldn’t make excuses to get out of it because it could be done in less than 5 minutes. Eventually, I built up to going to a gym, and now three years later I very rarely miss a day. Through this book James is able to clearly articulate a system that will let you apply what I did with my gym habit to any habit in your life. Be patient and trust the process - Joel Embiid (probably)"

Not the author's fault, but that fucked it up a bit for me, after every chapter I kept on asking myself, okay but is the point of all this to amp up my productivity for the bottomless system of consumption in capitalism? Fuck that. And why should I make something of my life? Exercise? Eat healthy? To help sustain an environment of greed and ecocide? Well, this book is a tool, like the H-bomb, no wait bad example, like an axe, and if you use it in a bad way, or for bad, it can become a weapon. Eichmann was a boring creature of habit reportedly.

Make it unsatisfyingThe best part that I liked is that he talks about the three layers of thinking: systems are what you do, outcomes are what you get, and identity is what you believe in.

Maybe it’s just because I was listening via audiobook, but the first couple of sections mostly sound like a long infomercial for the James Clear’s website. And the Clear is pretty self-aggrandizing. It might be that I’m just not used to listening to self-help-style books.That said, by the time I finished the audiobook, I had added seven habits I’m trying to build to my habit tracker app (called HabitShare... highly recommend!) and had also put more thought into how I could “stack” the habits to make them more successful. Is a 5-minute meditation, using the Peloton app, more effective in the morning before I start my day or after my workout when I’m already more in-tune with my body (and usually already have the Peloton app open on my phone)?This is the first summer during which I’m not writing a book or taking grad school classes or applying for jobs, so it was supposed to be a summer of music festivals and the beach and pretty much nothing else. Now that covid has cancelled those big plans, it’s been a bit of a challenge for me to feel purposeful. Without consciously planning on it, I’ve started using my extra time to focus on my health—physically and, I guess, mentally, too. I mean, the point of a habit is to be more productive: When you don’t need to spend time thinking about if and how and when you should do something, when you just do it habitually, you have more mental energy (and time) to devote to the rest of your day. This book has helped give some structure to the small changes (habits) I’m trying to make.It’s also the reason people might see me smiling madly at nothing when I start a run—to try to trick my brain into thinking that I am a person who loves running."
114,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4459767-filipa,5,"This book is a game-changer. I loved how practical, how hands-on this reading was. I was expecting another book deeply focused on theories (and that's nothing wrong with that, I love that the authors know what they talk about and research about everything they mention in their books) but James Clear mixes theory with real-life problems and very practical examples and he offers practical and easy strategies for us to implement immediately in our lives. I could recognise myself in various examples given by the author and that was crucial in order to really connect, create empathy with this reading and focus on the message. I think this might be the book about habits that will finally help me change some of my behaviours. Its message and the way the message and strategies were presented impacted me deeply and it has made a real impression on my brain. I've read some books about habits (I recommend reading Charles Duhigg's books - The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business) but Atomic Habits was so hands-on that I can really see myself using it as my guide, my motivator and my orientation to break some of my habits and build good ones. This was super inspiring and now that I've read once, I will start putting its strategies to practice. "

What really makes this book a five star, however, is the absolutely life-changing tips. While this the first time I have read the book in full, I have been using his recommendations for routines, internalizing habits, and making habits easier (through the describing of a friend who recommended the book) to build habits for two months now. I am constantly marveling at how much more productive I have been since using this advice, but even more importantly how much time I have to do the things important to me!

At the end of this book, through Clear's easy-to-follow and practical guidance, I have successfully implemented (or stopped) all of them. This book took what felt like a few abstract ideas of how I would one day, eventually, improve my quality of life through being more disciplined and focused, and gave me the knowledge and tools needed to turn those ideas into attainable realities. It felt like I was hacking into a secret realm of human behavior. Like I was learning how to ""trick"" myself into change. It was equally so surprisingly simple and so complex.

EDM has surprised me from time to time as well. I was really expecting to find the book distasteful. But, I thoroughly enjoyed it. James Clear hooks you in from the introduction pages. He attributes everything good about the book, to the geniuses who came before him, while admitting that the book might be full of fallacies considering he has written it.The anecdotes were simple but sufficient to drive towards the point. Each idea and method were so simple, I began applying it to my life while I was reading this. We fall into many practices which eats away at our life, minute by minute. James reminds us how challenging oneself can make you a better person. Good habits does not have to be an attainable goal. Once you sit down, and dismantle it piece-by-piece you get the see certain patterns in our behaviour, which makes us slaves to our own failings. We associate schedules as something that takes away our freedom. That is a common misconception. Along with all this, James tries to answer- why we love junk food? Why your tribe is important? And how pain can turn out to be an absolute pleasure. Thank you, James. Very cool."

124,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40236446-bartosz-majewski,5,A rare example of a book designes to equip reader in tools to drive change in himself. A lot of books deal with abstraxt concepts - however after reading a few books on the topic i found that the topic of habits needs a practical approach. This is it. Clear has delivered a lot of value through his writing. Highly recommended.

There is one other author who did this, The Irrationality Series, Dan Arielly also talks about his burn wounds. It was extremely painful to read and so was this authors suffering, the episode about the baseball bat smashing his skull into pieces, was absolutely painful to read. I was able to visualize it in my mind and the picture wouldn't go away. This is how the book will be remembered by many audience, as a grotesque face, disfigured by a baseball bat. Getting into the book, it does not have any value addition what so ever, if you have read1. The Power of Habit2. Hooked, How to build habit forming products3. Nudge by Richard ThalerBut if you have not read these books, you might appreciate the book better. The book is merely a derivative work of the principles discussed in those three books, the author has not made any contributions of his own, except his personal journey using the principles discussed in those two books. i.e. the practice of the habits and how he created his own habits is discussed. Power of Habit is more like a text book or a reference book about habits and its research. This book is written from the point of view of one persons suffering and his discovery of habits. POV is different, the rest is the same. I don't seen any extra value addition done by this book. The book also takes its elements from Hooked: How to build habit forming products. The concepts are all borrowed, though the author might have discovered them through independent research (I would like to give him the benefit of doubt), but I wish that the author did not include the part about the bat smashing his skull, it was painful to read! But I don't see any extra value addition, because I have already read those three books! This work is merely a touch feely, emotional derivative work of the more formal theories discovered in the power of habit and other pioneers!This book also talks about modifying the environment to create habits, this has been taken from Nudge by the Nobel Prize winning Richard Thaler. I don't take an issue with the author taking the best from all the books, but the author has to create some value addition, and not merely stitch a suit from pieces and beautiful rags he found while hiking in the woods! This book is a more practical advice, geared towards an individual, but the important thing to understand is that anybody (with a little imagination) who would have read Nudge, Power of Habits and Hooked could have created these patterns either consciously or sub-consciously. I say this out of experience, I engineered my own addictions, very powerful and productive habits, that started reaping compound interests after two to three years. I don't dislike the book, I just wish that the author could have done some experiments of his own and added more value through his efforts. The only value addition of the author might be that he could have saved some time for people, who could not read three very large books. He replaced it with one very small book!The maximum value addition is done in the last two to three chapters, where he mixes up concepts from various other books i.e. from FLOW, Deliberate Practice and The Talent Code. Where he analyzes the conflict of genes in building the habit and how to build a habit and keep improving the habit ie.. by deliberately pushing the limits and not getting stagnated with the habit, he also talks about the conditions in which a habit would be most interesting i.e. FLOW pre-requisites. The value addition of the book in reducing these very awesome concepts into a language that is easy for a common person to understand and creating tools, i.e. everyday practical tools and not merely concepts and theories, I use the habit tracking tool. I have bought myself some marbles and jars and I now track my work using those marbles and jars, thanks to his advice. It is working like a charm, because ""OUT OF SIGHT OUT OF MIND"", though I might take pride in the fact that I am a rational intelligent being, I must also accept the fact that most of my brain is just ancient! I was tracking my work with digital dashboards and apps, but marbles and jars are a better replacement to these work tracking apps any day, because they are more physical and more visible. THUS THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE AUTHOR IS CONVERTING THEORETICAL CONCEPTS FROM VARIOUS BOOKS INTO PRACTICAL AND USABLE CONCEPTSHere is a list of books that the author explicitly mentions in this book:Arts and FearAlan Carr's Easy way to stop smokingGuns, Germs and Steel"

127,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3289004-nathik,5,"Atomic Habits by James Clear has been one of the beneficial books that I have read this year. And I wanted to share the notes and ideas which helped me with you all.The crux of the book is that Habits are the compound interest of self improvement. The effects of your habits multiplies as you repeat them just like money. A simple change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination.According to James Clear, all habits revolves around the below four step model and any behavior change revolves around these steps.CueCravingResponseRewardAggregation of Marginal gains:It doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What really matter is whether your habits are putting you in the right path to success. Instead of focusing on your current results, you should you concerned with your current trajectory. Your aim should be to become 1% better everyday. Winning tiny battles like hitting the gym each week, reading books each day and spending less than you earn each month will define your future.Can 1 % improvement really make any difference?Habits often appears to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. People make few small changes and when they fail to see immediate results, they quit. This is the prime reason why people struggle to build habits that lasts.Mastery require patience. Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiple whatever you feed it. Good Habits makes time your ally and Bad habits make time your enemy.Habits and Identity:The more pride you have in a particular aspects of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. James argues that identity is literally your “repeated being”. The frequency of your habits influence your identity and vice versa. The goal is NOT to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.Two step process:Decide the type of person you want to be.Prove it to your self with small wins.The First Law:Create a habit scorecard: Make a list of your daily habits.Once you list, look at each habits and ask yourself “Is this a good/bad or a neutral habit?. Assign ‘+’ if its a good habit, ‘-‘ for bad habit and ‘=’ for neutral habit.Design your environment:Environment is the invisible hand that shapes your behavior. If you want to make a behavior change, make a cue a big part of your environment. The most persistent behavior will usually have multiple cues.Habit Stacking:Best way to build a new habit is to identity a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top.The Second Law:We need to make our habits attractive so learn to associate them with positive experience. Sometimes all you need is a slight mind-set shift.The Third Law:If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection. You just need to practice it often. The more you repeat an activity, the more structure of your brain changes to become efficient at it. Example: Learn a new language, play an instrument require repetition.Two minutes rule:When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.Example: Read before bed each night becomes “Read one page”. Run three miles becomes “take out my running shoes”.The Fourth Law:What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished it avoided. Reward yourself after every new habit. Take a bubble bath or going on a leisurely walk.Never miss twiceYou don’t realize how valuable it is to just show up on your bad days. Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you. So always show up.Create a Habit contract:Create a habit contract with you partner or your friend. This will help you stay the course.These are some of the best points I have found helpful from the book. Let me know if you have found other great tips for habit building.If you are looking for more Habit hacks, then I recommend that you follow James clear on twitter."
128,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65978670-tiago-faleiro,5,"A marvellous book, and greatly exceeded my expectations. The book starts with an introduction to the basic of habits the compounding effect of small actions, its role in your identity, and the process of building better habits. One of the main themes of the book is that habits depend on the systems you've set in place, and not on your motivation alone. ""If you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and againnot because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.""James provides a framework of 4 laws in order to optimize the creation of good habits: The 1st law is to make it obvious. You need to be aware of your current habits and make the intention of the implementation incredibly specific. Set out the specific behaviour, time and location in advance. Stacking habits is useful and should be taken advantage of. Instead of having them dispersed throughout the day, create chains of habits. And lastly, design your environment so that the cues for the habits are as obvious and visible as possible. The 2nd law is to make it attractive. We tend to do what's easier, which is generally not what we need to do. Pair the behaviour you're trying to achieve with a behaviour that is enjoyable. This will create a motivation for the needed behaviour by taking advantage of what's paired with. Humans are social creatures, and we're wired to be aware and respond to our social environment. This should be taken advantage of. Join a community and culture that values the behaviour you're trying to achieve. The 3rd law is to make it easy. If we're lazy and take the easier route, then the desired behaviour better be as easy as possible. Prime the environment for that action, decrease the number of steps needed, optimize small choices leading up to it, down-scale your habits to tiny chucks (James recommends a rule of down-sizing to something that can be done in 2 minutes), and lastly make it as automatic as you can, technology being a great aid. The 4th law is to make it satisfying. Reinforce the action with an immediate reward. Not only positive actions, but the lack of negative ones as well. Track your habits to give you a representation of how far you've come and avoid breaking the chain. If you do break the chain, never miss twice. If you fail, get back to it immediately. In addition to those 4 laws to create a good habit, James creates an inversion of them to do the exact opposite - breaking a bad habit. Instead of make it obvious, you try to make it invisible by reducing exposure to the cues that are associated with the bad habit. Instead of make it attractive, you make it unattractive by reframing your mindset and highlighting the consequences of your bad habits. Instead of making it easy, you make it as difficult as possible. Increase friction and increase the number of steps needed. Lastly, instead of making it satisfying, you make it unsatisfying. By getting someone to keep you accountable and watch your behaviour, you extend the liability to another person. We don't want other people to know our failures. Habit contracts are also useful, where you set up specific costs for your bad habits, and make them undesirable and public. What I found most surprising was the perfect balance between being scientific and practical. There always a trade-off between being too technical and not applicable, and trying to oversimply it without providing an adequate scientific explanation. James somehow magically managed to merge the two flawlessly. In addition, the book is incredibly easy to read. It never feels like a chore, and plenty of charts and summaries makes sure you're retaining the information well. It's truly a masterpiece of a book and guaranteed to help anyone improve their lives by improving their habits."

Clear is very clear (pun intended) on the processes that need to be put into place to build good habits and limit bad habits. Many of the examples Clear used i was noticing in my own life and was able to remedy them immediately. For example ""You’re more likely to find a behaviour attractive if you get to do one of your favourite things at the same time."" I knew that I spent time watching TV (usually sports over the summer) while playing mobile games. Rather than do this, I decided going on walks would be a good way to have some alone time to listen to podcasts (one of my favourite things to do). Now I look forward to going on a walk because it means I get to listen to podcasts. "

Clear provides actionable nuggets to improve your life - if you so choose!Notable Quotes:“The quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits. With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results.” “A slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very different destination.” “At some point it comes down to who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the same lifts over and over and over.”“Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.”“You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.”Habits are dopamine-driven feedback loops. The more dopamine, the more motivation.It is the ANTICIPATION of reward, not fulfillment itself that makes us act. The greater the anticipation, the bigger the dopamine spike.There are many ways to address the same underlying motive. Habits are all about associations. We sense cues all the time, but it’s only when you think you’d be better off in a different state that you act. Desire is the difference between where you are now and where you want to be in the future.Even the tiniest action is tinged with the motivation to feel differently than you do in the moment…What you really want is to FEEL different.Don’t ask “how long does it take to build a new habit,” ask “how MANY [reps] does it take to form a new habit.” What matters is the RATE at which you perform the behavior, the frequency.Master the habit of showing up…a habit must be established before it can be improved.Sometimes success is less about making good habits easy and more about making bad habits hard.Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit.Habits are easier to do and more satisfying to stick with when they align with your natural inclinations and abilities. Genes don’t determine your destiny, but they determine your areas of opportunity. “Genes can predispose, but they don’t predetermine.” -  Gabor MateBuild habits that work with your personality. If you want to exercise you can do it alone or with others, etc. There’s a version of every habit that can bring you satisfaction. Find it. Habits must be enjoyable to stick. In theory you can enjoy almost anything. In practice, you enjoy what comes easily to you. Play a game where the odds are in your favor. When you can’t win by being better, you can win by being different. By combining your skills, you reduce the level of competition. Specialization is a way to overcome the accident of genetics. The more you master a skill, the harder it is for others to compete with you.The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.I loved the book's Appendix, summarized as:•	Happiness is the absence of desire. But it’s fleeting because another desire always comes along.•	We chase the idea of pleasure. We don’t actually know if the attainment will satisfy (that’s why Victor Frankl said happiness can’t be pursued, it must ensue)•	Peace means not turning observations into problems.•	Emotions drive behavior. We can only be rational after we’ve been emotional (That’s why appealing to emotion works better than appeals to reason).•	Suffering: a desire for change in state. It is also the source of progress.•	Seneca: being poor is not having too little, it is wanting more.•	If your wants > your likes, you’ll always be unsatisfied.•	Desire initiates, pleasure sustains."

This is the perfect example of why- don't take a 2 star to mean awful! Here is why ⬇️:The main ideas and principles of this book are incredibly important and I imagine helpful to many people. He does a great job of highlighting the importance of seeing the beauty and impact of focusing on small improvements that compound over time. I can absolutely see why this is such a leading book in the self help world.Also, I always love reading about fascinating studies in psychology or social experiments- who doesn't? My youtube history attests to how much I enjoy watching experiments on human behavior lol. If you enjoy stories and case studies that you would hear in the likes of a psychology class, you may especially like how he writes this book. Almost every chapter starts with one. If you don't like that? You will grow tired of those very quick.One thing that remains on my mind after finishing this is that he starts the book with personal background about an awful injury he suffered, and also how he ended up excelling in college by utilizing good habits. So I don't think it's wrong to assume the rest of the book would give details about the exact habits he used? Because... he doesn't. He gives several good strategies, yes, but I kept thinking, ""cool, but what habits did YOU use that you said made you so successful in college?"" Rather than relying on general scenarios of others using some of these habits, that would have added to this book a great deal since that is how he chose to kick off the book. It makes me question if his college success was purely from good habits as he says.I think the weak point of this book was in the execution. I think this book could have been much shorter, particularly due to its repetitive nature. That may just be a personal pet peeve though because perhaps my number one criticism about self help books I've read, is they could have been shorter. This also feels like a summary of other people's works and framed as his own ideas (like, literally renaming concepts that are already established.....kinda weird), rather than a new fresh take. And certain stories seemed to be really simplified to serve a particular idea, or I would wonder if it was even a good example to use for his point. Again, I may be overanalyzing here.In the end, I think this is an informative book about habits and the cognitive side behind them, and lays out useful strategies! However, the repetitiveness bogged down my enjoyment of this. "

The author breaks down seemingly insurmountable goals to easy building blocks: just establish one good habit at a time to progress to where you want to be. It's not shiny. It's not a quick fix. It's a daily choice to progress towards where you want to be. The popularity of this book may in part be related to the popularity of bullet journals; as far as which came first, it's a chicken and the egg scenario. What I do know is that, for someone with anxiety, reading a success story built upon small positive changes was more helpful than listening to another overnight fame podcast story. With this said, it is not possible to divide every day into being all of the things that I would like to be. Reader. Writer. Musician. Teacher. Friend. Good cook. Mom. Partner. Healthy. Voter. Daughter. Sister. Volunteer. Hiker. Karaoke aficionado. I think the hardest part of establishing habits is, at least for me, deciding how to spend those precious few free hours of spare time (because sleeping, eating, and finding a way to pay the bills are not optional).

137,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5822873-kaustubh,5," Atomic Habits: Big impacts are always built over a foundation of numerous small steps True to his name, James Clear, provides a lucid narrative on how to cultivate, optimize, and maintain good habits, and rather importantly, also how to relegate bad practices. I am highly critical of texts that present behavioral arguments without providing reproducible research to back them up but Clear strikes a compelling balance between one-off examples and how they fit under the bigger paradigm of peer-reviewed research. Atomic Habits details why certain habits are easily followed whereas others are not and how one might go about making habits easier to achieve. A major concept is that small steps add up and Clear does an excellent job of showcasing and exploring the impacts of such seemingly incremental changes in one’s workflow. I found several similarities with Anders Ericsson's  Peak, but while the latter goes more into the dynamics of achievement, Atomic Habits doesn't care much about achievement and instead, prioritizes and personalizes the importance of how any achievements come about in the first place. Overall, Atomic Habits is a fantastic resource for developing and facilitating habits conducive to your overall wellbeing and work ethic. It also contains effective information on how to push away habitual behavior that might be detrimental to you. I expect that this will be a resource that I’ll be coming back to again and again. "

You do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.”  This is, very likely, the most efficiently and effectively written book on the subject of habit formation you’ll find. James Clear presents a well rounded compendium of pertinent knowledge on the subject. He draws this knowledge into to a coherent framework which is easily relatable and (most importantly) easily applicable. I have to commend the clarity, conciseness and preciseness that Clear embodies in his approach. Whether you are familiar with some of the myriad of research used (which I was to a proportion) or a relative new comer to this subject; Clear’s logical overview and framework is exemplary. Clear manages to be both clinical and accessible in his writing.It really is hard for me to criticise this book, the clarity that Clear displays is almost beguiling; in that he makes topics which may be far more complex (when presented in other contexts) seem surprisingly simple. Although this surface level of simplicity is a potential source of criticism — I see this as a triumph of Clear’s approach.In particular Clear’s synthesis and framing of identity transformation as a key mantra is one that I have noted being discussed, by others, many times in relation to this book. It is indeed a key component that should not be overlooked.This is overall an excellent body of work which is supported by a great collection of additional materials provided by the author (via web link)."

True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.” In Anatomic Habits James Clear shares his believes about the importance of habits. He himself suffered a severe brain injury as a teenager, which forced him to work his way back up, which he did by the implemention of small habits. He starts with describing their impact and formation and with which mindset we should approach them, before sharing their fundamental anatomy.Going from there he introduced his four laws of behavior change. He claims that if we fail to obey even one of those laws, we will fail with forming a new behavior and shares strategies how to stick to them.This book helped me to look at myself more critical and with more awareness. I feel like I have been provided with tools for thought through actions to conquer underlying causes of bad habits and form new ones.Naturally the application of those rules lies in the hands of the reader. No book can help you to change your actions, if you don‘t change your actions. But I experienced his thinking process as very logical and observe the laws in my own behaviors, helping me to understand and observe myself better, which I believe to be the foundation of all personal changes.Pro Tip: Read ""The Power of Habit"" by Charles Duhigg first and ""Anatomic Habits"" by James Clear after! They build up on each other."

For me they felled all into a category of ""peptalkish"" self-help for bored housewives. I've changed my mind after reading Heath+Heath ""Switch"" - I've found it very good & in fact ... helpful. Not only in context of myself, but also others.I've read this one (AH) as some sort of experiment - some recommended it to me & I wanted to confirm whether there's anything else to add to the subject. The other reason was that I wanted to test Scribd streaming & this book was available ;)Anyway, honestly - this is a GOOD book. Maybe even more useful & easier to ""turn into action"" than beforespoken ""Switch"". My initial feeling was that JC (author) wants to ""sell"" me some ""framework"" he has pulled out of his ass (pardon the words), but it's not some artificial ritual but very reasonable & convincing break-down on how to introduce/break habits w/o relying on sheer motivation (which is proven not to work as well as we've always thought): cues, cravings, responses, rewards.His method really resonates with my own observations & what has worked & what didn't (in my past). It doesn't feel ""artificial"" or unnatural - IMHO thinking about builing/breaking habits in this way has a huge potential to really help you. The book itself ain't long or ""over-talked"": clear, well-structured, to the point, no cheap brain-wash.Truly recommended."

James Clear explains how and why habits are formed, and gives steps to follow for breaking bad habits and establishing productive ones. He points out that “You do not rise to the level of your goals; you fall to the level of your systems.” He then encourages the reader that it is really a simple two-step process: 1.) Decide the type of person you want to be. 2.) Prove it to yourself with small wins. He breaks down how a habit is formed (cue, craving, response, and reward), and elaborates on each step throughout the rest of the book, making sensible and doable suggestions. My only criticism of the book is that he makes passing reference a couple times to our “evolutionary ancestors,” which always irritates me, but it’s easy enough to skim over those. This book would make an excellent gift for graduates and young people who are still establishing their identity, but I highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to form habits that will support the type of person you want to be. It’s never too late to change your habits!"

James Clear is a habit expert and in this engaging audiobook helps us understand and develop habits—yet in an uncomplicated, everybody can do it sort of way.ATOMIC HABITS opens with the story of the British cycling team who instead of huge goals decided to change things by one percent. When most of us want to change a habit like lose weight or make more money or ???, we set a major goal then most of us fail in this process. Clear advocates and teaches how to change in small increments which is much more possible. The British cycling team made incremental one percent changes in their pillow, their clothing, the massage oil, and many other elements. It transformed the team into winning Olympic gold medals. Clear contends to make a new effective habit means developing a system. This audiobook is loaded with insights for every reader.

144,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6428619-deepika,4,"A quick, easy read that discusses plenty of ideas around habit formation and how to stick with them. I’ve personally found a couple of them really helpful – one being that one of the best ways to getting started on a new habit is to ritualize the first two minutes of it. The idea being our resistance is mostly to getting started and once that’s passed it usually gets easier. This has been especially useful with my running – my plan was just to put on my running shoes without thinking too much. Of course, I don’t do that as often as I want, but it really is easier once you get started and that can be as simple as putting on your shoes. Another thing that I have trouble implementing but seems like a great idea - is to designate spaces for certain things. The example cited is of people who had trouble sleeping and how when they stopped using their phones in the bedroom, they found it easier to fall asleep. I’ve been trying to do that – a couple of days I left the phone in the living room and swore that I’ll never again bring it to my bedroom – but oh it’s so hard. There were a number of other things that I’d known about earlier, but reading them again in this book – which is so well organized – was still worth the while."

This short book (45 pages in large font) is a perfect example as in few pages it manages to present very useful tips, example and strategy to do an effective transformation of our life. Simplicity does not means put less effort, on the contrary, but finding the right way to focus our energies and thoughts is paramount. I really appreciate both aspect of the book:- a theoretical overview, short and concise, on how our mind (and habits) work and influence us and how positively change the framework with few simple (not for that, easy) steps.- pragmatic examples that help us focusing on what is really needed to be done to change. For example the point in focusing on daily schedule of regular action and not on ultimate ambitious objectives gives a perfect picture on how the transformation can, and does, work. For completing the reading I strongly recommend to subscribe also to the bi-weekly newsletter or regularly read post from James Clear blog. You will get other good examples that will help you taylorize the approach to your own goals and needs. A revealing reading that I will re-read on regular basis. "
146,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1762558-amanda,4,"Someone recommended this book to me, so I bought it, because honestly, I have a lot of bad habits and a lot of habits I'd like to establish. I have trouble sticking to a lot of them (cleaning routines, workout schedules longer than a couple of weeks, etc.), and want to do better. I found this book very helpful in that regard. James Clear's suggestions re: habit stacking and scheduling were useful, and while they feel very much like common sense once you consider them, somehow I've never tried to structure my habits this way before. He also gave examples that I found motivational, including mentioning that it's better to show up at the gym for five minutes than to skip it entirely, which has kept me going with my workouts while I have a cold this week — 60% effort is better than 0%, and I've stayed on track.I'd recommend reading this if you want to learn more about establishing good habits or breaking bad ones. I haven't read a lot of books about habits, or a lot of self-help books in general, so my review takes that into account. If you've read other books that are habit-related, I'm not sure whether this book will be useful. "
147,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9945293-neelam-babul,5,"Atomic Habits is a highly acclaimed and profoundly useful book. It is a practical guide to identifying and changing your habits.  The book is simple and straightforward. The writer starts each chapter with an example, introduces you to the concept in a simple manner and provides you with concrete steps and ways to apply the concept in real life. This book is worth reading. It’s easy to apply the knowledge and go through the action steps. It is a book which will make you more aware of yourself and provides a good lens through which you can view yourself and others. It serves as an effective platform for analyzing your habits, tuning them to reflect your identity and to develop it in a way which serves your interests. One of the best books I have read. Being a huge fan of James Clear, I can say that I am looking forward to reading more books by this wonderful author."
148,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45946197-renee,4,"Don't get me wrong, this is a well written, sounds facts and practical book on creating habits. I read many books of habits and like all the others if does give me the "" self-help"" vibe that leaves a bit of bad taste in my mouth. It has nothing to do with the author but more with my personal taste. One point missing here was the heart issues, habits and habit training can become a bandaid to cover up the real underlining issues. If you don't address the sin of sloth and laziness, you can train yourself to do the habit without mental work ( get the wheel into motion without mental efforts ) but if you don't deal with the sins, are you really growing and changing ? I would recommend this book for anyone who would like practical ideas of out to get out of their rut and who want to make changes toward some goals they set for themselves."
149,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99928108-brandon-still,5,"Atomic Habits by James Clear exceeded my expectations. In his book, he illustrates simplistic, yet profound ideas that shift our sights from focusing on our goals, to focusing on the systems we use to achieve these goals. He directs us with the four laws of behavior change; make it obvious, make it easy, make it attractive, and make it satisfying. While these are the keys to creating good habits, he inversely explains the keys to terminating bad habits; make it invisible, make it hard, make it unattractive, and make it unsatisfying. Being intentional and deliberate of what we create our habits to be, directly correlates to continuously improving in every aspect we choose in our lives. James closes by saying, ""it's remarkable what you can build if you just don't stop, habits don't add up, they compound."""

He provides the reader with a framework and a various of practical implementations for acquiring new and getting rid of bad habits. Clear also provides downloadable templates making it easy to start implementing the material from his book. Changing behavior is hard, but it really seems quite simple, or at least, possible after reading Clear’s advice. I’m excited to try it out."
151,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17166082-maarten-den-braber,4,"A good book about how to form habits that holds a lot of practical tips and advice. It's American for sure in that it's written in the standard template of: introductory stories - concept - some more examples - a few other concepts - summary. It completely fits the self-help-book mold. It isn't too dense, includes a lot of summaries (you could do very well just reading those) and links to reference or follow-up materials. I appreciated the appendix where the author refers to some 'lessons learned' about human behavior as a result of the framework he introduces. A good enough read for anyone interested in habits with lots of possibilities for follow-up. Best is to read this book twice: once for the concepts and once selecting those concepts to go and act on."
152,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23414375-andra,4,"James Clear has a thoroughly enjoyable writing style, one that suits both the web and the book format.If you haven't read any of his articles, you'll find a wealth of practical knowledge in his book, illustrated with memorable examples.If you have read his articles, the book will be an experience of tying it all together - his work, his experience, his ideas and mental models - in a framework you can apply right away to change your harmful habits or start building healthy ones.It's a light read that provides a balanced perspective on habit-building and that complements nicely one of my previous reads, Charles Duhigg's The Power of Habit, which I highly recommend as well. "
153,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1178748-ibrahim,5,"The book starts off with a very powerful testimony of how the author has come out victorious, getting back on top of the horse, when his nose and head were once severely injured. I am gripped by what I’m reading and love everything he is writing. I take down notes from the book verbatim. For instance, he made sure to make a point about keeping his room neat and tidy, and while these are minor improvements yet they gave him a sense of control over his life and he started to feel confident once again (p.6). Despite his depth of experience and evident wisdom, James Clear amazes me by his humility. "

155,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4565947-jaana,4,"It’s a good book. Strictly explains how habits work and how to either get rid of a bad habit or adopt a good one. You really can’t fail with habits after reading this. Has some science in it as well to explain stuff. Doesn’t have the classic annoying American self help book disease where everything with substance is said in the first chapter and the rest of the 300 pages just repeat the same thing. It could be 5 stars but personally I didn’t learn a lot of new stuff, I guess I have now read a few books around habits ... "

Missing twice is the start of a new habit.”Definitely one I'll be re-reading with a highlighter and some post-it notes in hand. This book contains page after page of small, impactful daily changes to help you reach your goals and, more importantly, make sure you're aiming for the right goals in the first place. I'm recommending this one to anyone interested in self-improvement and becoming a better you. "

It got really annoying real quick. If someone wants to visit the site, they will, wouldn’t you telling them 100 times. There were good tips, the core of the book was that small changes will lead to great results eventually. Of course, consistency is the key. Not too short, not too long book. The length of the book was just perfect! "

It is full of practical strategies to build new habits and change old ones, categorized in a very organized way. I listened to the audio book, about 5 hours, which was just the right amount of time to convey the information in my opinion. I didn't feel like there's much repetition. There was enough useful information in the book to fill the 5 hours."

But some are big and difficult to introduce or change. The main point here is incremental change, hence atomic habits! Have to start the process with small changes. You cannot do big things unless you make somethings effortless, into a habit."

176,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76007489-juan-sanoja,5,"The Fundamentals: Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference1: The Surprising Power of Atomic HabitsHabits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run.Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential.Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change.The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.”3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple StepsA habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible.Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.The first law: Make it obvious4: The Man Who Didn't Look RightWith enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it.Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing.The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions.The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.5: The Best Way to Start a New HabitThe 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it obvious.The two most common cues are time and location.Creating an implementation intention is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a specific time and location.The implementation intention formula is: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit.The habit stacking formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].6: Motivation is Overrated; Environment Often Matters MoreSmall changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior over time.Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out.Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment.Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the cue.It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues.7: The Secret to Self-ControlThe inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it invisible.Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten.People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It’s easier to avoid temptation than resist it.One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one.The second law: Make it attractive8: How to Make a Habit IrresistibleThe 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it attractive.The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act.It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike.Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.9: The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your HabitsThe culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us.We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe.We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige).One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group.The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.10: How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad HabitsThe inversion of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it unattractive.Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper underlying motive.Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires.The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them. The prediction leads to a feeling.Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem unattractive.Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings and unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings. Create a motivation ritual by doing something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.The third law: Make it easy11: Walk Slowly, but Never BackwardThe 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it easy.The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning.Focus on taking action, not being in motion.Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition.The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed it.12: The Law of Least EffortHuman behavior follows the Law of Least Effort. We will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible.Reduce the friction associated with good behaviors. When friction is low, habits are easy.Increase the friction associated with bad behaviors. When friction is high, habits are difficult.Prime your environment to make future actions easier.13: How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute RuleHabits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact your behavior for minutes or hours afterward.Many habits occur at decisive moments—choices that are like a fork in the road—and either send you in the direction of a productive day or an unproductive one.The Two-Minute Rule states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.”The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things.Standardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist.14: How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits ImpossibleThe inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it difficult.A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that locks in better behavior in the future.The ultimate way to lock in future behavior is to automate your habits.Onetime choices—like buying a better mattress or enrolling in an automatic savings plan—are single actions that automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time.Using technology to automate your habits is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right behavior.The fourth law: Make it satisfying15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior ChangeThe 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it satisfying.We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying.The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards.The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.To get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful—even if it’s in a small way.The first three laws of behavior change—make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy—increase the odds that a behavior will be performed this time. The fourth law of behavior change—make it satisfying—increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time.16: How to Stick with good Habits Every DayOne of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making progress.A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit—like marking an X on a calendar.Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make your habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress.Don’t break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak alive.Never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible.Just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing.17: How an Accountability Partner Can Change EverythingThe inversion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it unsatisfying.We are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or unsatisfying.An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction. We care deeply about what others think of us, and we do not want others to have a lesser opinion of us.A habit contract can be used to add a social cost to any behavior. It makes the costs of violating your promises public and painful.Knowing that someone else is watching you can be a powerful motivator.Advanced Tactics: How to Go from Being Merely Good to Being Truly Great18: The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Don't)The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition.Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle.Genes cannot be easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances.Habits are easier when they align with your natural abilities. Choose the habits that best suit you.Play a game that favors your strengths. If you can’t find a game that favors you, create one.Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on.19: The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and WorkThe Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities.The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom.As habits become routine, they become less interesting and less satisfying. We get bored.Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It’s the ability to keep going when work isn’t exciting that makes the difference.Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.20: The Downside of Creating Good HabitsThe upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside is that we stop paying attention to little errors.Habits + Deliberate Practice = MasteryReflection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious of your performance over time.The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it.Conclusion: The Secret to Results That LastCan one tiny change transform your life? It’s unlikely you would say so. But what if you made another? And another? And another? At some point, you will have to admit that your life was transformed by one small change.The holy grail of habit change is not a single 1 percent improvement, but a thousand of them. It’s a bunch of atomic habits stacking up, each one a fundamental unit of the overall system.Just as one coin won’t make you rich, one positive change like meditating for one minute or reading one page each day is unlikely to deliver a noticeable difference.Gradually, though, as you continue to layer small changes on top of one another, the scales of life start to move.Eventually, if you stick with it, you hit a tipping point. Suddenly, it feels easier to stick with good habits. The weight of the system is working for you rather than against you.Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system to improve, an endless process to refine.“If you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.”Sometimes a habit will be hard to remember and you’ll need to make it obvious. Other times you won’t feel like starting and you’ll need to make it attractive. In many cases, you may find that a habit will be too difficult and you’ll need to make it easy. And sometimes, you won’t feel like sticking with it and you’ll need to make it satisfying.You want to push your good habits toward the left side of the spectrum by making them obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying. Meanwhile, you want to cluster your bad habits toward the right side by making them invisible, unattractive, hard, and unsatisfying.This is a continuous process. There is no finish line. There is no permanent solution. Whenever you’re looking to improve, you can rotate through the Four Laws of Behavior Change until you find the next bottleneck. Make it obvious. Make it attractive. Make it easy. Make it satisfying. Round and round. Always looking for the next way to get 1 percent better.The secret to getting results that last is to never stop making improvements.When you observe a cue, but do not desire to change your state, you are content with the current situation. Happiness is not about the achievement of pleasure (which is joy or satisfaction), but about the lack of desire. It arrives when you have no urge to feel differently. Happiness is the state you enter when you no longer want to change your state."

178,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79047121-britt,5,"I listened to the audio version of this book, I reserve purchasing physical copies only for books I intend to reread. That being said, I will be purchasing this book. There is so much wisdom here! My main two take always are this:1. Systems are the true and better goals. To set a goal is minimal, to set and maintain a system is life changing. 2. Identity defines and solidifies habits. A person who believes they are something (healthy, Godly, productive) will gain much ground in habit forming (rejecting cake, reading the Bible, checking off tasks). I think therefore I am. My main love from this book is a tiny nugget I’ll never forget: moving your thoughts from “I have to” to “I get to.” I have to feed the child becomes I get to feed my daughter. I have to go to work becomes I get to earn an income. I have to pack for the trip becomes I get to prepare for vacation. Simple. Life changing."

I had hope to finish the book feeling more motivated. Tweets as well as listening to James Clear on Sam Harris' The Making Sense Podcast boosted my expectations out of proportion. Both were unfortunately huge spoilers. The main downer is that I had hoped for more guidance on how to work on habits which are still conflicting with my identity and that for this reason are harder to incorporate in my daily life. Having said this, the book is beautifully written and contains not only useful information but also brief stories that help you to remember the concepts. In addition to that, there are reader-friendly tables and graphics, which provide additional examples and helpful summaries of the key concepts. If all of this was not enough, the author has also created many additional resources that you can find on the page atomichabits.com. I can definitely imagine going back to it to to find some inspiration."
180,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3767809-trace,5,I'm giving this a solid 5 stars! I went into this book with the pre-conceived notion that the author might have taken a topic that could be summed up in an essay and tried to stretch it out into a book. I see this happen ALL of the time! I was thrilled to find out that this is NOT the case with this book. I was thoroughly impressed with the research presented.... the sheer number of ideas talked about. This is a dense and very meaty book. The author has given you a LOT to ponder and do - it is an extremely thorough and solid study of habits. Habits though seemingly small - are the very foundational blocks of what our lives will be. Its a huge topic and this author did an incredible job unpacking it. I'll be wanting to read this in 2021 as well. Highly recommend.

It tells you how to build habbits that benefit you, and cut out ones that don't based on others experiences and what has proven to work for some people. I'm a pretty unmotivated person when it comes to building new habbits and following through with them so I might try some of these tips in the future. Even though I'm not going to say I completely enjoyed my self reading this book, as it was just a bunch of information rather than a story I can get lost in, but I did get something out of this which is important to me when reading a non-fiction book."

A lot of it is fairly intuitive and likely already known / implemented by a lot of people: make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, make it satisfying, though the examples are useful and prompt for action.A few things that resonated:1. Break down different levels for change: (1) goals, (2) habits and (3) identity. If your goal is to run a marathon, you'll likely stop once that's done. If you identify as a runner, you'll likely keep on running afterwards.2. Importance of practice, and not confusing motion for progress, and avoiding planning as a form of procrastination towards progress. Eventually trying little things, making mistakes and learning is the best path towards progress.3. ""When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."". Any form of measurement should be a guide towards a desired behavior but not the goal itself, otherwise it can lead to bad incentives and undesired side effects"

The book was also thoroughly enjoyable. Unlike most self-improvement books, Clear doesn’t provide too many long, repetitive stories.

We are so fixated on our daily routines and cultural establishments that we forget to evaluate the true impacts of our habits. Even the great ones we’ve already established. Every action can help us strive towards the person(s) we want to become (the artist, the writer, the reader, the athlete...).

210,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63599-rob,5,"Atomic Habits is an excellent guide to habits: what they are, why they matter, how to master them. Moreover, it's fun to read, including a number of illustrative stories. It's the book that I wish The Power of Habit had been; unlike The Power of Habit, Atomic Habits doesn't overreach into societal habits.I'm a huge believer in habits and routine to begin with, and Clear captures very well the importance of SMALL habits in building a great life.WHY SMALL HABITS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action. Whether it is losing weight, building a business, writing a book, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about. Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—sometimes it isn’t even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run.But building successful habits is hard. Some of the best habits don't pay off immediately - exercising, eating well, etc. - so it is easy to fall off the habit early and revert. Breaking bad habits is similarly difficult; you're doing something bad because you're getting a reward out of it, and if all you do is stop that thing then you're just removing a reward and relying on willpower.Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way.Clear lays out a framework for thinking about building and breaking habits which I find very compelling.The biggest idea that he has, though, and the reason I started reading his website a while back, is the following statement:The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this....The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader. The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner. The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.I had never thought about it that way before Clear spelled it out for me, but that idea is a powerful one. And he looks at habits as ways to build credibility _with yourself_ that you are who you say you are, and who you would like to become.So in this light, making good habits or breaking bad ones is much deeper than changing what you do; it's changing who you believe yourself to be.“I’m terrible with directions.” “I’m not a morning person.” “I’m bad at remembering people’s names.” “I’m always late.” “I’m not good with technology.” “I’m horrible at math.” . . . and a thousand other variations.When you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy to slide into these mental grooves and accept them as a fact.The book is, itself, inspirational, with stories of Olympians, writers, business leaders, and others that have achieved great success on the basis of seemingly small things. He's good at making you believe that it is possible to change _anything_ about your life.The secret to getting results that last is to never stop making improvements. It’s remarkable what you can build if you just don’t stop. It’s remarkable the business you can build if you don’t stop working. It’s remarkable the body you can build if you don’t stop training. It’s remarkable the knowledge you can build if you don’t stop learning. It’s remarkable the fortune you can build if you don’t stop saving. It’s remarkable the friendships you can build if you don’t stop caring. Small habits don’t add up. They compound."

Definitely picked up some tips that I hope will stick with me.Favorite quote: “Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.” "
213,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80725380-tarek-omran,5,"WOW! (Hope that’s enough to make you read the book)However, I would still like to reflect on some of my key takeaways:Takeaway#1 PERSONAL NARRATIVES, IDENTITIES & VOTESTo give some context to this book, a few years back I used to openly say that: “I’m a master procrastinator.” Well, just the fact that I am acknowledging it and owning my procrastination skills, might be good [accepting you have a problem]! But in the LONG RUN, it is definitely not an identity to live by.Our personally perceived identities shape and influence the actions that we do. I like to call this the 
personal narrative
. If I tell myself:  ""I am an athlete or I am training to be an athlete!"" then my actions are more likely to be driven that way.I am FAT, or even better I am a SMOKER works the same exact way where they found in a study that people who quite and say they are not smokers are less likely to smoke again. that way ;). Our personal narratives shape and influence the actions that we do.Question is how can you change your personal narrative?1- Decide on your IDENTITY, e.g. I would like to be a fit and healthy person OR I would like to be an intellectual reader who reflects and ponders on his reading.2- Envision what kind of ACTIONS this person is likely to take and how do you compare?It helps to map out, what kind of things would a super athlete do. Would she sleep early or late? Would she exercise 5days a week or 5days a month. That way you start embodying the behaviour and actions that will get you where you want to be. Rethink your current identity and what kind of person you would like to be.3- Finally CAST YOUR VOTES, towards the person you want to be.Of course writing affirmations and sticking them to the bathroom mirror, might help. But there is a fool proof method (specially if you are low on self belief and positive thinking) that James Clear discusses beautifully. - Simply put, all our 
actions are like casting mini-votes
 in a certain direction that helps us identify with the kind of person we aim to be. So if you want to become SUPER ATHLETIC and all you do on your free time is eat junk food - then you are instead trying to be  SUPER DIABETIC or an ASPIRING EATING CHAMPION (which ever makes you feel better about yourself ;)). Your actions slowly start shaping your identity which in return further reinforces your habits towards your ultimate goal.Takeaway#2 Temptation Bundling/Coupling ActionsAnother super useful strategy I am actually using is coupling actions together. For example - I would only listen to Audiobooks when going for a jog. If it’s raining, cold and I’m lazy then its for the audiobook, if the audio book is boring then it’s for getting the exercise done. Once you pull this off multiple times, it becomes super reinforced and you will keep the training habit going due to the multi source reinforcements.Other examples from the book were* Only get a pedicure while processing overdue work emails.* Only watch your favorite show while ironing or doing household chores.* Only eat at your favorite restaurant when conducting your monthly meeting with a difficult colleague.Then again, there is a lot more where this came from. This book has so many powerful techniques and actionable exercises, that this reflection won’t do justice.Highly recommended for … EVERYBODY!"
214,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3725488-cyd-madsen,5,"An outstanding book. It’s one thing to know how habits work, and something completely different putting that knowledge to work. How to make that knowledge work was exactly what I found in this book. I now understand why my best efforts in the past to change habits have worked for a short time, with a huge expenditure of willpower, only to see them quickly fade. Clear walks you through every step, with science-backed facts, on how habits work and to how you can work your habits. And make them stick. Although the book is science-backed, I was surprised at how compulsively readable it was. At no time was there a grunt or groan while trying to grasp these concepts. The writing style is friendly, warm, and at times humorous. I also felt that Clear was right there working his way through his own habit changes with me. That’s a pretty good feeling. It was a refreshing break from feeling that the author was belittling me for not living up to their stellar standards. I’m an avid reader of his blog and thought this might be a re-hash of everything I’ve already read. That isn’t at all the case. There is new information here as well as his unique perspective and formation of new concepts. Clear walks the reader through those steps and leaves nothing to guesswork. My main concern was that this book might be interesting but have nothing to offer for those of us with low self-esteem or a general lack of motivation. He covers those beautifully. The process for low self-esteem is to put one foot in front of the other, one small step at a time, focus on the process, and meet the you you’ve always wanted to be. As far as motivation goes, he unpacks that and shows that we’ve been putting the cart in front of the horse for far too long. The section on identity was a game changer. When I read the chapter heading, I immediately felt resistance. Hasn’t the whole idea been to discover our identity? To uncover our passions and be true to ourselves? It took a bit of reading, maybe a page or two, before it all clicked into place and the Ah-ha! moment hit. I’ve used his techniques for a few days, both focusing on the process and choosing my identity. The results have been stunning. Without feeling deprivation or a struggle, some very old and deeply ingrained habits took a small turn, something I didn’t think was possible. I don’t want to give the impression that this book is a magic wand that will change everything you ever wanted to change by simply fanning yourself with the pages. There is work to be done, patience to cultivate, disappointments to be dealt with along the way, and persistence called for. Perhaps that’s what I like most about this book. It doesn’t present itself as a magic potion. Even the least desperate of us would like that to appear, and there have been many who have fed off this very human desire. Clear has the integrity to resist that temptation. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone looking to make changes in their habits, big and small, as well as people who feel that something unnamable is missing from their lives. Clear will not disappoint. "

218,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1142366-hans,5," I loved the author's synthesis of physiology with human psychology to create a clear picture of how the human mind forms habits. Broken down into the basic concepts of how the brain wires itself will make one quickly realize why some habits are so hard to break or to form. The phrase ""Neurons that fire together wire together"" captures how repeated behaviors over time gradually become literally hard-wired in our brain. This also explains why breaking that connection can be so difficult and we fall back into the same behaviors repeatedly.Huge fan of applying the law of compound interest to habit formation. Everything about life is made up of the little things so why wouldn't this apply to habits as well. You start small make it just challenging enough but not so hard that you feel overwhelmed. Then build on that and over time all those little habits, like focused practicing of a musical instrument 30 minutes a day, or exercising 30 minutes a day, build into something much larger. The great achievements of mankind, the pyramids, the gothic cathedrals, all built one brick, one stone at a time. This is how the law of compound interest applies to habit formation. You dedicate a little bit of time to each of these habits everyday and over the span of a lifetime they pay huge dividendsSince breaking a bad habit is so challenging the author gives practical and easily applicable advice. Understanding those hard-wired neuronal connections in your brain that formed that habit only degrade with time it is important to influence the external factors that might re-trigger the habit. He goes on to explain how avoid those triggers by adapting your external environment. For example purchasing junk food will make it much harder to avoid eating it if it is already in your house. Use online purchase-to-pickup and focus on those healthy foods you actually want to eat and completely avoid the temptation of purchasing the unwanted and unhealthy so you don't have to test your will power.Identity also plays a huge part of habit formation. Define how you see yourself and how you want to see yourself. Start incorporating those changes into your identity. Instead of ""I'm on a diet"" that implies only a temporary behavior change, use ""I am a healthy person"" and it will help you form those habits to support that identity. Identification is a powerful cognitive tool since our brains tend to naturally seek out to confirm how we see ourselves.I highly recommend this book, there is something in it for everyone, and I will definitely be re-reading it again.

I am currently applying some strategies from the book and it does help me in building my everyday habits. Before reading this book, I have the habit of setting goals at the beginning of the year. However, the book suggests we should forget about goals and focus on systems instead. Goals restrict your happiness since it creates an ""either-or"" conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. The true long-term thinking is goal-less thinking and focuses more on the systems which are about the process that lead to those goals.The book introduces the 4 steps of building a habit:1. Cue: what you see trigger the brain to initiate a behavior2. Craving: the thoughts, feelings, and emotions that transform a cue to a craving3. Respond: actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action4. Reward: what you get after performing the behaviorThe strategies of atomic habit are:- Make bad habit unattractive and make good habits attractive by creating a positive environment- Use implementation intentions: ""I will [behavior] at [time] in [location]""- Habit tracking: ""[After [current habit], I will [new habit]""- Make good habits satisfyingEx: Deal with habits of avoidance - want to avoid eating out, transferring $50 to a saving account whenever skip eating out => satisfying and match the identity - The Goldlocks rule: To achieve a state of flow, a task must be roughly 4% beyond your current ability"

Duhigg), mixed with personal bragging (mostly about how sick the author was and how brilliantly he recovered) and anecdotes that are taken out of context and often do not have anything to do with habits. Like this: the body of a swimmer is fit for swimming, and the body of a runner is fit for running (long descriptions of what is good for swimming and what is good for running). Soooo... let's form habits that work for our personality! Many claims are left without any reference. Maybe because they are just lies. ""Research has shown that once a person believes in a particular aspect of their identity, they are more likely to act in alignment with that belief"". Or: ""Research has shown that people who track their progress [...] are all more likely to improve than those who don't"". Or: ""Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last"". Even the habits he uses as examples are often ridiculous, like ""When I serve myself a meal, I will always put veggies on my plate first"" (this is supposed to be ""healthy eating""). Or: ""After I get into bed at night, I will give my partner a kiss"" (this one reminds me of Niles Crane: ""Maris means the world to me. Just the other day I kissed her for no reason whatsoever"").Don't waste your time. "
227,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27124894-v-h-ng,4,"This is a good self-help book on habit forming with modest amount of introduction on the nature of habits and a good amount of tips on building new habits.Once you have accepted the framework of cues, craving, response, reward, everything the author said seems to make common sense. Though, I have to add, these ideas are not new. This book is a repackage of existing ideas, with some additions from the author's own anecdotes, into the above-mentioned framework. It's not a bad thing, however, since a ""proven way"" can't be too original..In term of writing, this has nothing to write home about. The structure seems logical, but the writing is disconnected and the anecdotes feel forced in place. Only about 70% of the book forms the core reading material. The rest are the author's random thoughts and comments that can't fit into the flow. Also, there are a number of promotional material sprinkled throughout the book. For these reasons, I believe reading an abridge version of this book would be no less effective and can be a lot easier to get started.Overall, Atomic Habits is a good book to get some ideas on habits forming. It's an excellent compilation of existing materials on the topic. Recommended if you're looking for a quick read. Or find a summary version of this book for an even quicker read."

There are some fine takeaways, but nothing mind-blowing to me. As with most books of this ilk, I feel like I could have just read a very salient article or listened to a 20-minute TED talk. ---Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress. (24)Whenever you want to change your behavior, you can simply ask yourself:1.	How can I make it obvious?2.	How can I make it attractive?3.	How can I make it easy?4.	How can I make it satisfying? (54)… being in motion and taking action. The two ideas sound similar, but they’re not the same. When you’re in motion, you’re planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but they don’t produce a result. Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an outcome. … Sometimes motion is useful, but it will never produce an outcome by itself.

Takes a lot of wisdom from The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business, Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise, and a bunch of other self-help books, but in the end ends up a great aggregate of the helpful bits of those books, with a _lot_ less filler.While _The Power of Habit_, it seemed to me, was focused on breaking bad habits, and really drilled the habit loop, this book more helpfully alternates between building new (good) habits along with breaking bad habits. It directly references the book and the loop, but doesn't waste more time than it needs to."

236,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1229150-kristina,4,"A STRONG 4.5 rating. I feel like this is the book that Charles Dohrigg wanted to write but then he got mired down into academia writing instead of ""this is how to apply all my research"" writing. So James Clear wrote this book for him - ""this is how to apply all that stuff in a much easier and readable format with clear cut tips and tricks and things to think about"". Anyway. I ended up liking this book much much much more than I thought (at first I thought ""is this a self-published dude who is tricking me into thinking he knows a lot more about this than he does?"") And if so - well kudos to James Clear because he tricked me by putting stuff together in a format that is making me re-examine and look at why I do what I do and how I can change some things and reinforce others. If this topic is interesting to you - you'll like this book. If this topic is boring to you - why are you even reading this review?"

A lot of the advice seems like common sense but good to have some reminders of how and why these methods are important. Lots of the chapters start with little anecdotes about interesting studies or famous people who used the methods discussed in the book which I enjoyed. The only part of the book I disagree with is when James Clear talks about how to discover which habits you should try to pursue. He mentions finding habits which you might be genetically suited for and therefore most likely to succeed at. I think what habits you chose should, at least partly, be based on what you find fun without the need of trying to become a world class master. If you suck at it but are having fun, whats the problem? Overall really helpful book :) "

He gives a cohesive overview focusing on habit formation and maintenance that's backed by enough legit science to give it credence but without being overly ""sciencey"" (since the general population probably isn't a big fan of overly deep neuroscience explanations).

While being insanely practical and easy to read, I’ve started to implement some of the techniques already! As great as all of that was, I love the way he writes not for the ear or eye but for the heart, he speaks to our identities, our motivations, desires and wills. In other words he points out what drives people is not the external per se, but the internal. We are not defined/driven by what we do but who we truly are. Our habits should be understood from this paradigm. Recommended."

290,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5766354-yernar-j,5,"“You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.” There are some non-fiction books that are filled with fluff and rehashed material that I have heard somewhere else before. But this book is a real gem. It’s something that can be put into practice in your life.Here’s the summary of the book:Why should we try to get a little better each day? Well, take a look at the following amazing maths.If you can get 1% better each day over the next year, you’ll be 37 times better by the time you’re done. This applies to all goals, whether it is losing weight, winning a race, or starting a business.Small habits can compound over time. In fact, according to Atomic Habits, habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effect of your habits multiplies as you repeat them. They seem to make little or even no difference on any given day but the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous.Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.The hallmark of any compound process is that the most powerful outcomes are delayed. Habits appear to make no difference until we cross a threshold and unlock a new level of performance.This is one of the reasons why it’s hard to build habits. You make a change, fail to see a tangible result and decide to give up. Habits need to persist long enough to break through the Plateau of Latent Potential (see above diagram). This takes time.If your complaining about progress early on remember: You effort hasn’t been wasted, it’s being stored up. It’s just that you haven’t broken through the plateau yet. When suddenly you do break through, people will think you’re an overnight success.Forget About Goals. Concentrate on SystemsGoals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.Atomic Habits states that if you focus on the system the goal will take care of itself. There are a number of reasons why you should focus on the system.1. Because winners and losers have the same goals.Every Olympian wants to win a gold medal. Every entrepreneur wants to be successful. Thus, its the systems of winners that get them better results, not their goals.2. Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.If our goal is to tidy a room and we tidy it, then we hit our goal. But without changing our system we’ll soon be looking at a messy room again.3. Goals restrict your happiness.Our implicit assumption is: “Once I reach my goal, then I’ll be happy.” This sets us up to fail. Because either you achieve your goal and then look for the next goal, or you fail and this makes you feel unhappy. We should be looking to fall in love with the process, not the goal.4. Goals are at odds with long-term progress.Many people will train hard to complete a marathon. But when the marathon is over they completely stop running. The goal of running the marathon was their motivation but now it’s gone.If you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.The Three Layers of Behavior ChangeYou can think of outcomes being about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.Most people don’t even consider identity change when they set out to improve. They just think, “I want to be skinny (outcome) and if I stick to this diet, then I’ll be skinny (process).”They set goals and determine the actions they should take to achieve those goals without taking into account the beliefs that drive their actions. They don’t realize that their old identity can sabotage their plans for change.For example. You may want better health. But if you continue to prioritize comfort over accomplishment, you’ll be drawn to relaxing rather than training. It’s hard to change your habits if you don’t change your underlying beliefs that lead to your previous bad behavior.True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity.You’re much more likely to work out each day if you believe you’re an athlete. You don’t have to force anything. You’re simply acting like the type of person you believe yourself to be.The biggest barrier to positive change is identity conflict. Good habits can make sense rationally, but if they conflict with your identity you will fail to maintain them.Your identity is formed through evidence. If you run even when it’s snowing you have evidence you’re a runner. But it doesn’t happen with just one run. It is a gradual process that may take years.Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.Here is a two-step process for change:1. Decide the type of person you want to be.2. Prove it to yourself with small wins (atomic habits).This will set up a feedback loop: Your habits shape your identity, but then your identity shapes your habits.The fundamental thing to remember with atomic habits is that they are not about having something. They are about becoming someone.The Habit LoopAtomic Habits states that habits follow this cycle: cue, craving, response, reward.First, there is the cue. The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior because it predicts a reward. Next, we have the craving. What you crave is not the habit itself, but the change in state it delivers. The response is the actual habit you perform. This can be a thought or an action. Finally, the response delivers a reward.The four steps together form a neurological feedback loop: cue, craving, response, reward, cue, craving, response, reward – that ultimately allow you to create automatic habits. This is the habit loop.The Four Laws of Behavior ChangeAtomic Habits provides a framework we can use to transform the four steps of the Habit Loop so that we can design good habits and eliminate bad ones.Step	Designing Good Habits	Breaking Bad HabitsCue	Make it obvious	Make it invisibleCraving	Make it attractive	Make it unattractiveResponse	Make it easy	Make it difficultReward	Make it satisfying	Make it unsatisfyingNote that that method of breaking a bad habit is always the opposite of building a good one.Whenever you want to change your behavior, simply ask yourself:1. How can I make it obvious?2. How can I make it attractive?3. How can I make it easy?4. How can I make it satisfying?Let’s examine each law in detail. In each section, we’ll look at multiple ways to boost your good habits and finish with an inversion showing how to break your bad habits.The 1st Law: Make It ObviousBefore we can build new habits we need to understand our current ones. This can be harder than it sounds because once you have a deeply rooted habit it can be unconscious and automatic.To become aware of your habits, use a Habits Scorecard. To create your own, simply make a list of your daily habits:* Wake up =* Check phone –* Go to the bathroom +* Weigh myself +* Have breakfast +* etc.Once you have a complete list, score each of them. Use “+” for good habits, “-” for bad, and “=” for neutral.If you’re still having trouble determining how to rate a particular habit, here is a question I like to use: “Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?” Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desired identity are usually bad.Note the goal is simply to notice your habits. We’re not trying to change anything yet.If you’re struggling to notice your habits you can use a technique called Pointing-and-Calling to raise your awareness by verbalizing your actions. For example, if you’re about to eat a cookie, say “I’m about to eat a cookie. This is bad for my long-term health”. It will really help you realize what you’re doing.1. The Best Way to Start a New HabitHundreds of studies have shown implementation intentions help people stick to their plans. People who make a plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through.There is another benefit to implementation intentions. Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things that derail progress, distract your attention, and pull you off course. We often say yes to little requests because we are not clear enough about what we need to be doing instead. When your dreams are vague, it’s easy to rationalize little exceptions all day long and never get around to the specific things you need to do to succeed.2. Habit StackingAccording to Atomic Habits, one of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify an existing habit and then stack a new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.Examples:* After I shower in the morning I will meditate.* As soon as I take off my shoes after work I will spend 30 minutes learning French.Once you begin to master how to do this, you can create larger stacks by chaining atomic habits together.The secret to habit stacking is selecting the right cue to kick things off. Habit stacking works best when the cue is highly specific and immediately actionable.Overall, habit stacking allows you to create a set of simple rules that guide your future behavior. It’s like you always have a game plan for which action should come next. Once you get comfortable with this approach, you can develop general habit stacks to guide you whenever the situation is appropriate:Exercise. When I see a set of stairs, I will take them instead of using the elevator.Social skills. When I walk into a party, I will introduce myself to someone I don’t know yet.Finances. When I want to buy something over $100, I will wait twenty-four hours before purchasing.Healthy eating. When I serve myself a meal, I will always put veggies on my plate first.Minimalism. When I buy a new item, I will give something away. (“One in, one out.”)Mood. When the phone rings, I will take one deep breath and smile before answering.Forgetfulness. When I leave a public place, I will check the table and chairs to make sure I don’t leave anything behind.One way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by brainstorming a list of your current habits. You can use your Habits Scorecard as a starting point. Alternatively, you can create a list with two columns. In the first column, write down the habits you do each day without fail.For example:Get out of bed.Take a shower.Brush your teeth.Get dressed.Change out of work clothes.Get into bed.Your list can be much longer, but you get the idea. In the second column, write down all of the things that happen to you each day without fail. For example:The sun rises.You get a text message.Armed with these two lists, you can begin searching for the best place to layer your new habit into your lifestyle.3. Environment Matters More than MotivationIf you work at an office that always has donuts in the kitchen then the chances are you’ll eat one from time to time. In this case your environment will have influenced your behavior.In fact, the environment is the invisible hand that shapes our behavior. Our behavior is not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them. In fact, this is a useful way to think about the influence of the environment on your behavior. Stop thinking about your environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled with relationships. Think in terms of how you interact with the spaces around you.Environment design means altering the spaces where you live and work to increase your exposure to positive cues and reduce your exposure to negative ones. Environment design can be powerful because not only because it influences how we engage with the world but also because we rarely do it.Inversion: The Secret to Self-ControlBad habits are autocatalytic. They feed themselves. They promote the feelings they try to numb. You feel bad, so you eat junk food. Because you’ve eaten junk food you feel bad.The idea that self-discipline can solve our bad habits is deeply embedded in our culture.Research, however, shows something different. It shows that “disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in such a way that it doesn’t require heroic willpower and self-control. Basically, they spend less time in tempting situations.A more reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source. One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.If you can’t seem to get any work done, leave your phone in another room for a few hours.If you’re continually feeling like you’re not enough, stop following social media accounts that trigger jealousy and envy.If you’re wasting too much time watching television, move the TV out of the bedroom.This practice is an inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change. Rather than make it obvious, we want to make it invisible. Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one.The 2nd Law: Make it AttractiveHabits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. Every behavior that is highly habit-forming—taking drugs, eating junk food, playing video games, browsing social media—is associated with higher levels of dopamine. The same can be said for our most basic habitual behaviors like eating food, drinking water, having sex, and interacting socially.When it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this: dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it. Gambling addicts have a dopamine spike right before they place a bet, not after they win. Cocaine addicts get a surge of dopamine when they see the powder, not after they take it. Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever dopamine rises, so does your motivation to act.”“Interestingly, the reward system that is activated in the brain when you receive a reward is the same system that is activated when you anticipate a reward. This is one reason the anticipation of an experience can often feel better than the attainment of it. 1. Temptation BundlingTemptation bundling is a way to create a more desirable version of a habit by connecting it with something you already want.Engineering a really irresistible habit is a difficult thing to do, but temptation bundling can be used to make most habits more attractive than they would be otherwise.Temptation bundling basically says that you’re more likely to find a behavior attractive if you get to do one of your favorite things at the same time. For example, you want to know celebrity gossip, but you need to get in shape. Using temptation bundling, you could only read gossip magazines at the gym.Temptation bundling can be used in conjunction with habit stacking to create a set of rules to guide your behavior. The formula is:For example, if you want to watch sports but you need to make sales calls.1. After I get back from lunch break, I will call three potential clients (need).2. After I call three potential clients, I will check ESPN (want).The hope is that eventually, you look forward to calling three clients each day.2. The Seductive Pull of Social NormsHumans are herd animals. We want to fit in. One of the deepest human desires is to belong.Social norms are invisible rules that guide your behavior. You’re always keeping them in mind, even when they are not at the top of your mind. For example, social norms tell us when and whether to get married and how many children to have.We imitate the habits of three groups: the close, the many, and the powerful.a. Imitating the CloseOur friends and family provide a kind of invisible peer pressure that pulls us in their direction.To build better habits join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. New habits seem achievable when you see others doing them every day.Nothing sustains motivation better than belonging to a tribe.One of the best things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where:* Your desired behavior is the normal behavior.* You already have something in common with this group.b. Imitating the ManyWhenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide our behavior. We are constantly scanning our environment to see what everyone else is doing. We check the reviews on Amazon because we want to make the right buying decision. We check TripAdvisor reviews because we want to make the best travel decision. When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is unattractive. When changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe, change is very attractive.c. Imitating the PowerfulHumans everywhere pursue power, prestige, and status. If a behavior can get us these things then we find it attractive.Inversion: Find an Fix the Causes of Your Bad HabitsSome of our underlying motives include:Conserve energyObtain food and waterFind love and reproduceConnect and bond with othersWin social acceptance and approvalReduce uncertaintyAchieve status and prestigeLook at nearly any product that is habit-forming and you’ll see that it does not create a new motivation, but rather latches onto the underlying motives of human nature.Find love and reproduce = using TinderConnect and bond with others = browsing FacebookWin social acceptance and approval = posting on InstagramReduce uncertainty = searching on GoogleAchieve status and prestige = playing video gamesHabits are all about associations. These associations determine whether we predict a habit to be worth repeating or not. As we covered in the 1st Law, your brain is continually absorbing information and noticing cues in the environment. Every time you perceive a cue, your brain runs a simulation and makes a prediction about what to do in the next moment.Cue: You notice that the stove is hot.Prediction: If I touch it I’ll get burned, so I should avoid touching it.The same cue can spark a good habit or a bad habit depending on your prediction. The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them."

It was really enthralling and contained so many relevant anecdotes and historical references as examples to the habit tips/analyses. I like how this book did not get bogged down into neuroscience research (which would have definitely bored me and gotten me lost) and, instead, paid a lot more attention to practical ways to implement the teachings into one’s own life--truly a world-class self-help book written for a layman. 	The progression of Atomic Habits is simply sensational. It starts off by providing context to the importance and science behind habits (cue, craving, response, reward). Some points I found notable were: Focus on systems rather than goals. Goals are momentary changes, but to truly fix a problem for good you need to change the process, the system (i.e. cleaning a room). Goals restrict happiness, you need to enjoy the process and have that as the primary motivation. Focus on working out 5x a week, rather than the goal of gaining a six pack--the results will follow. Most effective way to change habits is to focus on IDENTITY rather than OUTCOMES. First, decide the person you want to be. Then, prove it to yourself with small wins. Every action is a vote for the person you wish to become.  	The book then breaks down the cue, craving, response, reward framework--sharing how to effectively create good habits, and break bad ones for each step. Essentially, to create a good habit: make it obvious (cue), attractive (craving), easy (response), satisfying (reward). Key takeaways in my opinion: Implementation intentions - more likely to do something if you specify when and where you will do itHabit stacking - diderot effect, once you do one habit, it carries momentum so stick another one in. Use in morning routinesDesignate things for single use. ENVIRONMENT IS KEY AND INCREASE/REDUCE FRICTION for actions - reduce temptations and/or make cues visible. If you want to meditate, put a mat in the room. If the phone is too distracting, put the phone in another room. Join a culture that is conducive towards a habit, where the desired behavior is normal. We are social creatures, herd animals and want to fit in. Make a habit easy at first by taking small steps to start. If you want to read a book, gain momentum by reading a page. (Two minute rule). To make a habit more attractive, give yourself a reward after completing a habit. Track habits and don’t skip two days in a row. 	After taking in all this information, I’m pretty excited to reflect on my own life: become more aware of my own habits and develop new ones. Clear described that habits are formed through practice, not planning (action rather than motion). Thus, don’t try to be perfect and find the best plan for change, just get started and take action. Definitely a GoodRead. My one knock would be the advanced habit strategies at the end; they didn’t seem to be as relevant as the body of the book. "
292,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3964636-matt,5,"This book describes an effective framework for understanding self-improvement, in a way that doesn't require unrealistic expectations or heroic willpower. Clear makes a distinction between goals and habits, in that goals typically involve conscious decision making and willpower, and often produce behavior which is dropped once the goal is reached. On the other hand, habits are unconscious patterns of behavior which effect changes over the long term. For instance, this is the difference between going on a crash diet and just being a healthy eater in general.I agree with Clear's assertion that repeated patterns of behavior are crucial for high performance in any field. All outstanding achievers I can think of are to some degree heavily involved in their craft. For example, scientists and mathematicians who achieved great results usually had a habit of working on equations or problems whenever they had an opportunity. Great writers usually write every day. Great comedians often work on new jokes every day for years before they get really funny. Same for athletes, chefs, artists, etc. You can't rely on bursts of high effort, or on long periods of conscious executive functioning. It's just too mentally exhausting, and people have a tendency to get distracted or to lose focus on the goal. You really need to establish patterns of behavior that you just do because you do them, and then let those patterns produce results over time.Clear lays out methods for examining and establishing new habits in this book, by focusing on the habit cycle. In the cycle, first you're prompted to do a thing by a trigger in your environment, then you do the thing, then you get a reward for doing it. If this cycle repeats enough, a behavior chain can become a habit, which initiates based on environmental triggers. An example of a good habit is going through your nighttime routine when you think about going to bed. An example of a bad habit is going on your phone when you feel stressed from work. You can make a new behavior into a habit by making it have an obvious trigger (such as by chaining it to a pre-existing habit, or by leaving a visual cue in an obvious place), by making the behavior mentally attractive (e.g. by making the upsides easily visible), by making the behavior easy (e.g. by ramping up the difficulty over time), and by making the experience satisfying (e.g. by giving yourself a reward afterwards). Similarly, you can help get rid of bad habits by removing the triggers, making the habit unattractive, making it hard to do, and by making it unsatisfying.I like this book because it offers a way to look at unconscious decision making, and in some way it gives us some tools to help us hack our own systems. So far I've been using the tips in this book to help get more exercise and a consistent sleep schedule into my system. Of course it's too early yet to know the long-term results, but so far I've found it fairly easy to produce the kinds of changes I want, whereas when I've tried before it's taken much more willpower."

Plus, everything he said was so reasonable. AND! It was rooted in evidence. Always a good thing. A few things I want to remember...* The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It's one thing to say I'm the type of person who wants this. It's something very different to say I'm the type of person who *is* this.* Habits do not restrict freedom. They create it. In fact, the people who don't have their habits handled are often the ones with the least amount of freedom. Without good financial habits, you will always be struggling for the next dollar. Without good health habits, you will always seem to be short on energy. Without good learning habits, you will always feel like you're behind the curve. If you're always being forced to make decisions about simple tasks--when should I work out, where do I go write, when do I pay the bills--then you have less time for freedom. It's only by making the fundamentals of life easier that you can create the mental space needed for free thinking and creativity.* Other processed foods enhance dynamic contrast, which refers to items with a combination of sensations, like crunchy and creamy...with natural, unprocessed foods, you tend to experience the same sensations over and over--how's that seventeenth bite of kale taste? After a few minutes, your brain loses interest and you begin to feel full. But foods that are high in dynamic contrast keep the experience novel and interesting, encouraging you to eat more. * When I walk into a room everything is in its right place...Because I do this every day in every room, stuff always stays in good shape...people think I work hard but I'm actually really lazy. I'm just proactively lazy. It gives you so much time back.* The human mind wants to ""win"" whatever game is being played. This pitfall is evident in many areas of life. We focus on working long hours instead of getting meaningful work done. We care more about getting ten thousand steps than we do about being healthy. We teach for standardized tests instead of emphasizing learning, curiosity, and critical thinking. In short, we optimize for what we measure. When we choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior. *Mastery requires practice but the more you practice something, the more boring and routine it becomes. Once the beginning gains have been made and we learn what to expect, our interest starts to fad...things are going well. It's easy to rationalize taking a day off because you're in a good place. The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. We get bored with habits because they stop delighting us..."
294,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46735809-tasnim-dewan-orin,4,"This book was recommended to me as a part of group reading. As the name suggests this book tells us ways to build a habit and stick to it. James Clear says we fail to make our New Year's Resolution to habit because they are not obvious, easy, satisfying and attractive. There are four laws of behavior change mentioned by the book. 1. The cue to habit should be obvious. Like setting a reminded to do it or include the habit in anything part of your daily life. I read book while I commute. So whenever I get into the transport, it is my cue to read book.2. The routine to make the habit should be easy3. The experience should be attractive. If it is boring, tiring or struggling. You will not be able to continue with the habit. So we should make the habit attractive.4. The experience should be more satisfying than other activity you used to do instead of the habit you are trying to build.James formulated two habit changing strategies. They are: 1. Stack and Start-Habit StackingHabit Stacking is using an old habit to trigger a new habit. Suppose, you are trying to drink adequate water in a day. You work 9 to 5 in a corporation. You have a habit of seeing your deadline every one hour. So you can stack the habit of drinking water with the habit of seeing your deadline. Like whenever you look at the deadline, you drink a glass of water. This will ensure your eight glasses of water a day.- Starting RitualInstead of focusing on the entire habit, focus on the starting ritual. The starting ritual should be less than 2 minutes. Everyday after the going to work, I open my Mac, give check-in, write plan to Slack about my day and then write my goals in sticky notes. This whole ritual takes me less than two minutes. I have been doing this for last 2 years. So to get into work with full concentration everyday becomes easier with the ritual.2. Sync and Score To make a habit inherently satisfying you must keep scores. One method is to keep track in calendar, tick mark the day you are successful in doing the habit. So when the month ends and you see 27 ticks on the calendar. You will find it satisfying. You can also habit tracking app to do so.According to James, we can easily build a habit and change our behavior by Stack and Start and Sync and Sore which will make the habit obvious, easy, satisfying and attractive.I highly recommend this book. This book has changed my life to an extent. If you are someone like me who is struggling to stick to a habit, please follow James' advice."

And I am happy and proud of it. The book has so many studies and real-life examples of how we can achieve great things just by getting 1% better each day.If you want to be able to stick with good habits or you want to break with the bad ones, this book is for you.While I was reading it I highlighted some phrases that I personally liked:""It is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change: the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle. We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we never get around to taking action. As Voltaire once wrote, “The best is the enemy of the good.” """"3rd Law: you just need to get your reps in.Redesign your life so the actions that matter most are also the actions that are easiest to do.""""Habits are like the entrance ramp to a highway. They lead you down a path and, before you know it, you’re speeding toward the next behavior""""We focus on working long hours instead of getting meaningful work done. We care more about getting ten thousand steps than we do about being healthy. We teach for standardized tests instead of emphasizing learning, curiosity, and critical thinking. In short, we optimize for what we measure. When we choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior.""""We all have goals that we would like to achieve and dreams that we would like to fulfill, but it doesn’t matter what you are trying to become better at, if you only do the work when it’s convenient or exciting, then you’ll never be consistent enough to achieve remarkable results.""""Professionals take action even when the mood isn’t right. They might not enjoy it, but they find a way to put the reps in.""""What you need is a combination of automatic habits and deliberate practice.Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery""""Happiness is not about the achievement of pleasure (which is joy or satisfaction), but about the lack of desire. It arrives when you have no urge to feel differently. Happiness is the state you enter when you no longer want to change your state.""Friedrich Nietzsche, the German philosopher, and poet, famously wrote, “He who has a why to live for can bear almost anyhow.” This phrase harbors an important truth about human behavior. If your motivation and desire are great enough (that is, why are you are acting), you’ll take action even when it is quite difficult. Great craving can power great action—even when friction is high."

Simple language used, easily consumable within a week.Yet I want more.The content is not new to me because I've seen it over on Clear's social media platforms or online articles. The same content are also repeated by other self-help authors, albeit in a different way. As such, these serve as a good, timely reminder but I wish the book circled more around having a why for your habits.I'm a little different than most people, but if you are reading this review, then maybe we are in the same stage of life now. Personally, I believe we are up to the tasks if we want to, but more often than not, we don't know what we want, let alone what habits to get there. The complexities of life's variables fog up our vision. Since we are no longer in our teens, the pursuit of one action (or habit) might have significant consequences to our long term plans. Simply put, one step forward, two steps back.As such, the key here, or the struggle we face, is to figure out what we want, then discover the blueprint to get there. This book will serve you well in the latter, where you have to do the homework to literally pen down your habits to analyse and reflect about them. However, as I am still stuck in the former quest, I wish the book would have been more complete in this aspect.Today I'm 24 years old. And I'm not always like this because I used to understand what I wanted. Now, as I transition from university to work, I start to see how the intangible aspects play out in the longer term, i.e. having mindspace for yourself, ample rest time, having buffer social time because you never know who needs you at which hour, and so on. With life being so flexible and for us to ""not have a desire to change so as to be peaceful"", it seems that unless a habit is 2 mins short, it's almost impossible to permanently have them in my life. And what goodness can ooze out of habits that finally took place but only less than 5 minutes short? Also, how do you know which habits are necessary for your long term plans yet they do not oppose the other intangible and variable plans? So many times we simply need to have the capacity to rest and do nothing so as to recharge, instead of trying to optimise your life in every way possible.These are the questions that the book did not answer. Otherwise, if you know what habits you want to keep, this is a good book to get you started."
297,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/908968-ryan,5,"✧ 🅁🄴🅅🄸🄴🅆 ✧ • ❝Atomic Habits❞ by James ClearAtomic Habits is a self-improvement book by James Clear, which starts with an explanation of a serious injury to Clear in high school which impacted him for the rest of his life. He explains how he realized that if he wanted to recover, no one else could do the work but him, and he better get to it. Clear’s basic argument in this book is that every journey starts with a single step: small changes can lead to long lasting habits. The primary philosophy is that for most goals, it takes a long time to achieve the goal, and it’s a series of small incremental improvements that make achieving these goals possible. But Clear makes an excellent point that all Olympic athletes have the same goal, for example, but the difference between the gold medalist and those who don’t place are the systems of daily improvement. Therefore having a strong system in place will do more to achieve the goals than having a goal alone.In this book, clear sets out four rules for creating good habits. In addition, he has created inverses of these rules to stop bad habits. Unlike many self-improvement books, this one has a lot of practical information on how to actually change habits, not just research. Though this is backed up by research, it’s a practical manual to changing your life. Like other books in this area, the high achievers are often the ones who right the book. It makes sense. Who would want to read about a guy who never changed his bad habits? But at the same time, having someone who excels in changing habits makes it difficult for those of us who struggle more. It’s not just so easy, sometimes, as to set a system in place. Sometimes there are some really difficult obstacles or challenging situations which make it much harder to change habits. In these cases, the simple view of “just make a small change” seems trivial and daunting at the same time. I also struggled because this seemed like it was only from Clear’s point of view as a self-employed writer, but many of the examples provided don’t work in a corporate or more structured environment.Even though I still have a lot of questions, and I need more help with some specific habits, for the most part this book was helpful. I’m excited to get started on tracking and changing my habits, and I now have ideas of how to put those systems in place. If anyone has read “The Power of Habit” by Charles Duhigg, or Gretchen Rubin’s “Better Than Before” this is a great follow up. ★★★★★ • Audiobook • Nonfiction - Self Help, Self Improvement, Productivity • Purchased through Audible.◾︎"

I've read Charles Duhigg's book on habit-formation and this one is by far my favourite. Clear separates his book into four sections which correspond to the 4 parts of making a habit stick: make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, and make it satisfying. What I like about his recommendations is that he's both honest about habit-formation and it's challenges while also acknowledging how much it can suck to build habits and gives the reader some excellent tips for getting started. I think it's worth reading the whole thing because it's packed full of good content, but I wanted to share two of my favourite parts:1) Clear says that making a habit is more important than immediately ramping up the habit. So even if you start small, if you're consistent you can eventually make an outsized impact. What this translates into is that if you want to exercise, going for a one minute run every day or just putting on your gym clothes and going to the gym to scroll on your phone is still helpful - it's helping insert a new habit into your life, and reinforcing a behavior that previously didn't exist. It's nice to know that such small actions can start rewiring your brain so that eventually you can get to the place where you run 10k a day or write for an hour or what have you. 2) He shares an obvious point that I think I needed to hear - that there will be a point where habit-formation becomes boring. I think a lot of people think about habit-formation as challenging, and drop off because of that, but he really focuses on how consistency equals repetition, and how you need to be ready to push through the dull bits in order to make the incremental progress that adds up.And finally, what i loved is that Clear focuses on the negative aspects of habit-formation! Namely, that once something becomes automatic, you don't get the same feedback as when you make a conscious effort, and in fact you reach your peak performance right before you establish a habit, rather than at the point where an action is habitual. But Clear also makes recommendations about ways that you can force yourself to take some conscious time to evaluate and calibrate your habits to continue working for you. "
