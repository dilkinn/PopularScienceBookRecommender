0,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10293618-simon,3,"This book does a great job of laying down the framework of how habits are formed, and shares insightful strategies for building good habits and breaking bad ones. Even though I was already familiar with research behind habit formation, reading through this book helped me approach habits I’m trying to adopt or break in my own life from different angles.But the book suffers from the same problems that seem to plague all self-help books. In the chapter about tracking habits, the author shares an anecdote about Benjamin Franklin’s habit of carrying a journal everywhere to track thirteen virtues. If you care to know more about that story, Franklin tried to make a habit of his thirteen virtues by turning it into a thirteen week course where he would work on a different virtue every week and track his progress. The author conveniently leaves out the fact that Franklin quickly found this method impractical and abandoned the project before getting through all thirteen virtues. There’s a lot of irony in including this anecdote in a chapter that talks about the importance of not “breaking the chain”. So while the author isn’t entirely wrong, I found it off-putting that he would retell this story in a manner that fit his narrative. This is a vice that is found all too commonly in self-help and pop science books that make you question the author’s intellectual rigour.Another criticism I have of this book is that it could have been even shorter. The last few chapters under “Advanced Tactics” that deal with the topic of mastery were the weakest in the book. While there is an obvious connection between habits and mastery, trying to tie in a topic as complex as mastery was perhaps too ambitious.The three star rating I am giving this book doesn’t reflect how important I consider habits to be. I completely agree with the author that habits are the cornerstone of your life. If you want to change your life in any meaningful way, the only dependable way I know is to build good habits. If you need convincing that habits are important, I would strongly recommend this book. If you are already convinced but struggling to adopt or break habits, racing through this book will give you some good ideas about how you can make changes stick."

This book is filled with practical steps and examples. Yes, there are plenty of habit-building books out there (just as there are plenty of diet books but yet there are still more new books published every year). Plenty of people are seeking the right book that resonates with them. The key points in this book are:* Compound Effect - Very small changes over time will have a big impact.* Habit Building Techniques - Make good habits into routines; use positive reinforcements and other techniques outlined in the book.* Monitor and Measure - Keep track of your progress and improvements."

You fall to the level of your systems.""- The best way of building a habit is making it part of your identity.- Make it easy to start: Habits are the entry point - not the goal. ""Read 30 books"" ⇒ ""Read before bed every night"" ⇒ ""Read one page"". Reduce a habit into a 2-minute first step.- Stick to the plan: ""Professionals stick to the schedule, amateurs let life get in the way."" Don't be a ""fair weather runner"" if you want to run a lot.- Make it hard to do the things you want to avoid.Most modern ""American self-help books for engineers or entrepreneurs"" (it is a category for me) are too repetitive and too long. Atomic Habits is not! It does have the category-required set of stories of American (mostly men) who built a great habit and got to the top - but just the right amount. ----- NOTES -----*Identity*The three levels of change - the lower the more ""fundamental"":3.

This book, Atomic Habits, has a completely different approach. James Clear focused on writing a book that goes deep into every single step of habit creation from a practical point of view. At the end of the day, who we are and what we will achieve depends so much on these small habits that we do every day. James Clear argues, that focusing only on improving those habits will lead to much bigger changes and accomplishments.My top 3 takeaways from this book are:* Forget about goals, focus on the system instead.* Change your identity to change your habits.* Motivation is overrated. Design the environment to support your habits.From this book, I distilled 21 strategies and principles on habit creation, and also I wrote a detailed book summary that you can read here: https://www.mentorist.app/books/atomi..."

Atomic also in one regard: As long as it works, it´s perfect down to the smallest part, each atom. If it fails, it´s radioactive and self cannibalizing, -destructing- and demotivating. To exaggerate, we can develop great working, social. and creative habits or destroy ourselves with neuroticism going haywire, find great ways to optimate oneself or madness, just read anecdotal filled pop psychology/science/philosophy books one can read without the danger of the hard work of really changing something or choose the difficult way and this book.The 1st Law Make it obviousRepetition and consequence, as if it wasn´t so shamefully obvious, is one of the key elements to everything, a skill, foreign language, school, degrees,… and the funny thing is that successful people use learning, creativity, memo-, techniques to perfect their skills, but forget the motivational, critical thinking, analytic retrospection, optimization, meditation-,… techniques, and, most importantly, to recapitulate, criticize oneself, let others criticize oneself, reflect, and develop. There is always some space left toward top performance but without modifying or even changing habits, they won´t be possible and nothing is more painful than stopping a working, well known, perfected, but ineffective habit, using an oldfashioned program, modify a schedule, use knowledge and expertise in a new, complicated, unknown way, etc. The brain is a bit bitchy, nagging, and one´s worst enemy, because it´s a lazy manipulator, not wanting one to do something that means real work for it, trying to make it feel as uncomfortable as possible, wanting easy stagnation instead of sweaty evolution. The 2nd Law and 3rd Law Make it attractive and easyAs if this wasn´t already painful and difficult enough, the self experimental subject now has to implement unused, and thereby for the crying, sobbing, angry brain very painful, new neuronal integrated circuits because, as one knows, reptile stem brain and monkeys social anxiety wants one to run far away from everything new, different, possibly dangerous. Here the inner demons have to been disguised as angels to make the whole agony as attractive as possible, a kind of hopeful masochism. Detecting the deficits has already wasted vast resources of willpower and now one doesn´t even have the legitimation to kill and destroy positive change with anger and negative emotions, but the new mind baby has to be raised next to the rascals one has to be tolerant and sympathetic towards.The 4th Law Make it satisfyingReaching this point is tricky, as one needs the stamina, perseverance, and resilience not to resign. As the old behaviors often aren´t directly harmful, just unproductive and used, they will come whispering and trying to get a hold of the subconscious mind to develop back towards the beginning. Humans are creatures of habit and whenever one just loses track and motivation for a second, their siren calls will try to lure you into old behaviors whose reminiscences are still lurking behind each screen, interaction, or working process.And as if all of this wasn´t torture enough, it should come with personal development and vivisecting one´s personality, thoughts, memories, all these things that seemingly aren´t directly related to work, too. Because hidden in the chasms of each simulated reality lies the key to boosting the occupational performance even more by eliminating all the mental corpses of complexes, childhood traumas, anxieties, phobias,… As long they are not overcome, they keep holding one down, interrupting the workflow, reducing concentration, focus, the quality of sleep,… even changing the obvious problems won´t unleash the full potential.A tip, after I´ve read a few of the most highly recommended DIY self brainwashing mind penetrating behavioral modification endeavor books for dummies, I´ve come to the conclusion that most of the theory, techniques, and schedules can easily be found during a longer google search, a Wikipedia or special wiki and Reddit, Quora walk, just using the essential keywords, bookmarking a few dozens to hundreds of pages of interest, copying the subjectively most essential and useful elements and still begin with the 1st law. But it would at least have cost you nothing. It´s getting a bit anecdotally and subjective now, even personal (cause people seem to like that stuff for whatever reason) and, of course, misanthropic, so don´t be shy to stop reading here and saving time and eye power that could be focused on reading something profound. Seriously, I´ve warned you.One of my main advantages is that I am naturally neurotic, a bit of still under control and productive, not negative elements of perfectionism, some might say soft OCD, but who listens to people, pedantic; a bit antisocial, and cold, rational, things very helpful when implementing new behavioral patterns because one doesn´t care about whatever other people think.  I am a bit biased here, because I have the, depending on the standpoint, positive or negative tendency to overachieve and excessively focus on one thing for weeks and months up to 12 or 14 hours a day, obsessive might be an understatement, let´s call it possession instead. Afterward, it´s often difficult to say how the final results, ideas, solutions paths developed, but conditioning oneself to combine focus and flow to hard fun and gamification, optional collaborative learning, yuck, might be a good alternative to just partying hard. This leads me to the extroverts that might face massive deficits in this regard, as they have the unfortunate tendency to spent much unproductive time with other people, leading to excessive, exponentially growth of sympathy, friendship, contact, dangerous pheromones, endorphins, territorial alpha behavior,… manipulating logical thinking, in the worst case not just resulting in friendships, but love, relationships, and kids bringing the distraction in your home, permanently, reproducing and multiplying it and giving it names, all things that make one ineffective, cost time. So start avoiding people, feel cold, sad, and dead inside; and whenever you are doubting, compare what the introvert vs extrovert forever achieving score lists brings in comparison, all science and technical evolution that is human history vs all BS, war, extremism, tradition, all evil isms. Doesn´t an empty, lonely life seem a small price for helping primate progress? Don´t forget thanking me for ruining your socialization with these stupid tips, lol. But seriously, social life is another prime example of habit, one becomes the people she/ he is in regular contact with and attracts more of these people, a dynamic one should not underestimate, and they all feed on you lifetime by craving for your attention, just compare how much one can get from articles and books in comparison to real life drivel filled with small talk, redundancies, errors,..., heck even the better memorization and internalization of content by social contact can be achieved with sophisticated learning techniques. To continue the isolationist standpoint (joke), it´s of course meanwhile absolutely unnecessary to make anything face to face and not in home office, VR, AR, psi transfer remote perception,... the technological singularity in general makes it more and more useless to leave the home castle.

5,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7161719-kaytlin,4,"I received this book as a Goodreads giveaway yesterday and immediately settled down to read it. I am always very skeptical of self help books because they often do no get to the root of issues. This one did. James Clear's main arguments are that habits are the compound interest of self improvement and that your identify emerges out of your habits. So, you must expereince a shift in identity for your habits to hold. This made a lot of sense to me, but I do think that Clear should have addresses deeper emotional issues and gave readers resources so as not to mislead them into believing that they can change their identity by action (repeating new habits) alone.

Building habits in the present allows you to do more of what you want in the future.”This book has helped me build a more productive morning routine and I love it! ☀️ Being a morning person has always been a struggle for me, but this book gives you very clear and very easy steps to create the life you’ve always imagined. When going through your daily habits, ask yourself, “Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?” Being more mindful about your day to day activities will open up so many doors. This is truly such a life changing book!"

“The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. If you’re proud of how your hair looks, you’ll develop all sorts of habits to care for and maintain it. If you’re proud of the size of your biceps, you’ll make sure you never skip an upper-body workout. If you’re proud of the scarves you knit, you’ll be more likely to spend hours knitting each week. Once your pride gets involved, you’ll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits.”

 Why do I keep doing this to myself? I keep picking up these tired pop-psychology books just because they have high ratings and I keep hoping they might have something good. I should know better by now. This one was as much of a disappointment as the rest of ""personal development"" books I've read this year. It's the same superficial, regurgitated information I've been stumbling across on self-help blogs for the past 10 years. Robotic writing, highly repetitive, anecdotes taken out of context to conveniently prove the author's point, some shoddy ""science"". Most of the ideas in this have already been covered by other authors, in greater depth and with more skill. For me it read like an informational. This is essentially was this was, another platform to enhance his brand and add to his ""passive income"".The advice caters, as always, to this very specific group of people, the lifestyle-hacker extraordinaire - Tim Ferris wanna-bes. "
8,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36777500-david-laing,4,"In an episode of the North Star Podcast with David Perrell, the software entrepreneur Daniel Gross said something that I thought was wise:The definition of a habit, for me, is something that doesn’t require willpower. How can I build a large collection of habits that are healthy—that are correct—and save them to RAM in my head so that I don’t have to think about them? I would like to have that done by the end of my 20s. I’d like to be in a good place in terms of body composition, in terms of what I eat, in terms of how I work, so that I can spend the rest of my life not thinking about that stuff.I heard this a few weeks before the New Year, and I got to thinking about which habits I might want to build or break in 2019. I found the perfect companion to this reflection in James Clear’s new book, Atomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Break Bad Habits & Build Good Ones.The motivating idea behind the book is that habits are the compound interest of behaviour. Get 1% better each day and you will rarely notice a change on any given day, but by the end of a year you will be 38 times better than when you started (1.01^365 = 37.8). It’s often not possible or useful to try to quantify your skill level—maybe you just want to remember to floss—but the insight is that huge long-term differences can be born from barely perceptible but consistent short-term differences. Hence, atomic habits: pennies that grow into a fortune.Clear explains that all habits, good or bad, play out in four stages:- The cue. You perceive a specific signal. You see cookies on the kitchen table.- The craving. You feel a rush of desire for a specific reward. Your mouth starts watering as you imagine the chocolate chips melting in your mouth.- The response. You perform an action. You pick up a cookie and bite into it.- The reward. You experience pleasure as your desire is satisfied. Your taste buds send gushing thank-you notes up to your brain.Each stage of this cycle is a lever you can pull to influence your behaviour. To build a good habit, pull them one way; to break a bad one, pull them the other way. This is the essence of Clear’s method.To build a good habit:- Make it obvious (the cue)- Make it attractive (the craving)- Make it easy (the response)- Make it satisfying (the reward)To break a bad habit:- Make it invisible (the cue)- Make it unattractive (the craving)- Make it hard (the response)- Make it unsatisfying (the reward)The book is broken into four sections, one for each stage of the habit cycle. Each chapter begins with a short vignette about a historical figure, and then dives into a related piece of advice. If you’ve done some thinking or reading about habit formation before, then you might be familiar with many of these ideas already. This was the case for me. However, even if you feel like you know the landscape well, I think you would find at least one actionable idea in the book. For the rest of this post, I’ll describe the ideas that I’ve implemented myself since reading it.Habit stackingOne of the easiest ways to build a new habit is to attach it to an existing one. By resolving to start performing a new habit directly following another one that is already ingrained, you turn the old habit’s reward into the new habit’s cue; you make it obvious. After enough repetitions, the new habit is woven into your life.Last year, I developed a stable habit of doing push-ups and kettlebell swings after every 25-minute work block throughout my workday. When I read about habit stacking, I recognized an opportunity to use these existing habits as foundations for a new one: drinking more water. Now, every time I do my push-ups and kettlebell swings, I drink a small glass of water. I’m more hydrated than ever.Implementation intentionsIn a study, two groups were asked to make to-do lists, but one group was given a small tweak that resulted in them accomplishing many more tasks than the other. They were told to write down with each task the time and location where they intended to complete it. They created an implementation intention. This is another way to make a behaviour more obvious, this time by associating the action with a context that can be perceived as the cue.I’ve started writing down implementation intentions every time I add an item to my to-do list. Instead of Call the bank to order a new debit card, it’s Call the bank to order a new debit card in the living room on Saturday morning. While there are still plenty of overdue tasks on my to-do list, this new habit of writing down where and when I intend to complete each task has helped me cross a number of them off.Prime your environmentI first learned the value of this lesson three years ago when I lived in a tiny coach house in Welland, Ontario. I had always struggled to get out of bed on time, but I was teaching courses of my own for the first time and couldn’t afford to be late for class. So I came up with a solution. Each night before bed, I prepared my stovetop espresso maker and put it on the stove, alongside a clean mug and my phone (my alarm). When my alarm started ringing, I had to get out of bed and walk over to the stove to turn it off. Immediately, I would turn on the stove element and go back to bed for a snooze. Ten minutes later I would be woken again by the gurgling of the espresso, as well as the fear that it would boil over if I didn’t get up to turn off the element. My reward for getting up the second time was a fresh cup of coffee. Ever since then I’ve been completely cured of my snoozing habit.As Clear explains, priming your environment for its next use is a great way to make a desirable behaviour more obvious as well as easier. After reflecting on this, I’ve been experimenting with a few changes:- Pumping up my bike tires as soon as I get home from my evening bike commute. (This makes it easier to choose the bike as my mode of transport the next day.)- Repacking my gym bag as soon as I get home from the gym. (This makes it easier to go for a work-out whenever I feel like it.)- Filling up a big water jug next to my desk at the end of each work day. (This makes it easier to stay hydrated the next day. Note that putting the water jug there also makes my drinking habit more obvious.)- Placing a novel on my pillow after making my bed each morning. (I’m trying to build the habit of reading fiction before bed because I find that it helps me sleep.)Make it smallI’ve used various habit trackers for about four years now, and I’ve just about settled on TaskLife as my favourite. I define a list of behaviours, and each day the app asks me whether I’ve done them. The beauty of it is that I can choose the frequency with which I want to perform each task, as well as the time period over which to calculate that frequency. It’s like Andy Matuschak’s system of smoothly ratcheting targets with teeth, minus a bit of smoothness and all the teeth.The most common reason that I’ve failed to hit my target frequency has been the size of my tasks—they have been too hard. For example, it’s often hard to find the time and motivation for one full hour of writing, so I would often skip that habit. Even before reading Atomic Habits, I had recognized this problem and made some changes, like cutting 60 minutes of writing down to 10. But Clear offered many more ways to break down a complex or challenging behaviour into a task that can be completed in under two minutes. Since getting started is by far the hardest part of most habits, I decided to change all my habits in TaskLife to 2-minutes-or-under tasks as a way of making it easier to spend time on the things that matter to me. Here is the current list of questions that TaskLife asks me each morning about my previous day, along with the frequency with which I aim to complete those tasks over a rolling window of 21 days:- Did you study at least one flashcard? (70%)- Did you read at least one page of fiction? (70%)- Did you write at least one sentence? (55%)- Did you read at least one Pocket article? (50%)- Did you play at least one chord on the guitar? (50%)- Did you write at least one sentence in your journal? (50%)- Did you go to bed by 9:30pm? (50%)- Did you send at least one message to a friend? (50%)- Did you read at least one page of nonfiction? (40%)- Did you walk through the doors of the gym? (25%)Automate itLastly, the easiest way to make a task easier is to delegate it to a machine. As a data scientist, I have obviously implemented this one before, too. I’ve automated my health insurance payments, my donations to charity, my bus pass top-ups, my memorization efforts, my sleep tracking, my exercise tracking, and my rebalancing calculations in my investment accounts. But there are always more things to automate, and Clear’s chapter on the subject got me to reflect on what else I could do. Since reading the chapter, I’ve set up automatic payments on all of my regular bills, and on my to-do list (with an implementation intention!) is the task of setting up automatic monthly transfers into my investment accounts.In summary, I recommend Atomic Habits. If the topic of habit formation is new to you, I think this book is probably the best general resource you’ll find. And if the topic is already familiar, you’ll find that the book is a quick and engaging read with dozens of fresh ideas that you can consider implementing in your life.This review is also posted on my website."
9,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7309374-romanas,4,"This is a dual review of two books about habit. Habits are important things in one’s life and there are numerous books on the subject. The classic book, a must read, is The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey. Another two popular books about habits are The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg and Atomic Habits by James Clear, that came out very recently. Having read all three of them I combined my notes for the last two in this post. No matter what stage in life you are, it is always good to review one’s habits and behaviour – these books provide a good framework for doing it.One of the habits I’m struggling with is to get rid of the reading of self-help books. Thus, reading The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg and parallelly Atomic Habits by James Clear became a sort of a meta enterprise. Would these self-help books about habits help me to get rid of the habit of reading self-help books? There’s nothing wrong with the self-help genre per se. I believe, everybody should strive to become a better version of themselves. Evidently, there’s a lot of great wisdom in this type of books – many prominent figured refer to them when they tell the story of their success. However, having read tons of them, one would usually circle around the same known stuff and shabby ideas wrapped in different narratives and supported by different anecdotes. The trick here is to know when to stop and, actually, go out and do something by using the knowledge and inspiration gained.My own habit of falling back to self-help books is, obviously, grounded in the alluring products of the habit loop driven by the craving for knowledge on self-improvement. We can use the basic members of the habit loop – cue, routine, and reward – well covered in the Duhigg’s book and analyse the situation with the reading of self-help books. For this type of products, the cues (triggers) are everywhere, and who can ignore the wish for excellence? Then, the routine is easily carried out – the messages in those books are straightforward that doesn’t require a very deep thinking and reading between the lines. It just assumes the acceptance in many cases, and, finally, the reward is instant – the feeling of getting something very valuable – a digested wisdom and not seldom a bit of inspiration. It can be compared to junk food (which by the way is almost gone from my life thanks to this kind of books). However, my point is not to pick on this genre, but rather to stress the importance of not getting stuck in it, as in my previous point. Habit as a phenomena humans and other living creatures are equipped with is one of my favourite subjects. I strongly believe, in the end, habits defines us and our destiny. The subject of habit covers several interesting areas as neuroscience, biology, psychology, and more. The basic mechanics of habit system can be described through the theory of operand conditioning, a term coined by B.F. Skinner back in 1930. It is a technique of learning that occurs through reward and punishment for behaviour. Through operand conditioning, an individual makes an association between a behaviour and a consequence. A relatively simple feedback loop forming habits of an individual can be described in terms of drive, stimulus, response, reward with different kind of reinforcers – positive or negative. What was lacking in the model of operand conditioning was other influencers like feelings, thoughts, and, very importantly – beliefs. Moreover, human behaviour is so complex that factors as the environment and group psychology are of crucial importance when it comes to the habit science. Modern behavioural science takes these terms into account and they are very important in the habit theory. The authors of both books did a great job addressing these factors in their respective methodologies.Based on the early theory of operand conditioning, different models around habits and behaviour (in my interpretation, behaviour is a series of actions evoked by habits) are developed and fundamental terms are just called different names. Charles Duhigg in The Power of Habit grounds his model on the habit loop consisting of cue-routine-reward parameters which are driven by craving. James Clear in Atomic Habits suggests his model consisting of four steps called cue, craving, response, and reward. These factors are systematically analysed by respective author and the steps how to build good habits and remove the bad ones based on these models are suggested. In both books I found some valuable and interesting points as well as good tips on how to keep one’s habits on the right track.As one can see from the parameters in each model, there’s a difference in the arrangement of them making some differences in application of the methodologies of habit treatment. Duhigg sees the term craving as a driving force for the members in the habit loop – cue, routine, reward. Clear suggests that craving is simply a second stage in his model of habit. This is the main difference, and I need to admit I haven’t put enough time to analyse which model is right – both make sense. We would need some deeper diving in relevant disciplines and get help from ontology of the actual things here. Anyhow, I tend to believe that a craving lies above cue, routine, and reward. Cues alone without craving are meaningless. Nevertheless, both models are very useful for working on one’s habits. Duhigg argues that the way of changing or replacing of habit is to focus on the routine parameter, or the response part according to the terminology or Clear. Clear gives a lot of examples on how the cue and reward steps can be worked on. I completely agree that even these parts can be influenced, whereas Duhigg argues that the most important thing is to focus on routine leaving cues and rewards unchanged. I believe, we can remove unwanted triggers. Like making the tempting things like candies hard to reach and out of sight, etc. This has been well researched in a very interesting work by Richard H. Thaler for which he was awarded the Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2017. Then, we can reprogram our brain to think about rewards differently – change the mode of them or reinforce the distant rewards requiring immediate sacrifice by some direct reward. Clear has a lot of good examples how to do it.Habit should be seen as one of the essential parts forming an individual. A brilliant quote by Margaret Thatcher shows the operational importance of habits: “Watch your thoughts, for they will become actions. Watch your actions, for they'll become... habits. Watch your habits for they will forge your character. Watch your character, for it will make your destiny.” If we put those terms it in a different order, we can see that habits are very important, perhaps more important than one’s thoughts, because they are operational tools defining which actions one will take and what destiny those actions will form.In summary, if you are somehow unsatisfied with any of your habits and would like to actively and effectively change them and thus become an individual you’d like to be, I strongly recommend both books. I would read The Power of Habit book first, this book is longer, has more stories, and has more research behind it. Atomic Habits book is easier to get through, especially after reading Duhigg’s book. Both books, as you might have guessed, are clear, easy to read and grasp. They will give you the right mindset to approach your behaviour and provide valuable tools to shape your personality."

To create a good habit, author James Clear suggests:  - Make it Obvious - Make it Attractive - Make it Easy - Make it SatisfyingWhile at first glance these may seem overly simplistic, Atomic Habits delves into each of these concepts and also describes how these same ideas can be inverted to break bad habits. The content is easily digestible. Different parts are likely to resonate with different readers but I found a lot of helpful information in this book, especially in one of the final chapters about how to stay motivated — Mastery requires practice. ”The only way to become excellent is to become endlessly fascinated with doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.”Atomic Habits is a read I recommend for anyone trying to step up their game, in any facet of life, with the reminder that refinement and improvement are continuous, long-term processes."
11,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51876682-matias-andina,1,"Reading this book feels like reading a homework assignment. James Clear wanted to read a lot of books and make a summary of the concepts he would implement for self-improvement. He also made a point in improve himself in the most hacky way possible. Instead of keeping the summary as personal notes, he published it. The fact that the author boasts about being a writer only makes it worse. You can actually smell the cheap tools he uses to put words into text and build chapters out of thin air. I wanted this book to get better, but it doesn't, up to the very end the author repeats the same choice pattern:* Tell them what you are going to tell them, tell them, tell them what you told them.* Simplify science to the border of being wrong. * Abuse of ""as such person said ___INSERT QUOTE HERE____""* Build each chapter out of unacknowledged (stolen/refurbished) concepts, coming from other writings that predate this book.The last point is particularly annoying and the book is plagued by them. He even uses the same graphics and plots as the originals! He includes verbatim whole poems by Lao Tse or writings by Seneca. At least these are attributed and not refurbished. If you are somewhat familiar with the literature, avoid this book.If you are thinking about reading this book, think about the books the author got the content from. Go and read those, you will get the original content without the coarse editing by James Clear. You will also get better foundations for growing a mindset instead of implementing hacks.Start with Why - Simon SinekMastery - George LeonardOutliers - Malcom GladwellThe Tipping Point - Malcom GladwellGetting Things Done - David AllenThe Element - Ken RobinsonBehave - Robert Sapolsky [Science communication written by experts in the field]Thinking Fast and Slow - Daniel Kahneman [Science communication written by experts in the field]"

On one hand, I'm one of those people who always wants to learn and improve, while also getting in my own way due to character/personality flaws, which I'm well acquainted with, which is why, occasionally, I read yet another self-help book, hoping to get inspired or to learn something that will result in me taking action. I heard about this book from different sources which propelled me to put it on hold. My usual scepticism was pretty quickly sent to smithereens. First of all, Clear is a very good narrator, he's got a lovely voice and accent. Second, he didn't try to sell me anything. Third, the book is very matter of fact, with a mix of psychology, examples and, most importantly, actionable steps. Also, it didn't have any spiritual mambo jumbo something that grinds my gears.

We all have certain habits we want to learn or unlearn and we usually start strong but lack the motivation to stick to it. This book really expanded my mind about what it actually takes to make habits stick and how motivation has VERY little to do with it. I added a few of key quotes from the book that touch on some of the steps: why the smallest habits matter, awareness, repetition over perfection, focus on environment, how to keep going when the initial flame of motivation dies down, learn / unlearn your identity, pay attention to the words you use. #vlbookclub"

22,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60057377-stephen-lubin,5,"8/10Atomic Habits is a useful book. It’s a practical guide to identifying and changing your habits. It’s something you can actually put into practice in your life. I think that all of the concepts in the book are good and useful to know but some of the action points I think are slightly oversimplified. If you take the action points in some chapters and modify them to your specific situation you can still apply most of them but you do have to do some critical thinking with the material. I like that the book is simple and straightforward. James Clear doesn’t bog you down with a lot of conceptual material. He starts each chapter with an example (some are better than others), gives you the concept plainly, and then gives you concrete actions to apply the concept in real life. It’s a nice formula. Each chapter is roughly 15-20min.This book is worth reading. It’s easy to apply the knowledge and action steps. Even if it doesn’t completely change your behavior, it will make you more aware of yourself. It provides a good lens that you can use to view yourself and others. I would recommend it to anyone who is trying to really set an airtight routine. If you follow the book you can definitely make something a habit. I’m a fan of James Clear. I have read his newsletter for about 2yrs now. His newsletter is one of the best I’ve read because it’s interesting and well researched and always has some take away for me. His book is really an expansion on a lot of things he’s covered in his newsletter. There are some chapters that I was already very familiar with because I had read his previous material on it. This doesn’t detract from the book. He expands on most things he’s written about before. The book is laid out like a road map and builds upon itself, which is something you don’t really get from the newsletter. The intro is pretty graphic. It’s about a personal injury the author has faced. I recommend being prepared for that. Once you get through that it’s all good. "

But this document, which is already only a 45-page free-to-download ""ebook"", is too long and could be synthesized in a 3 page tryptic. Although the intention is good and the concept an important one, and the proposals described to get rid of bad habits and attain desired ones are with no doubt good ones, it's a full blown action of ""copy-writing"": self-help mumbo jumbo that goes over and over again through the same concepts in an attempt to spin out something akin to a book to get people to give their emails in exchange of a free copy.I do appreciate the contents, I certainly don't appreciate that I need to skim through the text searching for the meat. Fortunately this is not a full-blown book, which I am sure some authors would pull off delivering exactly the same meaningful information. Moreover, it promises on talking about ""the science of habit"" and there is nothing even close to science or scientific references on it. The only references are other books on habits which presumably don't have sources in them either. I am not saying it's nonsense, I apply the techniques described in it and I can attest to its effectiveness, but there's no scientific proof here if that's what you are looking for.Whoever is interested in an abridged version of the WHOLE thing, here it is:How to build new habits: Three step process (3 Rs): - cue/reminder: don't wait to be motivated, associated an habit with an every-day trigger. - routine: do it, no matter what, even if it's a minimal version of what you want to achieve. - reward: associate doing it with a reward, which can simply be saying ""success"" to yourself.Start small, make it easy so you never avoid the habit.Identity-based habits:The goal must not be the habit itself, nor what people think of you, or a deadline nor even what you want to achieve. Focus on who you want to be (or go back to being) and work towards that through the habit. (I.e. ""I want to loose 10 kg"" wrong, ""I want to be a person that eats less junk"" right).Set schedules (habit), not goals (achievement).How to break bad habits:We have bad habits because we are rewarded by them. They are normally associated with stress and boredom. Thus, ""just stop doing it"" never works. You need to substitute a bad habit with a different one. How to: - Choose a substitute. - Cut out the triggers. - Don't do it alone, commit to it with or in front of other people. - It's ok to slip, just keep at it.That's it. You may find some other things, but this is the important part, really."

“Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.”
I've read a number of books on how to form positive habits, including The Power of Habit by Duhigg, and in my opinion, Atomic Habits by Clear ranks as the best. It covers what could be considered as ideas of common sense, but presents these ideas in a well organized and logical way. Basic concepts include the notion that you should focus not on the end goal, but rather forming the habit which will ultimately get you to your goal. The author notes that we as a society are too absorbed by short-term gratification; bad habits (like smoking or overeating) satisfy in the near term, but take us away from the person we really want to be in the long-run. Good habits, however, often involve short-term discomfort (going to the gym), but move us toward our goals over time. Other points: keep habits small at first, and again forget about short-term progress. For example, it doesn't matter how hard you work out, just so long as you go to the gym; avoid finding excuses not to go. Another: make bad habits more difficult; remove the batteries from your TV remote if you want to stop watching the tube. Also, employ the power of habit tracking for positive reinforcement. Personally, I love the HabitBull app on my phone which I use to track habits.The book shares numerous great tips. My only gripe is that the author has a habit (sorry) of stating repeatedly that more info is available on his website. After 20+ times it became annoying."

29,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,4,"A clear, practical guide to developing good habits. The information in this book is fairly solid and worth reading for most people. My only concern is whether the information is presented in a way that is effective: that is, after reading this book, what percentage of people will actually change their behavior? I suppose this is the ultimate question of all self-improvement books, but I found that this one in particular, while effective at organizing and presenting information, didn't do it in such a way that I was immediately motivated to act on it. In short, I found it to be an educational book, but not an inspirational one.However, an important note: before reading this book, I was already reasonably good at building good habits. For example, about 6 years ago, I got myself into the habit of taking notes whenever I read nonfiction, and after finishing a book, summarizing those notes on GoodReads as part of my review; in fact, that's what you're reading here right now! I've managed to keep this habit for years and have now written reviews and summaries for hundreds of other books. Oddly enough, it was this habit—writing the very notes you're reading now—that got me to act on some of the advice in Atomic Habits (namely: I'm starting a habit journal and focusing on slower progress in fitness). But if I didn't already have this habit, would this book have helped me make any changes in my life? I'm not sure.That said, it's still a useful read. Here are some of the key takeaways for me:1. Your life today is the sum of your habits.- ""Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. You get what you repeat.""- If you get your habits right, the rest will follow. Therefore, you should be more concerned with your trajectory than your current position.- The 4 stages of forming a habit are cue, craving, response, reward. The cue triggers your brain to initiate some action; the craving provides the motivation to take a specific action; the response is the action you actually take; and the reward is what you get in response for that action. For example, the cue might be a stressful day at work, which makes you crave a relief from all that anxiety, which leads to the response that you head outside and smoke, which gives you the reward of getting away from work and the relaxation you get from the cigarette. - If you want to create good habits, you need all 4 of those ingredients in sufficient qualities: you need something to trigger the habit, you need it to produce a strong enough craving to motivate you take act on that habit, the response must be easy enough that you actually do it, and the reward must be satisfying enough that you keep doing it. The inverse is also true: if you want to break a bad habit, you can do it by interfering with any of these 4 ingredients.2. Small habits add up to something big.- Small habits are like compound interest. If you keep investing, even just a little bit, over time, the returns are exponential.- The best way to form habits is typically to start small—so small, that it may seem inconsequential. To get yourself to exercise, you might start with just 5 minutes of exercise per day; to get yourself to write more, you might start with writing just 1 paragraph per day. Just about everyone can take these tiny first steps, and sticking with easy habits is, well, fairly easy. And while the initial habit mmight not have much effect, the important part is that it got you started.- To make progress, you need to continue making tiny tiny little steps forward: 1% improvements, like adding 1 more minute of exercise each week, or 1 more paragraph of writing. Again, taking small steps forward is fairly easy, but these tiny improvements can add up astonishingly fast. A 1% improvement each day may not seem like much, but it adds up to a ~37x improvement over the course of a year. Exponential progress is powerful.3. Exponential progress is hard to see, initially.- One of the trickiest things with forming habits around small steps and exponential progress is that in the early days, it's hard to see any effect at all, which can be very demotivating. E.g., You won't see much change in your body from just 5 minutes of exercise per day, and you won't become a famous writer with just 1 paragraph of writing per day.- However, even though you can't see it, those investments are making a difference. Think of an ice cube in a room that starts at 20 degrees and is slowly warming up. As the temperature goes to 21 degrees, 22, 23, etc, you initially see no changes in that ice cube whatsoever. And yet, progress is being made. It's only when you finally get to 30 degrees, 31, and 32 that, suddenly, a dramatic change is visible. Almost all the change is only visible at the end, but you couldn't have gotten there without investing all the energy in the beginning an middle. - Much of life works that way. That's why it's essential to form habits now and keep investing, even if it doesn't seem to be making a difference initially. The effect of compound interest is delayed. 4. Patience is essential.- Because progress is so hard to see, patience is an essential part of success. The media loves to tell sensational stories of overnight success, but the reality is that almost all great accomplishments take a long, long time. - In fact, small, incremental progress is typically more effective and sustainable than large jumps, even if you think you have the ability to make a large jump. For example, if you have a habit of weight lifting, and one day, you try to make a 30 pound jump in your squat, there's a chance you'll injure yourself, or even if you don't, make yourself exceptional sore, either of which can be a setback and even break your habit. If you instead stay patient and stick with much smaller increments—e.g., just a 1 pound increase from your last workout—you'll almost always succeed, the risk of injury is low, and over time, these small increments add up shockingly quickly, and you'll far surpass the person trying to do bigger jumps. 5. Focus on systems more than goals.- Much of the modern world is obsessed with setting and accomplishing goals. But it's far more important to focus on putting in place a system to achieve your goals than the goals themselves.- That's because, when life gets tough, you don't rise to the level of your goals; instead, you fall to the level of your systems. If you don't have a good system in place, you'll never accomplish your goals; but if you have a good system in place, then the score will take care of itself. Get the inputs right, and the outputs will work out.6. The best way to put a good system in place is to make it part of your identity.- If you want to form a new habit to accomplish some goal, instead of focusing on the goal itself, focus on becoming the type of person that can accomplish that goal.- Example: instead of focusing on trying to lose weight, become the type of person who never misses a workout. Make it part of your identity, and your own pride will help you turn it into a habit.- To make something part of your identity, you need to gradually show yourself evidence that that person is really you. For example, start with a small exercise habit (e.g., 5 minutes of exercise) that is easy to succeed at. Seeing yourself exercise every day will let you build up some evidence that you're the type of person who never misses a workout. You then gradually ramp the workouts up, and each time you succeed and get some exercise in, you'll see yourself more and more as the person who never misses a workout. You'll start telling others that. You'll start being that person. And once it's part of your identity, it becomes a much easier habit to maintain.- Note that this can be a double-edged sword. Bad habits can also come from some part of your identity. E.g., If you identify yourself as someone who is bad at math or someone who can't remember names, then because you've made those bad habits part of who you are, it'll be hard to change them. So be very careful with what you make part of your identity!7. Trigger new habits with existing ones. - Examples: when I have my first cup of coffee in the morning (existing habit), I will do 2 minutes of meditation (new habit); just before heading to lunch each day (existing habit), I will do 10 push-ups (new habit). - The existing habit becomes a trigger for your new one. By leveraging behaviors you already do, and especially behaviors you enjoy, you can make it easier to pick up new behaviors.- Note: try to be very specific when identifying the trigger. For example, ""do 2 minutes of meditation in the morning"" is not nearly as good as ""do 2 minutes of meditation when I have my first cup of coffee"", as ""in the morning"" is a vague time period that won't be nearly as effective of a trigger as ""first cup of coffee.""8. Make the habit satisfying.- Triggers can help you start doing a habit, but to reinforce that habit so you keep doing it over the long term, it needs to be satisfying in some way. Some habits are inherently satisfying (e.g., you might starting getting a ""runner's high"" once you start running), but for those that aren't, or where the satisfaction won't be visible until much later (e.g., after years of training), you'll want to deliberately add some sort of reward.- Example: each time you manage to go to the yoga studio and do a good hour of stretching, reward yourself with a tasty snack from their cafe. Your brain will then slowly associate Friday the reward of yoga with yummy food, and it'll become a fun outing, rather than a chore.9. The environment has a huge impact on your habits.- People who are good at creating new habits don't necessarily have better willpower than others; instead, they are just better at structuring their environment so they don't have to exercise their willpower in the first place. You should strive to design your world so that it's easy to do the right thing.- For example, if you walk into the kitchen, and there is a plate of cookies on the table, you might be tempted to eat one, even if you're not hungry. If you're trying to get into a habit of eating healthy, using your willpower to try to resist those cookies every single time you walk into the kitchen is going to be a losing battle. A far more effective technique is to get those cookies out of sight; or even better, not have them in the house in the first place. - It's also a good idea to try to tie each environment to exactly 1 habit, and to avoid mixing. For example, if you're trying to get into a healthy sleeping habit, don't watch TV or do work in the same place you sleep (i.e., your bed). Instead, create a separate environment for TV (e.g., your living room or your couch) and another separate environment for doing work (e.g., your office or your desk). That way, each time you're in an environment, it triggers one habit, and only one habit: e.g., I'm at my desk, so I'm doing work, or I'm at my bed, so I'll go to sleep.10. Tracking habits can help reinforce them.- Tracking your progress and making what you've accomplished more visible can be a powerful way to reinforce habits.- Example: a calendar or habit journal where you put an ""X"" every day you succeed at a habit (e.g., go to the gym or meditate). After a while, you'll see a long streak of X's, which is satisfying, as you get a visual representation of your progress (which, as you may remember from earlier, is hard to see, especially early on). Moreover, it reinforces the habit, as you'll be tempted to keep doing the habit just to avoid breaking your streak of ""X's"". - Example: get two jars, and put a bunch of paperclips in one of them. Each time you succeed at a habit, move a paperclip from the full jar to the empty one. Over time, as you do the habit more and more, the empty jar will fill up, giving you another great visual sense of progress. You may start doing the habit more and more just to fill up that jar.- Note: tracking your habits is yet another habit to develop, so there is a cost to this, but it's the type of habit you invest in once, and then it pays dividends when working on all your other habits.11. Never miss twice.- Eventually, everyone fails at their habits. You'll have a bad day, or get sick, or just screw up.- The key is not to give up just because you failed. Since all success takes a long time, a single failure along the way will likely have no measurable impact on the final outcome. So don't stress it, and immediately get back on track. The goal is not to be perfect, but to be consistent.- In other words, it's OK to miss once now and then, but never miss twice in a row."

The concepts are really simple and straight-forward, yet profound in their ability to change lives. I plan to purchase it in eyeball-reading form so I can actually put these concepts into action since doing so in the car on my way to and from work doesn't really make sense.In my experience and with some of my recent reads on addiction and dealing with many addicts in my line of work, I can say that these concepts really make sense. I've worked with people breaking alcohol addiction and some of the same practices were used that are described here, such as brushing your teeth or drinking grapefruit juice when you have a craving. Atomic Habits doesn't tell you to brush your teeth or drink juice, but tells about the cues that cause us to fall back into habits.Habits govern so much that we don't even realize. I hear a pop of a can and suddenly I'm looking to grab a Dr. Pepper and that's just one of so many things I realize in my own life let alone those that I don't realize.Self-examination is tough, but I would highly recommend reading this book, especially if you are stuck in a rut and can't figure your way out. But even if not, it's good to take a look at how habits are affecting your day-to-day life. This quote is quite profound and describes, I believe, what I'm saying: “Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.

Great book on how to create of break habits.I Atomic Habits useful as I did with the book Deep Work by Cal Newport in the sense that both are about improving productivity. Deep Work was more impactful to me though as some things in Atomic Habits were repeated from other books I've read like The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg. Power of Habit was more so the importance and impact habits have on you, as oppose to Atomic Habits which I found more practical in the sense that how you can make or break productive or unproductive habits. It also reminded me of the Compound Effect by Darren Hardy because of how he talks a lot about how little changes in your daily routine can make a big impact down the line, and about compound interest.Notes:- Change your identity change your habits - not I’ll try and run, instead say I am a runner and I’m going for a run.

All I want is a productive little audiobook to listen to while I work, helpfully filled with tips to improve my life. All I get is priviledged white people recycling the same old advice over and over. This book is especially grating as it's filled with cute little platitudes like ""the same boiling water will soften a potato and harden an egg"". I already know how boiling water works, thanks, can we get to the part where you tell me something I haven't heard from seven other productivity books already?At one point Clear writes, ""I get my assistant to do this for me every week, but if you don't have an assistant..."" I love how some of these productivity authors neglect to mention all the outside help they hire. It's like that other woman who suggested hiring an au pair for when your primary nanny is taking her vacation days. He also suggests doing things like paying for grocery delivery instead of going to the store to save time. He tells the story of one guy who paid his personal trainer $500 every time he forgot to log his food for the day.The real productivity hack seems to be to hire someone to do all the little day-to-day tasks for you so you can focus on other things. This is great if you're fabulously rich, but, if you're like me and don't currently have a full time assistant, and people to do your housework and your meal prep for you, then you may have to look elsewhere for more practical advice.

It breaks things down in a way that is based on research and actionable. A few things that stuck with me are:1) Whenever you do a habit, you are casting a vote for the person you want to become2) When you slip up, it's ok. You just have to make the next action you take, be one that is an action you want your ideal person to take3) A 1% improvement a day, can lead to a 37x improvement at the end of the year! (the compounding effect of habits)4) It's more important to show up than to actually get something done, because showing up is the hardest part (using activation energy to make yourself takes small steps to build your habit first)"
37,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28266634-liza-fireman,4,"I really liked this book. It is very practical and interesting. It did remind me a little bit of The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business by Charles Duhigg. It included a lot less of the story telling, but included much of the advice of changing habits. It also reminded me of The Happiness Advantage: The Seven Principles of Positive Psychology That Fuel Success and Performance at Work by Shawn Achor. A really great book, that mentions adding friction to make it harder to go with bad habits (remove the remote control batteries, and it will probably make you think more about turning on the tv).  The author suggests that you should decide who is the person you want to be, and that habits make you who you are. Your habits shape your identity, and you can change your habits and identity (not sure that I am super happy with that phrasing, but there was much in the book that was really good, so I'll be willing to look away on this phrasing :)). I really loved his system: How to Create a Good HabitThe 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious.The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive.The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy.The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying.And:How to Break a Bad HabitInversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible.Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive.Inversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult.Inversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying.It is worth mentioning that James Clear had a really terrible accident in baseball, and a serious head injury. He had been hit in the face with a baseball bat, and got into a comma. But this injury probably had a part of who he is today. This injury was one of mine, and the experience taught me a critical lesson: changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits. With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible. His parents were no strangers to the hospital, since his sister had cancer a decade earlier. Oh my, poor parents.Clear puts an emphasis on starting, even with a little tiny easy thing. Habits for the most part is doing something that you started, whether it is sitting on the sofa, or going to the gym. Habits are like the entrance ramp to a highway. They lead you down a path and, before you know it, you’re speeding toward the next behavior. It seems to be easier to continue what you are already doing than to start doing something different. He gives the example of running starting with tying your running shoes.I really liked this book. Practical and nicely written, with some great advice. 4 stars. "
38,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13717595-jake,2,"I once had a teacher who used to grumble about self help books under his breath. He was most eminently aggravated by this entire genre for being, as he used to like to say with poise: ""trash"". His sentiment regarding them seems to be pretty prevalent among many thinking people. I think there is a truth in the idea of seeing this genre as trashy, and a folly as well.While it certainty is the case that most books in this category are bereft of serious scholarship and deep thought, there are generally useful tidbits that can be gleaned regarding how to practically achieve a couple of your goals. Carnegie's advice may get you attacked by a mob, but in another context they may very well aid you into understanding people on a level that would never be mentioned in a psych 101 course. These books, are, in my view always practical. And on that note, I still read them even if at times their mediocre understanding of philosophy, science and history make my eyes roll back in my head.So? Atomic habits. Eh. This is a solid book, despite its lack of self awareness - as many people have come before clear and said the same thing in more articulate ways. A good resource for this is Maria popova's blog : https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03.... She has been writing about these ideas prob before duhigg' s power of habit. In short, clear contends that one should start with smaller goals, rather than massive ambitions. ANd by doing life little by little. That being, changing our individual habits, we will find ourselves gaining more control over our lives. As it is in fact the case that we are - in a sense what we do - it therefore is more accurately expressed 'we are what we do habitually.' Change your habits - change your lifeClear states at the end that the architecture of habits are broken down to two phases. We then must learn about ourselves and recondition our behaviors. 1. The problem phase  1a. cue (find a trigger/learn old triggers)1b.craving (impulse to do thing after trigger)2. Solution phase2a. response (respond to trigger)2b reward (receive reward for doing thing)I would like to take this time at the end of the review to quote a small part of the text which I found stimulating by its silliness.""In 1936 psychologist Kurt Lewin write a simple equation that makes a powerful statement: Behavior is a function of the person in their environment, or B= f(p,e)"". Im fairly certain that a well seasoned researcher of psychology would never write this pseudo mathematical sentence. This was ok. Recommended for:-people who like listening to Tony Robbins - those who want a run down of the concept of habit- those struggling to move who want an idea"
39,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"This was excellent. Full of common sense advice on how to change your habits, one tiny step at a time. The ideas are simple and easy to follow, and he gives concrete examples and even templates for things like habit tracking and evaluating your habits. James Clear also explains the psychology behind his system, sprinkled with interesting, but not too many, real life examples. For example, we are wired for immediate satisfaction, but most good habits have delayed gratification - so he suggests finding an immediate reward. Some simple techniques are habit stacking - i.e. connecting a new habit to an existing one, or the 2 minute rule - that a new habit should not take longer than two minutes. First, establish the habit, later refine or add to it. Very useful. I have listened to it, but ordered a copy and will review it in print, so I can make notes. Highly recommend to every procrastinator out there - of whom I am a major example."

The book has a plethora of real-life events that portray “Habits are like compound interest”. James started with his own-not-so-happy-incident from his life and how subsequently he went on to the quest of creating the Atomic Habits empire.The essence of the whole book is put into a nutshell of four life-defining rule:•	Make it Obvious (Cue)•	Make it Attractive (Craving)•	Make it Easy (Response)•	Make it Satisfying (Reward)To achieve big in life it’s not necessary that we do only big things. A small percentage of improvement on a daily basis can also achieve the same thing. One has to overcome his/her “Plateau of Latent Potential”- as the author suggests. It’s good to have goals in life but do not focus on goals rather accrue your potential to create a “belief system” to achieve that goal. Winners and Losers have the same goals but what differentiates them is “System” they followed to get the goal.Every rule begins with a spellbound example from the annals of successful history. Be it entertainment, sports, medicine, scholar – every example is so inter-related with the habit that it feels unbelievable that a minute habit can have a remarkable impact. James also gave few strategies to practice this in our daily life like “Habit Score Card”, “Habit Stacking”, “Habit Contract” and many more. One of my fav. concepts from the book is “The Goldilocks Rule”: It says, “The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty.”The amazing thing I liked in the book is how meticulously James observed the nuance in once behaviors. How one’s habit gets created and shaped in the society he/she lives, whom they talk, whom they listen, and what object they use. The book is not targeted only for a particular sect of society but it encapsulates the whole of mankind. I think this is the book one must have on their shelf."
44,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109681904-layla,4,"It was pretty educational and offered many insightful ways to improve upon yourself. It tells you how to build habbits that benefit you, and cut out ones that don't based on others experiences and what has proven to work for some people. I'm a pretty unmotivated person when it comes to building new habbits and following through with them so I might try some of these tips in the future. Even though I'm not going to say I completely enjoyed my self reading this book, as it was just a bunch of information rather than a story I can get lost in, but I did get something out of this which is important to me when reading a non-fiction book."
45,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65666930-atharva-amdekar,5,"I generally tend to avoid reading self-help books because I believe its more natural to learn from your own past experiences rather than someone else's, which is why I always found it difficult to relate to, and apply the lessons written by self-help authors. However, reading this book was certainly a different experience. The author provides a cogent, and a scientific approach, unlike the philosophical approach of most self-help books. He breaks down the formation/destruction of good/bad habits into easy-to-understand and easy-to-apply systematic components. This book also taught me a lot on how the human psyche works in tandem with our environment. He talks about how our brain is wired to overvalue radical changes in our behaviour as against the undervaluation of small changes over a longer period of time, which was the most important lesson I picked up from this book. A must-read for anyone who wants to form/break good/bad habits. However, I'd suggest to read only a few pages everyday so that you are able to apply those learnings as you go along. Reading this book like a story book and aiming to apply everything after completing it in its entirety will probably do you no good."

I started reading  Atomic Habits  on my Kindle and just 15% in I felt I had highlighted and underlined basically every line, so much so I had to go out and get a physical copy of the book so I could go through slowly. WHAT A BOOK! This is a must read book for everyone! Jame Clear really gets to the heart of what it takes to build healthy habits and what it takes to get rid of the unhealthy ones. I think everyone could benefit from reading this book and putting into practice the advice given. For me, I love how clear James Clear was in this book in the work that goes into forming healthy and getting rid of unhealthy habits. Clear offers practical advice on how to build these habits, in ways that aren't overwhelming. I love how feasible his suggests were and I look forward to putting them into practice.  It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.  This is a major thing for me. I get so caught up in having a defining moment that I lose sight of making the small improvements on a daily basis that leads to these defining moments. I liked that Clear focus on how you can tiny improvements on a daily basis that will lead to major improvements. Finally, if you are like me, I focus on the big goals... I get lost in trying to achieve that goal and I dont focus on what can lead to me achieving these goals. In Atomic Habits, James Clear talks about the process that leads to the goals and how we need to focus more on putting process and systems in place to achieve these goals. This is a solid read and I recommend this books to anyone who is struggling to put in place new healthy habits and get rid of unhealthy ones. Please grab a copy and change your life. "

At the end of each chapter, there's simplified notes for easy reference.If you want to step up your game on creating a disciplined and successful life, I suggest you go and read Atomic Habits.

54,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72021544-a-bibliophile-s-compendium,1,"The book is a rehash of other authors' work, skimmed off the top. There are useful basic ideas in the book but if you look at it closely, you can see that the author is lacking a real understanding of these concepts. He doesn't explore them in depth and his conclusions are based on what he's learned from reading and then applied to his own life. He experiments on himself and then concludes ""I did it, so it must be true"". For example he says ""Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last."" What about addiction? Everything we know about addiction clearly contradicts the above statement from Clear. He also says ""Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity."" Baseless bollocks with no scientific grounds. Sure, this maybe the case for him but he has absolutely no evidence to back-up to generalize this claim. I understand he might be coming from a good place, he clearly believes he is doing good but this work is undone by the large number of statements that are untested, unquestioned or just plain false based on the current scientific evidence. What I could tell from this book and his online presence is that he is very skilled at copy-writting / summarizing other people's work and at self-promotion. Even though he considers himself to be a writer, he is not. Again, he is a copy-writer, a marketer, not a scientist, not a writer. And I get how he might seem like a great starting point if this is the first time you're stumbling across these ideas. But I say, read more books from more reputable sources, backed-up but more than an audience of subscribers and then come and see how your really feel about this content. Or not, it's really your choice. If the book came from a different perspective I could have disregarded all of this and cherry picked the good. If he would have built it like ""this is my experience, this I what I've learned throughout my life through learning and experimentation, it might work for you"". But it wasn't written like this. It's written with certainty that everything he says is true, scientifically proven and applied to everyone. He attaches his opinions to scientific facts twisting into his own version of the truth. The two quotes alone should make you question his credibility but if you don't believe me, feel free to see for yourself.Overall, a lot of hype, not a lot of substance."
55,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16080726-sabin,4,"There's got to be something that this guy does right. It might just be that he’s found the proper mix of real world examples, easy to apply manual-like instructions and just the right amount of brain science to get his point across.Of course, now that I think about it, I guess that the cocktail he made here will appeal to certain types of personalities more than to others, and I'm not even going to try to guess which, since I don't really know where I stand to begin with. Heck, maybe I'm the kind of people that it appeals to: those who can't be bothered to do some introspection. Or better yet, who do introspect, but never reach an actionable conclusion. But enough about that. The point is, if you feel that you might need a bit more order and structure in your life, or if you're annoyed that you can't stick to healthy or productive habits, then this might actually help. For me, there were at least a few takeaways. One thing that I'm pondering is how to design my environment to help me stick with a habit. And it's as easy as placing a glass full of water on the nightstand before you go to bed if you want to drink water first thing in the morning. Another cool trick is using down-time to do small chores. Like cleaning the toilet while you wait for the water in the shower to get warmer. You're already there in the bathroom and doing nothing, might as well make the most of it.That said, there are also some weaker parts. He does have a few moments throughout the book where he feels the need to do some life coaching, which, in my opinion, he could have scrapped. I always feel that funny moments are more memorable than personal confessions (and the confessions here never stop), so I would have liked more jokes instead. But, then again, not everybody can make jokes work, so, I guess that, here too, he plays to his strengths. (or avoids his weaknesses)Good book, easy read and just about the right length.

The concepts are really simple and straight-forward, yet profound in their ability to change lives. I plan to purchase it in eyeball-reading form so I can actually put these concepts into action since doing so in the car on my way to and from work doesn't really make sense.In my experience and with some of my recent reads on addiction and dealing with many addicts in my line of work, I can say that these concepts really make sense. I've worked with people breaking alcohol addiction and some of the same practices were used that are described here, such as brushing your teeth or drinking grapefruit juice when you have a craving. Atomic Habits doesn't tell you to brush your teeth or drink juice, but tells about the cues that cause us to fall back into habits.Habits govern so much that we don't even realize. I hear a pop of a can and suddenly I'm looking to grab a Dr. Pepper and that's just one of so many things I realize in my own life let alone those that I don't realize.Self-examination is tough, but I would highly recommend reading this book, especially if you are stuck in a rut and can't figure your way out. But even if not, it's good to take a look at how habits are affecting your day-to-day life. This quote is quite profound and describes, I believe, what I'm saying: “Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.”4.5 out of 5 stars (highly recommended)"

Power of Habit was more so the importance and impact habits have on you, as oppose to Atomic Habits which I found more practical in the sense that how you can make or break productive or unproductive habits.

I already know how boiling water works, thanks, can we get to the part where you tell me something I haven't heard from seven other productivity books already?At one point Clear writes, ""I get my assistant to do this for me every week, but if you don't have an assistant..."" I love how some of these productivity authors neglect to mention all the outside help they hire. It's like that other woman who suggested hiring an au pair for when your primary nanny is taking her vacation days. He also suggests doing things like paying for grocery delivery instead of going to the store to save time. He tells the story of one guy who paid his personal trainer $500 every time he forgot to log his food for the day.The real productivity hack seems to be to hire someone to do all the little day-to-day tasks for you so you can focus on other things. This is great if you're fabulously rich, but, if you're like me and don't currently have a full time assistant, and people to do your housework and your meal prep for you, then you may have to look elsewhere for more practical advice.

It breaks things down in a way that is based on research and actionable. A few things that stuck with me are:1) Whenever you do a habit, you are casting a vote for the person you want to become2) When you slip up, it's ok. You just have to make the next action you take, be one that is an action you want your ideal person to take3) A 1% improvement a day, can lead to a 37x improvement at the end of the year! (the compounding effect of habits)4) It's more important to show up than to actually get something done, because showing up is the hardest part (using activation energy to make yourself takes small steps to build your habit first)"
67,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28266634-liza-fireman,4,"I really liked this book. It is very practical and interesting. It did remind me a little bit of The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business by Charles Duhigg. It included a lot less of the story telling, but included much of the advice of changing habits. It also reminded me of The Happiness Advantage: The Seven Principles of Positive Psychology That Fuel Success and Performance at Work by Shawn Achor. A really great book, that mentions adding friction to make it harder to go with bad habits (remove the remote control batteries, and it will probably make you think more about turning on the tv).  The author suggests that you should decide who is the person you want to be, and that habits make you who you are. Your habits shape your identity, and you can change your habits and identity (not sure that I am super happy with that phrasing, but there was much in the book that was really good, so I'll be willing to look away on this phrasing :)). I really loved his system: How to Create a Good HabitThe 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious.The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive.The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy.The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying.And:How to Break a Bad HabitInversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible.Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive.Inversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult.Inversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying.It is worth mentioning that James Clear had a really terrible accident in baseball, and a serious head injury. He had been hit in the face with a baseball bat, and got into a comma. But this injury probably had a part of who he is today. This injury was one of mine, and the experience taught me a critical lesson: changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits. With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible. His parents were no strangers to the hospital, since his sister had cancer a decade earlier. Oh my, poor parents.Clear puts an emphasis on starting, even with a little tiny easy thing. Habits for the most part is doing something that you started, whether it is sitting on the sofa, or going to the gym. Habits are like the entrance ramp to a highway. They lead you down a path and, before you know it, you’re speeding toward the next behavior. It seems to be easier to continue what you are already doing than to start doing something different. He gives the example of running starting with tying your running shoes.I really liked this book. Practical and nicely written, with some great advice. 4 stars. "
68,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13717595-jake,2,"I once had a teacher who used to grumble about self help books under his breath. He was most eminently aggravated by this entire genre for being, as he used to like to say with poise: ""trash"". His sentiment regarding them seems to be pretty prevalent among many thinking people. I think there is a truth in the idea of seeing this genre as trashy, and a folly as well.While it certainty is the case that most books in this category are bereft of serious scholarship and deep thought, there are generally useful tidbits that can be gleaned regarding how to practically achieve a couple of your goals. Carnegie's advice may get you attacked by a mob, but in another context they may very well aid you into understanding people on a level that would never be mentioned in a psych 101 course. These books, are, in my view always practical. And on that note, I still read them even if at times their mediocre understanding of philosophy, science and history make my eyes roll back in my head.So? Atomic habits. Eh. This is a solid book, despite its lack of self awareness - as many people have come before clear and said the same thing in more articulate ways. A good resource for this is Maria popova's blog : https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03.... She has been writing about these ideas prob before duhigg' s power of habit. In short, clear contends that one should start with smaller goals, rather than massive ambitions. ANd by doing life little by little. That being, changing our individual habits, we will find ourselves gaining more control over our lives. As it is in fact the case that we are - in a sense what we do - it therefore is more accurately expressed 'we are what we do habitually.' Change your habits - change your lifeClear states at the end that the architecture of habits are broken down to two phases. We then must learn about ourselves and recondition our behaviors. 1. The problem phase  1a. cue (find a trigger/learn old triggers)1b.craving (impulse to do thing after trigger)2. Solution phase2a. response (respond to trigger)2b reward (receive reward for doing thing)I would like to take this time at the end of the review to quote a small part of the text which I found stimulating by its silliness.""In 1936 psychologist Kurt Lewin write a simple equation that makes a powerful statement: Behavior is a function of the person in their environment, or B= f(p,e)"". Im fairly certain that a well seasoned researcher of psychology would never write this pseudo mathematical sentence. This was ok. Recommended for:-people who like listening to Tony Robbins - those who want a run down of the concept of habit- those struggling to move who want an idea"
69,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"This was excellent. Full of common sense advice on how to change your habits, one tiny step at a time. The ideas are simple and easy to follow, and he gives concrete examples and even templates for things like habit tracking and evaluating your habits. James Clear also explains the psychology behind his system, sprinkled with interesting, but not too many, real life examples. For example, we are wired for immediate satisfaction, but most good habits have delayed gratification - so he suggests finding an immediate reward. Some simple techniques are habit stacking - i.e. connecting a new habit to an existing one, or the 2 minute rule - that a new habit should not take longer than two minutes. First, establish the habit, later refine or add to it. Very useful. I have listened to it, but ordered a copy and will review it in print, so I can make notes. Highly recommend to every procrastinator out there - of whom I am a major example."

The book has a plethora of real-life events that portray “Habits are like compound interest”. James started with his own-not-so-happy-incident from his life and how subsequently he went on to the quest of creating the Atomic Habits empire.The essence of the whole book is put into a nutshell of four life-defining rule:•	Make it Obvious (Cue)•	Make it Attractive (Craving)•	Make it Easy (Response)•	Make it Satisfying (Reward)To achieve big in life it’s not necessary that we do only big things. A small percentage of improvement on a daily basis can also achieve the same thing. One has to overcome his/her “Plateau of Latent Potential”- as the author suggests. It’s good to have goals in life but do not focus on goals rather accrue your potential to create a “belief system” to achieve that goal. Winners and Losers have the same goals but what differentiates them is “System” they followed to get the goal.Every rule begins with a spellbound example from the annals of successful history. Be it entertainment, sports, medicine, scholar – every example is so inter-related with the habit that it feels unbelievable that a minute habit can have a remarkable impact. James also gave few strategies to practice this in our daily life like “Habit Score Card”, “Habit Stacking”, “Habit Contract” and many more. One of my fav. concepts from the book is “The Goldilocks Rule”: It says, “The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty.”The amazing thing I liked in the book is how meticulously James observed the nuance in once behaviors. How one’s habit gets created and shaped in the society he/she lives, whom they talk, whom they listen, and what object they use. The book is not targeted only for a particular sect of society but it encapsulates the whole of mankind. I think this is the book one must have on their shelf."
74,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109681904-layla,4,"It was pretty educational and offered many insightful ways to improve upon yourself. It tells you how to build habbits that benefit you, and cut out ones that don't based on others experiences and what has proven to work for some people. I'm a pretty unmotivated person when it comes to building new habbits and following through with them so I might try some of these tips in the future. Even though I'm not going to say I completely enjoyed my self reading this book, as it was just a bunch of information rather than a story I can get lost in, but I did get something out of this which is important to me when reading a non-fiction book."
75,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65666930-atharva-amdekar,5,"I generally tend to avoid reading self-help books because I believe its more natural to learn from your own past experiences rather than someone else's, which is why I always found it difficult to relate to, and apply the lessons written by self-help authors. However, reading this book was certainly a different experience. The author provides a cogent, and a scientific approach, unlike the philosophical approach of most self-help books. He breaks down the formation/destruction of good/bad habits into easy-to-understand and easy-to-apply systematic components. This book also taught me a lot on how the human psyche works in tandem with our environment. He talks about how our brain is wired to overvalue radical changes in our behaviour as against the undervaluation of small changes over a longer period of time, which was the most important lesson I picked up from this book. A must-read for anyone who wants to form/break good/bad habits. However, I'd suggest to read only a few pages everyday so that you are able to apply those learnings as you go along. Reading this book like a story book and aiming to apply everything after completing it in its entirety will probably do you no good."

I started reading  Atomic Habits  on my Kindle and just 15% in I felt I had highlighted and underlined basically every line, so much so I had to go out and get a physical copy of the book so I could go through slowly. WHAT A BOOK! This is a must read book for everyone! Jame Clear really gets to the heart of what it takes to build healthy habits and what it takes to get rid of the unhealthy ones. I think everyone could benefit from reading this book and putting into practice the advice given. For me, I love how clear James Clear was in this book in the work that goes into forming healthy and getting rid of unhealthy habits. Clear offers practical advice on how to build these habits, in ways that aren't overwhelming. I love how feasible his suggests were and I look forward to putting them into practice.  It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.  This is a major thing for me. I get so caught up in having a defining moment that I lose sight of making the small improvements on a daily basis that leads to these defining moments. I liked that Clear focus on how you can tiny improvements on a daily basis that will lead to major improvements. Finally, if you are like me, I focus on the big goals... I get lost in trying to achieve that goal and I dont focus on what can lead to me achieving these goals. In Atomic Habits, James Clear talks about the process that leads to the goals and how we need to focus more on putting process and systems in place to achieve these goals. This is a solid read and I recommend this books to anyone who is struggling to put in place new healthy habits and get rid of unhealthy ones. Please grab a copy and change your life. "

At the end of each chapter, there's simplified notes for easy reference.If you want to step up your game on creating a disciplined and successful life, I suggest you go and read Atomic Habits.

Already putting it to use! Interestingly, it contradicts ""the willpower instinct"" in a few places (e.g. re whether you should hide cues for bad habits). I wonder who is right? Likely subjective.One drawback is that the author kept quoting the Dilbert guy in a role model way, which rubbed me the wrong way given his famous misogynistic rants...

84,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72021544-a-bibliophile-s-compendium,1,"The book is a rehash of other authors' work, skimmed off the top. There are useful basic ideas in the book but if you look at it closely, you can see that the author is lacking a real understanding of these concepts. He doesn't explore them in depth and his conclusions are based on what he's learned from reading and then applied to his own life. He experiments on himself and then concludes ""I did it, so it must be true"". For example he says ""Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last."" What about addiction? Everything we know about addiction clearly contradicts the above statement from Clear. He also says ""Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity."" Baseless bollocks with no scientific grounds. Sure, this maybe the case for him but he has absolutely no evidence to back-up to generalize this claim. I understand he might be coming from a good place, he clearly believes he is doing good but this work is undone by the large number of statements that are untested, unquestioned or just plain false based on the current scientific evidence. What I could tell from this book and his online presence is that he is very skilled at copy-writting / summarizing other people's work and at self-promotion. Even though he considers himself to be a writer, he is not. Again, he is a copy-writer, a marketer, not a scientist, not a writer. And I get how he might seem like a great starting point if this is the first time you're stumbling across these ideas. But I say, read more books from more reputable sources, backed-up but more than an audience of subscribers and then come and see how your really feel about this content. Or not, it's really your choice. If the book came from a different perspective I could have disregarded all of this and cherry picked the good. If he would have built it like ""this is my experience, this I what I've learned throughout my life through learning and experimentation, it might work for you"". But it wasn't written like this. It's written with certainty that everything he says is true, scientifically proven and applied to everyone. He attaches his opinions to scientific facts twisting into his own version of the truth. The two quotes alone should make you question his credibility but if you don't believe me, feel free to see for yourself.Overall, a lot of hype, not a lot of substance."
85,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16080726-sabin,4,"There's got to be something that this guy does right. It might just be that he’s found the proper mix of real world examples, easy to apply manual-like instructions and just the right amount of brain science to get his point across.Of course, now that I think about it, I guess that the cocktail he made here will appeal to certain types of personalities more than to others, and I'm not even going to try to guess which, since I don't really know where I stand to begin with. Heck, maybe I'm the kind of people that it appeals to: those who can't be bothered to do some introspection. Or better yet, who do introspect, but never reach an actionable conclusion. But enough about that. The point is, if you feel that you might need a bit more order and structure in your life, or if you're annoyed that you can't stick to healthy or productive habits, then this might actually help. For me, there were at least a few takeaways. One thing that I'm pondering is how to design my environment to help me stick with a habit. And it's as easy as placing a glass full of water on the nightstand before you go to bed if you want to drink water first thing in the morning. Another cool trick is using down-time to do small chores. Like cleaning the toilet while you wait for the water in the shower to get warmer. You're already there in the bathroom and doing nothing, might as well make the most of it.That said, there are also some weaker parts. He does have a few moments throughout the book where he feels the need to do some life coaching, which, in my opinion, he could have scrapped. I always feel that funny moments are more memorable than personal confessions (and the confessions here never stop), so I would have liked more jokes instead. But, then again, not everybody can make jokes work, so, I guess that, here too, he plays to his strengths. (or avoids his weaknesses)Good book, easy read and just about the right length.

The concepts are really simple and straight-forward, yet profound in their ability to change lives. I plan to purchase it in eyeball-reading form so I can actually put these concepts into action since doing so in the car on my way to and from work doesn't really make sense.In my experience and with some of my recent reads on addiction and dealing with many addicts in my line of work, I can say that these concepts really make sense. I've worked with people breaking alcohol addiction and some of the same practices were used that are described here, such as brushing your teeth or drinking grapefruit juice when you have a craving. Atomic Habits doesn't tell you to brush your teeth or drink juice, but tells about the cues that cause us to fall back into habits.Habits govern so much that we don't even realize. I hear a pop of a can and suddenly I'm looking to grab a Dr. Pepper and that's just one of so many things I realize in my own life let alone those that I don't realize.Self-examination is tough, but I would highly recommend reading this book, especially if you are stuck in a rut and can't figure your way out. But even if not, it's good to take a look at how habits are affecting your day-to-day life. This quote is quite profound and describes, I believe, what I'm saying: “Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.”4.5 out of 5 stars (highly recommended)"

Deep Work was more impactful to me though as some things in Atomic Habits were repeated from other books I've read like The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg. Power of Habit was more so the importance and impact habits have on you, as oppose to Atomic Habits which I found more practical in the sense that how you can make or break productive or unproductive habits. It also reminded me of the Compound Effect by Darren Hardy because of how he talks a lot about how little changes in your daily routine can make a big impact down the line, and about compound interest.Notes:- Change your identity change your habits - not I’ll try and run, instead say I am a runner and I’m going for a run. Look at what you want and ask yourself what type of person would I have to be to get to that and adopt traits and habits that go with that type of person- Every goal has systems in place. It’s the systems that you can always adapt and change.

You just have to make the next action you take, be one that is an action you want your ideal person to take3) A 1% improvement a day, can lead to a 37x improvement at the end of the year!

97,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28266634-liza-fireman,4,"I really liked this book. It is very practical and interesting. It did remind me a little bit of The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business by Charles Duhigg. It included a lot less of the story telling, but included much of the advice of changing habits. It also reminded me of The Happiness Advantage: The Seven Principles of Positive Psychology That Fuel Success and Performance at Work by Shawn Achor. A really great book, that mentions adding friction to make it harder to go with bad habits (remove the remote control batteries, and it will probably make you think more about turning on the tv).  The author suggests that you should decide who is the person you want to be, and that habits make you who you are. Your habits shape your identity, and you can change your habits and identity (not sure that I am super happy with that phrasing, but there was much in the book that was really good, so I'll be willing to look away on this phrasing :)). I really loved his system: How to Create a Good HabitThe 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious.The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive.The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy.The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying.And:How to Break a Bad HabitInversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible.Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive.Inversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult.Inversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying.It is worth mentioning that James Clear had a really terrible accident in baseball, and a serious head injury. He had been hit in the face with a baseball bat, and got into a comma. But this injury probably had a part of who he is today. This injury was one of mine, and the experience taught me a critical lesson: changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits. With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible. His parents were no strangers to the hospital, since his sister had cancer a decade earlier. Oh my, poor parents.Clear puts an emphasis on starting, even with a little tiny easy thing. Habits for the most part is doing something that you started, whether it is sitting on the sofa, or going to the gym. Habits are like the entrance ramp to a highway. They lead you down a path and, before you know it, you’re speeding toward the next behavior. It seems to be easier to continue what you are already doing than to start doing something different. He gives the example of running starting with tying your running shoes.I really liked this book. Practical and nicely written, with some great advice. 4 stars. "

He was most eminently aggravated by this entire genre for being, as he used to like to say with poise: ""trash"". His sentiment regarding them seems to be pretty prevalent among many thinking people. I think there is a truth in the idea of seeing this genre as trashy, and a folly as well.While it certainty is the case that most books in this category are bereft of serious scholarship and deep thought, there are generally useful tidbits that can be gleaned regarding how to practically achieve a couple of your goals. Carnegie's advice may get you attacked by a mob, but in another context they may very well aid you into understanding people on a level that would never be mentioned in a psych 101 course. These books, are, in my view always practical. And on that note, I still read them even if at times their mediocre understanding of philosophy, science and history make my eyes roll back in my head.So? Atomic habits. Eh. This is a solid book, despite its lack of self awareness - as many people have come before clear and said the same thing in more articulate ways. A good resource for this is Maria popova's blog : https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03.... She has been writing about these ideas prob before duhigg' s power of habit. In short, clear contends that one should start with smaller goals, rather than massive ambitions. ANd by doing life little by little. That being, changing our individual habits, we will find ourselves gaining more control over our lives. As it is in fact the case that we are - in a sense what we do - it therefore is more accurately expressed 'we are what we do habitually.' Change your habits - change your lifeClear states at the end that the architecture of habits are broken down to two phases. We then must learn about ourselves and recondition our behaviors. 1. The problem phase  1a. cue (find a trigger/learn old triggers)1b.craving (impulse to do thing after trigger)2. Solution phase2a. response (respond to trigger)2b reward (receive reward for doing thing)I would like to take this time at the end of the review to quote a small part of the text which I found stimulating by its silliness.""In 1936 psychologist Kurt Lewin write a simple equation that makes a powerful statement: Behavior is a function of the person in their environment, or B= f(p,e)"". Im fairly certain that a well seasoned researcher of psychology would never write this pseudo mathematical sentence. This was ok. Recommended for:-people who like listening to Tony Robbins - those who want a run down of the concept of habit- those struggling to move who want an idea"
99,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"This was excellent. Full of common sense advice on how to change your habits, one tiny step at a time. The ideas are simple and easy to follow, and he gives concrete examples and even templates for things like habit tracking and evaluating your habits. James Clear also explains the psychology behind his system, sprinkled with interesting, but not too many, real life examples. For example, we are wired for immediate satisfaction, but most good habits have delayed gratification - so he suggests finding an immediate reward. Some simple techniques are habit stacking - i.e. connecting a new habit to an existing one, or the 2 minute rule - that a new habit should not take longer than two minutes. First, establish the habit, later refine or add to it. Very useful. I have listened to it, but ordered a copy and will review it in print, so I can make notes. Highly recommend to every procrastinator out there - of whom I am a major example."

The book has a plethora of real-life events that portray “Habits are like compound interest”. James started with his own-not-so-happy-incident from his life and how subsequently he went on to the quest of creating the Atomic Habits empire.The essence of the whole book is put into a nutshell of four life-defining rule:•	Make it Obvious (Cue)•	Make it Attractive (Craving)•	Make it Easy (Response)•	Make it Satisfying (Reward)To achieve big in life it’s not necessary that we do only big things. A small percentage of improvement on a daily basis can also achieve the same thing. One has to overcome his/her “Plateau of Latent Potential”- as the author suggests. It’s good to have goals in life but do not focus on goals rather accrue your potential to create a “belief system” to achieve that goal. Winners and Losers have the same goals but what differentiates them is “System” they followed to get the goal.Every rule begins with a spellbound example from the annals of successful history. Be it entertainment, sports, medicine, scholar – every example is so inter-related with the habit that it feels unbelievable that a minute habit can have a remarkable impact. James also gave few strategies to practice this in our daily life like “Habit Score Card”, “Habit Stacking”, “Habit Contract” and many more. One of my fav. concepts from the book is “The Goldilocks Rule”: It says, “The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty.”The amazing thing I liked in the book is how meticulously James observed the nuance in once behaviors. How one’s habit gets created and shaped in the society he/she lives, whom they talk, whom they listen, and what object they use. The book is not targeted only for a particular sect of society but it encapsulates the whole of mankind. I think this is the book one must have on their shelf."
104,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109681904-layla,4,"It was pretty educational and offered many insightful ways to improve upon yourself. It tells you how to build habbits that benefit you, and cut out ones that don't based on others experiences and what has proven to work for some people. I'm a pretty unmotivated person when it comes to building new habbits and following through with them so I might try some of these tips in the future. Even though I'm not going to say I completely enjoyed my self reading this book, as it was just a bunch of information rather than a story I can get lost in, but I did get something out of this which is important to me when reading a non-fiction book."
105,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65666930-atharva-amdekar,5,"I generally tend to avoid reading self-help books because I believe its more natural to learn from your own past experiences rather than someone else's, which is why I always found it difficult to relate to, and apply the lessons written by self-help authors. However, reading this book was certainly a different experience. The author provides a cogent, and a scientific approach, unlike the philosophical approach of most self-help books. He breaks down the formation/destruction of good/bad habits into easy-to-understand and easy-to-apply systematic components. This book also taught me a lot on how the human psyche works in tandem with our environment. He talks about how our brain is wired to overvalue radical changes in our behaviour as against the undervaluation of small changes over a longer period of time, which was the most important lesson I picked up from this book. A must-read for anyone who wants to form/break good/bad habits. However, I'd suggest to read only a few pages everyday so that you are able to apply those learnings as you go along. Reading this book like a story book and aiming to apply everything after completing it in its entirety will probably do you no good."

I started reading  Atomic Habits  on my Kindle and just 15% in I felt I had highlighted and underlined basically every line, so much so I had to go out and get a physical copy of the book so I could go through slowly. WHAT A BOOK! This is a must read book for everyone! Jame Clear really gets to the heart of what it takes to build healthy habits and what it takes to get rid of the unhealthy ones. I think everyone could benefit from reading this book and putting into practice the advice given. For me, I love how clear James Clear was in this book in the work that goes into forming healthy and getting rid of unhealthy habits. Clear offers practical advice on how to build these habits, in ways that aren't overwhelming. I love how feasible his suggests were and I look forward to putting them into practice.  It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.  This is a major thing for me. I get so caught up in having a defining moment that I lose sight of making the small improvements on a daily basis that leads to these defining moments. I liked that Clear focus on how you can tiny improvements on a daily basis that will lead to major improvements. Finally, if you are like me, I focus on the big goals... I get lost in trying to achieve that goal and I dont focus on what can lead to me achieving these goals. In Atomic Habits, James Clear talks about the process that leads to the goals and how we need to focus more on putting process and systems in place to achieve these goals. This is a solid read and I recommend this books to anyone who is struggling to put in place new healthy habits and get rid of unhealthy ones. Please grab a copy and change your life. "

If reading The Power of Habit makes us understand 'habit' better, Atomic Habits provides practical methods and solutions that are research-based.It's an easy to understand book/manual, with case studies and examples of real life people. At the end of each chapter, there's simplified notes for easy reference.If you want to step up your game on creating a disciplined and successful life, I suggest you go and read Atomic Habits.

Already putting it to use! Interestingly, it contradicts ""the willpower instinct"" in a few places (e.g. re whether you should hide cues for bad habits). I wonder who is right? Likely subjective.One drawback is that the author kept quoting the Dilbert guy in a role model way, which rubbed me the wrong way given his famous misogynistic rants...

114,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72021544-a-bibliophile-s-compendium,1,"The book is a rehash of other authors' work, skimmed off the top. There are useful basic ideas in the book but if you look at it closely, you can see that the author is lacking a real understanding of these concepts. He doesn't explore them in depth and his conclusions are based on what he's learned from reading and then applied to his own life. He experiments on himself and then concludes ""I did it, so it must be true"". For example he says ""Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last."" What about addiction? Everything we know about addiction clearly contradicts the above statement from Clear. He also says ""Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity."" Baseless bollocks with no scientific grounds. Sure, this maybe the case for him but he has absolutely no evidence to back-up to generalize this claim. I understand he might be coming from a good place, he clearly believes he is doing good but this work is undone by the large number of statements that are untested, unquestioned or just plain false based on the current scientific evidence. What I could tell from this book and his online presence is that he is very skilled at copy-writting / summarizing other people's work and at self-promotion. Even though he considers himself to be a writer, he is not. Again, he is a copy-writer, a marketer, not a scientist, not a writer. And I get how he might seem like a great starting point if this is the first time you're stumbling across these ideas. But I say, read more books from more reputable sources, backed-up but more than an audience of subscribers and then come and see how your really feel about this content. Or not, it's really your choice. If the book came from a different perspective I could have disregarded all of this and cherry picked the good. If he would have built it like ""this is my experience, this I what I've learned throughout my life through learning and experimentation, it might work for you"". But it wasn't written like this. It's written with certainty that everything he says is true, scientifically proven and applied to everyone. He attaches his opinions to scientific facts twisting into his own version of the truth. The two quotes alone should make you question his credibility but if you don't believe me, feel free to see for yourself.Overall, a lot of hype, not a lot of substance."
115,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16080726-sabin,4,"There's got to be something that this guy does right. It might just be that he’s found the proper mix of real world examples, easy to apply manual-like instructions and just the right amount of brain science to get his point across.Of course, now that I think about it, I guess that the cocktail he made here will appeal to certain types of personalities more than to others, and I'm not even going to try to guess which, since I don't really know where I stand to begin with. Heck, maybe I'm the kind of people that it appeals to: those who can't be bothered to do some introspection. Or better yet, who do introspect, but never reach an actionable conclusion. But enough about that. The point is, if you feel that you might need a bit more order and structure in your life, or if you're annoyed that you can't stick to healthy or productive habits, then this might actually help. For me, there were at least a few takeaways. One thing that I'm pondering is how to design my environment to help me stick with a habit. And it's as easy as placing a glass full of water on the nightstand before you go to bed if you want to drink water first thing in the morning. Another cool trick is using down-time to do small chores. Like cleaning the toilet while you wait for the water in the shower to get warmer. You're already there in the bathroom and doing nothing, might as well make the most of it.That said, there are also some weaker parts. He does have a few moments throughout the book where he feels the need to do some life coaching, which, in my opinion, he could have scrapped. I always feel that funny moments are more memorable than personal confessions (and the confessions here never stop), so I would have liked more jokes instead. But, then again, not everybody can make jokes work, so, I guess that, here too, he plays to his strengths. (or avoids his weaknesses)Good book, easy read and just about the right length.

The concepts are really simple and straight-forward, yet profound in their ability to change lives. I plan to purchase it in eyeball-reading form so I can actually put these concepts into action since doing so in the car on my way to and from work doesn't really make sense.In my experience and with some of my recent reads on addiction and dealing with many addicts in my line of work, I can say that these concepts really make sense. I've worked with people breaking alcohol addiction and some of the same practices were used that are described here, such as brushing your teeth or drinking grapefruit juice when you have a craving. Atomic Habits doesn't tell you to brush your teeth or drink juice, but tells about the cues that cause us to fall back into habits.Habits govern so much that we don't even realize. I hear a pop of a can and suddenly I'm looking to grab a Dr. Pepper and that's just one of so many things I realize in my own life let alone those that I don't realize.Self-examination is tough, but I would highly recommend reading this book, especially if you are stuck in a rut and can't figure your way out. But even if not, it's good to take a look at how habits are affecting your day-to-day life. This quote is quite profound and describes, I believe, what I'm saying: “Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.”4.5 out of 5 stars (highly recommended)"

Deep Work was more impactful to me though as some things in Atomic Habits were repeated from other books I've read like The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg. Power of Habit was more so the importance and impact habits have on you, as oppose to Atomic Habits which I found more practical in the sense that how you can make or break productive or unproductive habits. It also reminded me of the Compound Effect by Darren Hardy because of how he talks a lot about how little changes in your daily routine can make a big impact down the line, and about compound interest.Notes:- Change your identity change your habits - not I’ll try and run, instead say I am a runner and I’m going for a run. Look at what you want and ask yourself what type of person would I have to be to get to that and adopt traits and habits that go with that type of person- Every goal has systems in place.

I love how some of these productivity authors neglect to mention all the outside help they hire. It's like that other woman who suggested hiring an au pair for when your primary nanny is taking her vacation days. He also suggests doing things like paying for grocery delivery instead of going to the store to save time. He tells the story of one guy who paid his personal trainer $500 every time he forgot to log his food for the day.The real productivity hack seems to be to hire someone to do all the little day-to-day tasks for you so you can focus on other things.

A really great book, that mentions adding friction to make it harder to go with bad habits (remove the remote control batteries, and it will probably make you think more about turning on the tv).  The author suggests that you should decide who is the person you want to be, and that habits make you who you are. Your habits shape your identity, and you can change your habits and identity (not sure that I am super happy with that phrasing, but there was much in the book that was really good, so I'll be willing to look away on this phrasing :)). I really loved his system: How to Create a Good HabitThe 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious.The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive.The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy.The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying.And:How to Break a Bad HabitInversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible.Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive.Inversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult.Inversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying.It is worth mentioning that James Clear had a really terrible accident in baseball, and a serious head injury. He had been hit in the face with a baseball bat, and got into a comma. But this injury probably had a part of who he is today. This injury was one of mine, and the experience taught me a critical lesson: changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits. With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible. His parents were no strangers to the hospital, since his sister had cancer a decade earlier. Oh my, poor parents.Clear puts an emphasis on starting, even with a little tiny easy thing. Habits for the most part is doing something that you started, whether it is sitting on the sofa, or going to the gym. Habits are like the entrance ramp to a highway. They lead you down a path and, before you know it, you’re speeding toward the next behavior. It seems to be easier to continue what you are already doing than to start doing something different. He gives the example of running starting with tying your running shoes.I really liked this book. Practical and nicely written, with some great advice. 4 stars. "
128,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13717595-jake,2,"I once had a teacher who used to grumble about self help books under his breath. He was most eminently aggravated by this entire genre for being, as he used to like to say with poise: ""trash"". His sentiment regarding them seems to be pretty prevalent among many thinking people. I think there is a truth in the idea of seeing this genre as trashy, and a folly as well.While it certainty is the case that most books in this category are bereft of serious scholarship and deep thought, there are generally useful tidbits that can be gleaned regarding how to practically achieve a couple of your goals. Carnegie's advice may get you attacked by a mob, but in another context they may very well aid you into understanding people on a level that would never be mentioned in a psych 101 course. These books, are, in my view always practical. And on that note, I still read them even if at times their mediocre understanding of philosophy, science and history make my eyes roll back in my head.So? Atomic habits. Eh. This is a solid book, despite its lack of self awareness - as many people have come before clear and said the same thing in more articulate ways. A good resource for this is Maria popova's blog : https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03.... She has been writing about these ideas prob before duhigg' s power of habit. In short, clear contends that one should start with smaller goals, rather than massive ambitions. ANd by doing life little by little. That being, changing our individual habits, we will find ourselves gaining more control over our lives. As it is in fact the case that we are - in a sense what we do - it therefore is more accurately expressed 'we are what we do habitually.' Change your habits - change your lifeClear states at the end that the architecture of habits are broken down to two phases. We then must learn about ourselves and recondition our behaviors. 1. The problem phase  1a. cue (find a trigger/learn old triggers)1b.craving (impulse to do thing after trigger)2. Solution phase2a. response (respond to trigger)2b reward (receive reward for doing thing)I would like to take this time at the end of the review to quote a small part of the text which I found stimulating by its silliness.""In 1936 psychologist Kurt Lewin write a simple equation that makes a powerful statement: Behavior is a function of the person in their environment, or B= f(p,e)"". Im fairly certain that a well seasoned researcher of psychology would never write this pseudo mathematical sentence. This was ok. Recommended for:-people who like listening to Tony Robbins - those who want a run down of the concept of habit- those struggling to move who want an idea"
129,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"This was excellent. Full of common sense advice on how to change your habits, one tiny step at a time. The ideas are simple and easy to follow, and he gives concrete examples and even templates for things like habit tracking and evaluating your habits. James Clear also explains the psychology behind his system, sprinkled with interesting, but not too many, real life examples. For example, we are wired for immediate satisfaction, but most good habits have delayed gratification - so he suggests finding an immediate reward. Some simple techniques are habit stacking - i.e. connecting a new habit to an existing one, or the 2 minute rule - that a new habit should not take longer than two minutes. First, establish the habit, later refine or add to it. Very useful. I have listened to it, but ordered a copy and will review it in print, so I can make notes. Highly recommend to every procrastinator out there - of whom I am a major example."

The book has a plethora of real-life events that portray “Habits are like compound interest”. James started with his own-not-so-happy-incident from his life and how subsequently he went on to the quest of creating the Atomic Habits empire.The essence of the whole book is put into a nutshell of four life-defining rule:•	Make it Obvious (Cue)•	Make it Attractive (Craving)•	Make it Easy (Response)•	Make it Satisfying (Reward)To achieve big in life it’s not necessary that we do only big things. A small percentage of improvement on a daily basis can also achieve the same thing. One has to overcome his/her “Plateau of Latent Potential”- as the author suggests. It’s good to have goals in life but do not focus on goals rather accrue your potential to create a “belief system” to achieve that goal. Winners and Losers have the same goals but what differentiates them is “System” they followed to get the goal.Every rule begins with a spellbound example from the annals of successful history. Be it entertainment, sports, medicine, scholar – every example is so inter-related with the habit that it feels unbelievable that a minute habit can have a remarkable impact. James also gave few strategies to practice this in our daily life like “Habit Score Card”, “Habit Stacking”, “Habit Contract” and many more. One of my fav. concepts from the book is “The Goldilocks Rule”: It says, “The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty.”The amazing thing I liked in the book is how meticulously James observed the nuance in once behaviors. How one’s habit gets created and shaped in the society he/she lives, whom they talk, whom they listen, and what object they use. The book is not targeted only for a particular sect of society but it encapsulates the whole of mankind. I think this is the book one must have on their shelf."
134,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109681904-layla,4,"It was pretty educational and offered many insightful ways to improve upon yourself. It tells you how to build habbits that benefit you, and cut out ones that don't based on others experiences and what has proven to work for some people. I'm a pretty unmotivated person when it comes to building new habbits and following through with them so I might try some of these tips in the future. Even though I'm not going to say I completely enjoyed my self reading this book, as it was just a bunch of information rather than a story I can get lost in, but I did get something out of this which is important to me when reading a non-fiction book."
135,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65666930-atharva-amdekar,5,"I generally tend to avoid reading self-help books because I believe its more natural to learn from your own past experiences rather than someone else's, which is why I always found it difficult to relate to, and apply the lessons written by self-help authors. However, reading this book was certainly a different experience. The author provides a cogent, and a scientific approach, unlike the philosophical approach of most self-help books. He breaks down the formation/destruction of good/bad habits into easy-to-understand and easy-to-apply systematic components. This book also taught me a lot on how the human psyche works in tandem with our environment. He talks about how our brain is wired to overvalue radical changes in our behaviour as against the undervaluation of small changes over a longer period of time, which was the most important lesson I picked up from this book. A must-read for anyone who wants to form/break good/bad habits. However, I'd suggest to read only a few pages everyday so that you are able to apply those learnings as you go along. Reading this book like a story book and aiming to apply everything after completing it in its entirety will probably do you no good."

I started reading  Atomic Habits  on my Kindle and just 15% in I felt I had highlighted and underlined basically every line, so much so I had to go out and get a physical copy of the book so I could go through slowly. WHAT A BOOK! This is a must read book for everyone! Jame Clear really gets to the heart of what it takes to build healthy habits and what it takes to get rid of the unhealthy ones. I think everyone could benefit from reading this book and putting into practice the advice given. For me, I love how clear James Clear was in this book in the work that goes into forming healthy and getting rid of unhealthy habits. Clear offers practical advice on how to build these habits, in ways that aren't overwhelming. I love how feasible his suggests were and I look forward to putting them into practice.  It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.  This is a major thing for me. I get so caught up in having a defining moment that I lose sight of making the small improvements on a daily basis that leads to these defining moments. I liked that Clear focus on how you can tiny improvements on a daily basis that will lead to major improvements. Finally, if you are like me, I focus on the big goals... I get lost in trying to achieve that goal and I dont focus on what can lead to me achieving these goals. In Atomic Habits, James Clear talks about the process that leads to the goals and how we need to focus more on putting process and systems in place to achieve these goals. This is a solid read and I recommend this books to anyone who is struggling to put in place new healthy habits and get rid of unhealthy ones. Please grab a copy and change your life. "

If reading The Power of Habit makes us understand 'habit' better, Atomic Habits provides practical methods and solutions that are research-based.It's an easy to understand book/manual, with case studies and examples of real life people. At the end of each chapter, there's simplified notes for easy reference.If you want to step up your game on creating a disciplined and successful life, I suggest you go and read Atomic Habits.

Already putting it to use! Interestingly, it contradicts ""the willpower instinct"" in a few places (e.g. re whether you should hide cues for bad habits). I wonder who is right? Likely subjective.One drawback is that the author kept quoting the Dilbert guy in a role model way, which rubbed me the wrong way given his famous misogynistic rants...

144,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72021544-a-bibliophile-s-compendium,1,"The book is a rehash of other authors' work, skimmed off the top. There are useful basic ideas in the book but if you look at it closely, you can see that the author is lacking a real understanding of these concepts. He doesn't explore them in depth and his conclusions are based on what he's learned from reading and then applied to his own life. He experiments on himself and then concludes ""I did it, so it must be true"". For example he says ""Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last."" What about addiction? Everything we know about addiction clearly contradicts the above statement from Clear. He also says ""Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity."" Baseless bollocks with no scientific grounds. Sure, this maybe the case for him but he has absolutely no evidence to back-up to generalize this claim. I understand he might be coming from a good place, he clearly believes he is doing good but this work is undone by the large number of statements that are untested, unquestioned or just plain false based on the current scientific evidence. What I could tell from this book and his online presence is that he is very skilled at copy-writting / summarizing other people's work and at self-promotion. Even though he considers himself to be a writer, he is not. Again, he is a copy-writer, a marketer, not a scientist, not a writer. And I get how he might seem like a great starting point if this is the first time you're stumbling across these ideas. But I say, read more books from more reputable sources, backed-up but more than an audience of subscribers and then come and see how your really feel about this content. Or not, it's really your choice. If the book came from a different perspective I could have disregarded all of this and cherry picked the good. If he would have built it like ""this is my experience, this I what I've learned throughout my life through learning and experimentation, it might work for you"". But it wasn't written like this. It's written with certainty that everything he says is true, scientifically proven and applied to everyone. He attaches his opinions to scientific facts twisting into his own version of the truth. The two quotes alone should make you question his credibility but if you don't believe me, feel free to see for yourself.Overall, a lot of hype, not a lot of substance."
145,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16080726-sabin,4,"There's got to be something that this guy does right. It might just be that he’s found the proper mix of real world examples, easy to apply manual-like instructions and just the right amount of brain science to get his point across.Of course, now that I think about it, I guess that the cocktail he made here will appeal to certain types of personalities more than to others, and I'm not even going to try to guess which, since I don't really know where I stand to begin with. Heck, maybe I'm the kind of people that it appeals to: those who can't be bothered to do some introspection. Or better yet, who do introspect, but never reach an actionable conclusion. But enough about that. The point is, if you feel that you might need a bit more order and structure in your life, or if you're annoyed that you can't stick to healthy or productive habits, then this might actually help. For me, there were at least a few takeaways. One thing that I'm pondering is how to design my environment to help me stick with a habit. And it's as easy as placing a glass full of water on the nightstand before you go to bed if you want to drink water first thing in the morning. Another cool trick is using down-time to do small chores. Like cleaning the toilet while you wait for the water in the shower to get warmer. You're already there in the bathroom and doing nothing, might as well make the most of it.That said, there are also some weaker parts. He does have a few moments throughout the book where he feels the need to do some life coaching, which, in my opinion, he could have scrapped. I always feel that funny moments are more memorable than personal confessions (and the confessions here never stop), so I would have liked more jokes instead. But, then again, not everybody can make jokes work, so, I guess that, here too, he plays to his strengths. (or avoids his weaknesses)Good book, easy read and just about the right length.

The concepts are really simple and straight-forward, yet profound in their ability to change lives. I plan to purchase it in eyeball-reading form so I can actually put these concepts into action since doing so in the car on my way to and from work doesn't really make sense.In my experience and with some of my recent reads on addiction and dealing with many addicts in my line of work, I can say that these concepts really make sense. I've worked with people breaking alcohol addiction and some of the same practices were used that are described here, such as brushing your teeth or drinking grapefruit juice when you have a craving. Atomic Habits doesn't tell you to brush your teeth or drink juice, but tells about the cues that cause us to fall back into habits.Habits govern so much that we don't even realize. I hear a pop of a can and suddenly I'm looking to grab a Dr. Pepper and that's just one of so many things I realize in my own life let alone those that I don't realize.Self-examination is tough, but I would highly recommend reading this book, especially if you are stuck in a rut and can't figure your way out. But even if not, it's good to take a look at how habits are affecting your day-to-day life. This quote is quite profound and describes, I believe, what I'm saying: “Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.”4.5 out of 5 stars (highly recommended)"

Deep Work was more impactful to me though as some things in Atomic Habits were repeated from other books I've read like The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg. Power of Habit was more so the importance and impact habits have on you, as oppose to Atomic Habits which I found more practical in the sense that how you can make or break productive or unproductive habits. It also reminded me of the Compound Effect by Darren Hardy because of how he talks a lot about how little changes in your daily routine can make a big impact down the line, and about compound interest.Notes:- Change your identity change your habits - not I’ll try and run, instead say I am a runner and I’m going for a run.

I love how some of these productivity authors neglect to mention all the outside help they hire. It's like that other woman who suggested hiring an au pair for when your primary nanny is taking her vacation days. He also suggests doing things like paying for grocery delivery instead of going to the store to save time. He tells the story of one guy who paid his personal trainer $500 every time he forgot to log his food for the day.The real productivity hack seems to be to hire someone to do all the little day-to-day tasks for you so you can focus on other things.

This injury was one of mine, and the experience taught me a critical lesson: changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits. With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible. His parents were no strangers to the hospital, since his sister had cancer a decade earlier. Oh my, poor parents.Clear puts an emphasis on starting, even with a little tiny easy thing. Habits for the most part is doing something that you started, whether it is sitting on the sofa, or going to the gym. Habits are like the entrance ramp to a highway. They lead you down a path and, before you know it, you’re speeding toward the next behavior. It seems to be easier to continue what you are already doing than to start doing something different. He gives the example of running starting with tying your running shoes.I really liked this book. Practical and nicely written, with some great advice. 4 stars. "

He was most eminently aggravated by this entire genre for being, as he used to like to say with poise: ""trash"". His sentiment regarding them seems to be pretty prevalent among many thinking people. I think there is a truth in the idea of seeing this genre as trashy, and a folly as well.While it certainty is the case that most books in this category are bereft of serious scholarship and deep thought, there are generally useful tidbits that can be gleaned regarding how to practically achieve a couple of your goals. Carnegie's advice may get you attacked by a mob, but in another context they may very well aid you into understanding people on a level that would never be mentioned in a psych 101 course. These books, are, in my view always practical. And on that note, I still read them even if at times their mediocre understanding of philosophy, science and history make my eyes roll back in my head.So? Atomic habits. Eh. This is a solid book, despite its lack of self awareness - as many people have come before clear and said the same thing in more articulate ways. A good resource for this is Maria popova's blog : https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03.... She has been writing about these ideas prob before duhigg' s power of habit. In short, clear contends that one should start with smaller goals, rather than massive ambitions. ANd by doing life little by little. That being, changing our individual habits, we will find ourselves gaining more control over our lives. As it is in fact the case that we are - in a sense what we do - it therefore is more accurately expressed 'we are what we do habitually.' Change your habits - change your lifeClear states at the end that the architecture of habits are broken down to two phases. We then must learn about ourselves and recondition our behaviors. 1. The problem phase  1a. cue (find a trigger/learn old triggers)1b.craving (impulse to do thing after trigger)2. Solution phase2a. response (respond to trigger)2b reward (receive reward for doing thing)I would like to take this time at the end of the review to quote a small part of the text which I found stimulating by its silliness.""In 1936 psychologist Kurt Lewin write a simple equation that makes a powerful statement: Behavior is a function of the person in their environment, or B= f(p,e)"". Im fairly certain that a well seasoned researcher of psychology would never write this pseudo mathematical sentence. This was ok. Recommended for:-people who like listening to Tony Robbins - those who want a run down of the concept of habit- those struggling to move who want an idea"
159,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,5,"This was excellent. Full of common sense advice on how to change your habits, one tiny step at a time. The ideas are simple and easy to follow, and he gives concrete examples and even templates for things like habit tracking and evaluating your habits. James Clear also explains the psychology behind his system, sprinkled with interesting, but not too many, real life examples. For example, we are wired for immediate satisfaction, but most good habits have delayed gratification - so he suggests finding an immediate reward. Some simple techniques are habit stacking - i.e. connecting a new habit to an existing one, or the 2 minute rule - that a new habit should not take longer than two minutes. First, establish the habit, later refine or add to it. Very useful. I have listened to it, but ordered a copy and will review it in print, so I can make notes. Highly recommend to every procrastinator out there - of whom I am a major example."

The book has a plethora of real-life events that portray “Habits are like compound interest”. James started with his own-not-so-happy-incident from his life and how subsequently he went on to the quest of creating the Atomic Habits empire.The essence of the whole book is put into a nutshell of four life-defining rule:•	Make it Obvious (Cue)•	Make it Attractive (Craving)•	Make it Easy (Response)•	Make it Satisfying (Reward)To achieve big in life it’s not necessary that we do only big things. A small percentage of improvement on a daily basis can also achieve the same thing. One has to overcome his/her “Plateau of Latent Potential”- as the author suggests. It’s good to have goals in life but do not focus on goals rather accrue your potential to create a “belief system” to achieve that goal. Winners and Losers have the same goals but what differentiates them is “System” they followed to get the goal.Every rule begins with a spellbound example from the annals of successful history. Be it entertainment, sports, medicine, scholar – every example is so inter-related with the habit that it feels unbelievable that a minute habit can have a remarkable impact. James also gave few strategies to practice this in our daily life like “Habit Score Card”, “Habit Stacking”, “Habit Contract” and many more. One of my fav. concepts from the book is “The Goldilocks Rule”: It says, “The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty.”The amazing thing I liked in the book is how meticulously James observed the nuance in once behaviors. How one’s habit gets created and shaped in the society he/she lives, whom they talk, whom they listen, and what object they use. The book is not targeted only for a particular sect of society but it encapsulates the whole of mankind. I think this is the book one must have on their shelf."
164,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109681904-layla,4,"It was pretty educational and offered many insightful ways to improve upon yourself. It tells you how to build habbits that benefit you, and cut out ones that don't based on others experiences and what has proven to work for some people. I'm a pretty unmotivated person when it comes to building new habbits and following through with them so I might try some of these tips in the future. Even though I'm not going to say I completely enjoyed my self reading this book, as it was just a bunch of information rather than a story I can get lost in, but I did get something out of this which is important to me when reading a non-fiction book."
165,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65666930-atharva-amdekar,5,"I generally tend to avoid reading self-help books because I believe its more natural to learn from your own past experiences rather than someone else's, which is why I always found it difficult to relate to, and apply the lessons written by self-help authors. However, reading this book was certainly a different experience. The author provides a cogent, and a scientific approach, unlike the philosophical approach of most self-help books. He breaks down the formation/destruction of good/bad habits into easy-to-understand and easy-to-apply systematic components. This book also taught me a lot on how the human psyche works in tandem with our environment. He talks about how our brain is wired to overvalue radical changes in our behaviour as against the undervaluation of small changes over a longer period of time, which was the most important lesson I picked up from this book. A must-read for anyone who wants to form/break good/bad habits. However, I'd suggest to read only a few pages everyday so that you are able to apply those learnings as you go along. Reading this book like a story book and aiming to apply everything after completing it in its entirety will probably do you no good."

I started reading  Atomic Habits  on my Kindle and just 15% in I felt I had highlighted and underlined basically every line, so much so I had to go out and get a physical copy of the book so I could go through slowly. WHAT A BOOK! This is a must read book for everyone! Jame Clear really gets to the heart of what it takes to build healthy habits and what it takes to get rid of the unhealthy ones. I think everyone could benefit from reading this book and putting into practice the advice given. For me, I love how clear James Clear was in this book in the work that goes into forming healthy and getting rid of unhealthy habits. Clear offers practical advice on how to build these habits, in ways that aren't overwhelming. I love how feasible his suggests were and I look forward to putting them into practice.  It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.  This is a major thing for me. I get so caught up in having a defining moment that I lose sight of making the small improvements on a daily basis that leads to these defining moments. I liked that Clear focus on how you can tiny improvements on a daily basis that will lead to major improvements. Finally, if you are like me, I focus on the big goals... I get lost in trying to achieve that goal and I dont focus on what can lead to me achieving these goals. In Atomic Habits, James Clear talks about the process that leads to the goals and how we need to focus more on putting process and systems in place to achieve these goals. This is a solid read and I recommend this books to anyone who is struggling to put in place new healthy habits and get rid of unhealthy ones. Please grab a copy and change your life. "

If reading The Power of Habit makes us understand 'habit' better, Atomic Habits provides practical methods and solutions that are research-based.It's an easy to understand book/manual, with case studies and examples of real life people. At the end of each chapter, there's simplified notes for easy reference.If you want to step up your game on creating a disciplined and successful life, I suggest you go and read Atomic Habits.

Already putting it to use! Interestingly, it contradicts ""the willpower instinct"" in a few places (e.g. re whether you should hide cues for bad habits). I wonder who is right? Likely subjective.One drawback is that the author kept quoting the Dilbert guy in a role model way, which rubbed me the wrong way given his famous misogynistic rants...

174,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72021544-a-bibliophile-s-compendium,1,"The book is a rehash of other authors' work, skimmed off the top. There are useful basic ideas in the book but if you look at it closely, you can see that the author is lacking a real understanding of these concepts. He doesn't explore them in depth and his conclusions are based on what he's learned from reading and then applied to his own life. He experiments on himself and then concludes ""I did it, so it must be true"". For example he says ""Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last."" What about addiction? Everything we know about addiction clearly contradicts the above statement from Clear. He also says ""Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity."" Baseless bollocks with no scientific grounds. Sure, this maybe the case for him but he has absolutely no evidence to back-up to generalize this claim. I understand he might be coming from a good place, he clearly believes he is doing good but this work is undone by the large number of statements that are untested, unquestioned or just plain false based on the current scientific evidence. What I could tell from this book and his online presence is that he is very skilled at copy-writting / summarizing other people's work and at self-promotion. Even though he considers himself to be a writer, he is not. Again, he is a copy-writer, a marketer, not a scientist, not a writer. And I get how he might seem like a great starting point if this is the first time you're stumbling across these ideas. But I say, read more books from more reputable sources, backed-up but more than an audience of subscribers and then come and see how your really feel about this content. Or not, it's really your choice. If the book came from a different perspective I could have disregarded all of this and cherry picked the good. If he would have built it like ""this is my experience, this I what I've learned throughout my life through learning and experimentation, it might work for you"". But it wasn't written like this. It's written with certainty that everything he says is true, scientifically proven and applied to everyone. He attaches his opinions to scientific facts twisting into his own version of the truth. The two quotes alone should make you question his credibility but if you don't believe me, feel free to see for yourself.Overall, a lot of hype, not a lot of substance."
175,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16080726-sabin,4,"There's got to be something that this guy does right. It might just be that he’s found the proper mix of real world examples, easy to apply manual-like instructions and just the right amount of brain science to get his point across.Of course, now that I think about it, I guess that the cocktail he made here will appeal to certain types of personalities more than to others, and I'm not even going to try to guess which, since I don't really know where I stand to begin with. Heck, maybe I'm the kind of people that it appeals to: those who can't be bothered to do some introspection. Or better yet, who do introspect, but never reach an actionable conclusion. But enough about that. The point is, if you feel that you might need a bit more order and structure in your life, or if you're annoyed that you can't stick to healthy or productive habits, then this might actually help. For me, there were at least a few takeaways. One thing that I'm pondering is how to design my environment to help me stick with a habit. And it's as easy as placing a glass full of water on the nightstand before you go to bed if you want to drink water first thing in the morning. Another cool trick is using down-time to do small chores. Like cleaning the toilet while you wait for the water in the shower to get warmer. You're already there in the bathroom and doing nothing, might as well make the most of it.That said, there are also some weaker parts. He does have a few moments throughout the book where he feels the need to do some life coaching, which, in my opinion, he could have scrapped. I always feel that funny moments are more memorable than personal confessions (and the confessions here never stop), so I would have liked more jokes instead. But, then again, not everybody can make jokes work, so, I guess that, here too, he plays to his strengths. (or avoids his weaknesses)Good book, easy read and just about the right length.

The concepts are really simple and straight-forward, yet profound in their ability to change lives. I plan to purchase it in eyeball-reading form so I can actually put these concepts into action since doing so in the car on my way to and from work doesn't really make sense.In my experience and with some of my recent reads on addiction and dealing with many addicts in my line of work, I can say that these concepts really make sense. I've worked with people breaking alcohol addiction and some of the same practices were used that are described here, such as brushing your teeth or drinking grapefruit juice when you have a craving. Atomic Habits doesn't tell you to brush your teeth or drink juice, but tells about the cues that cause us to fall back into habits.Habits govern so much that we don't even realize. I hear a pop of a can and suddenly I'm looking to grab a Dr. Pepper and that's just one of so many things I realize in my own life let alone those that I don't realize.Self-examination is tough, but I would highly recommend reading this book, especially if you are stuck in a rut and can't figure your way out. But even if not, it's good to take a look at how habits are affecting your day-to-day life. This quote is quite profound and describes, I believe, what I'm saying: “Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.”4.5 out of 5 stars (highly recommended)"

Deep Work was more impactful to me though as some things in Atomic Habits were repeated from other books I've read like The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg. Power of Habit was more so the importance and impact habits have on you, as oppose to Atomic Habits which I found more practical in the sense that how you can make or break productive or unproductive habits. It also reminded me of the Compound Effect by Darren Hardy because of how he talks a lot about how little changes in your daily routine can make a big impact down the line, and about compound interest.Notes:- Change your identity change your habits - not I’ll try and run, instead say I am a runner and I’m going for a run.

I love how some of these productivity authors neglect to mention all the outside help they hire. It's like that other woman who suggested hiring an au pair for when your primary nanny is taking her vacation days. He also suggests doing things like paying for grocery delivery instead of going to the store to save time. He tells the story of one guy who paid his personal trainer $500 every time he forgot to log his food for the day.The real productivity hack seems to be to hire someone to do all the little day-to-day tasks for you so you can focus on other things.

It also reminded me of The Happiness Advantage: The Seven Principles of Positive Psychology That Fuel Success and Performance at Work by Shawn Achor. A really great book, that mentions adding friction to make it harder to go with bad habits (remove the remote control batteries, and it will probably make you think more about turning on the tv).  The author suggests that you should decide who is the person you want to be, and that habits make you who you are. Your habits shape your identity, and you can change your habits and identity (not sure that I am super happy with that phrasing, but there was much in the book that was really good, so I'll be willing to look away on this phrasing :)).

They lead you down a path and, before you know it, you’re speeding toward the next behavior. It seems to be easier to continue what you are already doing than to start doing something different. He gives the example of running starting with tying your running shoes.I really liked this book. Practical and nicely written, with some great advice. 4 stars. "

He was most eminently aggravated by this entire genre for being, as he used to like to say with poise: ""trash"". His sentiment regarding them seems to be pretty prevalent among many thinking people. I think there is a truth in the idea of seeing this genre as trashy, and a folly as well.While it certainty is the case that most books in this category are bereft of serious scholarship and deep thought, there are generally useful tidbits that can be gleaned regarding how to practically achieve a couple of your goals. Carnegie's advice may get you attacked by a mob, but in another context they may very well aid you into understanding people on a level that would never be mentioned in a psych 101 course. These books, are, in my view always practical. And on that note, I still read them even if at times their mediocre understanding of philosophy, science and history make my eyes roll back in my head.So? Atomic habits. Eh. This is a solid book, despite its lack of self awareness - as many people have come before clear and said the same thing in more articulate ways. A good resource for this is Maria popova's blog : https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03.... She has been writing about these ideas prob before duhigg' s power of habit. In short, clear contends that one should start with smaller goals, rather than massive ambitions. ANd by doing life little by little. That being, changing our individual habits, we will find ourselves gaining more control over our lives. As it is in fact the case that we are - in a sense what we do - it therefore is more accurately expressed 'we are what we do habitually.' Change your habits - change your lifeClear states at the end that the architecture of habits are broken down to two phases. We then must learn about ourselves and recondition our behaviors. 1. The problem phase  1a. cue (find a trigger/learn old triggers)1b.craving (impulse to do thing after trigger)2. Solution phase2a. response (respond to trigger)2b reward (receive reward for doing thing)I would like to take this time at the end of the review to quote a small part of the text which I found stimulating by its silliness.""In 1936 psychologist Kurt Lewin write a simple equation that makes a powerful statement: Behavior is a function of the person in their environment, or B= f(p,e)"". Im fairly certain that a well seasoned researcher of psychology would never write this pseudo mathematical sentence. This was ok.

The ideas are simple and easy to follow, and he gives concrete examples and even templates for things like habit tracking and evaluating your habits. James Clear also explains the psychology behind his system, sprinkled with interesting, but not too many, real life examples. For example, we are wired for immediate satisfaction, but most good habits have delayed gratification - so he suggests finding an immediate reward. Some simple techniques are habit stacking - i.e. connecting a new habit to an existing one, or the 2 minute rule - that a new habit should not take longer than two minutes. First, establish the habit, later refine or add to it. Very useful. I have listened to it, but ordered a copy and will review it in print, so I can make notes. Highly recommend to every procrastinator out there - of whom I am a major example."

The book has a plethora of real-life events that portray “Habits are like compound interest”. James started with his own-not-so-happy-incident from his life and how subsequently he went on to the quest of creating the Atomic Habits empire.The essence of the whole book is put into a nutshell of four life-defining rule:•	Make it Obvious (Cue)•	Make it Attractive (Craving)•	Make it Easy (Response)•	Make it Satisfying (Reward)To achieve big in life it’s not necessary that we do only big things. A small percentage of improvement on a daily basis can also achieve the same thing. One has to overcome his/her “Plateau of Latent Potential”- as the author suggests. It’s good to have goals in life but do not focus on goals rather accrue your potential to create a “belief system” to achieve that goal. Winners and Losers have the same goals but what differentiates them is “System” they followed to get the goal.Every rule begins with a spellbound example from the annals of successful history. Be it entertainment, sports, medicine, scholar – every example is so inter-related with the habit that it feels unbelievable that a minute habit can have a remarkable impact. James also gave few strategies to practice this in our daily life like “Habit Score Card”, “Habit Stacking”, “Habit Contract” and many more. One of my fav. concepts from the book is “The Goldilocks Rule”: It says, “The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty.”The amazing thing I liked in the book is how meticulously James observed the nuance in once behaviors. How one’s habit gets created and shaped in the society he/she lives, whom they talk, whom they listen, and what object they use. The book is not targeted only for a particular sect of society but it encapsulates the whole of mankind. I think this is the book one must have on their shelf."
194,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109681904-layla,4,"It was pretty educational and offered many insightful ways to improve upon yourself. It tells you how to build habbits that benefit you, and cut out ones that don't based on others experiences and what has proven to work for some people. I'm a pretty unmotivated person when it comes to building new habbits and following through with them so I might try some of these tips in the future. Even though I'm not going to say I completely enjoyed my self reading this book, as it was just a bunch of information rather than a story I can get lost in, but I did get something out of this which is important to me when reading a non-fiction book."
195,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65666930-atharva-amdekar,5,"I generally tend to avoid reading self-help books because I believe its more natural to learn from your own past experiences rather than someone else's, which is why I always found it difficult to relate to, and apply the lessons written by self-help authors. However, reading this book was certainly a different experience. The author provides a cogent, and a scientific approach, unlike the philosophical approach of most self-help books. He breaks down the formation/destruction of good/bad habits into easy-to-understand and easy-to-apply systematic components. This book also taught me a lot on how the human psyche works in tandem with our environment. He talks about how our brain is wired to overvalue radical changes in our behaviour as against the undervaluation of small changes over a longer period of time, which was the most important lesson I picked up from this book. A must-read for anyone who wants to form/break good/bad habits. However, I'd suggest to read only a few pages everyday so that you are able to apply those learnings as you go along. Reading this book like a story book and aiming to apply everything after completing it in its entirety will probably do you no good."

I started reading  Atomic Habits  on my Kindle and just 15% in I felt I had highlighted and underlined basically every line, so much so I had to go out and get a physical copy of the book so I could go through slowly. WHAT A BOOK! This is a must read book for everyone! Jame Clear really gets to the heart of what it takes to build healthy habits and what it takes to get rid of the unhealthy ones. I think everyone could benefit from reading this book and putting into practice the advice given. For me, I love how clear James Clear was in this book in the work that goes into forming healthy and getting rid of unhealthy habits. Clear offers practical advice on how to build these habits, in ways that aren't overwhelming. I love how feasible his suggests were and I look forward to putting them into practice.  It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.  This is a major thing for me. I get so caught up in having a defining moment that I lose sight of making the small improvements on a daily basis that leads to these defining moments. I liked that Clear focus on how you can tiny improvements on a daily basis that will lead to major improvements. Finally, if you are like me, I focus on the big goals... I get lost in trying to achieve that goal and I dont focus on what can lead to me achieving these goals. In Atomic Habits, James Clear talks about the process that leads to the goals and how we need to focus more on putting process and systems in place to achieve these goals. This is a solid read and I recommend this books to anyone who is struggling to put in place new healthy habits and get rid of unhealthy ones. Please grab a copy and change your life. "

If reading The Power of Habit makes us understand 'habit' better, Atomic Habits provides practical methods and solutions that are research-based.It's an easy to understand book/manual, with case studies and examples of real life people. At the end of each chapter, there's simplified notes for easy reference.If you want to step up your game on creating a disciplined and successful life, I suggest you go and read Atomic Habits.

Already putting it to use! Interestingly, it contradicts ""the willpower instinct"" in a few places (e.g. re whether you should hide cues for bad habits). I wonder who is right? Likely subjective.One drawback is that the author kept quoting the Dilbert guy in a role model way, which rubbed me the wrong way given his famous misogynistic rants...

204,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72021544-a-bibliophile-s-compendium,1,"The book is a rehash of other authors' work, skimmed off the top. There are useful basic ideas in the book but if you look at it closely, you can see that the author is lacking a real understanding of these concepts. He doesn't explore them in depth and his conclusions are based on what he's learned from reading and then applied to his own life. He experiments on himself and then concludes ""I did it, so it must be true"". For example he says ""Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last."" What about addiction? Everything we know about addiction clearly contradicts the above statement from Clear. He also says ""Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity."" Baseless bollocks with no scientific grounds. Sure, this maybe the case for him but he has absolutely no evidence to back-up to generalize this claim. I understand he might be coming from a good place, he clearly believes he is doing good but this work is undone by the large number of statements that are untested, unquestioned or just plain false based on the current scientific evidence. What I could tell from this book and his online presence is that he is very skilled at copy-writting / summarizing other people's work and at self-promotion. Even though he considers himself to be a writer, he is not. Again, he is a copy-writer, a marketer, not a scientist, not a writer. And I get how he might seem like a great starting point if this is the first time you're stumbling across these ideas. But I say, read more books from more reputable sources, backed-up but more than an audience of subscribers and then come and see how your really feel about this content. Or not, it's really your choice. If the book came from a different perspective I could have disregarded all of this and cherry picked the good. If he would have built it like ""this is my experience, this I what I've learned throughout my life through learning and experimentation, it might work for you"". But it wasn't written like this. It's written with certainty that everything he says is true, scientifically proven and applied to everyone. He attaches his opinions to scientific facts twisting into his own version of the truth. The two quotes alone should make you question his credibility but if you don't believe me, feel free to see for yourself.Overall, a lot of hype, not a lot of substance."
205,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16080726-sabin,4,"There's got to be something that this guy does right. It might just be that he’s found the proper mix of real world examples, easy to apply manual-like instructions and just the right amount of brain science to get his point across.Of course, now that I think about it, I guess that the cocktail he made here will appeal to certain types of personalities more than to others, and I'm not even going to try to guess which, since I don't really know where I stand to begin with. Heck, maybe I'm the kind of people that it appeals to: those who can't be bothered to do some introspection. Or better yet, who do introspect, but never reach an actionable conclusion. But enough about that. The point is, if you feel that you might need a bit more order and structure in your life, or if you're annoyed that you can't stick to healthy or productive habits, then this might actually help. For me, there were at least a few takeaways. One thing that I'm pondering is how to design my environment to help me stick with a habit. And it's as easy as placing a glass full of water on the nightstand before you go to bed if you want to drink water first thing in the morning. Another cool trick is using down-time to do small chores. Like cleaning the toilet while you wait for the water in the shower to get warmer. You're already there in the bathroom and doing nothing, might as well make the most of it.That said, there are also some weaker parts. He does have a few moments throughout the book where he feels the need to do some life coaching, which, in my opinion, he could have scrapped. I always feel that funny moments are more memorable than personal confessions (and the confessions here never stop), so I would have liked more jokes instead. But, then again, not everybody can make jokes work, so, I guess that, here too, he plays to his strengths. (or avoids his weaknesses)Good book, easy read and just about the right length.

The concepts are really simple and straight-forward, yet profound in their ability to change lives. I plan to purchase it in eyeball-reading form so I can actually put these concepts into action since doing so in the car on my way to and from work doesn't really make sense.In my experience and with some of my recent reads on addiction and dealing with many addicts in my line of work, I can say that these concepts really make sense. I've worked with people breaking alcohol addiction and some of the same practices were used that are described here, such as brushing your teeth or drinking grapefruit juice when you have a craving. Atomic Habits doesn't tell you to brush your teeth or drink juice, but tells about the cues that cause us to fall back into habits.Habits govern so much that we don't even realize. I hear a pop of a can and suddenly I'm looking to grab a Dr. Pepper and that's just one of so many things I realize in my own life let alone those that I don't realize.Self-examination is tough, but I would highly recommend reading this book, especially if you are stuck in a rut and can't figure your way out. But even if not, it's good to take a look at how habits are affecting your day-to-day life. This quote is quite profound and describes, I believe, what I'm saying: “Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.”4.5 out of 5 stars (highly recommended)"

Deep Work was more impactful to me though as some things in Atomic Habits were repeated from other books I've read like The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg. Power of Habit was more so the importance and impact habits have on you, as oppose to Atomic Habits which I found more practical in the sense that how you can make or break productive or unproductive habits. It also reminded me of the Compound Effect by Darren Hardy because of how he talks a lot about how little changes in your daily routine can make a big impact down the line, and about compound interest.Notes:- Change your identity change your habits - not I’ll try and run, instead say I am a runner and I’m going for a run. Look at what you want and ask yourself what type of person would I have to be to get to that and adopt traits and habits that go with that type of person- Every goal has systems in place.

This book is especially grating as it's filled with cute little platitudes like ""the same boiling water will soften a potato and harden an egg"". I already know how boiling water works, thanks, can we get to the part where you tell me something I haven't heard from seven other productivity books already?At one point Clear writes, ""I get my assistant to do this for me every week, but if you don't have an assistant..."" I love how some of these productivity authors neglect to mention all the outside help they hire. It's like that other woman who suggested hiring an au pair for when your primary nanny is taking her vacation days. He also suggests doing things like paying for grocery delivery instead of going to the store to save time. He tells the story of one guy who paid his personal trainer $500 every time he forgot to log his food for the day.The real productivity hack seems to be to hire someone to do all the little day-to-day tasks for you so you can focus on other things.

It did remind me a little bit of The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business by Charles Duhigg. It included a lot less of the story telling, but included much of the advice of changing habits. It also reminded me of The Happiness Advantage: The Seven Principles of Positive Psychology That Fuel Success and Performance at Work by Shawn Achor. A really great book, that mentions adding friction to make it harder to go with bad habits (remove the remote control batteries, and it will probably make you think more about turning on the tv).  The author suggests that you should decide who is the person you want to be, and that habits make you who you are. Your habits shape your identity, and you can change your habits and identity (not sure that I am super happy with that phrasing, but there was much in the book that was really good, so I'll be willing to look away on this phrasing :)).

He had been hit in the face with a baseball bat, and got into a comma. But this injury probably had a part of who he is today. This injury was one of mine, and the experience taught me a critical lesson: changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits. With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible. His parents were no strangers to the hospital, since his sister had cancer a decade earlier. Oh my, poor parents.Clear puts an emphasis on starting, even with a little tiny easy thing. Habits for the most part is doing something that you started, whether it is sitting on the sofa, or going to the gym. Habits are like the entrance ramp to a highway. They lead you down a path and, before you know it, you’re speeding toward the next behavior. It seems to be easier to continue what you are already doing than to start doing something different.

And on that note, I still read them even if at times their mediocre understanding of philosophy, science and history make my eyes roll back in my head.So? Atomic habits. Eh. This is a solid book, despite its lack of self awareness - as many people have come before clear and said the same thing in more articulate ways. A good resource for this is Maria popova's blog : https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03.... She has been writing about these ideas prob before duhigg' s power of habit. In short, clear contends that one should start with smaller goals, rather than massive ambitions. ANd by doing life little by little. That being, changing our individual habits, we will find ourselves gaining more control over our lives. As it is in fact the case that we are - in a sense what we do - it therefore is more accurately expressed 'we are what we do habitually.' Change your habits - change your lifeClear states at the end that the architecture of habits are broken down to two phases. We then must learn about ourselves and recondition our behaviors. 1. The problem phase  1a. cue (find a trigger/learn old triggers)1b.craving (impulse to do thing after trigger)2. Solution phase2a. response (respond to trigger)2b reward (receive reward for doing thing)I would like to take this time at the end of the review to quote a small part of the text which I found stimulating by its silliness.""In 1936 psychologist Kurt Lewin write a simple equation that makes a powerful statement: Behavior is a function of the person in their environment, or B= f(p,e)"". Im fairly certain that a well seasoned researcher of psychology would never write this pseudo mathematical sentence. This was ok. Recommended for:-people who like listening to Tony Robbins - those who want a run down of the concept of habit- those struggling to move who want an idea"

The ideas are simple and easy to follow, and he gives concrete examples and even templates for things like habit tracking and evaluating your habits. James Clear also explains the psychology behind his system, sprinkled with interesting, but not too many, real life examples. For example, we are wired for immediate satisfaction, but most good habits have delayed gratification - so he suggests finding an immediate reward. Some simple techniques are habit stacking - i.e. connecting a new habit to an existing one, or the 2 minute rule - that a new habit should not take longer than two minutes. First, establish the habit, later refine or add to it. Very useful. I have listened to it, but ordered a copy and will review it in print, so I can make notes. Highly recommend to every procrastinator out there - of whom I am a major example."

The book has a plethora of real-life events that portray “Habits are like compound interest”. James started with his own-not-so-happy-incident from his life and how subsequently he went on to the quest of creating the Atomic Habits empire.The essence of the whole book is put into a nutshell of four life-defining rule:•	Make it Obvious (Cue)•	Make it Attractive (Craving)•	Make it Easy (Response)•	Make it Satisfying (Reward)To achieve big in life it’s not necessary that we do only big things. A small percentage of improvement on a daily basis can also achieve the same thing. One has to overcome his/her “Plateau of Latent Potential”- as the author suggests. It’s good to have goals in life but do not focus on goals rather accrue your potential to create a “belief system” to achieve that goal. Winners and Losers have the same goals but what differentiates them is “System” they followed to get the goal.Every rule begins with a spellbound example from the annals of successful history. Be it entertainment, sports, medicine, scholar – every example is so inter-related with the habit that it feels unbelievable that a minute habit can have a remarkable impact. James also gave few strategies to practice this in our daily life like “Habit Score Card”, “Habit Stacking”, “Habit Contract” and many more. One of my fav. concepts from the book is “The Goldilocks Rule”: It says, “The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty.”The amazing thing I liked in the book is how meticulously James observed the nuance in once behaviors. How one’s habit gets created and shaped in the society he/she lives, whom they talk, whom they listen, and what object they use. The book is not targeted only for a particular sect of society but it encapsulates the whole of mankind. I think this is the book one must have on their shelf."
224,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109681904-layla,4,"It was pretty educational and offered many insightful ways to improve upon yourself. It tells you how to build habbits that benefit you, and cut out ones that don't based on others experiences and what has proven to work for some people. I'm a pretty unmotivated person when it comes to building new habbits and following through with them so I might try some of these tips in the future. Even though I'm not going to say I completely enjoyed my self reading this book, as it was just a bunch of information rather than a story I can get lost in, but I did get something out of this which is important to me when reading a non-fiction book."
225,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65666930-atharva-amdekar,5,"I generally tend to avoid reading self-help books because I believe its more natural to learn from your own past experiences rather than someone else's, which is why I always found it difficult to relate to, and apply the lessons written by self-help authors. However, reading this book was certainly a different experience. The author provides a cogent, and a scientific approach, unlike the philosophical approach of most self-help books. He breaks down the formation/destruction of good/bad habits into easy-to-understand and easy-to-apply systematic components. This book also taught me a lot on how the human psyche works in tandem with our environment. He talks about how our brain is wired to overvalue radical changes in our behaviour as against the undervaluation of small changes over a longer period of time, which was the most important lesson I picked up from this book. A must-read for anyone who wants to form/break good/bad habits. However, I'd suggest to read only a few pages everyday so that you are able to apply those learnings as you go along. Reading this book like a story book and aiming to apply everything after completing it in its entirety will probably do you no good."

I started reading  Atomic Habits  on my Kindle and just 15% in I felt I had highlighted and underlined basically every line, so much so I had to go out and get a physical copy of the book so I could go through slowly. WHAT A BOOK! This is a must read book for everyone! Jame Clear really gets to the heart of what it takes to build healthy habits and what it takes to get rid of the unhealthy ones. I think everyone could benefit from reading this book and putting into practice the advice given. For me, I love how clear James Clear was in this book in the work that goes into forming healthy and getting rid of unhealthy habits. Clear offers practical advice on how to build these habits, in ways that aren't overwhelming. I love how feasible his suggests were and I look forward to putting them into practice.  It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.  This is a major thing for me. I get so caught up in having a defining moment that I lose sight of making the small improvements on a daily basis that leads to these defining moments. I liked that Clear focus on how you can tiny improvements on a daily basis that will lead to major improvements. Finally, if you are like me, I focus on the big goals... I get lost in trying to achieve that goal and I dont focus on what can lead to me achieving these goals. In Atomic Habits, James Clear talks about the process that leads to the goals and how we need to focus more on putting process and systems in place to achieve these goals. This is a solid read and I recommend this books to anyone who is struggling to put in place new healthy habits and get rid of unhealthy ones. Please grab a copy and change your life. "

If reading The Power of Habit makes us understand 'habit' better, Atomic Habits provides practical methods and solutions that are research-based.It's an easy to understand book/manual, with case studies and examples of real life people. At the end of each chapter, there's simplified notes for easy reference.If you want to step up your game on creating a disciplined and successful life, I suggest you go and read Atomic Habits. But, do read The Power of Habit first. I feel that your habit journey will not be complete without reading these two books."

Already putting it to use! Interestingly, it contradicts ""the willpower instinct"" in a few places (e.g. re whether you should hide cues for bad habits). I wonder who is right? Likely subjective.One drawback is that the author kept quoting the Dilbert guy in a role model way, which rubbed me the wrong way given his famous misogynistic rants...

234,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72021544-a-bibliophile-s-compendium,1,"The book is a rehash of other authors' work, skimmed off the top. There are useful basic ideas in the book but if you look at it closely, you can see that the author is lacking a real understanding of these concepts. He doesn't explore them in depth and his conclusions are based on what he's learned from reading and then applied to his own life. He experiments on himself and then concludes ""I did it, so it must be true"". For example he says ""Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last."" What about addiction? Everything we know about addiction clearly contradicts the above statement from Clear. He also says ""Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity."" Baseless bollocks with no scientific grounds. Sure, this maybe the case for him but he has absolutely no evidence to back-up to generalize this claim. I understand he might be coming from a good place, he clearly believes he is doing good but this work is undone by the large number of statements that are untested, unquestioned or just plain false based on the current scientific evidence. What I could tell from this book and his online presence is that he is very skilled at copy-writting / summarizing other people's work and at self-promotion. Even though he considers himself to be a writer, he is not. Again, he is a copy-writer, a marketer, not a scientist, not a writer. And I get how he might seem like a great starting point if this is the first time you're stumbling across these ideas. But I say, read more books from more reputable sources, backed-up but more than an audience of subscribers and then come and see how your really feel about this content. Or not, it's really your choice. If the book came from a different perspective I could have disregarded all of this and cherry picked the good. If he would have built it like ""this is my experience, this I what I've learned throughout my life through learning and experimentation, it might work for you"". But it wasn't written like this. It's written with certainty that everything he says is true, scientifically proven and applied to everyone. He attaches his opinions to scientific facts twisting into his own version of the truth. The two quotes alone should make you question his credibility but if you don't believe me, feel free to see for yourself.Overall, a lot of hype, not a lot of substance."
235,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16080726-sabin,4,"There's got to be something that this guy does right. It might just be that he’s found the proper mix of real world examples, easy to apply manual-like instructions and just the right amount of brain science to get his point across.Of course, now that I think about it, I guess that the cocktail he made here will appeal to certain types of personalities more than to others, and I'm not even going to try to guess which, since I don't really know where I stand to begin with. Heck, maybe I'm the kind of people that it appeals to: those who can't be bothered to do some introspection. Or better yet, who do introspect, but never reach an actionable conclusion. But enough about that. The point is, if you feel that you might need a bit more order and structure in your life, or if you're annoyed that you can't stick to healthy or productive habits, then this might actually help. For me, there were at least a few takeaways. One thing that I'm pondering is how to design my environment to help me stick with a habit. And it's as easy as placing a glass full of water on the nightstand before you go to bed if you want to drink water first thing in the morning. Another cool trick is using down-time to do small chores. Like cleaning the toilet while you wait for the water in the shower to get warmer. You're already there in the bathroom and doing nothing, might as well make the most of it.That said, there are also some weaker parts. He does have a few moments throughout the book where he feels the need to do some life coaching, which, in my opinion, he could have scrapped. I always feel that funny moments are more memorable than personal confessions (and the confessions here never stop), so I would have liked more jokes instead. But, then again, not everybody can make jokes work, so, I guess that, here too, he plays to his strengths. (or avoids his weaknesses)Good book, easy read and just about the right length.

The concepts are really simple and straight-forward, yet profound in their ability to change lives. I plan to purchase it in eyeball-reading form so I can actually put these concepts into action since doing so in the car on my way to and from work doesn't really make sense.In my experience and with some of my recent reads on addiction and dealing with many addicts in my line of work, I can say that these concepts really make sense. I've worked with people breaking alcohol addiction and some of the same practices were used that are described here, such as brushing your teeth or drinking grapefruit juice when you have a craving. Atomic Habits doesn't tell you to brush your teeth or drink juice, but tells about the cues that cause us to fall back into habits.Habits govern so much that we don't even realize. I hear a pop of a can and suddenly I'm looking to grab a Dr. Pepper and that's just one of so many things I realize in my own life let alone those that I don't realize.Self-examination is tough, but I would highly recommend reading this book, especially if you are stuck in a rut and can't figure your way out. But even if not, it's good to take a look at how habits are affecting your day-to-day life. This quote is quite profound and describes, I believe, what I'm saying: “Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.”4.5 out of 5 stars (highly recommended)"

Deep Work was more impactful to me though as some things in Atomic Habits were repeated from other books I've read like The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg. Power of Habit was more so the importance and impact habits have on you, as oppose to Atomic Habits which I found more practical in the sense that how you can make or break productive or unproductive habits. It also reminded me of the Compound Effect by Darren Hardy because of how he talks a lot about how little changes in your daily routine can make a big impact down the line, and about compound interest.Notes:- Change your identity change your habits - not I’ll try and run, instead say I am a runner and I’m going for a run. Look at what you want and ask yourself what type of person would I have to be to get to that and adopt traits and habits that go with that type of person- Every goal has systems in place.

All I want is a productive little audiobook to listen to while I work, helpfully filled with tips to improve my life. All I get is priviledged white people recycling the same old advice over and over. This book is especially grating as it's filled with cute little platitudes like ""the same boiling water will soften a potato and harden an egg"". I already know how boiling water works, thanks, can we get to the part where you tell me something I haven't heard from seven other productivity books already?At one point Clear writes, ""I get my assistant to do this for me every week, but if you don't have an assistant..."" I love how some of these productivity authors neglect to mention all the outside help they hire. It's like that other woman who suggested hiring an au pair for when your primary nanny is taking her vacation days. He also suggests doing things like paying for grocery delivery instead of going to the store to save time. He tells the story of one guy who paid his personal trainer $500 every time he forgot to log his food for the day.The real productivity hack seems to be to hire someone to do all the little day-to-day tasks for you so you can focus on other things.

It did remind me a little bit of The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business by Charles Duhigg. It included a lot less of the story telling, but included much of the advice of changing habits. It also reminded me of The Happiness Advantage: The Seven Principles of Positive Psychology That Fuel Success and Performance at Work by Shawn Achor. A really great book, that mentions adding friction to make it harder to go with bad habits (remove the remote control batteries, and it will probably make you think more about turning on the tv).  The author suggests that you should decide who is the person you want to be, and that habits make you who you are. Your habits shape your identity, and you can change your habits and identity (not sure that I am super happy with that phrasing, but there was much in the book that was really good, so I'll be willing to look away on this phrasing :)).

He had been hit in the face with a baseball bat, and got into a comma. But this injury probably had a part of who he is today. This injury was one of mine, and the experience taught me a critical lesson: changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits. With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible. His parents were no strangers to the hospital, since his sister had cancer a decade earlier. Oh my, poor parents.Clear puts an emphasis on starting, even with a little tiny easy thing. Habits for the most part is doing something that you started, whether it is sitting on the sofa, or going to the gym. Habits are like the entrance ramp to a highway. They lead you down a path and, before you know it, you’re speeding toward the next behavior. It seems to be easier to continue what you are already doing than to start doing something different.

The ideas are simple and easy to follow, and he gives concrete examples and even templates for things like habit tracking and evaluating your habits. James Clear also explains the psychology behind his system, sprinkled with interesting, but not too many, real life examples. For example, we are wired for immediate satisfaction, but most good habits have delayed gratification - so he suggests finding an immediate reward. Some simple techniques are habit stacking - i.e. connecting a new habit to an existing one, or the 2 minute rule - that a new habit should not take longer than two minutes. First, establish the habit, later refine or add to it. Very useful. I have listened to it, but ordered a copy and will review it in print, so I can make notes. Highly recommend to every procrastinator out there - of whom I am a major example."

The book has a plethora of real-life events that portray “Habits are like compound interest”. James started with his own-not-so-happy-incident from his life and how subsequently he went on to the quest of creating the Atomic Habits empire.The essence of the whole book is put into a nutshell of four life-defining rule:•	Make it Obvious (Cue)•	Make it Attractive (Craving)•	Make it Easy (Response)•	Make it Satisfying (Reward)To achieve big in life it’s not necessary that we do only big things. A small percentage of improvement on a daily basis can also achieve the same thing. One has to overcome his/her “Plateau of Latent Potential”- as the author suggests. It’s good to have goals in life but do not focus on goals rather accrue your potential to create a “belief system” to achieve that goal. Winners and Losers have the same goals but what differentiates them is “System” they followed to get the goal.Every rule begins with a spellbound example from the annals of successful history. Be it entertainment, sports, medicine, scholar – every example is so inter-related with the habit that it feels unbelievable that a minute habit can have a remarkable impact. James also gave few strategies to practice this in our daily life like “Habit Score Card”, “Habit Stacking”, “Habit Contract” and many more. One of my fav. concepts from the book is “The Goldilocks Rule”: It says, “The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty.”The amazing thing I liked in the book is how meticulously James observed the nuance in once behaviors. How one’s habit gets created and shaped in the society he/she lives, whom they talk, whom they listen, and what object they use. The book is not targeted only for a particular sect of society but it encapsulates the whole of mankind. I think this is the book one must have on their shelf."
254,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109681904-layla,4,"It was pretty educational and offered many insightful ways to improve upon yourself. It tells you how to build habbits that benefit you, and cut out ones that don't based on others experiences and what has proven to work for some people. I'm a pretty unmotivated person when it comes to building new habbits and following through with them so I might try some of these tips in the future. Even though I'm not going to say I completely enjoyed my self reading this book, as it was just a bunch of information rather than a story I can get lost in, but I did get something out of this which is important to me when reading a non-fiction book."

However, reading this book was certainly a different experience. The author provides a cogent, and a scientific approach, unlike the philosophical approach of most self-help books. He breaks down the formation/destruction of good/bad habits into easy-to-understand and easy-to-apply systematic components. This book also taught me a lot on how the human psyche works in tandem with our environment. He talks about how our brain is wired to overvalue radical changes in our behaviour as against the undervaluation of small changes over a longer period of time, which was the most important lesson I picked up from this book. A must-read for anyone who wants to form/break good/bad habits. However, I'd suggest to read only a few pages everyday so that you are able to apply those learnings as you go along. Reading this book like a story book and aiming to apply everything after completing it in its entirety will probably do you no good."

I started reading  Atomic Habits  on my Kindle and just 15% in I felt I had highlighted and underlined basically every line, so much so I had to go out and get a physical copy of the book so I could go through slowly. WHAT A BOOK! This is a must read book for everyone! Jame Clear really gets to the heart of what it takes to build healthy habits and what it takes to get rid of the unhealthy ones. I think everyone could benefit from reading this book and putting into practice the advice given. For me, I love how clear James Clear was in this book in the work that goes into forming healthy and getting rid of unhealthy habits. Clear offers practical advice on how to build these habits, in ways that aren't overwhelming. I love how feasible his suggests were and I look forward to putting them into practice.  It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.  This is a major thing for me. I get so caught up in having a defining moment that I lose sight of making the small improvements on a daily basis that leads to these defining moments. I liked that Clear focus on how you can tiny improvements on a daily basis that will lead to major improvements. Finally, if you are like me, I focus on the big goals... I get lost in trying to achieve that goal and I dont focus on what can lead to me achieving these goals. In Atomic Habits, James Clear talks about the process that leads to the goals and how we need to focus more on putting process and systems in place to achieve these goals. This is a solid read and I recommend this books to anyone who is struggling to put in place new healthy habits and get rid of unhealthy ones. Please grab a copy and change your life. "

If reading The Power of Habit makes us understand 'habit' better, Atomic Habits provides practical methods and solutions that are research-based.It's an easy to understand book/manual, with case studies and examples of real life people. At the end of each chapter, there's simplified notes for easy reference.If you want to step up your game on creating a disciplined and successful life, I suggest you go and read Atomic Habits. But, do read The Power of Habit first. I feel that your habit journey will not be complete without reading these two books."

Already putting it to use! Interestingly, it contradicts ""the willpower instinct"" in a few places (e.g. re whether you should hide cues for bad habits). I wonder who is right? Likely subjective.One drawback is that the author kept quoting the Dilbert guy in a role model way, which rubbed me the wrong way given his famous misogynistic rants...

264,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72021544-a-bibliophile-s-compendium,1,"The book is a rehash of other authors' work, skimmed off the top. There are useful basic ideas in the book but if you look at it closely, you can see that the author is lacking a real understanding of these concepts. He doesn't explore them in depth and his conclusions are based on what he's learned from reading and then applied to his own life. He experiments on himself and then concludes ""I did it, so it must be true"". For example he says ""Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last."" What about addiction? Everything we know about addiction clearly contradicts the above statement from Clear. He also says ""Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity."" Baseless bollocks with no scientific grounds. Sure, this maybe the case for him but he has absolutely no evidence to back-up to generalize this claim. I understand he might be coming from a good place, he clearly believes he is doing good but this work is undone by the large number of statements that are untested, unquestioned or just plain false based on the current scientific evidence. What I could tell from this book and his online presence is that he is very skilled at copy-writting / summarizing other people's work and at self-promotion. Even though he considers himself to be a writer, he is not. Again, he is a copy-writer, a marketer, not a scientist, not a writer. And I get how he might seem like a great starting point if this is the first time you're stumbling across these ideas. But I say, read more books from more reputable sources, backed-up but more than an audience of subscribers and then come and see how your really feel about this content. Or not, it's really your choice. If the book came from a different perspective I could have disregarded all of this and cherry picked the good. If he would have built it like ""this is my experience, this I what I've learned throughout my life through learning and experimentation, it might work for you"". But it wasn't written like this. It's written with certainty that everything he says is true, scientifically proven and applied to everyone. He attaches his opinions to scientific facts twisting into his own version of the truth. The two quotes alone should make you question his credibility but if you don't believe me, feel free to see for yourself.Overall, a lot of hype, not a lot of substance."
265,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16080726-sabin,4,"There's got to be something that this guy does right. It might just be that he’s found the proper mix of real world examples, easy to apply manual-like instructions and just the right amount of brain science to get his point across.Of course, now that I think about it, I guess that the cocktail he made here will appeal to certain types of personalities more than to others, and I'm not even going to try to guess which, since I don't really know where I stand to begin with. Heck, maybe I'm the kind of people that it appeals to: those who can't be bothered to do some introspection. Or better yet, who do introspect, but never reach an actionable conclusion. But enough about that. The point is, if you feel that you might need a bit more order and structure in your life, or if you're annoyed that you can't stick to healthy or productive habits, then this might actually help. For me, there were at least a few takeaways. One thing that I'm pondering is how to design my environment to help me stick with a habit. And it's as easy as placing a glass full of water on the nightstand before you go to bed if you want to drink water first thing in the morning. Another cool trick is using down-time to do small chores. Like cleaning the toilet while you wait for the water in the shower to get warmer. You're already there in the bathroom and doing nothing, might as well make the most of it.That said, there are also some weaker parts. He does have a few moments throughout the book where he feels the need to do some life coaching, which, in my opinion, he could have scrapped. I always feel that funny moments are more memorable than personal confessions (and the confessions here never stop), so I would have liked more jokes instead. But, then again, not everybody can make jokes work, so, I guess that, here too, he plays to his strengths. (or avoids his weaknesses)Good book, easy read and just about the right length.

The concepts are really simple and straight-forward, yet profound in their ability to change lives. I plan to purchase it in eyeball-reading form so I can actually put these concepts into action since doing so in the car on my way to and from work doesn't really make sense.In my experience and with some of my recent reads on addiction and dealing with many addicts in my line of work, I can say that these concepts really make sense. I've worked with people breaking alcohol addiction and some of the same practices were used that are described here, such as brushing your teeth or drinking grapefruit juice when you have a craving. Atomic Habits doesn't tell you to brush your teeth or drink juice, but tells about the cues that cause us to fall back into habits.Habits govern so much that we don't even realize. I hear a pop of a can and suddenly I'm looking to grab a Dr. Pepper and that's just one of so many things I realize in my own life let alone those that I don't realize.Self-examination is tough, but I would highly recommend reading this book, especially if you are stuck in a rut and can't figure your way out. But even if not, it's good to take a look at how habits are affecting your day-to-day life. This quote is quite profound and describes, I believe, what I'm saying: “Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity.”4.5 out of 5 stars (highly recommended)"

Deep Work was more impactful to me though as some things in Atomic Habits were repeated from other books I've read like The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg. Power of Habit was more so the importance and impact habits have on you, as oppose to Atomic Habits which I found more practical in the sense that how you can make or break productive or unproductive habits. It also reminded me of the Compound Effect by Darren Hardy because of how he talks a lot about how little changes in your daily routine can make a big impact down the line, and about compound interest.Notes:- Change your identity change your habits - not I’ll try and run, instead say I am a runner and I’m going for a run.

This book is especially grating as it's filled with cute little platitudes like ""the same boiling water will soften a potato and harden an egg"". I already know how boiling water works, thanks, can we get to the part where you tell me something I haven't heard from seven other productivity books already?At one point Clear writes, ""I get my assistant to do this for me every week, but if you don't have an assistant..."" I love how some of these productivity authors neglect to mention all the outside help they hire. It's like that other woman who suggested hiring an au pair for when your primary nanny is taking her vacation days. He also suggests doing things like paying for grocery delivery instead of going to the store to save time. He tells the story of one guy who paid his personal trainer $500 every time he forgot to log his food for the day.The real productivity hack seems to be to hire someone to do all the little day-to-day tasks for you so you can focus on other things.

It did remind me a little bit of The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business by Charles Duhigg. It included a lot less of the story telling, but included much of the advice of changing habits. It also reminded me of The Happiness Advantage: The Seven Principles of Positive Psychology That Fuel Success and Performance at Work by Shawn Achor. A really great book, that mentions adding friction to make it harder to go with bad habits (remove the remote control batteries, and it will probably make you think more about turning on the tv).  The author suggests that you should decide who is the person you want to be, and that habits make you who you are. Your habits shape your identity, and you can change your habits and identity (not sure that I am super happy with that phrasing, but there was much in the book that was really good, so I'll be willing to look away on this phrasing :)).

He had been hit in the face with a baseball bat, and got into a comma. But this injury probably had a part of who he is today. This injury was one of mine, and the experience taught me a critical lesson: changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits. With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible. His parents were no strangers to the hospital, since his sister had cancer a decade earlier. Oh my, poor parents.Clear puts an emphasis on starting, even with a little tiny easy thing. Habits for the most part is doing something that you started, whether it is sitting on the sofa, or going to the gym. Habits are like the entrance ramp to a highway. They lead you down a path and, before you know it, you’re speeding toward the next behavior. It seems to be easier to continue what you are already doing than to start doing something different.

I think there is a truth in the idea of seeing this genre as trashy, and a folly as well.While it certainty is the case that most books in this category are bereft of serious scholarship and deep thought, there are generally useful tidbits that can be gleaned regarding how to practically achieve a couple of your goals. Carnegie's advice may get you attacked by a mob, but in another context they may very well aid you into understanding people on a level that would never be mentioned in a psych 101 course.

Some simple techniques are habit stacking - i.e. connecting a new habit to an existing one, or the 2 minute rule - that a new habit should not take longer than two minutes. First, establish the habit, later refine or add to it. Very useful. I have listened to it, but ordered a copy and will review it in print, so I can make notes. Highly recommend to every procrastinator out there - of whom I am a major example."

However, a lot of this information could have been condensed into a much shorter work. There was a lot of rehashing in this book and repeating of ideas. "

The book has a plethora of real-life events that portray “Habits are like compound interest”. James started with his own-not-so-happy-incident from his life and how subsequently he went on to the quest of creating the Atomic Habits empire.The essence of the whole book is put into a nutshell of four life-defining rule:•	Make it Obvious (Cue)•	Make it Attractive (Craving)•	Make it Easy (Response)•	Make it Satisfying (Reward)To achieve big in life it’s not necessary that we do only big things. A small percentage of improvement on a daily basis can also achieve the same thing. One has to overcome his/her “Plateau of Latent Potential”- as the author suggests. It’s good to have goals in life but do not focus on goals rather accrue your potential to create a “belief system” to achieve that goal. Winners and Losers have the same goals but what differentiates them is “System” they followed to get the goal.Every rule begins with a spellbound example from the annals of successful history. Be it entertainment, sports, medicine, scholar – every example is so inter-related with the habit that it feels unbelievable that a minute habit can have a remarkable impact. James also gave few strategies to practice this in our daily life like “Habit Score Card”, “Habit Stacking”, “Habit Contract” and many more. One of my fav. concepts from the book is “The Goldilocks Rule”: It says, “The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty.”The amazing thing I liked in the book is how meticulously James observed the nuance in once behaviors. How one’s habit gets created and shaped in the society he/she lives, whom they talk, whom they listen, and what object they use. The book is not targeted only for a particular sect of society but it encapsulates the whole of mankind. I think this is the book one must have on their shelf."
284,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109681904-layla,4,"It was pretty educational and offered many insightful ways to improve upon yourself. It tells you how to build habbits that benefit you, and cut out ones that don't based on others experiences and what has proven to work for some people. I'm a pretty unmotivated person when it comes to building new habbits and following through with them so I might try some of these tips in the future. Even though I'm not going to say I completely enjoyed my self reading this book, as it was just a bunch of information rather than a story I can get lost in, but I did get something out of this which is important to me when reading a non-fiction book."
285,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65666930-atharva-amdekar,5,"I generally tend to avoid reading self-help books because I believe its more natural to learn from your own past experiences rather than someone else's, which is why I always found it difficult to relate to, and apply the lessons written by self-help authors. However, reading this book was certainly a different experience. The author provides a cogent, and a scientific approach, unlike the philosophical approach of most self-help books. He breaks down the formation/destruction of good/bad habits into easy-to-understand and easy-to-apply systematic components. This book also taught me a lot on how the human psyche works in tandem with our environment. He talks about how our brain is wired to overvalue radical changes in our behaviour as against the undervaluation of small changes over a longer period of time, which was the most important lesson I picked up from this book. A must-read for anyone who wants to form/break good/bad habits. However, I'd suggest to read only a few pages everyday so that you are able to apply those learnings as you go along. Reading this book like a story book and aiming to apply everything after completing it in its entirety will probably do you no good."

I started reading  Atomic Habits  on my Kindle and just 15% in I felt I had highlighted and underlined basically every line, so much so I had to go out and get a physical copy of the book so I could go through slowly. WHAT A BOOK! This is a must read book for everyone! Jame Clear really gets to the heart of what it takes to build healthy habits and what it takes to get rid of the unhealthy ones. I think everyone could benefit from reading this book and putting into practice the advice given. For me, I love how clear James Clear was in this book in the work that goes into forming healthy and getting rid of unhealthy habits. Clear offers practical advice on how to build these habits, in ways that aren't overwhelming. I love how feasible his suggests were and I look forward to putting them into practice.  It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis.  This is a major thing for me. I get so caught up in having a defining moment that I lose sight of making the small improvements on a daily basis that leads to these defining moments. I liked that Clear focus on how you can tiny improvements on a daily basis that will lead to major improvements. Finally, if you are like me, I focus on the big goals... I get lost in trying to achieve that goal and I dont focus on what can lead to me achieving these goals. In Atomic Habits, James Clear talks about the process that leads to the goals and how we need to focus more on putting process and systems in place to achieve these goals. This is a solid read and I recommend this books to anyone who is struggling to put in place new healthy habits and get rid of unhealthy ones. Please grab a copy and change your life. "

If reading The Power of Habit makes us understand 'habit' better, Atomic Habits provides practical methods and solutions that are research-based.It's an easy to understand book/manual, with case studies and examples of real life people. At the end of each chapter, there's simplified notes for easy reference.If you want to step up your game on creating a disciplined and successful life, I suggest you go and read Atomic Habits. But, do read The Power of Habit first. I feel that your habit journey will not be complete without reading these two books."
288,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19771675-kara,5,"Immediately want to flip back through it so I don't forget anything. Lots of practical advice, tons of references. Already putting it to use! Interestingly, it contradicts ""the willpower instinct"" in a few places (e.g. re whether you should hide cues for bad habits). I wonder who is right? Likely subjective.One drawback is that the author kept quoting the Dilbert guy in a role model way, which rubbed me the wrong way given his famous misogynistic rants... Not sure that's someone I really want to emulate or hear about."
289,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73128729-emma-bostian,5,"This is the second time I’ve read Atomic Habits in one year. And in all honesty I didn’t think I could possibly love it any more than the first time around. But I was sorely mistaken. The first go-around I listened to the audio book, which, while fantastic, doesn’t have the same effect as reading the physical copy with the diagrams. 11/10 would recommend. "

It's an atomic bomb for anybody who wants to improve by eliminating bad habits and introducing constructive ones into their lives. Good deal of its usefulness is in clear steps outlined, that you need to take for fantastic results. That shouldn't be hard, because of strong believability factor due to the fact the book is very convincing in making you realize the power of compounding interest when it comes to stacking the good habits. In other words, just keep on keeping on and showing up."

294,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72021544-a-bibliophile-s-compendium,1,"The book is a rehash of other authors' work, skimmed off the top. There are useful basic ideas in the book but if you look at it closely, you can see that the author is lacking a real understanding of these concepts. He doesn't explore them in depth and his conclusions are based on what he's learned from reading and then applied to his own life. He experiments on himself and then concludes ""I did it, so it must be true"". For example he says ""Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last."" What about addiction? Everything we know about addiction clearly contradicts the above statement from Clear. He also says ""Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity."" Baseless bollocks with no scientific grounds. Sure, this maybe the case for him but he has absolutely no evidence to back-up to generalize this claim. I understand he might be coming from a good place, he clearly believes he is doing good but this work is undone by the large number of statements that are untested, unquestioned or just plain false based on the current scientific evidence. What I could tell from this book and his online presence is that he is very skilled at copy-writting / summarizing other people's work and at self-promotion. Even though he considers himself to be a writer, he is not. Again, he is a copy-writer, a marketer, not a scientist, not a writer. And I get how he might seem like a great starting point if this is the first time you're stumbling across these ideas. But I say, read more books from more reputable sources, backed-up but more than an audience of subscribers and then come and see how your really feel about this content. Or not, it's really your choice. If the book came from a different perspective I could have disregarded all of this and cherry picked the good. If he would have built it like ""this is my experience, this I what I've learned throughout my life through learning and experimentation, it might work for you"". But it wasn't written like this. It's written with certainty that everything he says is true, scientifically proven and applied to everyone. He attaches his opinions to scientific facts twisting into his own version of the truth. The two quotes alone should make you question his credibility but if you don't believe me, feel free to see for yourself.Overall, a lot of hype, not a lot of substance."
295,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16080726-sabin,4,"There's got to be something that this guy does right. It might just be that he’s found the proper mix of real world examples, easy to apply manual-like instructions and just the right amount of brain science to get his point across.Of course, now that I think about it, I guess that the cocktail he made here will appeal to certain types of personalities more than to others, and I'm not even going to try to guess which, since I don't really know where I stand to begin with. Heck, maybe I'm the kind of people that it appeals to: those who can't be bothered to do some introspection. Or better yet, who do introspect, but never reach an actionable conclusion. But enough about that. The point is, if you feel that you might need a bit more order and structure in your life, or if you're annoyed that you can't stick to healthy or productive habits, then this might actually help. For me, there were at least a few takeaways. One thing that I'm pondering is how to design my environment to help me stick with a habit. And it's as easy as placing a glass full of water on the nightstand before you go to bed if you want to drink water first thing in the morning. Another cool trick is using down-time to do small chores. Like cleaning the toilet while you wait for the water in the shower to get warmer. You're already there in the bathroom and doing nothing, might as well make the most of it.That said, there are also some weaker parts. He does have a few moments throughout the book where he feels the need to do some life coaching, which, in my opinion, he could have scrapped. I always feel that funny moments are more memorable than personal confessions (and the confessions here never stop), so I would have liked more jokes instead. But, then again, not everybody can make jokes work, so, I guess that, here too, he plays to his strengths. (or avoids his weaknesses)Good book, easy read and just about the right length. Now I’ve got to find a good place to put some weights so I can stumble over them in the morning. (#workoutgoals)"
296,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25399319-martin-georgiev,5,"Great book containing ideas that we are all aware of but need to hear and act upon. The author tells interesting and relevant stories while mixing in some research on the topic. There are occasional unusual tips and tricks for habit formation and continuity. The system is quite rigid and similar to the one found in ""The Power of Habit"". I was not particularly happy about the constant links to his website but that might have been due to the Audiobook version I was using. Strong recommendation for anyone!"
297,0735211299,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24820576-scott-barngrover,5,A life changing book. I was lucky to get an advanced copy. James gives great advice on how to build good habits and how to break bad ones. He gives very interesting real life examples and charts that explain his points in an entertaining way. Each chapter has a summary and there is an overall summary of the key principles (laws). I highly recommend this book.
