The book is ostensibly about the future of mankind, but really is a means of highlighting how current trends in science, technology, humanity etc may progress and asks if that's really how we want things to go. It's philosophy. That big question that has been posed throughout the ages: how should we live? He makes clear that his hypotheses are only potential ways the future might unfold, but the text comes across as a warning as much as anything else.For me, the most interesting and thought-provoking was his argument for the better treatment of animals. While we have placed ourselves at the top of the species ladder, new advents in technology may bring about computer technologies which replace us in the number one spot. Considering we may well end up in the unenviable position of the underdog, perhaps we should take more care of those who, like us, may well depend on the goodwill of this higher in the chain. Not only that, modern technology has increasingly allowed us to understand the emotional and intellectual complexity of animals in a way that should make it difficult to treat them as lesser beings. This is an issue that has been playing on my mind for some time. It seems like every week now we are getting news reports of another animal ripped from its habitat for a selfie and dying as a result. Pictures of intensive farming that have animals in cages so small they can't lay down. My social media newsfeed of animals mistreated, dumped, abused, given no more thought than a piece of trash. Harari is a vegan and his specific set of beliefs come across in the text. Yet, as a current meat eater, it is becoming increasingly difficult to justify my position. I don't know what to do that can help and the book doesn't offer any concrete plans for change, but it has added another dimension to the considerations I have been struggling with myself.Overall though, it is Harari's style which is the most engaging. I rushed though this book because even the most complex issues are dealt with in accessible language and an approachable tone. It's fun and despite the subject matter, doesn't take itself too seriously. It felt like the starting point of a conversation, somewhat controversial of course, but isn't that the best way to get a debate going?Many thanks to Yuval Noah Harari, Random House/Vintage, and Netgalley for this copy in exchange for an honest review."

2,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,"Homo ObsoletusThe audacious first act, Sapiens, ended with a wild and apocalyptic prophesy - that the Sapiens were cooking up the next epochal revolution that will overshadow the previous three: the cognitive, agricultural and scientific/industrial revolutions. Home Deus, the second act, is the full exploration of that prophesy. Both Sapiens and Homo Deus are compulsory reading in my book, even though the macro-history presented is plenty vulnerable to all sorts of attacks. But then, it might be better to think of these as works of philosophy and not of history. Just like Sapiens is not a History, Home Deus is not a prophesy, both are explorations. This line can be taken as the transition line that links the first book with the second one:“Having raised humanity above the beastly level of survival struggles, we will now aim to upgrade humans into gods, and turn Homo sapiens into Homo deus.”The old enemies of mankind— plague, famine and war—are now under control. Except for the potentially restrictive energy constraint, Sapiens has very little standing in our way now. The result is that the Sapiens are becoming more and more God-like, Harari says, and one is forced to pause and reflect: by any previous standards of our history, are we not already Gods? Have we not already exceeded most wild power fantasies? Well yes, but even more God-like attributes are coming: cheating death and creating new life being primary.And along with this march towards the godlike we are marching towards being machine-like too, as we outsource more and more of our internal algorithms to better data-based external algorithms. And the march is relentless, Homo Deus is taking birth before our eyes. The tomorrow is already upon us, and so forth.However, just like the previous three revolutions that infused the Sapiens with power, this revolution too will come at a price, the price of a ratcheting up of inequality. The new Gods will be the techno-super-rich. BTW, reading Harari is good motivation to work on getting rich faster: he hints at a possibility that anyone who is rich enough to afford it, some 50 years into the future, should be able to buy proxy-immortality. And it will probably be a window that closes quickly, since the super-rich would soon take over the monopoly on immortality. So if you are rich enough at the right point in time, then you can be part of Olympus too. That might not be a deal many would want to miss out on… There is one more catch: as technology takes over most of the functions, even the godlike sapiens will find themselves stuck in a universe devoid of real meaning. Bulk of humanity will have no economic, social or cultural purpose since anything we can do our new creations would be able to do even better. “Organisms are algorithms,” and the new algorithms will be so much better than the imperfect ones we are made of. As Bill Gates asked in his article about the book, “What If People Run Out of Things to Do?” We will be stuck in an immortal meaninglessness, our own creations clearly our betters. We will need a new religion to make sense of all this, since the powerful combo of Humanism+Science will not work in world where the sanctity of being Human has lost meaning. Harari feels that “Dataism” will be the religion that will fill the avoid left by Humanism. The whole of Humanity, the Earth, and maybe the entire Universe will become servants to data - a huge data-processing system, the eternal all-knowing Atman. And serving this goal will be the only meaningful pursuit left for us. Immortal, All-powerful, Obsolete: this is the future of the Sapiens."
3,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31791908-nir,2,"Harari is a fantastic historian: he writes effortlessly and fascinatingly about historic trends, and has a great big picture perspective of the revolutions and contexts of historical progression.Harari, however, is not a good futurologist and an absolutely terrible cognitive scientist. Being educated in Cognitive Science and technology myself, all I can say, with the utmost respect I can offer to a fellow Israeli, is that he's full of shit.Homo Deus is an attempt to make a sequel to the wildly popular (and actually quite good) ""From Animals into Gods"" - its main thesis is that in the 21st century, liberal humanism would progress into ""techno humanism""; and that humanity's main efforts would be to upgrade humans into some bizarre godlike cyborg entity. He focuses on some aspects of modern progress (e.g. genetic engineering) and extrapolates completely insane uses. An example of a claim that he makes: In the near future, the efforts of medical science would be tuned to upgrading the rich rather than healing the diseases of the poor.His underlying zeal for a hunter gatherer sociological eco-utopia notwithstanding - this is bullshit, and focuses on a remote obscure threat rather than a very real threat that's already here: If there's a threat to modern society from modern medical science, it's is the personalization of medicine, rather than ""upgrades"". That is, drugs would be concocted to be maximally efficient according to a genotype. This is already happening at a very rough scale (for instance, there are drugs that are more effective on people of African American descent) - but in the near future, rather than upgrade themselves, the rich people would simply have far more effective cancer treatment because they'd be able to afford genotyping and personal medicine.If the cyborg-upgrade part sounds to you like a bad synopsis of a Neal Stephenson novel, you're absolutely right. Let's all jack into the Matrix now! Needless to say, the views have the grounding in scientific and research reality that a SciFi fanfic about Kirk banging Uhura has, and it is written with the same brain addling juvenile exuberance.Read the first book of his; avoid the second."
4,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27788046-sean-barrs,4,"Homo Deus is not quite as factual and cohesive as Sapiens. It falls into the realm of speculation rather than trying to organise and make sense of the world. Sapiens was fantastic because it was almost like a novelisation of human history. It was dramatic and loaded with exciting revelations about what makes us human. It discussed where we came from and where we are now. It was a thought provoking, an exceedingly intelligent piece of writing. With this book Harari looks to the future, to where we may go and how we may get there. And here Harari’s opinion comes across very strongly. He examines our current practices regarding technology and animals. We advance scientifically, but not emotionally or spiritually. We continue to make the same mistakes as we destroy the natural world and ruin our planet. Like me, Harari is a vegan and he is disgusted with current practice. He does not offer an idealistic view of the future (one a vegan would wish for) but instead discusses what will happen if we continue with our erroneous ways. And for me, this took the book to an entirely new level. It became thoughtful, critical and totally necessary. 

“This is the best reason to learn history: not in order to predict the future, but to free yourself of the past and imagine alternative destinies. Of course this is not total freedom – we cannot avoid being shaped by the past. But some freedom is better than none.”

 He looks at animals, about what we truly know about them. They are not so different from us, and the way we treat them is deplorable. I could write essays on this subject; I am beyond bitter about it. I’m angry. I’m frustrated. And above all I am so deeply sad. My heart is broken every day because humanity is so terribly unjust to those it deems beneath them. And here Harari adds another element, he considers what would happen if we became a “lesser” lifeform. With the progress in technology and genetic engineering, it is not to far to suggest that computers could replace us or some form of superhuman. So, in a way, we should not act all high and mighty because one day we may be in a very different situation. I don’t find it too hard to believe.I do not doubt that these two books have the potential to change how you think about the world. They will open your eyes to issues you may never have thought about. They’re not to be missed. FBR | Twitter | Facebook | Insta | Academia"

In pursuit of health, happiness and power, humans will gradually change first one of their features and then another, and another, until they will no longer be human.” ― Yuval Noah Harari, Homo Deus: A Brief History of TomorrowHarari takes us, with this continuation to his blockbuster book Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, from the past to the future. This book shares a lot of the same limitations of the previous book. But because ""speculation"" is inherent in writing about the future, Harari's jumps are easier to forgive when talking about tomorrow than when talking about today. I'm a diabetic and have an insulin pump and I've thought of myself, only partially in jest, as a early, unsophisticated, cyborg the last ten years. I walk around with my iphone plugged into my ears, my artificial pancreas plugged into my thigh, my sensor for my pump plugged into my stomach. It isn't very neat. We have miles to go before all of this technology becomes aesthetically amazing, and loses all the wires and clunky functionality, but it still gives me pause about the future. My friend's Tesla drives by itself, big data seems able to predict what I will buy next, my smart phone really is smart. Perhaps we are all surfing towards some Omega Point. I have a friend who is a Transhumanist and it has been interesting to hear him discuss the values and virtues of Transhumanism. I'm a little more hesitant. I'm no Luddite, but I DO worry about these big technological/cultural/commercial shifts. Will technology make Homo Sapiens the next Homo Neanderthalensis? Will these gains through AI, technology, genetic modification, etc., be well-thought-out? Harari hedges by saying he doesn't know what the future brings (If he did, perhaps we should just join his church), but is only using this discussion to suggest the type of ethical and moral and even survival discussions we SHOULD probably be having. As we incrementally crawl towards some form of technological singularity, perhaps we need to give pause to not just the benefits, but costs of self-driving cars and sex robots."

7,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This is a powerful book by a truly insightful author. I recently read Harari's previous great book, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, and I enjoyed this one just as much. There is so much packed into Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow, that it is hard to do justice to the book in a review. Yuval Harari has such a unique insight into how the world turns. He is sometimes very blunt, but he ""tells it like he sees it."" The first two-thirds of the book is devoted to a description of how the humanist philosophy developed, while the last third is about how humanism may very well fall to the wayside in the not-too-distant future.In the beginning of the book, Harari describes two new human agendas. The first is how humans attempt to extend their lifetimes, and the second is to increase happiness. The goal is to upgrade homo sapiens into homo deus. That is, the desire to re-engineer our bodies and minds, escape old age, death and misery. Basically, to attain divinity. Harari gives numerous examples of how were technologies developed to aid ill or handicapped people, and then were borrowed to help ""normal"" healthy people; prosthetics, bionics, Viagra, memory aid drugs, plastic surgery, and genetic engineering. (In 2000, a baby girl was born with genetic inheritance from three parents; nuclear genes from mother and father, and mitochondrial DNA from another woman! A year later, the U.S. government banned this special treatment, but the U.K. has since approved it.)Harari contends that historians study the past, not in order to repeat it, or to foretell the future, but to be liberated from it. He gives a marvelous example of the history of the grass lawn. He writes that the best reason to study history is not to predict the future, but to ""free yourself of the past and imagine alternative destinies.""Harari has some interesting insights into the founding of modern religions. He writes that they were founded when humans switched from hunting/foraging to agriculture. A central point of the religions was to give humans dominion over all animals, in order to justify their domestication and superiority, and to justify the terrible suffering humans cause for animals. The agricultural revolution was both an economic and a religious revolution, used to justify brutal exploitation of animals. Agricultural societies also started treating some classes of people as property. I wonder, though, didn't pre-agricultural societies practice slavery? When I try to do some simple online research in this subject, it seems like Harari might be correct; slavery was established to mimic the domestication of animals. And, the agricultural revolution was bad for humans in other ways, as well. A peasant in 1850 in China or Britain had a worse life than an archaic hunter-gatherer, from the point of view of diet and hygiene.Harari has some unique insights into the dichotomy between religion and science. He describes science as a new ""religion"" that replaced theist religions with humanist religions, replacing gods with humans. The hatred of monotheists for the theory of evolution is inspired by the lack of scientific evidence for a human soul. A soul has no parts, and evolution operates through incremental changes to various parts of a whole. But, both religion and science, in theory at least, are both devoted to the truth. But since their truths are different they seem doomed to clash. However, since neither religion nor science really care much about truth, they can coexist. Religion is mostly interested in social order and structure, while science is mostly interested in power. That is, the power to cure disease, fight war and produce food. So, since religion and science prefer order and power over truth, they ""make good bedfellows.""Modernity is a simple deal based on a contract: Humans agree to give up meaning in exchange for power. Plagues, droughts and wars have no cosmic meaning to modern humanism, but we have the power to eradicate them. Paradise does not await us after death, but we have the power, in principle, to create paradise here on Earth. Modernity is based on the belief that growth is essential. Growth is the supreme value. Because avarice and greed help to fuel growth, they are encouraged. Traditional religions offer no alternative to liberalism because they are reactive instead of creative. This wasn't always true. During the Middle Ages, Christian monasteries were among the most advanced centers for innovations--Harari lists a number of their innovations. But today religions look to scriptures for answer. But scriptures are no longer a source of creativity, as they say nothing about modern technologies such as genetic engineering or artificial intelligence. Harari describes three different possible futures for humanism. In one of these, liberalism may die out as technology displaces humans. The masses will lose their economic and military importance. Harari suggests that ""Dataism"" may appear as a new religion. Dataism advances the first truly new value in nearly 200 years; the value of freedom of information. Dataism is firmly entrenched in its two mother disciplines, computer science and biology. Organisms are seen by scientists as data-processing systems. The stock market is the most powerful of all data processing systems, and centralized government is one of the worst. Capitalism defeated Communism during the Cold War, not because it is more ethical or because individual liberties are sacred, but because in times of rapid technological change, distributed processing systems work better than centralized systems.Humanists rely on feelings to make important decisions, and these feelings evolved over millions of years. But often our feelings are just irrational and wrong. Computer algorithms can surpass feelings in making good decisions. So, the humanist recommendation to ""get in touch with your feelings"" may not he given in the future. Perhaps, meaning in life will not lie in our experiences, until they are shared with others, through social media. And, these social media will analyze our experiences, and be able to give expert advice on important decisions. Harari gives some pretty good evidence that this trend may come to pass.I do want to quibble with some numbers that Harari proposes. He writes that the one billion cars owned around the world could be reduced to 50 million, if they were jointly owned and operated autonomously. People could share rides. However, people want to commute to work in cars all at the same time. They sit in parking lots at work and at home because people have no need for them during work hours and overnight. But this is perhaps a minor point in Harari's argument. Many people will pooh-pooh much of what Harari has to say. But, it is all extremely thought-provoking. I have just scratched the surface of this book. I highly recommend it to all open-minded people who are not afraid to think a bit differently about the meaning of life, about our political structures, and the future."
8,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may,4,"Excellent again. Harari is fast becoming one of my favourite writers.I didn't love  Homo Deus quite as much as  Sapiens, but I think that's because the history Harari takes us through in the latter really does read like a very compelling novel. This book explores different themes and theories about the future of humanity - relating to aging, technological advancements, etc. - which makes it not as cohesive. Still, though, very interesting. He really knows how to break down complex concepts so everyone can understand them."
9,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39575951-helen-2-0,5,"Obviously I need to get a copy of Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind because I loved this book. I can't claim to be well-read in the topic of Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow, so I'm definitely biased in my opinion that Harari is a genius. Every few pages my copy has lengthy passages highlighted, brilliant bits I just knew I would want to reference when I pitched this book to family and friends later on. In Homo Deus, Harari holds that now that humanity has all but solved the mammoth problems plaguing it before the 21st century - disease, famine, and violence - it will turn to a new agenda, namely attaining happiness, immortality, and divinity. This is what the blurb will tell you, but the book addresses many more topics beyond the above. The author writes about our potential future in terms of our recent and ancient past (he is, after all, first and foremost a historian). He explains how humans distinguished themselves from the animal world and came to recognize the human experience and economic growth as the ultimate powers of the recent centuries. Harari then turns to look at where the unstoppable tide of technology and progress may take us in a few decades - whether intelligent algorithms and a genetically upgraded superhuman elite may make ordinary humans obsolete. His ideas, put starkly, may sound like far-fetched science fiction, but Harari supports his assertions with historical and current evidence as well as deep insights that make his predictions seem chillingly close to prophecy. Even though he states that Homo Deus is meant to help readers explore all possible future routes of humankind, the book still induced an ominous feeling in me the whole way. One of my favorite passages concerns the belief in a potential scientific ""Noah's Ark"" which will deliver the rich and social elite from detrimental future effects of climate change, leaving the poor masses to deal with the fallout: 
Even if bad comes to worse and science cannot hold off the deluge, engineers could still build a hi-tech Noah's Ark for the upper caste, while leaving billions of others to drown. The belief in this hi-tech Ark is currently one of the biggest threats to the future of humankind and of the entire ecosystem. People who believe in the hi-tech Ark should not be put in charge of the global ecology, for the same reason that people who belive in a heavenly afterlife should not be given nuclear weapons.
 Touché.And one of the best ""food for thought"" snippets, in a chapter discussing (among other things) the moral implications of farming animals: 
If and when computer programs attain superhuman intelligence and unprecedented power, should we begin valuing these programs more than we value humans? Would it be okay, for example, for an artificial intelligence to exploit humans and even kill them to further its own needs and desires? If it should never be allowed to do that, despite its superior intelligence and power, why is it ethical for humans to exploit and kill pigs?
All that being said, the book does have a tendency to ramble a bit. Harari hammers his main points into the reader through numerous repetitions and returns. There are 50 page chapters in Homo Deus, elaborating on and illustrating one single-sentence argument. However, lots of the evidence the author presents is interesting in itself - often it was a historical case applicable to current events - so it never gets boring."
10,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59458347-petrik,3,"3.5/5 starsNot as good as Homo Sapiens but Homo Deus did provide me with additional informative knowledge and intriguing speculations told in an engaging and thought-provoking style.

“People are usually afraid of change because they fear the unknown. But the single greatest constant of history is that everything changes.”

I will first say that Harari is a good writer, he really knows how to make interesting topics more compelling and he also kept me focused on information that would’ve been boring to read usually. Frankly speaking, there were indeed some sections in Part II—liberalism—that in my opinion was super dull and dry to read, but Part 1 and Part 3 of the book was superb; I found the majority of my attention grabbed by the way Harari discussed topics that evidently relevant in our society. Unlike Homo Sapiens which mostly dealt with facts and how humanity progressed—or stay the same—from the past up to the present, in Homo Deus Harari tells and speculates what comes after; what kind of futures humanity might be facing or going for based on the data and theories gathered from our history and present timeframe. There are so many topics that I could talk about here, but I feel like talking too much would diminish the benefit of reading this book itself; I’ll refrain from doing that and gives a bit of my opinion regarding one of the topics discussed: the power and curses of social media.

“In the past, censorship worked by blocking the flow of information. In the twenty-first century, censorship works by flooding people with irrelevant information. [...] In ancient times having power meant having access to data. Today having power means knowing what to ignore.”

The passage above speaks a loud volume to the way humanity lives these days. You want to know about something? Search it on Google. You want to see beautiful places you’ve never been to or bookish pictures? Search it on Instagram. Do you want to learn how to do something? Search it on Youtube or Pinterest. Book reviews? Search it on Goodreads/Amazon. There are many more examples, but the conclusion is that we live in an era where we have incredibly easy access to information that wasn’t possible to gain more than a decade ago. There’s no doubt that internet and social media have changed the way we live completely and there’s simply no going back from here. I’ve seen and heard some people complained about the way their privacy and data are used, and yes, their reasons are valid and I do believe that privacy of each individual should be respected. But this isn’t actually a hard-to-find knowledge; majority of social media users know that they’re giving away their data when they used their applications. Knowing all the risk of data sacrificial, we arrive at the most important question:Will we/they continue to use the applications? Most likely yes, the convenience and strength given by social media are simply way too powerful to ignore. I don’t have many issues against social media; most of my lives are enriched because of it. you’re reading this—and my other—review through social media, after all. However, it truly saddens me to see how many people have their lives destroyed by social media. Depression is at an all-time high; jealousy sparked easily; we constantly feel unsatisfied by what we have because of the beauty and unrealistic expectations set by filtered lenses.

“We do not become satisfied by leading a peaceful and prosperous existence. Rather, we become satisfied when reality matches our expectations. The bad news is that as conditions improve, expectations balloon.”

The heavy reliance on social media usage might be responsible for many issues these days, honestly speaking, though, I personally don’t think that social media should take the blame entirely. It’s easier said than done, but internet/social media should be treated with the same rule of drinking alcohol: use it responsibly and it has a chance of bringing you happiness instead of harm/problems. Anything that’s too much is never good and that notion applies here, on our way to increase our quality of life by becoming a user of internet/social media, the opposite happens when we’re not in control: social media doesn’t become the product we use, WE become the social media’s product.

“Every day millions of people decide to grant their smartphone a bit more control over their lives or try a new and more effective antidepressant drug. In pursuit of health, happiness and power, humans will gradually change first one of their features and then another, and another, until they will no longer be human.”

There are still many more words I could write regarding this topic, but this is a book review and I plan to keep it that way. Please don’t take the long paragraphs I wrote about data, social media, and internet as a way of me saying that these are the only prominent topics that Harari talked about, there were still many other VERY important topics such as food, history, human dominance, belief, and religions that Harari elaborated with effectiveness, but I think it would be better for you to read them for yourself.

“This is the best reason to learn history: not in order to predict the future, but to free yourself of the past and imagine alternative destinies. Of course this is not total freedom – we cannot avoid being shaped by the past. But some freedom is better than none.”

Overall though, despite finding this book interesting and engaging, I still think that Homo Sapiens is the superior book. Now, I have no idea whether it’s due to Homo Sapiens being the first book I read instead of Homo Deus or not, but it really felt like some of the discussions and ideas gets repetitive to read. Plus, I had mixed feelings regarding Part 2 of the book where a lot of sections were uninteresting and told in an almost text-book manner. Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow is a thought-provoking book about societies, dataism, humanism, and the power of beliefs. As always, my rating speaks more for enjoyment rather than technicality, and I honestly believe that this, and Homo Sapiens, are books that should be read at least once whether you enjoy them or not. I agree and don’t agree with Harari on several topics, but the reasonings he gave will most likely make you reflect on many important topics.

“Fiction isn't bad. It is vital. Without commonly accepted stories about things like money, states or corporations, no complex human society can function. We can't play football unless everyone believes in the same made-up rules, and we can't enjoy the benefits of markets and courts without similar make-believe stories. But stories are just tools. They shouldn't become our goals or our yardsticks. When we forget that they are mere fiction, we lose touch with reality. Then we begin entire wars `to make a lot of money for the cooperation' or 'to protect the national interest'. Corporations, money and nations exist only in our imagination. We invented them to serve us; why do we find ourselves sacrificing our life in their service.”

11,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3675162-j-l-sutton,3,"The title and the premise of Yuval Noah Harari’s Home Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow sounds intriguing; however, not much felt new. I feel like I’ve already heard much of the author’s arguments in other places. So while the various topics discussed are interesting and thought-provoking, Homo Deus is mostly provocative because of the way it is packaged. Advancements in a number of fields, especially in relation to data and an increase in our longevity, are examined to make the point that we are reaching a pivotal moment in our history. In order for transformations to be made, the author argues we need to change our mindset and expectations and maybe even our concept about individualism. While that may be true, I was hoping to hear more about the future, the tomorrow in Harari’s subtitle, than the past. The final quarter of the book did focus on that tomorrow (what the job market might look like, whether man or some people in the job market might end up being completely superfluous, the future role of AIs in our society etc.), but I would have preferred more of that analysis earlier in the book. I would have also liked something closer to the beginning of the book about how important algorithms would be in that analysis. 3.5 stars.   "
12,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40334778-cj-dufficy,2,"Certainly a disappointment when compared to Sapiens. The insights were generally already well presented in the earlier book. The section on animal lives is not convincingly warranted for inclusion but more obviously just a passion for the author leading me to feel I was being preached too. His criticism of Dawkins et al although correct could be equally pointed at himself. The universe will move from hot to cold regardless of quantum mechanical randomness at the quanta scale and equally at our barely greater scale (in universal terms) the path of the universe need not worry about human probabilistic behaviour, our free will is irrelevant to the progress of the universe. The fact that it is buried in our consciousness where language based thought is absent is hardly surprising as without it we could never have arrived at language based thought.All living things will die (even if capable of life spans we can't comprehend now) something terminal eventually happens to everything. As finally when the universe is so cold nothing can happen, long after this proton decay will plant the last nail in all coffins. Dr Hariri is no different to a WW1 general asking people to sacrifice some of their one and only life to benefit some unknown present or future person or animal with zero guarantees the sacrifice pays off but 100% certainty of the personal cost. Technology won't replicate humans, why would anyone want to copy such an imperfect organism when so many better options would be available?He admits, to paraphrase Dr King, that the arc of history is towards justice. The future is not a destination we choose any effort to dictate global outcomes never succeeds and this book is just another ""I know best contribution"" that will soon be forgotten.Generally the book feels as a world view supported selectively and not the wonderful voyage of discovery presented in Sapiens. Like Dawkins hating God though not believing, the author to object to humanism sneers at humans. No one ever said humans should act justly towards anything as a result of evolution but wth curiosity, generosity and empathy we have achieved a lot and are headed to achieve more although doomed anyway either in the long or short term. He fails completely to demonstrate any logic for a human that is mortal caring the exact length of time left to the species and acting altruistically as a result, and so totally unaware his action would have a measurable affect. If Mr Schickelbach hadn't changed his name to Hitler how different would the 20th century have been? What is the possibility of picking out causal events like these or knowing preventing them offers a better present. Everyone alive today must selfishly accept all of the great or horrible past or simply not exist.I'm happy I read it just a little deflated that so little eye opening left field explanations are in it and so many unsupported claims are made.To sum up he reminds me of the experimenter that forgets he is part of the experiment and can never not be."

A year or so ago I read an interview with Harari on this book, which was still work in progress, and I found his views on biological inequality (and, to a lesser extent, the decoupling of intelligence from consciousness) very insightful. Actually, it was that interview that inspired me to read Sapiens, which, despite certain flaws, unfortunately amplified in Deus, is a book definitely worth reading. Meanwhile, Deus is wordy, chaotic and repetitive; most of the book is a just hotchpotch of quite basic facts stretching across many disciplines that does not seem to serve any purpose. A portion of that is a repetition from Sapiens, but most sounds like extended paragraphs from high school textbooks which are intended – I guess – to support each chapter’s main claim, but fail to do so, as they are not inserted in any kind of persuasive argumentation. Despite most of the book’s being redundant, I have to say I appreciated Harari’s insights on free will. Had I not read about biological inequality before, I’d probably also somewhat praise that part. If I hadn’t read Sapiens, I could have liked the parts already discussed in Sapiens (but if you haven't read Sapiens, just read Sapiens). But I'm afraid that's all. Really disappointing, I honestly wanted to give up on this book at least three times, but ploughed through it, including notes, anyway, because I hoped I'd discover something of real value in the end. Didn’t happen."

After all, computers are far more efficient calculators than humans, and chess can be broken down to calculations (In fact, nowadays chess masters don't stand a chance against present day computer Chessmaster programs. It's simply not possible for a human mind to beat them). And we're also not at all shocked when Google and Tesla present us automated cars driven by computer programs. Nevertheless, we reason,computers can never rival humans in arts, because arts require something distinctively(perhaps even spiritually) humane, which can never be replicated by computers. If you're a believer in this sort of human distinctiveness, perhaps you would naturally be thrown off upon hearing that a computer program written by a professor of musicology produced musical piece that the audience thought was superior to Bach. In other words, AI has already passed the Turing test in music. If programs can outperform us in our allegedly distinct 'human art' form, there's really no reason to think that it can't outperform us in every other field. Programs may lack subjective consciousness like us, but that doesn't stop them to outperform us in intellectual and artistic fields. Harari's new book explores the dimensions of the marriage between man and machine. He basically paints a dystopian vision of the future where humanity is by and large subjugated to non conscious intelligent machines. He even entertains the idea with the rise of brain-machine interfaces, where today's elite class of human beings would upgrade themselves to a biologically improved version of humans, which the general mass couldn't possibly afford for their lives. This would create a real caste system with real biological hierarchies. After reading Harari's previous book Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, I must say that I am a bit disappointed with this book. Much of the book is reiteration of the previous book which seemed to me largely redundant. However, although this book is not as articulated or entertaining as the previous one, it is probably more important, considering the topics it deals with. "

After finishing it, I'm both elated and anxious.Homo Deus (what a perfect title) was complex and it covered a lot of things, but it is especially trying to decipher where the humanity is going.Consciousness, the individual, intelligence, and the very important ability to organise are thoroughly analysed.I was very surprised to have my native country mentioned and analysed briefly but comprehensively. More importantly, Harari answered a question I've been asking myself for many years. In retrospect, the explanation is logical but it never occurred to me and nobody else was able to enlighten me either. Algorithms - a modern word, but very important, as we all are biological algorithms.What's more important - intelligence or consciousness?I also enjoyed the recap/rundown of some historical events in history. Harari also addresses our cruel treatment of farm animals. I'm an omnivore who feels guilty. What else? There's a lot to take in, but Harari unpacks it for us in an eloquent, easy to understand manner (well, I understood it). I'll probably buy the paperback so I go over certain chapters again.This audiobook was splendidly narrated by Derek Perkins.Highly recommended"
16,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53209373-simon-clark,4,"I was a HUGE fan of Harari's previous smash hit Sapiens, and as such I came into this book with high expectations. Those expectations were met in some areas, and not in others: overall the book is engaging but a shadow of its predecessor.First, the good stuff. Harari's prose is as readable and clear as ever in Homo Deus, and he paces himself excellently. Too often in popular science books I find that either the author drags their feet getting to the interesting stuff or rockets over important sections, leaving some fatal misunderstandings. As in Sapiens Harari is economical with his words, saying just enough to convey the point exactly without overstaying his welcome. Additionally, similar to Sapiens the broad-brush overview of history is extremely compelling (provided you don't expect academically rigorous sources). Most of the book is actually a re-telling of the power structures that have shaped human societies, focusing on the concept of religions. Naturally this includes Abrahamic religions, animalist or spiritualist beliefs, and a slew of ancient religions. However crucially Harari also classifies humanism as a religion, and, in fact, as the defining religion of the modern period, placing the individual human at the centre of the moral universe. With this framework in place Harari then extrapolates modern interplay of religion and society forward a few centuries, speculating about what future religions might look like.This speculative section of the book is what drew me to Homo Deus, as I'm sure was the case for many readers. Unfortunately I think many will likewise come away disappointed. For such a long buildup, Harari spends very little time actually discussing the potential future, or how society might look with, for example, a caste of technologically-enhanced humans lording it over us mere biological peasants. The rise of machine learning gets the most thorough treatment, being as it is likely the most severe social disruptor of this century, but even the predictions here feel brief, even perfunctory. A much more thorough discussion takes place in Pedro Domingo's excellent The Master Algorithm. I really hoped for more from Harari in speculating how current broad trends might plan out, but (perhaps understandably) he shirks away from providing many predictions.This said, in the few years since the book has been published many of its predictions have come true. For example, the rise of not only ride-sharing but car-sharing apps is directly predicted. The very day that I read that section of the book I saw an advert for car-sharing app ZipCar on the tube. The rising discontent with politics (as hinted at during the writing of the book with the election campaigns of Brexit and Donald Trump) have absolutely come to pass. This certainly lends some validity to the broad vision Harari presents, and I have no doubt that his vision of how technology and society will interact in the 21st century will come to pass. Between the lack of details however, as well as an uncharacteristically patchy discussion of modern religions, and his perennial problem of writing for a popular audience and so skimping on references, this just doesn't hold up to comparison to Sapiens. Still, a recommended read for those who enjoyed the previous book."
17,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,5,"Having read Sapiens, I had some idea that there would be new themes which Yuval Noah Harari would cover which nobody else has before. With Sapiens, it was about the agricultural revolution and the binding power of stories. And yes - there are brilliant new themes in Homo Deus as well - our delusion of free will and the Sapiens in a future world ruled by algorithms, and it continues excellently from where Sapiens left off. If Sapiens was about how the most powerful species consolidated it's power, Homo Deus is about what is in store for Sapiens. The theme of the power of stories - to bind and also delude is continued in Homo Deus. Stories - good or bad enables large scale co-operation among Sapiens - even if the story is not entirely logical or fair to other species. This has led to Humanism as a religion, where Sapiens have declared themselves as the centre and primary purpose of the universe. So everything else revolves around Sapiens - and all other life forms are for it's use. This has led to us being extremely cruel with other life forms and farm animals lead miserable lives from birth till death. The story which binds humans regards this as the norm and generation after generation sees nothing wrong in it. How would humans feels if a more advanced species (spawned off by artificial intelligence) should make judgements and kill undesirable humans?There are fairly long discussions around political systems and the growth of liberalism. I found this to be a little too long, and it could well have been crisper. Humans have acquired a combination of intellect and consciousness which was regarded as necessary for being advanced life forms at the top of the pyramid. Consciousness especially would be difficult to acquire. However, it is clear now that intelligence which is superior is adequate to ascend the pyramid. Already artificial intelligence is winning over humans in several fields regarded as earlier insurmountable such as chess and even the arts. Humans will depend more and more on algorithms and at some point algorithms will be all powerful. One big surprise which the book springs is around our free will. Do we really have free will? - or do we make forced choices based on experience and conditioning? I found this to be the most interesting discussion in the book.While I do not think the future will play out entirely as outlined, it might still be close. The reasoning and discussions are excellent, provoking us to think & reflect - and isn't that what is most important in a good book?Yuval Noah Hariri closes the book being thankful to the practice of Vipassana meditation as taught by S N Goenka for allowing him to look beyond conditioning and see things as they are. A sign that there is wisdom which is eternal and will endure, isn't it?"
18,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27098959-leonard-gaya,3,"Harari wrote Homo Deus following the success of Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind a couple of years earlier. And while the first book’s ambition is to tell the saga of humanity’s past, this one is offered as a sort of sequel, showing what our future might hold. In truth, Sapiens was mostly glossing over the complexities of humankind’s history. And most of the first half of Homo Deus commits to rehashing the same arguments, only to thin them down with a slightly different set of examples and anecdotes. For example, Harari spends quite a few pages discussing once again the notion that human societies are shaped by arbitrary conventions or “intersubjective fictional entities” (economy, ethics, laws, ideologies, religions). He also devotes a significant part of the book to his pet cause: the callousness of industrial livestock farming. Most of the book is written in a journalistic style, with anecdotes aplenty, which makes for both engaging and easy reading, but at the same time, renders the book a bit sketchy, patchy, dated and peripheral.Nevertheless, Homo Deus starts to introduce new notions about halfway through. The core of the book is an examination of modernity, in the wake of what Nietzsche had coined the “Death of God”. The ideology that is currently replacing the moribund religions of the past is humanism, in its either liberal or socialist version. Harari briefly examines the question of consciousness and free-will, which are the founding (albeit debatable) principles of humanism. He also outlines the distinctive features of this modern ideology: the belief in perpetual technological and economic growth; the belief in individualism, “inner-awareness” and “self-determination” and, thus, in democracy and happiness. Even though, in the end, modern humanism does very little to provide meaning to human existence.Towards the end of the book, however, as Harari considers what might come next, it becomes clear that the blessings of humanism might ultimately be bestowed on a very limited elite. Harari examines how the humanist obsession with technological progress might well become the downfall of our humanist civilisation and the inception of a “dataist” dystopia. A few precursory elements include novel techniques of body and brain “hacking”, the systematic replacement of the human workforce by increasingly intelligent machines (and the social inequalities this will imply), and last but not least, the flourishing belief that the Self and even the whole of society is but a bunch of pre-determined data-processing systems. In other words, we are algorithms.Homo Deus’ closing chapters paint, with broad brush strokes, a grim picture of our possible future. The dawn of this new era is probably upon us already, and individuals are increasingly treated, through an ever encircling net of technology, as data-bags, suitable only for corporations’ meaningless profits — just as animals are treated as meat-bags, suited only to humans’ boundless consumption. Nietzsche (again) prophetically called this the age of the “Last Man”. That was more than a century ago, however, so there is nothing groundbreaking in Homo Deus today. In any event, this places Harari right next to a couple of other slightly gloomy transhumanists, such as Nick Bostrom."

It was a working hypothesis that worked, and I didn't look behind it until it became untenable. Now I effectively assume my continuing identity as a person - because that works, sort of, too. In me, and most people I know, the baton of consciousness, of awareness of one's I-ness, is repeatedly exchanged at unimaginable speeds between the two hemispheres. That baton seems to get dropped by people suffering certain forms of dementia - with increasing frequency as their condition worsens, being eventually only picked up and handed to and fro for brief, sometimes apparently fortuitous periods, if at all. How cruel (alongside other pains and indignities) to lose the working hypothesis that everyone else lives by. But perhaps, isolated in the permanently unfamiliar and frightening. Now they may be closer to the reality of the human condition than the rest of us. As with Santa, the mere fact that a working hypothesis produces a desirable and convenient result does not make it correct.Take famine. We are told that ""famine is rare"". But across what data-set is that claim true? Across the data-set of what we actually know, about what is actually happening, at the present time? But that is a profoundly-inadequate data-set. We ought to consider also what we don't know about what is happening right now (Do we know whether or not, even right now, a serious famine is underway in under-reported/remote in parts of Africa?). More important, we ought to consider what might have happened, in recent history (has humanity quite possibly been merely lucky not to have experienced a mega-famine, in recent times (we may have come close, for instance, in 2007-9, during which period most of the world's countries resorted to banning food exports)?"

I think Homo Deus poses some excellent questions that make you question your existence. Why do we think of ourselves as superior to all other life forms. Why do we have such strong faith in imaginary things such as money, gods, human rights, companies...And what will become of us if dataism succeeds. All in all, it's clear that we can't keep living like this. Harari's writing style is very engaging. He's a bit of sarcastic when he questions religion, our history, science, technology, humanity, our supposedly superior position to other life forms, humanism, liberalism, yet he doesn't claim that he's some expert in this matter, he just gives you a set of facts.Thank you Yuval Noah Harari for writing this & Random House UK, Vintage Publishing Harvill Secker and Netgalley for this copy in exchange for an honest review."

Overall, its very worth it and full of a lot of the interesting high level perspectives and frameworks. But it also lacks the clear structure of a coherent narrative, isn't presenting (to me) quite as novel information, and also does some strange things - like using the word 'liberal' in contexts that I don't think definitionally make sense.I like the train of the thought that Harari closed Sapiens with and continues in this book, which is about human happiness and how to optimize for it - though he doesn't have rosy conclusions on where we are headed. And the notion that we are going to beat death at some point soonish (I'd guess in 20-40 years) is not a new one, but is a very interesting one. Whether or not humans will over time stay human, or be divided into superhumans and regular humans, or create a class of economically useless people - are some of the larger questions we will face in the future as AI and aging advance.Success breeds ambition, and our recent achievements are now pushing humankind to set itself even more daring goals. Having secured unprecedented levels of prosperity, health and harmony, and given our past record and our current values, humanity’s next targets are likely to be immortality, happiness and divinity. Having reduced mortality from starvation, disease and violence, we will now aim to overcome old age and even death itself. Having saved people from abject misery, we will now aim to make them positively happy.

Just as Sapiens, Homo Deus is a gripping book, I love Yuval’s writing style because it never bores me, he always manages to draw my full attention. Homo Deus is a book that wants to present the possible roads that the future might lead us to. It’s not a presentation of how the future will look, but rather how it might. I found the format of this book interesting, it often seems chaotic with subjects ranging from the history of lawns to even a chapter about Nicolae Ceaușescu. When you look at them individually, they don't seem to be that relevant to the subject of the book, but there’s order in his chaos and this is what makes this book and Sapiens so compelling, how he uses examples that are not only fascinating, but also easy to understand, informative and relatable. The only thing I could reproach is that the title is misleading, there’s surprisingly little about the future of humankind in this. It felt more like an extension of the last chapter in Sapiens. It even recycles some ideas from Sapiens while expanding others. Overall the ideas presented here are by no means original, but Yuval Noah Harari deserves credit for the way it managed to gather and present so many ideas in a way that not only made sense but was also easy to understand and follow, all that while also being surprisingly entertaining."

Homo sapiens (modern humans) were able to gain dominance over all of nature because of their ability to communicate and to collaborate with each other and because they could use their collective brain to come up with novel ideas, but as technology progresses and we rely more and more in computers and algorithms these computers programs are based on , are we as a species giving up dominance to technology? Are we becoming obsolete? And if we become obsolete who or what is primed to take over the mantle and what will happens to Homo Sapiens once it does happen? This is what these book asks and it dwells in many scenarios this could happen, there are already artificial intelligence available (our iPhones, robot doctors and gps) , humans could use these new technology to enhance themselves and if they do , will they still be fundamentally human? Or would they more divine , (Homo Deus) and once these disparities become apparent, how would ethics, religion or the human experience changed to accommodate this reality? The point of this book is to explore these questions and to make us try to come up with an answer , or pretty soon if not already too late that choice will be taken from us."
26,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13162061-amirography,5,"A great and ausual book. When considering many more books about the same topic, ""how we are going to be"", Harari's arguments are more than satisfying and his reasonings are both terrifying and educated. I believe his warnings were the most accurate, I could have found on the topic of technologies and how they may be a danger to us. So there are so many people, like Hawkins that try to warn us about future AI uprising, which any sci-fi author from 90's could counter argue effectively and easily. However, Harari's predictions are actually possible and are risen from just fear of unknown. Rather his warnings are based on what we know is possible. I adore and recommend this book, as a great sequel to ""Sapiens"" by Harari. "
27,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/765636-ray,4,"This book is sure to give one a lot to think about.Firstly, I’d highly recommend reading Harari’s seminal Sapiens book before delving into Homo Deus. They are meant to complement each other in order to better understand humanity’s past and future. Much of Homo Deus repeats the previous themes, which is a bit of a flaw, and frames human historical patterns into broad categories which can seem rushed if one didn’t read Sapiens already. Still, the concepts are so important and take much energy to truly contemplate so they are generally worth repeating. While constantly mind-blowing, Harari writes in a readable engaging style which may or may not be oversimplifying depending on how good his research is…I originally thought Homo Deus would be a book about transhumanism, and it is to some degree, but it’s not meant to give the details on how cybernetic movements will work in the technological sense. Rather, Harari seeks to contemplate the underlying philosophies of what he concludes will be the new techno-religions of the future. It’s interesting how he defines religions, which don’t require belief in the supernatural and rather any thought process which ends in ‘-ism’ can pretty much be a religion. Much is written about individualistic humanism for example, and it’s various 20th century branches nationalism-socialism-communism-liberalism etc. as he defines them. Also, everything is apparently all about algorithms. I would criticize that he is too harsh at times, always saying that the ethics of human rights and whatnot are arbitrary and there is no sense that the social contract is any kind of evolution. Just one of many choices. It is true that borders and laws are intersubjective illusions, and it is true that human beings treat animals appallingly. But personally I still hope, however naively, that there is some kind of progress going on throughout the ages.In any case it is fascinating to dissect how we got here and where we may go next. Harari is a master of the big picture, which is refreshing in times of turmoil when it becomes hard to see further from the events right in front of us. From superhumans to Dataism, what is being cooked up in Silicon Valley is supremely more important than the regressive reactionary forces which we are usually told are such a big deal.The challenges to come as the human race changes are going to unlike anything imaginable. Indeed, much of it is by definition impossible to predict because the way our brains currently work is not the way brains will work in the future. The singularity must be mentioned as well. These are important things to think about even if it will be tricky to truly understand. Ultimately Harari is raising questions and doesn’t pretend to know all the answers. But what questions. Readers are left hoping that if we contemplate these things seriously enough we might actually be able to avoid some of the disasters. Yet that will require a lot of foresight. Good luck, humans. The final questions are these and I don’t think it’s a spoiler to share so here, please think:1. Are organisms really just algorithms, and is life really just data processing?2. What’s more valuable – intelligence or consciousness. 3. What will happen to society, politics and daily life when non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms know us better than we know ourselves?"
28,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim,5,"Harari picks up where he left off with Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, a fantastic book that I gave a 5 star review HERE. There he shows where we've been & spends the last chapters asking where are we going. He also asks what is happiness? Both are important questions that he starts off addressing here with The New Human Agenda, an interesting & long introduction that covers a lot of thoughtful territory to set the stage for the 3 parts of the book.His examples are great since they take me places I've never been before. I had a good education, I'm curious, & fairly well read, yet he constantly reminds me how poor & US-centric my knowledge of world & its history is. Unfortunately, the length & numbers of his examples actually detract from his overall points at times. He doesn't clearly & succinctly define a premise from the outset & then prove it. Instead, he usually provides a super short idea & expands on it along with a running proof that often obfuscates the premise. I was tempted to drop a star for this, but didn't.He's also preachy at times, something I object to even though I'm usually in the choir, if not on the pulpit with him. Too often his examples & interpretations are lopsided. Normally, the book would lose at least a star, but I didn't even though I point one out later in the review & in the first comment of this review. (I put that comment & some other excursions of my own in the comments since there's just too much here to think about & I was afraid I'd run out space in the review.)---------------------Update 16Dec2018: here is a good piece about Harari's philosophy that should be taken into account when reading his books. I don't agree with it all, but it does contain important points to consider.https://www.thenewatlantis.com/public...---------------------As an audio book that I'm listening to at varying times, I occasionally lost sight of where he was going & only found my way back by skimming the text version, but it's all interesting. He's a smart guy with a unique way of structuring large, complex ideas, but the first & second sections could have used more editing. Don't give up, though! The third section brings it all together in a fantastic fashion that I wish everyone would read, especially politicians. That's why this garnered 5 stars.Highly recommended in both text & audio. As with his other book, this is great to listen to, but a text edition is a great way to check & ponder his many points. As you can tell, I found much to ponder here.The rest of the review isn't really for you, but notes for me.
Most people rarely think about it, but in the last few decades we have managed to rein in famine, plague and war.
 It wasn't unusual for 10% or more of a population to die from any one of these. They were once completely beyond our control & in the realm of deities. Now men are held accountable & the amount is down both as a percentage & even actual numbers in many cases even though there are far more people (500 million 1500, 1 billion 1800, 1.8 billion 1920, 7.6 billion 2017). People are still hungry, sick, & killed violently, but it's incredible just how much better things are for most people.- The 1918 Spanish flu killed 20-50 million while the 2014 Ebola outbreak killed less than 12,000. Small pox wiped out 90% of many populations in the Americas. We've now wiped out small pox.- In 2012 about 56 million people died throughout the world; 620,000 of them died due to human violence (war killed 120,000 people, and crime killed another 500,000.Perspective: There were 615,000 Allied casualties in the Battle of Somme in WWI - one battle of many both in that war & those that followed in the 20th century.- Far more people die today due to gluttony than famine.
It took just a piece of bread to make a starving medieval peasant joyful. How do you bring joy to a bored, overpaid and overweight engineer?
From the primordial ooze to a century ago, survival once demanded our full attention & now it doesn't. The animal satisfied with one meal starved to death, while the one that kept scrambling for more passed on its genes, so we're hardwired to always want more. Now we have it & what? Where are our cravings - the pursuit of happiness - taking us? He provides numbers on suicides that are both indicative & disheartening. From 1/100K in developing countries to 25/100K in developed ones, our relative wealth shows a growing dissatisfaction with life that will only be exacerbated as lifespans & wealth increase. Immortality, actually ammortality, is coming soon to rich people.Part I: Homo Sapiens Conquers the WorldWe live in the Anthropocene era, an age where humans are a force more powerful than the comet that destroyed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. While the beginning of this age is the 20th century, we've actually had a huge effect on the environment since shortly after our cognitive revolution & he doesn't make that point well. Actually, this section suffers greatly from a wandering, yet narrow viewpoint that I didn't expect from him. He seems to have an agenda, especially against factory farming, as if that's the only sort there is.Out of book research: A quick read of Harari's Wikipedia page & his website show that he's a vegan & an animal welfare advocate. That accounts for the lopsided arguments & fanatical tone I detected.While I agree that we're as gods to animals & have done piss poor job of it, we are getting better. We actually have people arguing for animal welfare now & we can afford to. As a historical trend, our treatment of animals is very similar to other technologies - we're very inefficient at first, but we gain understanding & economic resilience as the tech matures (e.g. insulin - see comment #1 for more). I'm disappointed that he didn't point this out at all, but just painted the darkest picture possible.
Now humankind is poised to replace natural selection with intelligent design, and to extend life from the organic realm into the inorganic.
 What is human? What are the bounds between human & machine? Our striving toward artificial intelligence & fixing humans has created cyborgs & designer people. He points out that later versions of these may well regard us as we do animals & have even less in common. His example for how these will come about is excellent. It will start with a needed fix & expand, just like plastic surgery did. (See Comment 2)He spends a lot of time trying to figure out what separates us from other animals. While all have both objective & subjective realities, humans are the only ones that share intersubjective realities or fictions (He referred to them as 'shared myths' in ""Sapiens"" e.g., money, empire, religion.) which allow us to cooperate in large groups. He wanders through some interesting paths, but seems to have blinders on. For instance, he never once mentions selfishness (ego) in this context & if he did mention the evolutionary maxim of 'the more copies of DNA available, the better', I missed it.Still, he sums up the section well with the following. As human fictions are translated into genetic and electronic codes, the intersubjective reality will swallow up the objective reality and biology will merge with history. In the twenty-first century fiction might thereby become the most potent force on earth, surpassing even wayward asteroids and natural selection. Hence if we want to understand our future, cracking genomes and crunching numbers is hardly enough. We must also decipher the fictions that give meaning to the world.Part II: Homo Sapiens Gives Meaning to the WorldHe starts out by discussing the story tellers. These are the shared myths & he examines how similar religion, empires, & various governing ideologies are in a variety of ways. There's a really interesting discussion on how we measure success in these systems; too often we measure them by their own yardsticks, not on anything real. ""Real"" being an entity that can feel pain.The Odd Couple - in practice, science and religion are like a husband and wife who after 500 years of marriage counselling still don’t know each other...- Most of the misunderstandings regarding science and religion result from faulty definitions of religion... people confuse religion with superstition, spirituality, belief in supernatural powers or belief in gods. Religion is none of these things...- Religion asserts that we humans are subject to a system of moral laws that we did not invent and that we cannot change...- Religion gives a complete description of the world, and offers us a well-defined contract with predetermined goals...- ...religious stories almost always include three parts:1. Ethical judgments, such as ‘human life is sacred’.2. Factual statements, such as ‘human life begins at the moment of conception’.3. A conflation of the ethical judgments with the factual statements, resulting in practical guidelines such as ‘you should never allow abortion, even a single day after conception’.- Science has no authority or ability to refute or corroborate the ethical judgments religions make. But scientists do have a lot to say about religious factual statements... He then goes on to say that the Scientific Age is also the Age of Ignorance. We learned to know that we didn't know & set about finding out. Unfortunately, the above took an awfully long time with many great examples & thoughts in between the basic premises I listed above. While I enjoy it, the ideas failed to make much of an impression until I could boil them down as above. A lot of this book does this. The Modern Covenant is about liberalism, capitalism, & the growing GDP. It is a rat race. I was surprised that he never mentioned complexity as one of the biggest balancing points, though. Instead, he concentrates on resources, energy, & knowledge. The latter is the only one growing in real terms.The Humanist Revolution: List the best innovations religions introduced in the past century or two. How about men & science? I can't think of anything for the first while I can fill pages with the last. Religion used to be creative, but now it is now entirely reactionary proving it is on its way out. The various fundamentalist movements are death throes.Atheism is on the rise, especially in modern, educated, successful nations where most only pay lip service to their fundamental religion if they espouse one. Much of the reason for this goes back to his original assertion that where gods & prayers failed to do anything about famine, plague, & war, man did. We no longer believe the god(s) are the source of inspiration, art, music, & everything else. So man is now the source of both meaning & authority, the traditional role of god(s) & religion. We believe in ourselves & our fellow man - the new religion, humanism. We're thinking for ourselves.Though in 1850 socialism was only a fringe movement, it soon gathered momentum, and changed the world in far more profound ways than the self-proclaimed messiahs of China and Sudan. If you count on national health services, pension funds and free schools, you need to thank Marx and Lenin (and Otto von Bismarck) far more than Hong Xiuquan or the Mahdi.Part III: Homo Sapiens Loses ControlCan humans go on running the world and giving it meaning?How do biotechnology and artificial intelligence threaten humanism?Who might inherit humankind, and what new religion might replace humanism?The Time Bomb in the LaboratoryIn 2016 the world is dominated by the liberal package of individualism, human rights, democracy and the free market. Yet twenty-first-century science is undermining the foundations of the liberal order…Science has found:- Free will as we've defined it doesn't really exist. We've broken our thought processes down into algorithms. Does it really matter if they run on a carbon or silicon based electro-chemical system?- We aren't ""individuals"", but ""dividuals"" - there are at least 2 of us inside - the experiencing & narrating self. The first has no memory, the latter stores the memory often in strange ways to make sense of it & it is often duration-blind.The Great Decoupling…Liberals uphold free markets and democratic elections because they believe that every human is a uniquely valuable individual, whose free choices are the ultimate source of authority. In the twenty-first century three practical developments might make this belief obsolete:1. Humans will lose their economic and military usefulness, hence the economic and political system will stop attaching much value to them.2. The system will still find value in humans collectively, but not in unique individuals.3. The system will still find value in some unique individuals, but these will be a new elite of upgraded superhumans rather than the mass of the population.This section plain terrifies me. It is too obviously happening already.- We have decoupled intelligence & consciousness. Many computer algorithms can & are doing intelligent tasks far better & faster than humans such as stock trading, baseball team picks, playing games. They're not confined to Deep Blue or Watson, a laptop will do most of the time. With Quantum Computing just around the corner, even Watson will be as outdated as the 8 bit Atari I had 25 years ago.- Guiding the masses to decisions. Ignore your political beliefs & read  this article especially the references & links to Cambridge Analytica. Public opinion shaped through Facebook memes & fake news that appeals to our prejudices which they know. With just 300 examples, there are algorithms that can pick your 'likes' more accurately than your spouse.- Personal decisions through big data! His description of how & why it could will happen makes far too much sense.(See comment 3.)Worst of all, this is the techno-humanist view, which at least still needs tolerates the vast majority of people. If robots are doing most of the work & fighting, what use are the masses? What will occupy them & keep them out of trouble? Harari doesn't mention it, but China's one-child policy shows that governments can change their populations relatively quickly while retaining their power & keeping the world at large at bay. Theirs wasn't war torn genocide, just a rational step, right? Advancing technologies will only make sterilizing & controlling large, relatively specific segments of the population easier. People as a resource. (See comment 4.)The Data ReligionDataism says that the universe consists of data flows, and the value of any phenomenon or entity is determined by its contribution to data processing.This is where Harari's ability to look at huge systems really shines. He describes how we went from small, disparate data clusters as hunter-gatherers to larger data clusters that were centralized in empires. Communism failed because centralized data couldn't react as well as the decentralized capitalist system. A central authority dictating the amount of wheat to plant & loaves to bake didn't have the information or self-correction of free market forces such as a stock exchange.A critical examination of the Dataist dogma is likely to be not only the greatest scientific challenge of the twenty-first century, but also the most urgent political and economic project.His explanations are both terrifying & accurate, especially in the practical applications & trends we are now seeing. Our leaders aren't any longer. They're increasingly reacting to older & older crisis as technology races past their understanding. The DMCA lauded as such an amazing piece of legislation in 1998 immediately had to be amended when they realized they'd outlawed all computers on private & corporate networks since the original language of the bill stated that any computer that didn't show its actual IP address was illegal. That such a huge, obvious flaw could make it into law is practically criminal & yet things have only gotten worse.When religion lost its ability to lead, it became reactionary & has lost its hold. Will politics & democracy become obsolete soon? Shouldn't they? Can we honestly say that the choice between Clinton, Sanders, Johnson, or Trump made any sense? Will we even survive Kim Jong-il or Putin? (see comment 5)Censorship used to rely on blocking information flows, but now it relies on obfuscating it by deluging us with spun data as in the Cambridge Analytica example above. The scariest thing about dataism is not what it will do to us in the short term - it might really be a good thing - but that it doesn't require any humans in the long run. As Harari points out, we're better data creators & processors than chickens, but we could easily be supplanted.The dataist will point out how much more efficient & better our lives can be if we simply share our information, the more, the better for us. Intelligent algorithms can then use it. He uses his car as an example. He only uses it 1 hour per day commuting to & from work, so it is a huge expense & waste of resources. He doesn't know enough to coordinate with the millions that live around him, each of whom also own cars, to share one, but if everyone let the system always know when & where they wanted to go an intelligent algorithm could do so. The only cost would be his privacy. Ditto with medicine. (See comment 5)He ends fantastically:If we think in term of months, we had probably focus on immediate problems such as the turmoil in the Middle East, the refugee crisis in Europe and the slowing of the Chinese economy. If we think in terms of decades, then global warming, growing inequality and the disruption of the job market loom large. Yet if we take the really grand view of life, all other problems and developments are overshadowed by three interlinked processes:1. Science is converging on an all-encompassing dogma, which says that organisms are algorithms, and life is data processing.2. Intelligence is decoupling from consciousness.3. Non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms may soon know us better than we know ourselves.These three processes raise three key questions, which I hope will stick in your mind long after you have finished this book:1. Are organisms really just algorithms, and is life really just data processing?2. What’s more valuable – intelligence or consciousness?3. What will happen to society, politics and daily life when non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms know us better than we know ourselves?Highly recommended in both text & audio. As with his other book, this is great to listen to, but a text edition is a great way to check & ponder his many points. As you can tell, I found much to ponder here & even so, I left out a lot. Yeah, it's fantastic."

According to Yuval Noah Harari, the main reason that humans have managed to attain such a strong position in this planet is their ability to believe in ""imaginary orders"" such as countries, religion, money etc.Many believe that we have something in us that could be called a soul or consciousness or similar but it is not clear that this exists and our behavior could possibly be only a result of complex algorithms, without free will (or possibly random will but not free).It seems, humans are rapidly managing to develop algorithms that do things better.So many fields in our life are replaced. Travel agents, computer programmers and in the near future drivers, lawyers and possibly artists, composers and more. We may find ourselves in a world that we decide things like who to vote for, who to love, what to do and practically any decision with the help of algorithms.In his very distinctive and persuasive style, the author uses his vast sociological and historical knowledge and tries to predict what will be the direction that the human race will take in the 21st century. On the way, he explains how humanism and other ""religions"" changed the way humans think and may change the destination of humans.I loved this book. I am not sure that I can capture the impression this book made on me in a review and I am not really going to try.I really think that this book is a must read for all people , and specifically people who want to understand humans and human society."

I didn't really equate the bill of human rights with the ten commandments. Yet humanism and the internal conflicts within almost tore the world apart in the 20th century. However, individual liberty is not likely to continue. Human value is likely to be surpassed. The future of the world is an algorithm. The author intends to shock and he does.

It let's you know the important technical advances that could have huge implications to society: specifically technologies that could end liberalism, humanism, and capitalism.It's hard to imagine a current world without one of those things. But in the not-to-distant future, all three of them could be gone.Harari makes the case that technology has, objectively, made the world a better place over time. And we shouldn't worry that the coming technologies will turn that trend around. Objectively, Harari argues, the future will be better.But the big question is: would the future be better off without humans? Do humans really matter to the future? And if we don't, what becomes of us?Like Sapiens, Homo Deus is an incredibly enlightening read."
34,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24275344-nmalpas,1,"Read the intro, skip the rest.I was intrigued by the premise of this (especially given that I love sci-fi and this promised a nonfiction treatment of some classic sci-fi themes). The introduction does indeed present some some interesting lines of thought about what human beings have achieved as a species and how things might progress. But that early promise was sorely dissappointed.Harari is fine as long as he sticks to his actual area of expertise, namely, history. Though even his historical insights are rather superficial and he goes on and on about many simple points ad nauseum. The real problem is that large parts of the book stray from history not only into other social sciences and physical sciences but most ruinously of all into philosophy, of which Harari clearly has little understanding. He falls victim to countless conceptual conceptions, his arguments are full of holes, he overstates his confusions, and shows a shocking ignorance of existing discussions in philosophy mind, social ontology, ethics, etc. But this cluelessness does not prevent him from giving what he supposes to be definite answers on a slew of very difficult and controversial issues in philosophy (like the problem of other mind and the nature of morality).Overall, most of the book reads like an undergraduate philosophy assignment - a good one mind, but not something anyone should expect to gain much insight or pleasure from, nor even something you would expect to find in a lauded book form a major publisher. If you don't have much philosophical background, you might be able to read this without getting infuriated; you might even come away thinking it was profound. But your sense of wonder or enlightenment would be a sham: you will just have taken on a bunch of delusions and been habituated to shoddy argument and conceptual analysis. (less)"

He describes how human nature, indeed our very humanity, could be transformed in the not very distant future due to developments in bio-technology, bio-engineering, genetic manipulation and artificial intelligence combining to create a very different sort of human being. A complete step-change for humanity and the next stage of evolution. The dizzying speed of change in scientific progress makes prediction a risky process but it seems clear, even to the most sceptical, that our world is changing and we humans along with it.

Overall, to be taken with a grain of salt, but otherwise very much thought provoking. To be discussed over wine. I wish I would have read this paired with another friend.Although very interesting, too much of it is redundant if you've already read Sapiens. If you have to choose, read only one.

All the rave about this terrific and ambitious author compelled me to read both of his works, Sapiens and Homo Deus. Both have disappointed me. I am insanely interested in both this topics and hoped to gain a thorough understanding through these two books but instead I find myself bashing the author all the time because of the unsettling amount of logical fallacies and sweeping arguments he committed in the book.In my opinion, such a book should be founded upon solid science, has considered every possible theory and leaves little room for disagreement. However, I have to say that Yuval Noah Harari is a terrible scientist and should not be allowed write ambitious science books like these for he is not qualified. Though the book is heavy with content and backed with loads of research, most of the arguments Yuval makes are with weak foundations and not convincing enough. Most of the the time I feel like I am reading an essay written by a high schooler, who has the help of google and pieced carelessly selected facts from the internet together to attempt to fool an examiner that his stand is justifiable. An example- Yuval tries to justify his stand that more people die of eating too much than by natural disasters, plagues and war by saying 'In the early twenty-first century, the average human is far more likely to die from bingeing at McDonald's than from drought, Ebola or an al-Qaeda attack.' How is this not something you would expect from a high schooler's essay? So Yuval conveniently selected four isolated events that in no way can represent 'overeating in modern society', 'natural disaster', 'plague' and 'war' with convenient statistics that just so happened to 'justify' his argument, in hope that the reader be fooled by this flawed logic. It is equally easy to select four other individual subset events of 'overeating in modern society', 'natural disaster', 'plague', 'war' and compare the statistics to 'prove' that Yuval is wrong. Such is the logic flaws that Yuval littered his book with and makes me wonder why have I bothered reading such a carelessly treated book."

There are some incredibly fascinating ideas here, and some well thought out predictions. Unfortunately, there are also some unsourced and easily contradicted assertions that undercut his arguments. Like that more Americans read digital books than physical. I simply can't find any source that supports that. Or using Microsoft's Cortana as the example of a personal digital assistant that's going to rule our lives. I mean, maybe, but Cortana over Alexa? It's little things like that that make me question Harari's handle on the tech side of things. Additionally, when discussing the science, especially the bioscience aspects, Harari offers few actual, concrete examples beyond what I could find listening to an NPR podcast. It's a fine book for a broad, general look at the potential future of biotech and machine learning, and a better look the historical context that put us here, but it feels a bit thin to me.One other thing I disliked was the manner in which Harari seemed to act as if taking psychiatric medications for therapeutic reasons was the same as taking them for a cognitive boost. A person who takes Adderall because they have ADD is taking them in order to bring themselves up to baseline functionality and isn't gaining an advantage over someone who does not have ADD and isn't taking Aderall. Suggesting otherwise is like suggesting a person with an amputated leg gains a significant advantage from using a prosthesis over someone who has both of their legs.

This book takes all three methods that we use to understand, adds some historical perspective and explains the human experience better than almost anyone and speculates where we as a society will be going in the relatively near future. Feelings are not facts, but we use our feelings to understand and process the sensuous world that we our thrown into, and we use what we think we know based on what our past beliefs were in order to understand the present. We are always in a strange loop that never quite converges because the past keeps receding and we are always anticipating the future. This book will cite a series of many neurological experiments (oh I feel for those poor rats) which show how we create narratives based on experiences and overweigh the most previous moment disproportionately from what logic dictates.Have you ever talked to people who are part of the cult of Trump? I have. They weigh each of the most previous moments’ experience that they've heard from Rush Limbaugh or Brietbart's news or Trump's 144 characters tweet disproportionately over previous data with an exponential decay set so high that history and perspective doesn't matter to them. They also would reject the principals within this book for one other big reason. They live in a universe without doubts by outsourcing their beliefs to a book or to a cult leader thus ascertaining certainty within their mythical constructions using their gut feelings as their standard for truth. Mythos dwellers never know it's a myth while they are living within the myth and will create alternative facts or whine 'fake news' when challenged. One cannot go from the abstract to the real without first creating a narrative which is depended on other narratives and which is further depended on even more stories we tell ourselves in order to fill in the thoughts between our thoughts (or what Heidegger called 'the ontological difference'). There is something very refreshing about an author who states 'Climate Change is real' as a fact. We live under a president whose mythos states in 144 characters or less that 'Climate Change is a Chinese Hoax'. I wish those kinds of people who base truth on their emotional based certainties would read a book like this one for edification. The Enlightenment spawned liberalism and firmed up humanism. The author will say that liberalism tends to 1) emphasize the individual, 2) enable the authentic self and 3) value experiences. The author uses his straw man version of liberalism (a version of Existentialism) and inverts all three of those points within his narrative and by citing relevant neurological experiments and concludes there is 1) no individual self (Harari has a lot of Hegelian thought, but never cites him), 2) there is no such thing as an authentic self, and 3) our values are skewed by our most recent experiences to the point for which we can’t always rely on them alone (never ignore your intellect!). The author argues against free will (hence there is no such thing as an authentic self) and thinks the concept of an immortal soul is contradictory and therefore not worth considering. Humanism is defined as worshiping humans, by him (overall he really doesn’t care for the Enlightenment). A somewhat loaded definition. He's arguing that our future world's values will be based on dataism. He predicts a future where reality unorganized has been converted to data which has been turned into information then knowledge and then finally wisdom. He definitely has a pessimistic bent to his future world view. He thinks people when the computers take over will be by and large left to staring at screens all day and forced to use opiods to deaden the boredom. Perhaps that's true. I know when I was liberated at an early age from working I took to bike riding 2 hours every day, stopped drinking beer, lost 75 pounds, started eating healthy, started reading books like this one, and became obsessed about learning about the universe and grateful for everyday I had to pursue what interests me the most (and opiods and screen staring had very little appeal for me). The author also had a weird Frankfurt School philosophy point of view throughout the book. Harari is a historian and this book is not a philosophy book as much as it is a historical or sociological book. He does quote from Nietzsche frequently, but in some places this book read like ""Closing of the American Mind"" by Allan Bloom (he's of the Frankfurt School as is Leo Strauss and Saul Bellow). They just don't like Nietzsche's relativism no matter what and this book makes the absurd claim that Beethoven's music is superior to Chuck Berry's music. I'm going to end that dumb assertion by the author who claims data would prove him right by asserting a young man alive in 1958 and wanted to meet that pretty girl over there and they both are attuned with their time period and singing ""Johnny B Goode"" is a way for him to meet her. Would that not show for that young man that Chuck Berry's music is superior, regardless of a stupid computer algorithm. The author puts together a masterpiece by weaving various threads to tell about how he believes our world will become. We don't live in an atomized world (that's part of why he rejects item 1 of individualism). Each part that we know gets its understanding from the whole and belongs in the web of knowledge. That's why climate change deniers are as irrelevant as a creationist would be. Both have no concept of the nature of reality and want to atomize knowledge (each item in science fits in a spider like web (see Willard van Orman Quine for amplification) and interacts with all the pieces around it, climate deniers can’t deny all of science so they latch on to anomalies that have no relevance beyond themselves). Harari talks about how that kind of thought culminated with Descartes' 'cogito ergo sum' and a lot of this book shows how that kind of thinking is poison for progress."

“Modernity is a surprisingly simple deal. The entire contract can be summarised in a single phrase: humans agree to give up meaning in exchange for power.”
I've picked up Homo Deus shortly after finishing Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, thinking this book about future will be a kind of sequel. And it was, kind of. Still, I don't recommend reading them closely together. Homo Deus builds on the ideas and interpretations of history he detailed in Sapiens. Probably to make the two books stand-alones and not require the knowledge of the other book to understand this one, Harari repeats and rehashes a lot of the material. The text is not the same, but his points and ideas behind the text are. They are interesting and I like them, but for the first half of the book, I thought I would give it 3 stars because the repetition happened too soon for me. And then part II happened. Humanism thought that experiences occur inside us, and that we ought to find within ourselves the meaning of all that happens, thereby infusing the universe with meaning. Dataists believe that experiences are valueless if they are not shared, and that we need not – indeed cannot – find meaning within ourselves. We need only record and connect our experience to the great data flow, and the algorithms will discover its meaning and tell us what to do.When Harari actually got to talking about the future, the different possibilities and their implications, my mind was blown again. I was thinking, crying, arguing, trembling under the blanket, and reading on. The book provoked all kinds of thought and feelings, it impacted me in a big way. Naturally, it goes to my 'favorites' shelf now.Kudos to Harari for once again showing he can write an entertaining and thought-provoking book of speculation. "

This should appeal to anyone who writes or reads as Harari´s thesis rests on the fact that we - homo sapiens - need to believe in things, be it money, flags, countries, companies, stories or even ourselves. Here, as well as showing how we got to where we are, he shows us how our reliance on technology, algorithms and being told what to do may prove to be our eventual undoing. What do we value more - consciousness or intelligence? Does consciousness really matter when intelligent machines - intelligent people - can do things better than us, more safely than us, and more perfectly? If you look at your phone instead of looking out of the window to see what the weather´s like, you might like to examine the gulf between our romantic views of our species and the cold reality."

More people die from old age than from infectious diseases or plagues and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals combined. For the first time in history humankind's three major problems that have remain unchanged from the days of the Pharaohs in Egypt, to the ancient Greeks and Chinese, and to the Victorian British, have been famine, plague and war. This has now been transformed through breakthroughs in the fields of medicine, science, technology, politics and through enlightenment in consciousnesses in humans as to what is right and wrong. Of course there are plenty of cases where things still go amiss, but in comparison to how things used to be, humanity's major problems and issues for the future are going to be a new set of challenges. Maybe humankind will have to decide between economic growth or ecological stability? The same growth that has provided economic growth and abundant food, medicine, energy and raw materials, also destabilises the planets ecological equilibrium. Pollution, climate change, global warming may all be having detrimental affects on the planet that humankind hasn't fully explored. The book is split up into three parts based on Harari's interpretation of history, his theory on how it led us to how humanity is in the present day, and his predictions on our future, each based on possibilities, hypothetical assumptions and philosophical speculations. Harari explains in some depth why and how we are a humanist society, which is important in understanding his beliefs as to where humanity is heading. His prediction is based on what humans will try to achieve in the twenty first century - not what it will succeed in achieving. He says that his forecast of the future may not be terribly original, however it is based on a liberal humanist approach of ideas and hopes that have dominated the world for 300 years. He argues that humanism sanctifies the life, emotions and desires of humans, so it isn't too difficult or far fetched to predict it will follow that humans will next want to significantly lengthen human lifespans, happiness and power. Take our current society based on humanism out of the equation, and humanity's future may indeed be very different, instead based on a future born of ideas and hopes of the twenty first century that we currently struggle to imagine or comprehend. The final third part of the book argues that attempting to realise this liberal humanist dream will eventually undermine its very foundations, by unleashing new post-humanist technologies and scientific discoveries. These discoveries could be the downfall of liberalism. If humans no longer control the running of the world, would the biggest threat be from biotechnology and artificial intelligence? What new religion would replace liberalism? Harari believes it would be techno religions in the form of the more conservative techno humanism and the more terrifying data religion. Techno humanism thinks that Homo sapiens, as we know it today, will not be relevant in the future but will still cling to many humanist values. It believes that we should therefore use technology to upgrade Homo sapiens into a far superior human model; homo deus. Dataism doesn't see humans as the pinnacle of creation - it worships data, not humans - and states that the universe consists of data flows, with the value of any entity or phenomenon determined by its contribution to data processing. The scary thing is that either of Hirari's proposed eventual hypothesis are possible, just as there are further scenarios that may lie in humankinds future, scenarios we as humans could not even begin to fathom due to our current limitations. If you enjoy having your personal beliefs and thoughts challenged, this book definitely fires up your electrochemical brain processes. Harari's views on history and how it shaped our world today, may open up new ways of looking at things to the reader. He dissects the past and takes us on a journey, so that we can see why humanity is a liberal humanist society today and what it could mean for our future. Harari also ponders the big questions of the meaning and the point of life. The debates and issues raised in the book are thought inspiring and certainly made me contemplate some new ideas. I can see this book being scoffed at by overly religious people, or people with closed mindsets, due to some of Harari's beliefs - such as the soul doesn't exist, the true self is imaginary, and that we fundamentally live pointless lives as data processing units. However, his arguments do make sense if you can think about it reasonably and logically. As Harari states, the scenarios in the book aren't prophesies, but possibilities. He attempts to explain how our present day conditioning came about in order to loosen its hold on our imagination and broaden our horizons. You don't have to agree with everything he writes, but it is an interesting debate and will definitely make you ponder and contemplate the many issues that humanity will ultimately face.Thanks very much to Random House UK Vintage Publishing, Yuval Noah Harari and Net Galley for a copy of this ARC in exchange for a review."

Humanism (inluding democracy, human rights and the underlying notion of free will) is apparently yesterday's news, as humans are outdated algorithms that are being superseded by 'the internet of all things'. The author unreservedly advocates surrendering our privacy and autonomy to 'algorithms', as Google and Facebook already supposedly know us better than we know ourselves. Allowing Google to read our emails is a recurring example, although Google actually recently stopped doing just that. It is one of many signs Harari is oversimplifying history (for instance, idealizing capitalism and neoliberalism, which conveniently allows him to refrain from mentioning criticism of Google and Facebook who only harvest our data for the financial gain of themselves and their shareholders, instead of improving mankind; or his statement that all life forms are merely data processing systems and that all of science agrees with that view) and the current state of affairs, in order to present a narrowminded, dystopian view of the future of mankind that is likely to earn him many additional invitations to TED Talks and other well-paid speaking gigs. The last pages are puzzling: it's where Harari unexpectedly backtracks and states we are perhaps not just algorithms after all; it's where he states he really wanted to broaden our horizon instead of presenting an inescapable view of the future - although that is *exactly* what he has done. It reads as a hastily added disclaimer that is written as a defense to all the valid criticism I envisage proofreaders may have presented to him - which is more convenient than rewriting the entire book, but it does seem that that is exactly what he should have done. This the type of book that distinguishes shortcut-seeking 'thought leaders' from bona fide public intellectuals, and Harari, regrettably and unexpectedly, seems to want to set up shop in the former camp."
56,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13298726-michael-perkins,3,"The author begins with the argument that individual human beings have no inherent value and that there is no such thing as individualism, that we are simply a collection of chemicals and neurons. He essentially mocks liberal humanism for placing any value in people as such. He argues that the advance of technology will only make this more so. In a sense, this is an old argument. The second wave of the industrial revolution had this effect and life expectancy plummeted. I've read Homo Sapiens. A lot of repetition of it in this book, with a wordy expansion of the final chapter of Sapiens. Many of his ideas are already dated, such as the importance of Big Data.

58,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/679134-bryan-alexander,2,"What an enormously disappointing book.I enjoyed the first half of Harari's first book,Sapiens, and looked forward to this one. As a futurist I have to read books trying to scope out what's coming next. I also hoped his wry humor would reappear.Instead, I've been trying to choose a book rating between one and two stars.To begin with, the bulk of Homo Deus is not about the future of humanity. Instead it's a breezy tour of some aspects of human history and culture. The reason for that digression (more than one half the book!) is to ground two scenarios about the future, but it doesn't work well, and ultimately wastes a lot of time. The kernel of Homo Deus is just over one hundred pages (start with chapter 9).At best that tour is potted history, reminding us that liberal democracy appeared in the late 1700s, that industrialism changed civilization, that secularization is a thing, etc. It's akin to clicking through Wikipedia. At worst Harari offers his snap judgments on different developments, which are dubious. For example, he brutalizes Marxism in typical ways (it's a religion, it's really a form of therapy, etc). There's also a long digression about animal rights which turns out to play no meaningful role in the rest of the book. After the first 100 pages of this I stopped taking notes, because I would end up with my own book in response, and I'm busy starting a very different book.When Homo Deus finally gets around to addressing its purpose (subtitle: ""A Brief History of Tomorrow"") (and that part really is brief), the text is entirely drawn from current events and popular discussion. Readers can extract the highlights from any number of bloggers or articles. Automation's becoming big? Check. Biological sciences are advancing rapidly? Check. Data is increasingly important? Yup. The internet of things looms large? Uh huh.So what's useful in it?The author offers several visions of the future wherein human civilization experiences a major transformation. A key step is the decline of ""liberalism"" (a rough grab-bag for representative democracy, some kinds of individualism, some form of capitalism, a touch of pluralism) in the face of biology and technology. The life sciences and computation have shifted us towards a new notion of people driven by genetic forces and best apprehended through data. Side effects include some loss of privacy, a setting aside of democracy (maybe? this isn't developed, hilariously), and increasing class divides. Interestingly, Harari backs away from the singularity idea.Even more interesting, and, for me, more depressing, is the book's refusal to take inequality seriously. That is, Homo Deus is very interested in how technology and life sciences could expand socio-economic inequality, and how some cultural responses could happen, but isn't concerned with actual economics or politics. There's no sense of business being interested in keeping compensation low, of regulatory capture by the financial sector, or of why unionization might have declined. Similarly the book isn't concerned about national security states; it prefers to wonder about Facebook rather than the NSA.I admit to enjoying some instances of Harari's humor. I like his paralleling of gods, states, and businesses, for instance. It's not a new idea, but I'm always glad to see anarchist concepts in the mainstream. I appreciate his thorough skepticism about religions, too.Yet overall this is one of those books which becomes easier to bear the more quickly you read it. It *might* be a fun read for secondary school students who haven't been excited about history. Otherwise, skip the thing."

Sapiens
? Remember how it brilliantly explained all of human history? Well, now Yuval Noah Harari explains some of the possibilities for humanity's future.Picking up on his thesis of humans as storytellers, he looks at the main stories we've told: religion and humanism and how they may fare in an increasingly technological world. The old certainties are built on these old stories. Can liberalism and democracy survive in a world where the biological algorithms of our bodies bring free will into question? What is our role when data and AI become ubiquitous? Assuming no easy answers - nor any certainty about his own predictions - Harari again shows why he is the new Jared Diamond."

He points out the lenses we look through of culture and philosophy, and challenges to look beyond. The subtitle is misleading, as the futurism discussion starts very late in the book. The first half of the book is very similar to Sapiens, and even re-hashes large portions of it. This book excelled in explaining humanism in its philosophical and cultural descendants, and the transition that we are living in right now."
61,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58035793-hiba-arrame,3,"Finally finishing this book after having to pause its reading for a while now. It wasn't as good as Sapiens, but not bad either. The thing is, I just didn't find what the description of the book promised, the only part where the writer evokes how the future of humanity ""might"" be is the very first one, as for the remaining two parts, they weren't that important, especially the second one that I found was mere ranting about everything and nothing, without being related to the subject of the book in any way.The point of strength in Yuval Harari's writing is the easy language and the smoothness in presenting the information. Weak points? While writing his ""theories"", Harari acts as if he owns the ultimate truth, and talks about so many things as if they're absolute imagination. That is the main weakness that can make even a great writer produce a rolling-eyes book because that's what I did mostly during all of the 450 pages.Still, reading this kind of books is an essential thing for every reader, even though Harari, the same as many scientists and writers departing from materialistic views, end up with the same conclusions. All the time. It is essential to read these views, not because we agree with them, nor because they behold the ultimate truth that we're seeking, but only because they make you reflect, they intrigue the mind and sharpen the senses as a friend of mine said.A friendly advice is, if you are easily provoked by non-religious views, and can easily be driven out of your senses, I advise you to put this book down and choose another one. If you feel yourself standing on firm grounds which are your beliefs, then reading this book, with all the author's imposition of non-religious views, won't move you an inch. It would only make you think about what is worth thinking about.To wrap it up, here are the three questions Harari ended up his book with, and I reckon need to be subject to our reflections: 1. Are organisms really just algorithms, and is life really just data processing?2. What’s more valuable – intelligence or consciousness?3. What will happen to society, politics and daily life when non-conscious buthighly intelligent algorithms know us better than we know ourselves?"

Still, the ability of Yuval Noah Harari to put at work ideas coming from different fields of knowledge is just amazing. Feminism is probably the only ingredient that wasn’t put to boil. But, yeah, our propensity to trust internet with personal data, grow dependent on wifi and delegate decision-making to powerful algorithms is unprecedented and leads us god knows where."

65,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4729639-krista,3,"Like capitalism, Dataism too began as a neutral scientific theory, but is now mutating into a religion that claims to determine right and wrong. The supreme value of this new religion is 'information flow'. If life is the movement of information, and if we think that life is good, it follows that we should extend, deepen and spread the flow of information in the universe. According to Dataism, human experiences are not sacred and Homo sapiens isn't the apex of creation or the precursor of some future Homo deus. Humans are merely the tools for creating the Internet-of-All-Things, which may eventually spread out from planet Earth to cover the whole galaxy and even the whole universe. This cosmic data-processing system would be like God. It will be everywhere and will control everything, and humans are destined to merge into it.In Homo Deus – the follow-up to his bestselling Sapiens – Yuval Noah Harari recaps the sorry history of mankind, unmasks the reality of our meaningless present, and shares his vision for our irrelevant future. As with the previous book, I found Harari's misanthropy to be patience-straining and not necessarily supported by the “facts” he shares; yet once again, I found his writing to be engaging and interesting, and reading this book wasn't a waste of my time. I concluded that if I thought of Harari's work as philosophy – pure opinion based on what he sees as the truth rather than a straight historical or scientific work – then it's much more palatable. I marked so many passages as I went along (many more than shared here), so I'm going to let Harari do most of the talking in this review.Once again, Harari's main thesis is that there's nothing very special about Sapiens; through chance and random mutations, we became the apex species on Earth. This time, however, he adds that all life is designed to process algorithms and our true strength as a species has always been our ability to collaborate in large groups to do this work; with religion (which doesn't necessarily mean “the worship of gods”) developing as a means to compel us to behave cooperatively. Consequently, anything we sense within ourselves that makes us believe we are superior to other lifeforms – that we have a “mind” or a “soul” – is pure delusion. Harari cites some fMRI studies (a field which is dismissed as the voodoo of neuroscience by many experts) which found no evidence for the mind as a physical object, and then proceeds as though the absence of proof is definitively the proof of absence:
Some scientists concede that consciousness is real and may actually have great moral and political value, but that it fulfills no biological function whatsoever. Consciousness is the biologically useless by-product of certain brain processes...If this is true, it implies that all the pain and pleasure experienced by billions of creatures for millions of years is just mental pollution. This is certainly a thought worth thinking, even if it isn't true.
Consider that last line closely: This is certainly a thought worth thinking, even if it isn't true. Harari also briefly goes over his anti-soul argument: since Sapiens evolved from earlier lifeforms, and the soul is supposed to have appeared suddenly in just our species, the soul itself couldn't have evolved from an earlier prototype (as in the evolution of the human eye from primitive light-sensing organs), and therefore, doesn't exist. He then extrapolates this “proof” to the conclusion that Sapiens don't have free will; even murderers are simply at the mercy of the chemical and electrical processes in their brains of which they aren't consciously aware: 
Once we accept that there is no soul, and that humans have no inner essence called 'the self', it no longer makes sense to ask, 'How does the self choose its desires?' It's like asking a bachelor, 'How does your wife choose her clothes?' In reality, there is only a stream of consciousness, and desires arise and pass within this stream, but there is no permanent self who owns the desires, hence it is meaningless to ask whether I choose my desires deterministically, randomly or freely.
Obviously, this has serious moral implications: in the early days of human civilisation, we followed a moral code in order to please the gods. Once we killed our gods – with the rise of liberalism – we still followed a moral code because we believed in the inherent dignity and value of individual humans. If we can now “prove” that we are special neither as a collective nor as individuals, where does that leave humanity?
What, then, is the meaning of life? Liberalism maintains that we shouldn't expect an external entity to provide us with some ready-made meaning. Rather, each individual voter, customer and viewer ought to use his or her free will in order to create meaning not just for his or her life but for the entire universe.The life sciences undermine liberalism, arguing that the free individual is just a fictional tale concocted by an assembly of biochemical algorithms. Every moment, the biochemical mechanisms of the brain create a flash of experience, which immediately disappears. Then more flashes appear and fade, appear and fade, in quick succession. These momentary experiences do not add up to any enduring essence. The narrating self tries to impose order on this chaos by spinning a never-ending story, in which every such experience has its place, and hence every experience has some lasting meaning. But, as convincing and tempting as it may be, this story is a fiction.
So, we have neither minds nor souls, our emotions are chemical responses and our every action is predetermined by our internal wiring. The activities that we've always assumed could never be replicated by computers – writing beautiful music or besting a chess champion – have come to pass, and in the near future, everyone from taxi drivers to doctors will be replaced by microchips. What's the point in even keeping humans around? Harari proposes that it was the need for cannon fodder and salt miners that urged the ruling elite to extend the welfare state throughout the twentieth century, but if only the super rich will be able to afford the coming grasps at immortality – and since the masses who can't afford the biotechnical upgrades won't have any jobs anyway – average humans will soon be seen for exactly what they are: 
The great human projects of the twentieth century – overcoming famine, plague and war – aimed to safeguard a universal norm of abundance, health and peace for all people without exception. The new projects of the twenty-first century – gaining immortality, bliss and divinity – also hope to serve the whole of humankind. However, because these projects aim to surpass rather than safe-guarding the norm, they may well result in the creation of a new superhuman caste that will abandon its liberal roots and treat normal humans no better than nineteenth-century Europeans treated Africans.
Putting aside worries about evil bankers and tech billionaires, if all of life is here simply to process logarithms, and we have now created computers that can outprocess even humans, should we be frightened for the future? Harari doesn't see us being blindsided by a robot uprising, but he does warn of us sleepwalking towards irrelevancy: with every Facebook like and Google search, each of us is adding to the massive database of the human experience, and once that is complete, there simply won't be a need for flesh and blood Sapiens.
In the high days of European imperialism, conquistadors and merchants bought entire islands and countries in exchange for coloured beads. In the twenty-first century our personal data is probably the most valuable resource most humans still have to offer, and we are giving it to the tech giants in exchange for email services and funny cat videos. 
Here's my basic beef with this whole book: Harari repeatedly makes definitive statements based on sketchy proofs – “the only purpose to life is processing algorithms”, “the mind doesn't exist”, “there's no such thing as free will” – and then proceeds to build on these planks as though they are incontrovertible; remove one plank and the whole edifice falls. In the end, even Harari says that the future is unknowable and the purpose of Homo Deus is simply to give something to think about; and especially as we do seem to be sleepwalking towards something never seen before on Earth. And that's a worthwhile subject to read about."

I actually described this book to a colleague by comparing it to a conversation between a group of smart people who each just took a large bump of cocaine. It’s impassioned, but rambling, filled with speculation but lacking any coherent argument. In short, it’s a mess.Generally, I dislike appeals to authority, but I feel I should preface this by saying that I am an expert in cognitive science, and I’ve been working with data for well over a decade. Unfortunately, the way cognitive science research is presented in this book is not grounded within the scope of the empirical findings. Indeed, I often found myself scratching my head trying to figure out how Harari got from, say, Gazzaniga’s research on split-brain patients to the idea that we’re all going to be ruled by computer-algorithm overlords and rich cyborgs. The main problem is that Harari writes as if his ideas are grounded in reality, when, in truth, they’re pure fiction. If you’re interested in speculative futurism, go watch Star Trek or read The Expanse. And, if you’re looking for a discussion of the future grounded in current scientific research, do yourself a favor and give this incoherent piece of drivel a hard pass. "

The one thing that appeals about future humans possibly being able to live for 3, 4 or even 5 hundred years is that the one thing that evolution has not provided - a long enough life span to really understand processes on a historical level. Global we're getting better at, how things happening elsewhere affects environment at ours often works fine, if the span is time, however, no such luck. One dark part of Harari's new book that stayed with me is the fact that humans do horrible things for what they believe are the right reasons. Fast forward a hundred years and a descendant do pretty much the same - only the actual reasons shifted. Not seldom they more or less have been inverted. I believe that this is both due to our inability to really understand our ancestors, the world they lived in, what the based their decisions on - and at the same time, we cannot picture the ones that will come after us. And certainly not the fact that much of what we think is the ultimate truths, correct reasons and right way to reason will be regarded by them as ignorance, delusions and lack of comprehension. Basically, we understand the current status - and most of us work very hard to secure status quo.""Homo Deus"" is even better that it's predecessor ""Sapiens: En kort historik över mänskligheten"" in my opinion. The subtitle; ""A Brief History of Tomorrow"", is slightly misleading though. Most of the text actually covers and expand the same ground as the first book and is really more of an expose over how we got where we are and, based on current status, where we might go from here. It's a good thing that the author writes so accessible, because it is often a hard read. But at the same time it's often an entertaining one at that, many of the realizations why we are like we are, do what we do and like what we like are not only plausible and a bit mindbending, but quite funny at times. What drives me towards despair more than anything, is while Harari explains the logical outcome of historical events, gained knowledge and experience, I'm left with the feeling that our own time constitutes a badly scratched record; how is it that we in 2017 seem to be very far from shaking some bronze age superstitions that affect our daily life profoundly? I hope for coming generations that this is just me and my flawed historical perspective and grasp and that the process are ticking along nicely, despite what I think I see. The book should really be read by everyone - unfortunately, those who stand to gain most from doing so will most likely proclaim the author ""wrong"" and wash their hands of it. "

Very well expressed, and oftentimes felt quite blunt - but then, Harari is talking about what is rather than what we tell ourselves. He's skewering principals and ideals and stories humans believe about ourselves, to see what really happened in the past through a different lens and therefore to see where we might evolve next. The fact that we can boil down humans to algorithms and life to data processing is uncomfortable. But then, the near future (or the far future) might be too."

The first part bravely states and vigorously defends a quite provocative thesis; that humanity will seek, and likely become immortal and godlike over the next century or so. There are many good and thought-provoking arguments presented for this.Yet the thinking is frequently sloppy.For example the book says that: In the twentieth century we have almost doubled life expectancy from forty to seventy, so in the twenty-first century we should at least be able to double it again to 150. -- but this is a common misconception. Child mortality used to be very high, and that is the main reason longevity was so low previously. People who survived long enough to become teenagers has had a life-expectancy of 65+ for many centuries. Medical progress in the age at which people actually die of old age related illnesses has NOT been doubling over the last century.Another even clearer example of a sloppy mistake is claiming that a surgeon with a good internet-connection could perform surgery remotely ""on Mars"" -- this ignores the speed-of-light delay which for Mars varies between 5 and 25 minutes; you can hardly perform surgery when it takes half an hour from you perform some tiny moment and until you can see the result of your movement.The most face-slappingly stupidity in the book though, and what in my eyes lost it a star was the authors naive reductionist argument against free will that can be summarized as ""individual atoms do not have free will, therefore things (such as humans) made of atoms can't have free will either"". On this flimsiest of foundations rests several chapters, and that really is inexcusable.Even worse, the author does seemingly not even notice that he contradicts himself CONSTANTLY by saying things like ""Human beings do not have free will, therefore we should ...""Uhm, I hate to break it to him, but if we do not have free will, then the very word ""should"" and all recommendations for behavior are utterly meaningless, because a lack of free will also implies that we don't have any choice at all about what to do; instead we're mindless automata that do what we do guided solely by external inputs and perhaps randomness. There can be no ""should"" in a world without free will.If you can ignore glaring inconsistencies and sloppy arguing like this then the book genuinely do have quite a few interesting ideas in it though; and although some of the arguments are sloppy there's also some good parts. Recommended to people interested in the future that are not too bothered by the presence of some weak parts."

Narari can certainly write and capture your attention. I suspect in large part that is why this book received such high reviews on GoodReads: it is an easy book to pick-up and read.I struggled, however, with many of his claims and often erroneous statements. On several occasions I found myself turning to his footnotes for further information. What I often found was a list of sources without any explanation of why the sources supported his claims. Moreover, he presents a rather simplistic review of history, such as:1. Medieval Period = A simplistic time when people blindly obeyed religious leaders who used their ""knowledge"" for their own purposes.2. Science freed people from the chains of religious ignorance, and gave way to a new religion, humanism.3. In our time, the human person has replaced God but only for so long. Soon, artificial intelligence will replace humans and we will encounter a whole new set of problems and challenges.Harari paints with broad strokes and more often than not offers a less-than-nuanced review of history, contemporary and future developments. More often than not, I found most of the material of this book to have been covered better in other books."

I even researched author's background to have better understanding of his perspective. In my opinion, this is primarily philosophical devagation and oversimplification of science. If you are humanist or philosopher, who always hated biology, chemistry, physics, math and your interest in those subjects ended at the level of high school - there is a chance you may enjoy this book. At the end it is written by a historian. Very good one. However, if you have a strong medical and scientific background, you might be annoyed by oversimplifications and plain wrong statements, like the fact that eating sugar is an etiology of diabetes - just to give one example. I didn't agree with author even on some philosophical subjects, like his statement that only pleasent sensation in the body can cause happiness. If that would be a case, there would be little to no hope for people with chronic disease and disabilities to ever be happy.My basic expectation toward nonfiction literature is that it will teach me something or stimulate me to think about something.

Well, no way to erase that data now. I guess I'll just keep on being me. On a more serious note, Homo Deus is a pretty solid attempt at envisioning the future of humanity as we know it to be today. The ""deus"" part of it is not a reference to an all-knowing all-powerful Bible God that the human being aspires to become, but rather, as Harari himself explains in the first part of the book, a Greek God like Zeus, Aphrodite or Hades, each a powerful being in their own right, but not all-powerful by themselves. Harari's ideas bring into questions things such as bio-technologies, data processing and how the birthing of a new human society might look nothing like what we see in our wildest dreams nowadays.

79,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61033954-m-r,5,"Well! here we go...On almost every page of Sapiens, a bible of mankind’s cultural and economic and philosophical evolution, our millennial battles with plague and war and famine, Harari announced himself a Zen-like student of historical paradox: “We did not domesticate wheat,” he wrote, “wheat domesticated us”; or “How do you cause people to believe in an imagined order such as Christianity, democracy or capitalism? First, you never admit that the order is imagined.” The most intriguing section of a wildly intriguing book was the last. Harari’s history of our 75,000 years wound up, as all bibles are apt to do, with apocalyptic prophesy, a sense of an ending.Humanity, Harari predicted, would engineer one more epochal event to rival the agricultural and scientific revolutions. Having evolved to exercise a measure of mastery over our environment, having begun to shape not only our planet, for better and worse, but also our biology, we stand, he argued, at the point of creating networked intelligences with a far greater capacity for reason than our own. The result was likely to be a lose-lose scenario for the species. Sapiens would disappear in the foreseeable future either because they had appropriated such mind-making powers as to become unrecognisable or because they had destroyed themselves through environmental catastrophe. Either way, judgment day was approaching.Harari is mostly, thrillingly or chillingly, sanguine about this prospect. He has an ethicist’s sense of rough justice: what Homo sapiens (in its wisdom) has visited on the natural world through industrialised food production will perhaps one day be visited on Homo sapiens. Individuals will become a just a collection of “biochemical subsystems” monitored by global networks, which will inform us second by second how we feel…Or perhaps, as Harari is stringent about reminding the reader, they will not. Like all rune-reading, this one comes with plenty of small print. From where we stand, he says, in the accelerating present, no long-term future is imaginable, still less predictable – and there is plenty of time for questions. Harari’s sometimes breathless, always compulsive inquiry leaves us with this one: “What’s more valuable – intelligence or consciousness?” Google will be no help in providing the answer."

In ""Sapiens"", Harari took us on a trip throughout history; in ""Homo Deus"", he briefly revisits some of that history in order to explain why we are where we are today, and then, takes us to where we might be in the future if we continue our present trends. This book is fascinating, Harari is brilliant and offers us an extremely insightful look into the possible future of humanity. Will our technology soon grant us immortality as we engineer our own bodies, turning ourselves into gods? Or will our technology make us redundant, perhaps even obsolete?

83,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13716226-murtaza,3,"This book is the sequel to Yuval Noah Harari's much celebrated history of the human race ""Sapiens"", published a few years ago and recommended by none other than Barack Obama. Among other things Harari's books provide an insight into how the ruling elites of our society think about the world and where its going, with ""Homo Deus"" being similarly endorsed by national leaders and other elites. Sapiens started with mankind's prehistory and charted the development of the species up until the present day, hinting at the role that new technologies were about to play in putting an end to the genus ""homo sapiens"" once and for all, by modifying it beyond all recognition. Homo Deus takes that ending as its jumping off point, exploring how artificial intelligence, genetic modification, powerful algorithms and ""big data"" are on the verge of upending all of humanity's established codes of morality and reasoning, while transforming us (or at least an elite among us) as a species so fundamentally that we will no longer bear any resemblance to our homo sapiens ancestors. In the fullness of time, Harari argues, the transformation within human beings wrought by technology will be as stark and unfathomable as the change that saw our species shift from homo erectus all the way to homo sapiens, millions of years ago.The book begins by discussing the emergence of mankind's preeminent modern religion, humanism. Whereas in previous eras human beings drew meaning from a variety of external sources such as textual religions and animist beliefs, today the primary mode through which most people to give meaning to the world is by evaluating how external phenomena impacts their own inner lives, as well as the lives of those around them. In pre-modern times most people would have judged the merit of an action in relation to how it stacked up to the prescriptions of a religious text, an astrological reading or the response of an animal that was roughly our equal in nature. Now we judge the merit of any activity based on how it makes us as human beings feel, as well as how it affects the feelings of others. Humankind and its own concerns are the primary stage stage for any moral valuation, and, according to humanism, human feelings are also enough to imbue meaning to the world itself, no God necessary. Even many ostensibly religious people have internalized humanist thinking, framing their religious arguments in terms of worldly justice and respect, rather than in purely textual ones. According to Harari, this self-sanctification has helped facilitate remarkable improvements in mankind's well-being. But it has also opened the door for homo sapiens to both create and accept the use of technologies so powerful that they will eventually lead to the abolition of the species itself. In fact, this abolition is already under way, with human beings increasingly surrendering their information and autonomy to unaccountable technologies that are turning us all into inputs and outputs in a giant system so complex that no one alive can completely fathom it - all in the blind belief that it is in our own interest.As advances in AI and genetic manipulation continue, over the course of the next decades human beings are set to start reach for their greatest goals: immortality and permanent happiness. But reaching these goals or even striving for them will require people to surrender more of our own sovereignty to computer algorithms that will make our optimal life choices for us, while modifying our biological makeup to the point where we are no longer the same species that we once were. Anti-depressants and smartphones are just the start: people will soon be able to engineer their brains to experience whichever moods they like, while passing on the authority to conduct life decisions to personal AI's (like super-evolved versions of Siri) that know more about us than we do ourselves, and that are able to optimize our life decisions better than we ever could on our own. Humans will also soon be able to upgrade their bodies and regenerate organs, radically extending their lives. Of course there will be a massive disparity in access to these technologies, with the rich upgrading themselves to a degree far greater than the poor and potentially initiating a type of extreme inequality that mankind has never experienced in its history.A thing that I found particularly interesting in the book is how technological change is set to upset our moral order, and how our traditional religions have been ill-equipped to guide people through the rapid changes initiated by liquid modernity. At best they have provided anchors, but not maps to help guide us through a world of increasingly bewildering technological change. As Harari eloquently explains, the reason that Marxism was so successful as a modern religion (and he insists Marxism, capitalism and socialism etc. are all religions that imposed a particular ethical order, sans supernatural beliefs) was that it accurately analyzed the technological and economic basis of society as it existed at the time, thus offering ordinary people a way of thinking about the world that was highly relevant to their lives. Most of our older religious traditions simply have nothing to say about what AI or genetic manipulation mean or how people should respond to them, let alone what the new theological implications will be when ordinary lives are extended indefinitely or when consciousness and intelligence begins to be transferred to inorganic systems. As a person who believes in the value of religious spirituality, I have to concede that Harari has a point about the current inadequacy of religion to formulate responses to these questions. I disagree with his assertion that human beings are nothing more than algorithms and I suspect this obsession with describing things as ""algorithms"" is itself reflective of a contemporary fad (to his credit, he also concedes this possibility), but I do think that any religion that wants to stay relevant needs to grapple effectively with the moral questions being raised by technological change, before they end up being replaced by entirely new cults and messianic movements. AI is not merely another neutral ""tool"" and neither is social media for that matter, thus urgent moral and philosophical engagement is necessary.A lot has been said about the authoritarian philosophies driving Silicon Valley, but Harari does a good job here of explaining how the tech world is effectively on the verge of abolishing liberalism itself without anyone even noticing. In a world where AI's have all the information about us and are increasingly making our optimal decisions for us, what basis is there left to sanctify liberal shibboleths like ""individual choice"" or ""free will""? Moreover, if we develop AI's that are better than us at any human task and entrust them with running society as effectively as possible, what's stopping the AI's themselves from one day just declaring many humans to be superfluous to the effective maintenance of that society? Just as we treat animals that are less intellectually developed as inferior species subject to effective slavery, it is entirely possible that an AI-dominated world (or a world with AI's alongside an elite of genetically-modified humans) might one day decide that ordinary homo sapiens are just as useless and contemptible as the cattle we mistreat today. Ironically, if AI's or genetically-modified elites did decide this, there is no way that we'd be able to compete, given that no ordinary human being can compute algorithms with the power of the AI's that are now coming into existence. Although such a world sounds like dystopic science fiction, it is already starting to emerge through advances in technology you can read about in the news on a daily basis. Just like the Industrial Revolution started in a small corner of England before radically upending the entire planet, we are on the cusp of having our entire worlds destroyed and remade by a small, opaque group of elites in Silicon Valley who don't seem to place a high value on our liberal pieties.The last bit of the book discusses new belief systems and religions that Harari expects to gain prominence in our Brave New World, including ""Dataism,"" which is effectively a mystical belief that the purpose of all beings in the world is to collect, process and transmit data in a cycle that will eventually make the world more and more advanced, before eventually encompassing the entire universe. This was the effective religion of Aaron Swartz and many others who have fought for the freedom of all information (a very different thing from freedom of speech), seeing it as the means by which the world can advance towards its true purpose of....something. According to Dataism, human beings reached the apex of world power because they were the best data processors and transmitters, homo sapiens as a species itself being nothing more than another biological algorithm that was simply more effective than its competitors. In the near future, if we develop algorithms that are better than us at accumulating and processing data, there is no need for us even to exist, if you accept Dataism's tenets. The development of the world and the universe can continue on without us, a species made obsolete by its own inventions, which are of course more effective at processing data than any ordinary human could ever dream of being.Suffice to say, this is a profoundly disturbing book. Surprisingly Harari is actually a historian and not a scientist, but he manages to lay out the current scientific dogma which claims that human beings are merely algorithms without any meaningful essence beyond that, and that anything that could be described as a ""core identity"" or ""individual will"" does not actually exist within a person. This seems like a bit of an arrogant argument particularly since he concedes ignorance about the existence of consciousness, which intelligence does not require and from which it is fast decoupling, through the advent of AI. I also think that Harari sometimes suffers from the same kind of pedantic reductiveness that might go to a restaurant and see, instead of a hamburger, merely the component parts of bread, meat, cheese and lettuce, and then decide that this psychological dismemberment is actually some kind of great philosophical insight. Personally I believe that human beings are something more than the spare parts he describes and that those who sincerely endeavor through philosophy and religious practice could see why that is the case, though I grant that Harari is eloquent in making his materialist argument. He also raises interesting questions of modified and expanded states of consciousness, very similar to those described by many spiritual traditions today.As much an ordinary person may dislike the new data-centric world that Harari is describing, it is hard to argue that it is not coming into existence. In exchange for power, modern people have made technology their God, and it is increasingly becoming possible to picture a world in which there is no conceivable purpose for human beings any longer. Not even art is safe, as algorithms are increasingly showing themselves to be better than humans in this rarefied field, not to mention in medicine, writing and law. In Islam these changes would seem to correlate with the Day of Judgement and the end of humanity. The irony is that most people, myself not exempted, will likely ease into this oblivion, gladly surrendering more and more of ourselves to this tech-driven world until there is nothing left besides it. The only faint hope Harari offers is that the very act of studying how we got here and where we may be going may help make us make different choices. In one moving passage, he describes where the convention of keeping a household lawn came from (it came from aristocratic Europe), to show how a knowledge of history can help give us freedom to decide what we truly want for our future. All in all, I thought this book was enjoyable despite being quite rambling at times, and I would rank it slightly lower than Sapiens, where he was on more solid ground as a historian rather than a prophet."

Israeli professor of history and best-selling author, Yuval Noah Harari provides the public with a cerebral treat. In this fantastic book the perceptive professor looks into his crystal ball and makes fascinating and insightful predictions of the future of humanity, Homo Deus. This captivating 450-page book is broken out into the following three parts: Part I. Homo Sapiens Conquers the World, Part II. Homo Sapiens Gives Meaning to the World, and Part III. Homo Sapiens Loses Control.Positives:1.	Science writing at its best. This is an intellectual treat. 2.	A fascinating topic, the future of human kind in the hands of a gifted and perceptive author.3.	What drives this book is the combination of a fascinating topic, great rhythm, and keen intellectual insights into the future based on sound observations and research.4.	This book is loaded with intellectual nuggets. “For the first time in history, more people die today from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals combined.”5.	Makes great use of history to establish the foundation of the future. “Whereas in ancient agricultural societies human violence caused about 15 per cent of all deaths, during the twentieth century violence caused only 5 per cent of deaths, and in the early twenty-first century it is responsible for about 1 per cent of global mortality.”6.	Interesting take on terrorism. “Terrorism is a strategy of weakness adopted by those who lack access to real power.” “In most cases, this overreaction to terrorism poses a far greater threat to our security than the terrorists themselves.”7.	A look at humanity’s great next achievement. “Humanity’s next targets are likely to be immortality, happiness and divinity.” “For modern people death is a technical problem that we can and should solve.”8.	The reality of feelings. “According to the life sciences, happiness and suffering are nothing but different balances of bodily sensations.”9.	The paradox of historical knowledge. “The paradox of historical knowledge. Knowledge that does not change behaviour is useless. But knowledge that changes behaviour quickly loses its relevance. The more data we have and the better we understand history, the faster history alters its course, and the faster our knowledge becomes outdated.” 10.	Some statements are memorable. “The single greatest constant of history is that everything changes.11.	Discusses how humanism (the worship of humankind) has conquered the world. “Whereas the Agricultural Revolution gave rise to theist religions, the Scientific Revolution gave birth to humanist religions, in which humans replaced gods. While theists worship theos (Greek for ‘god’), humanists worship humans.”12.	The relationship between Homo sapiens and other animals, in an attempt to understand what makes our species so special. “There is zero scientific evidence that in contrast to pigs, Sapiens have souls.” “To the best of our knowledge, only Sapiens can cooperate in very flexible ways with countless numbers of strangers. This concrete capability – rather than an eternal soul or some unique kind of consciousness – explains our mastery of planet Earth.”13.	The grand theory of evolution, strikes again. “The theory of evolution maintains that all instincts, drives and emotions have evolved in the sole interest of survival and reproduction.” “Yet the life sciences doubt the existence of soul not just due to lack of evidence, but rather because the very idea of soul contradicts the most fundamental principles of evolution.”14.	Makes the compelling case that organisms are algorithms. “Humans are algorithms that produce not cups of tea, but copies of themselves (like a vending machine which, if you press the right combination of buttons, produces another vending machine).”15.	The professor is very fair on what we don’t know. “Scientists don’t know how a collection of electric brain signals creates subjective experiences. Even more crucially, they don’t know what could be the evolutionary benefit of such a phenomenon. It is the greatest lacuna in our understanding of life.”16.	Consciousness, a mind, oh my. “According to the Turing Test, in order to determine whether a computer has a mind, you should communicate simultaneously both with that computer and with a real person, without knowing which is which.” “As long as we haven’t deciphered the mysteries of consciousness, we cannot develop a universal measurement for happiness and suffering, and we don’t know how to compare the happiness and suffering of different individuals, let alone different species. How many units of happiness are generated when a billion Chinese enjoy cheaper electricity?”17.	Fascinating tidbits through out the book. “Sousa Mendes, armed with little more than a rubber stamp, was responsible for the largest rescue operation by a single individual during the Holocaust.”18.	Discusses the path it took our species to go from the last millennia to our present crossroads. “Many of the difficulties faced by present-day African countries stem from the fact that their borders make little sense.” “Blind faith in these stories meant that human efforts frequently focused on increasing the glory of fictional entities such as gods and nations, instead of bettering the lives of real sentient beings.” “However, religion is created by humans rather than by gods, and it is defined by its social function rather than by the existence of deities. Religion is any all-encompassing story that confers superhuman legitimacy on human laws, norms and values. It legitimises human social structures by arguing that they reflect superhuman laws.”19.	Discusses our current predicament and our possible futures. “Hence according to our best scientific knowledge, the Leviticus injunctions against homosexuality reflect nothing grander than the biases of a few priests and scholars in ancient Jerusalem.” 20.	Discusses the covenant between science and humanism. “Yet in fact modernity is a surprisingly simple deal. The entire contract can be summarised in a single phrase: humans agree to give up meaning in exchange for power.” “Modern culture rejects this belief in a great cosmic plan. We are not actors in any larger-than-life drama. Life has no script, no playwright, no director, no producer – and no meaning. To the best of our scientific understanding, the universe is a blind and purposeless process, full of sound and fury but signifying nothing. During our infinitesimally brief stay on our tiny speck of a planet, we fret and strut this way and that, and then are heard of no more.”21.	The three kinds of resources. “But in truth there are three kinds of resources: raw materials, energy and knowledge. Raw materials and energy are exhaustible – the more you use, the less you have. Knowledge, in contrast, is a growing resource – the more you use, the more you have.” “22.	What might replace humanism? And so MUCH MORE…Negatives:1.	At over 400 plus pages it will require an investment of your time. 2.	I did have some reservations on some of the definitions of key concepts such as religion. Humanism is not a religion and I hope it was just a misunderstanding on my part.3.	Some speculation is treated as a mere appetizer. 4.	Limited use of charts and diagrams. There is some good visual material here just needed more in my opinion. In summary, it’s rare to find such a well-crafted book that crosses multiple disciplines that is so satisfying yet this is such a gem. Professor Harari has won me over with his insightful observations and well thought out speculations. A fun read indeed and guaranteed to learn something. Worthy of five-stars, I highly recommend it!Further suggestions: “Sapiens” from same author, “The Singularity is Near” by Ray Kurzwell, “Algorithms to Live By” by Brian Christian, “The Second Machine Age” by Erik Brynjolfsson, “Human” By Michael S.

A small group of such humans bonded together to form roving bands of hunter gatherers who traveled across lands and eventually settled almost all over the world, tribes with chieftains were the next step in their evolution which later morphed into kingdoms. Empires, mass upheavals, federalism and parliamentary democracy all followed suit in this march of history. While all of this was going on, the past couple of decades introduced a game changer : the internet which has since then revised the way we think, interact and even select our governments. This past is extensively documented but then all of this begs the question : what next ? Yuval Noah Harari who tackled the history of mankind in his seminal work Sapiens attempts to answer this question while evaluating multiple alternate futures for humanity. Not so long ago the biggest threats that humanity had to face were threefold : plague, famine and war. The first of these more of less met its match with the wide spread usage of antibiotics and advances in medical technology. Although it is very much possible that any given day a new strain of virus might break free and wipe out a good chunk of the world population, that could be a freak occurrence and the possibility of which is quite small. The second one - famine has become a stuff of lore and legend in the annals of mankind. This does not mean that people do not starve to death in the world, they still do but Harari’s brush stroke is rather wide which tells us that the days of famine staring us in the face as a global threat has passed. What little remains is a result of either abject poverty or willful manipulation by devious administrators to keep a population subjugated. The third one has killed countless numbers in the course of two world wars and the cold war but when the twentieth century rolled around, something interesting started to happen. Barring the occasional flareups, global wars pretty much ground to a halt in the past century. The reasoning behind this was pretty simple : war is an extremely costly affair and businesses/governments could gain more through commerce than they could ever hope of accomplishing through warfare. A few missile strikes might make you feel like you are king of the hill but the expenses that those missiles rack up can be pretty much backbreaking for your tax paying citizens and in the age of social media, that is not a risk anyone wants to run. Long story short we have pretty much vanquished all that stood against us in the past, so what is next for us ? Harari has answer : we would want to become gods ! If we decimate every known disease carrying pathogen then the obvious next step would be to think of immortality and that might not really be the relegated to the realm of sci fi anymore. In a world where things change, morph and evolve in a matter of hours, the future could be an actual age of superheroes. Now let us stop right here and look at the practical side of it : none of this will come cheap and only the super-rich could even be able to afford a tiny bit of all these said advancements. A few centuries from now the economic divide would be so vast that it would be a wide, horizon-encompassing chasm between the rich and the poor. One look at the world’s richest list show us that only a tiny percentage of people are qualified enough to be super rich with no indication that the gap between them and the normal mortals would ever close. The logical summary it gives us is that a vast, vast majority of human beings will be rendered effectively useless in a world of the super powered beings of the future. What is more interesting is that in such a world, a Matrix like scenario will probably never happen for humanity will become redundant for all practical purposes. If you have ever thought that you will one day be a slave to a robotic army then Harari is sorry to burst your bubble for he feels that the robots/techno humans will not even give you a second glance. In such a world, have you wondered as to what happens to religion ? The answer according to Harari is pretty straightforward, in a future where mankind itself will undergo radical changes there will be very little space for the religions of the present day. There is every possibility that data could be the new god in a world where wish granting super powered beings are a norm !Reading Harari is about navigating through countless interpretations, evaluations, hypotheses and analyses to arrive at the thread of a theory. There is history, mythology, science, anthropology and technology all finding its way into how he weaves his narrative together and he minces no words. Harari is opinionated and makes no qualms about it but there is no way you will not be impressed by the sheer amount of background work that he has done for the book. Maybe a few decades from now, we might look back at this book and laugh at how it got the whole thing wrong but then that is still ok since the scope of this book might even spill into a few centuries. Most of the technological revolutions, super powers and a data based lifestyle are not changes that would come around fully in the next hundred years or so but with what little data we have, this is a possible extrapolation of where we might be headed. What kept bothering me all through the book was coincidentally the one point that also impressed me : the scale/timeline of the narrative of the book. It spans centuries and with the current rate at which we are wreaking havoc on our environment and the ecosystem, a century on earth seems to be a long shot. I live in a little state at the southernmost tip of India which was ravaged by the biggest floods in recorded history just a year ago. The soil composition has changed drastically in the state ever since. Every time there is rain, the water runs off into the ocean in under a day and the ground water levels are dangerously low. We are only a small distance away from drought while the neighboring state is already in the throes of one. There are every possible signs that this will only increase in the decades to come. With such being the case across most of the cities in the world, how can we think ahead to a century ? What alternatives will come into the picture ? Of course Harari does not answer these for it is not under the scope of the book but these are important questions still.If you have even a passing interest in mankind, history, anthropology, science and the future then both Sapiens and Homo Deus are MUST reads. While the first book teaches you how inflated our egos are, the second tells you how ridiculously redundant we might be in the centuries to come !"

If yes, then it is probably too dangerous (or too silly) to take our thoughts seriously. If no, then probably the mind needs a LOT more understanding.(2) Is ""I"" an imaginary story, just like gods, nations and money? If no, what is I? If yes, then that changes a LOT of things and probably we should equip ourselves more for this possibility. (3) It is really very very alarming to think of the kind of changes we humans are making to the world around us. All the best minds of our time are focused on making machines process large and countless data that's inscrutable to human brain. Will this really lead to dataisms and a dystopian ending? If not, what are the alternatives? What can we do to steer this scientific curiosity in the right direction? If that is not in our hands, what else are we to do?I highly recommend this book to everyone! Though, I would suggest that you read Sapiens before you start on this - that way you'll get more context to the author's writings."

Tell us that future would repeat the history but the central figure of this transformation won't be the homo sapiens. It would completely transform (positive or negative ?) human life in every aspects. Harari doesn't try to prophesize the future of mankind, he simply put forward facts, development and changes that are taking place in our world and just try to link and find out what could future possibly be and what would happen to us.Though many of his thoughts on future and the role of technology may seem like some high Sci-Fi but it is all possible as technology is taking leap at an unprecedented level and he has also given many mind blowing real examples. With the advent of AI, machine learning and big data the future maybe something that the most Genius minds of our mankind may not be able to anticipate.Give this book a read and think how technology and computer can transform mankind in a unimaginable way."

Sure not everything he says to do makes sense in my mind but i did like what he said about how it could be possible for everyone to live to be 500 but the world would need alot of work not jsut us as people would need to change our ways but the world and what we did to it. Thats why in bible times people lived forever because the world was still mainly perfect. We screwed it up and now we live to be 80 if we are lucky.

91,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6045558-lisa,1,"I don't often mark books ""read"" if I didn't bother finishing them. But after about a third of this book, I feel like I know enough about it to say that 1) I'm certainly not finishing it because 2) it's not worth finishing.I value ideas. I think it's important to read outside your comfort zone. I know that sometimes it takes a book until the end to make its impact or complete its argument. But reading something that makes you uncomfortable is not the same as reading things that are factually wrong, or tacitly accepting arguments that hide faulty premises. And if that's the bulk of a book, you should stop reading it. So I closed this one.The main issues I had were with Harari's argument and conclusion structure, which relies on fallacies that hide behind a facade of rationalism. There is an entire chapter devoted to animal consciousness - an interesting subject! - where he repeatedly argues that because various animals react to stimuli like humans, they clearly can't *not* have consciousness, so they are conscious like humans. But this argument relies on a false binary. There can be degrees and kinds of consciousness; it's (likely) not an all-or-nothing game. This kind of fallaciousness was so pervasive that once I spotted it, I couldn't find an argument that *didn't* rely on it.Harari doesn't seem to understand people, either. His explanation for why evolution is such a scary theory for religious people who believe in souls was... surprising. He thinks that people who dislike the theory of evolution have realized that, because evolution can't create something that is unified and lacks parts like the soul, the soul could never have evolved, which means no one has a soul. We see again his favorite fallacy of a false binary - it's plausible, if you believe in souls, to think that souls are completely separate from biology and have nothing to do with evolution. But beyond that, this just isn't the main complaint you hear from evolution deniers. I've never heard *anyone* who denies evolution bring this up.I'm honestly bummed that the first half of the book was so poorly argued because I would have liked to see the futures he's building toward in the second half, if the foundations weren't so shoddy."

Then it sat on my TBR pile, not because I wasn't excited to read it, but because this author makes me work. Reading his books is not an easy thing to do. He writes about the history of humans, and then projects us forward in time to possible futures. He writes about religion, philosophy, and all the isms, about technology, and medicine, and science, and social media, and the meaning of life, and really almost everything about what what it means to be human. And he does it all in a very easy to understand, accessible manner. So when I say it's not an easy read, it not about how he writes, but rather what he writes about. He makes me think, he makes me question, he upsets my mental models, and as I expected, he changed how I look at myself, humanity, and our future. That's where the work is. This is not a light, fluffy read, so wait until you are in the mood to do some heavy lifting, mentally speaking, and then settle in for a read that will change how you see yourself and the world. I'm not going to summarize the main points of this book, because I want you to experience those Ah-Ha moments for yourself. But here's a teaser: Did you know that in 2014 a Japanese venture capital firm, Deep Knowledge, named an artificial intelligence (AI) to its board of directors? The robot, named Vital, was chosen for its ability to pick up on market trends ‘not immediately obvious to humans.' It wasn't a one-off either. The evolution from Homo Sapiens to Home Deus is a thrilling, scary, fascinating, horrifying, enlightening, terrible, educational, entertaining, compelling, and humbling ride. Highly recommended for every human who doesn't want to go the way of the Dodo. I am not the same person I was before I read this book. Is there any higher praise?"

It was a little less science-fiction than I was expecting, and the middle of the book covered a lot of the same ground as Sapiens, but by the end, I saw why this was necessary. To understand and think about where humanity is going, it helps to understand where we've been. Harari casts liberal humanism as the world's current dominant religion and poses questions and theories about how technologies such as AI and genetic engineering may shatter the liberal humanist values that guide much of our current thinking. The technologies discussed are presented as possibilities, not predictions. As with Sapiens, I didn't agree with all of Harari's conclusions, but I loved thinking about them and was genuinely entertained. "

The book is very digestible and one doesn't realize how deep the waters the author gets into because the prose is so clear and direct.

“Today having power means knowing what to ignore.”
The portrait of mankind I was left with after finishing Yuval Noah Harari’s Sapiens. A Brief History of Humanity was so gloomy that I have to admit I am ready to believe, with some dark, twisted satisfaction, in the prophecy of its extinction made by the same author in his equally disturbing sequel, Homo Deus – A Brief History of Tomorrow. As the title suggests, Harari makes some predictions concerning the future of humanity, based on social, psychological, economical and biological facts, all which seem to point to the same direction – the end of mankind as we know it. Indeed, after eradicating famine (the famine that still exists in the world is not naturally but politically induced) and war (which is no longer an option even in time of peace like in the past), the new item on the human agenda is the pursuit of happiness. That happiness that seems to forever elude us because of some psychological impulse that makes our expectations exceed objective conditions (whenever we achieve something we want something better) and because of our biological imprint (the pleasant sensations in our body that determine our happiness).This is why the 21st century science, in its ambition to re-engineer Homo sapiens in order to overcome both psychological issues and biochemistry is ready to adopt one of the following three ways to ensure global happiness: biological engineering (enhancing the potential of our bodies, by rewriting the genetic code, rewiring the brain circuit, altering the biochemical balance, growing new limbs), cyborg engineering (merging the organic body with non-organic devices), or the engineering of non organic beings (developing intelligent software). It goes without saying that the upgrading of Sapiens will be a gradual process, not a robots’ revolt; nevertheless we are rushing towards the great unknown inexorably, first because we don’t understand the system that pushes us forward anymore, and second because stopping will cause the collapse of our economy and society.The book is structured in three parts, describing the past achievements and future doom of Sapiens: how they conquered the world, how they gave it meaning and how they are now losing control of it. The period of conquering, called by Harari the Anthropocene, covers the last 70 000 years when Sapiens became “the single most important agent of change in the global ecology”. Until then, since the appearance of life 4 billion years ago, no other species changed the ecology by itself, all changes being made by natural forces (climate change, tectonic plate movement, volcanic eruptions, asteroid collisions).During the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens began to talk about things that existed only in their imagination, organizing their society and creating gods they held festivals for and offered sacrifices to. Agricultural Revolution replaced these animist religions (“a grand Chinese opera with a limitless cast of colorful actors”) with a theist one (“a bleak Ibsen drama with just two main characters: man and god”). The new religion gave authority to man over the other animals, which, according to it, do not have an eternal soul. When God punished the man, he wanted to erase all the other creatures also.The farm thus became the prototype of new societies, complete with puffed-up masters, inferior races fit for exploitation, wild bears ripe for extermination, and a great God above that gives His blessing to the entire arrangement.It was the Scientific Revolution (whose greatest discovery was “the discovery of ignorance”) that began to change the vision and attitude towards God, transforming, metaphorically speaking, the Garden of Eden into the garden of Woolsthorpe (the garden where Newton is supposed to have seen the apple falling, and where Newton, instead of being punished for the knowledge acquired, became God himself):Untold numbers of teachers throughout the world recount the Newton myth to encourage curiosity, implying that if only we gain enough knowledge we can create paradise here on earth.Thus, the knowledge formula changed in time. In medieval Europe it was K = Scriptures X Logic (the multiplication sign is used because the medieval scholastic believed that if your logic were 0 you couldn’t understand the Scriptures). The Scientific Revolution proposed a new formula (without erasing the other): K = Empirical Data X Mathematics (which led amazing scientific results but left aside value and meaning – the ethical judgments. This is why the two formulas went along – humanity cannot survive without value judgments). It was the new religion, Humanism, that gave the formula of the modern world: K = Experiences X Sensitivity (life is a gradual process from ignorance to enlightenment by means of emotional, intellectual and physical experiences)…the modern world… has been created by the covenant of science and humanism. Every scientific yang contains within it a humanist yin, and vice versa. The yang provides us with power, while the yin provides us with meaning and ethical judgments.If modernity, a race where you have to adapt to new structures every day (governments race toward growth and not equilibrium, individuals towards new standards of living) has not collapsed yet, it is because of this new religion, the humanism. It is the humanism that encourages people to search inside themselves both the sense of their lives and of the universe, what J.J. Rousseau summed up in Émile (“the eighteenth century bible of feeling”), whose hero said he had found the life’s rules in himself. This has changed the perception of morality (murder and theft are wrong not because of the commandments, but because they bring unhappiness to somebody), of art (Marcel Duchamp’s Fountain – actually a mass-produced urinal – is considered an artistic milestone because it debates the very meaning of art in the eye of the beholder) and so on.On the other hand, science discovered that our actions are governed by our desires (like any other animal’s), not our free will. Desires we cannot choose. Moreover, humans are not individuals, are a sum of ‘dividuals”, from which two are predominant: the experiencing self and the narrating self. The narrating self chooses from two experiences to eliminate the less pleasant and invests our past sufferings with a meaning. The narrating self goes over our experiences with a sharp pair of scissors and a thick black marker. It censors at least some moments of horror and files in the archive a story with a happy ending.Therefore, the liberal belief in the valuable individual could be made obsolete in the 21st century following three practical developments: the loss of the human usefulness for the economical and political system; the preference of the system for the collectivity but not for the individual; the decision to upgrade only valuable individuals instead of the entire humanity. In the 18th century there was a first shift from a deo-centered world to a homo-centered world, which reached its peak in the 20th century, when the protection of human rights was considered a key to the economic growth (liberalization of society and economy). The 21st century could witness a second shift, from a homo-centered to a data-centered world. This shift, initiating rather a practical revolution than a philosophic one, could signal that the age of masses is over, and with it the age of mass medicine. As human soldiers and workers give way to algorithms, at least some elite may conclude that there is no point in providing improved or even standard levels of health for masses of useless poor people, and it is far more sensible to focus on upgrading a handful of superhumans beyond the norm.Until now, it was thought that from the two basic abilities humans have, physical and cognitive, machines were better in former and humans in latter, belief contradicted now by the science with the three principles of algorithms: any organism is an algorithm shaped by the natural selection; the material a calculator is built does not affect algorithmic calculations; so, what is the difference between non-organic algorithms and organic ones, provided the calculations remain valid?Sapiens is more and more in danger to become a useless class, for computer algorithms will probably take over almost all current jobs and even if other jobs are invented, algorithms might be better at them, too. The crucial problem isn’t creating new jobs. The crucial problem is creating new jobs that humans perform better than algorithms. Until now, human life has been divided in the period of learning and the period of working. In the future humans might have to learn all their lives and not all of them would be able to do so. They would become useless masses with nothing to do but spending their time in virtual-reality worlds – and this will destroy the liberal belief in the sacredness of human life.In the heyday of the European imperialism, conquistadors and merchants bought entire islands and countries in exchange for coloured beads. In the twenty-first century our personal data is probably the most valuable resource most humans still have to offer, and we are giving it to the tech giants in exchange for email services and funny cat videos.The brave new world about to appear would be incomplete, of course, without its own religion: two new types of techno-religions are the natural consequence of the research laboratories activity: techno-humanism (that clings to many traditional humanist values) and data religion (humans are now obsolete and must be replaced with new kinds of entities).Although techno-humanism still believes that the most important thing is the human will, this belief may be rendered obsolete by the new technologies that promise to supersede any desire that make us uncomfortable (ex. why not make Romeo and Juliet love someone else and all that tragedy?). In this case, humans will become only designer products without will and experience. On the other hand, there is the Dataist perspective, in which the human species is only a single data processing system. Dataism, initially only a scientific theory, is now becoming a religion whose credo is that information must flow freely, for the information sake (which is not the same as freedom of expression given to humans). After all, scientists discovered that even human feelings are more than a source of poetry, they are an algorithm that encapsulates the voices of ancestors that struggled to survive, thus ensuring Sapiens’ existence. Everything now falls into an algorithm – life, science, knowledge. Many of the new algorithms that govern our existence (like Google search) cannot be understood by the human brain – they are developed by huge teams each understanding only one part of it. Moreover, algorithms improve themselves and learn form their mistakes independently.The seed algorithm may initially be developed by humans, but as it grows it follows its own path, going where no human has gone before – and where no human can follow.Our world’s future is shaped under our eyes by three interlinked processes: the promulgation of the scientific dogma that “ organisms are algorithms and life is data processing”; the decoupling of the intelligence from consciousness and the understanding of the human self by “non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms”. And like Harari, I wish I knew the answer of the three questions these processes raise: 1. Are organisms really just algorithms, and is life really just data processing?2. What's more valuable - intelligence or consciousness?3. What will happen to society, politics and daily life when non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms know us better than we know ourselves?"

Harari spends much of the early chapters here repeating points and examples he'd already brought up in ""Sapiens."" Were it not for the fact that I'd only recently read that book, this likely wouldn't have come off as repetitive as it did, but ultimately I felt like it took some wading to get to much new ground.Since ""Homo Deus"" does largely deal with our future, it's much more speculative, though this speculation is always made with a look back at the steps humankind has taken to get where we are now. With Harari at the helm, it should similarly go without saying that whether it's the way in which AI is likely to disrupt the human economy, the rise of nationalism and populism, or other, future uncertainties, ""Homo Deus"" is always fascinating to read. Harari is certainly a passionate animal rights advocate, something that was clear from reading ""Sapiens"" as well, and he makes valid arguments that humanity needs to shift away from factory farms and meat-eating more generally. It's hard though to read a book about the future without it quickly becoming dated. ""Homo Deus"" was released only three years ago, and if Harari's forecasts haven't already taken place, they seem somewhat obvious, especially in light of current events.There are interesting discussions that have been raised in the past year, particularly around the idea of UBI (largely thanks to the candidacy of Andrew Yang) and automation that Harari doesn't delve into. This, and the way in which the coronavirus pandemic is likely to speed the development of AI and automation, would seem to scream for an updated version of ""Homo Deus."" Nevertheless, as uncertain as the future may be, it's a comfort to know that people like Harari exist to help us make sense of it."

100,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28280419-jan,5,"Dr. Harari is an Oxford educated historian and he uses arguments about the trends from the past to lead us into questioning what the future may hold. His big picture approach combined with evidence and logic makes it a very enjoyable read.His previous book, Sapiens, concluded with we had climbed to the top of evolutionary pyramid by virtue of our ability to cooperate and therefore gain power over stronger competitors.He starts Homo Deus by telling us mankind had turned to gods for help against the three major threats of war, famine and pestilence. But now, more die of suicide than in war, more die from overeating (diabetes, heart issues) than famine and when we have an outbreak of disease, we question why the authorities didn’t do better. There is no need for our old gods any more.Humanism has become our default new god, elevating the well-being of people to the top priority. Science has aided the rise of humanism by delivering new technologies and higher standards of living. But where should we project that these trends will take us?Harari asks if we accept that 1) all organisms are algorithms – humans included, 2) the more information we have combined with the more interconnected computer processors, the faster and the more accurate our decisions can be, 3) we are in the process of merging with our technology with artificial hearts, replacement hips – and soon microprocessors will implanted in our bodies, and 4) combined with continued growth in our knowledge of genetic engineering – we can see how it is almost inevitable that humans will greatly accelerate evolutionary changes to achieve goals for longer life, greater intelligence, greatly improved happiness. But Harari isn’t talking about a utopian vision, he sees instead that only the very wealthy will become the new human species. The growth in use of algorithms will likely lead to the end of democracy as we know it – if Google and Amazon can know what we want before we do, what do we think the political system will become? And, as it becomes accepted that the notion of free will is really a predictable set of genetic and environmental factors, isn’t democracy rather meaningless?Most when trying to predict the future just overlay more goodies and challenges on to our present set of values. Harari sees our basic values of humanism being threatened. He says we don’t yet comprehend what artificial intelligence will do to the job markets and what society will look like when the majority can’t find work. Not to mention, what will the new, much more powerful species of humans think of the rest of us. He raises questions about the value of consciousness versus intelligence as we begin to merge with computers and our new technologies. This isn’t a lightly put together book – there are over 30 pages of footnotes. Although the book just came out last year, many of the leaders in technology have described it as must read.I need to thank my Goodreads friend David for his review in August which caused me to read this thought-provoking book."

Some bits are pleasant and others are downright scary. Harari takes a dig on a great variety of subjects from artificial intelligence to biology from psychology to politics and so on ... I really found the part on free-will and Individual really exciting. It is sort of like bringing back my long time undecided stance on Solipsism. I am Not really Solipsist, but I enjoy exploring that philosophical idea. The parts in the book about individual and free-will bring in a new dimension to my pondering on the same.And not to mention the book overall reaffirmed my nihilistic world view. LOL! I liked how Harari discredits the power that terrorism claims and calls the terrorist agenda a dead cause. He infers humanity have walked past the God phase. I reckon terrorism is a legit problem, but the terrorist's inability to have an organized armed force, as nations do, makes them not a real threat but a sort of just noise and distraction with relatively lesser calamities. As of course, there will be casualties but Harari is making a point on the scale of humanity as a whole and on that scale, the casualties are less. The second thing that is discredited is Climate Change which currently is a big threat to life on the planet. humanity. I personally think if we assume it to be out of the scenario then the possibilities mentioned are pretty reasonable, but in the light of climate change, we can't go much far unless we deal wit it. The writing style of this book is colloquial and that keeps one interested to carry on reading. I often get bored of non-fiction when they start taking the textbook tone. Not that there is anything wrong with textbooks, but for leisure reading, I prefer more engaging text. I kinda cruised through this pretty smoothly and can't wait to read Sapiens. This book has a wide range of topics involved thus it offers something for everyone. I think everyone can give it a try. "

But now robots and computers are catching up and may soon outperform humans in most tasks. (...) We are are on the brink of a momentous revolution. Humans are in in danger of losing their economic value, because intelligence is decoupling from consciousness.I am going to keep this review short. Harari is a really intelligent man. I would recommend his books to everyone because they are eye-opening. You may not agree with everything he says or may believe different things, but both Homo Sapiens and Homo Deus that makes you look differently at the world and makes you conscious about things happening around us that we didn't want to see before.To be honest, I thought this book would give me fears about are shared future, but it didn't. Harari puts many fears into perspective. However, sometimes it felt like Harari was repeating himself over and over, just in different words. I think this book could have been 50-100 pages shorter without losing any essential information. That's why I liked Homo Sapiens a little better, it was more to the point and based on facts than assumptions."
103,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36765194-myra,4,"Well that was interesting. And definitely ended on an eerie, chilling note. So I read Homo Deus after reading Sapiens (which was awesome). Sapiens is the sort of a broad amalgamation of the history of mankind and and Homo Deus is positioned as the history of tomorrow. The future of mankind as you will. So that was the lens i was looking at this book from. This book is a chunker - the book I have was about 465 pages. The first half of the book was a drag. Although sprinkled with some interesting ideas and concepts. A lot of it felt like a revision of Sapiens and could be HEAVILY edited down. It was too much iteration of the same thing. Where the book significantly picked up was about a little over half way through. The book is divided into 3 sections. So the last bit of the 2nd section and the last section were the ideas of tomorrow that i was craving to read. My god, its was well worth the wait. I couldnt put the book down at that point. It felt like a reality based breakdown of so many of the science fiction books ive read. Are we really going to enslave ourselves to the dataism? Will it be so bad? How will homo sapiens evolve to the next level? Why should you care about it? Do we actually have free-will?If you have read sapiens and just want to read about the new ideas - i think you could easily skip to half way into the book. If you do not read non-fiction but still want to get a taste of whats out there - I would recommend reading ""The circle - by Dave Eggers"", ""Caves of Steel - by Issac Asimov"", ""Planetfall by Emma Newman"" or the classic ""Brave New World - Aldous Huxley"". But definitely go out there and read this book. Even if you dont agree with the concepts, it will make you think critically. And in the end, thats all that matters."

I didn't like this book at all. I wanted to say that the title of this book is very misleading and doesn't really live up to the promise, but actually it is quite accurate, I would perhaps call it ""A history of today"" though. Because that is what it is. A history from the perspective of humans evolving into beings that are able to do the things religions claim gods can/could do. OK, OK, to be honest, I would actually call it ""History of god"", because that what it was for the most part. You know how annoyed is a person who thinks he is going to read a book full of science and it ends up being full of history of religion? 1 star type of annoyed. I had a very hard time with the book and I only enjoyed approx. 1h of it. And you know what? That hour was full of facts about now and tomorrow. Then the book turned to speculations about future. Unfortunately for speculations to be interesting they either should have a strong factual background or a unique perspective. I didn't find either of those, unfortunately. And lastly as this was the third book I have finished by this author, I have to say that some of the researches quoted did repeat from the other books. In a way it is good as I already know what's up. But at the same time it's a bit annoying to read the same thing again. This can only impact your reading experience if you have read his other books.

Harari introduces so many ideas here which not only forces you to think differently but also forces you to break the pre-conceived ideas. This and the previous book 'Sapiens' are very important books which are just full of important ideas which change your views about history and also the ideas for the future.People who don't read generally ask me my reasons for reading. Simply put I just love reading and so to that end I have made it my motto to just Keep on Reading. I love to read everything except for Self Help books but even those once in a while. I read almost all the genre but YA, Fantasy, Biographies are the most. My favorite series is, of course, Harry Potter but then there are many more books that I just adore. I have bookcases filled with books which are waiting to be read so can't stay and spend more time in this review, so remember I loved reading this and love reading more, you should also read what you love and then just Keep on Reading."

However, this book sat on my shelf as a TBR till i decided to pick it up later, which i regretted it (if not for the purpose of reading for the book discussion).I have so much things to complain about this book. However, my main gripe with this book is that it lacks proper research (as mentioned by some of the reviewers in Goodreads) and how it disses humanism and put science on a pedestial, while forgetting we are not robots in the first place."

Sapiens looks back back at human development while Homo Deus looks forward. There's a lot of conjecture about what we'll become, which leaves a lot of room for error.

108,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7208369-miles,5,"“Who could heed the words of Charlie Darwin/Fighting for a system built to fail/Spooning water from their broken vessels/As far as I can see there is no land.”So sings Ben Knox Miller in The Low Anthem’s “Charlie Darwin,” one of the best songs I discovered during my college years. The track is a mournful yet courageous confrontation of the most difficult truths the modern world has revealed: that human life is neither inherently meaningful nor special; that we are bound and determined by the same natural laws that control the rest of the universe; and that the many stories we tell ourselves to make life bearable are at best useful fictions, at worst destructive falsehoods.Yuval Noah Harari’s Homo Deus is the perfect intellectual companion to this arresting song. Harari’s first book––Sapiens––was my favorite piece of nonfiction from 2015, and this followup may prove to be my favorite from 2017. Although I think some of his views are flawed or in need of revision, I count myself an official Harari acolyte. Still, I will do my best to provide a balanced review of this exceptionally interesting and informative book.The purpose of Homo Deus is to acknowledge that humanity is at a crossroads. Although the choice before us will assume infinite permutations as history plays out, it can be summarized thus: reject the narratives of the past, or perish. If we take a hard look at the swift transitions––economic, political, ecological, technological, social––that are already upon us, we will realize that equally swift adaptation is the only way to survive. This leaves us with an important couple of questions: What will human life look like if we manage to carry on? Will that life even be human at all?Homo Deus takes up these questions, and many more, with the succinct and witty style familiar to anyone who has read Harari before or listened to him interviewed. His ability to cut through the noise and get to the heart of matters most critical to the modern moment is unparalleled in my experience, and his message––though deeply troubling in some ways––is important and profound. Picking up where Sapiens left off, Harari turns to the future, trying to grasp which historical lessons might continue to hold water in the coming decades, and which will become (or have already become) entirely obsolete. He takes aim at two cherished and interrelated ideas on which the foundations of contemporary societies rest: humanism and liberalism. Both of these “broken vessels” take a brutal beating in this book––one that may prove salutary to those willing to dispense with old, romantic ideas and embrace new, practical ones.Harari posits that humanism has spent the last few centuries conquering the world. Humanism was the first “religion” (his word) to send humanity looking inward for answers to life’s big questions, rather than appealing to a religious or social authority. Out of this process arose three basic goals: life extension, increased happiness, and power to reshape the world and ourselves according to desire. Although the pursuit of these goals has led to incredible improvements in quality of life for most humans (especially by historical standards), Harari is dubious in his assessment of humanism’s future:""The rise of humanism also contains the seeds of its downfall. While the attempt to upgrade humans into gods takes humanism to its logical conclusion, it simultaneously exposes humanism’s inherent flaws…The same technologies that can upgrade humans into gods might also make humans irrelevant…Once we come nearer to achieving these goals the resulting upheavals are likely to deflect us towards entirely different destinations."" (66)Throughout the text, Harari provides exhaustive support for how and why individual human beings are daily becoming less valuable in the race to realize the promises of humanism. Technological automation has begun to supersede our status as the primary contributors to economic production and our usefulness as participants in war. Social algorithms are coming ever-closer to knowing us better than we could ever hope to know ourselves, at least in terms of behavioral prediction.These developments are also undermining the basic tenets of liberalism, which teaches that each human is a distinct individual who can (and should) choose freely how he/she wants to live, and suggests that superior societies and markets will arise from everyone choosing what is best for him- or herself. Yet, Harari rightfully points out that “these factual statements just don’t stand up to rigorous scientific scrutiny” (283). Credible support for strict individuality and free will is nowhere to be found in empirical observations, and there is no conclusive evidence to prove that people making choices according to their perceived self-interest necessarily leads to better or happier societies. On the contrary, the facts show that our conscious ideas about what constitutes our self-interest are deeply flawed, which turns out not to matter much since those ideas are just one of many factors that determine our behavior, most of which are unconscious and far more influential than consciously-held convictions:""If by ‘free will’ we mean the ability to act according to our desires––then yes, humans have free will, and so do chimpanzees, dogs and parrots. When Polly wants a cracker, Polly eats a cracker. But the million-dollar question is not whether parrots and humans can act upon their inner desires––the question is whether they can choose their desires in the first place. Why does Polly want a cracker rather than a cucumber? Why am I so eager to kill my annoying neighbor instead of turning the other cheek? Why do I want to buy the red car rather than the black? Why do I prefer voting for the Conservatives rather than the Labour Party? I don’t choose any of these wishes. I feel a particular wish welling up within me because this is the feeling created by biochemical processes in my brain. These processes might be deterministic or random, but not free."" (285-6, emphasis his)So we can cling to the idea that we exercise free will by choosing from a host of options we had no say in constructing, but even that intellectual backflip won’t necessarily mitigate liberalism’s plunge to obsolescence. Harari asserts that even if it is not what we most value about ourselves, a radical interpretation of self-determination is the original justification for the creation of representative democracies with protections for individual freedoms. But if self-determination is a fiction, then the rational justification for the role of the state in preserving individual freedoms falls away.Liberal defenders may retreat to arguments about how liberal democracy is the best form of government available to us––an acceptable position for those willing to ignore the successes of contemporary China. Still, there is no guarantee of liberal democracy’s place in humanity’s future. Harari gives the lie to the notion that liberal democracies became popular solely because they were superior systems of governance. Rather, liberal democracy was in the right place at the right time; it met the economic and wartime needs of industrialized societies in the 19th and 20th centuries:""Liberalism did not become the dominant ideology simply because its philosophical arguments were the most valid. Rather, liberalism succeeded because there was abundant political, economic and military sense in ascribing value to every human being. On the mass battlefields of modern industrial wars and in the mass production lines of modern industrial economies, every human counted. There was value to every pair of hands that could hold a rifle or pull a lever."" (309-10)It is abundantly clear that this paradigm is no longer valid. We are rushing toward a future where small numbers of technologically-advanced (or -augmented) groups can run global economies, acquire and utilize resources, and wage war with relatively little human input. Where, then, is the incentive for future governments to improve the lives of average citizens? There is none, except perhaps a moral imperative to take care of humans because human life is inherently special or valuable––another nice idea with no scientific or logical standing! (I do not actually think this is a complete picture, as addressed later in the review.)The point here is not that humanist and liberal values are not at all meaningful or influential. These ideas have played a significant role in bringing us to the present moment. The point is that, when considering the broad arcs of natural and human history, humanism and liberalism are minor league players with far less clout than more fundamental forces, such as resource scarcity, social power dynamics, physics and biology. These forces may be and have been supported, redirected or obfuscated by imagined orders such as humanism and liberalism, but natural laws always prevail when the rubber meets the road. Harari urges us to consider that the rubber and the road have already met; in fact, the future looks like a car that has been spinning its wheels for some time but is only just starting to take off. As the car picks up speed, humanity as we know it will either vanish or become completely irrelevant; the car will not wait for our philosophical convictions to catch up.Even if we agree with his general outlook (which I do), we do well to consider places where Harari oversimplifies or missteps. Semantically, he has an annoying habit of conflating religious and ethical language. While he may not see an important distinction between these two terms, I think it is critical to distinguish between value systems that appeal to supernatural forces (such as Christianity and Islam) and ones that do not (such as humanism). All human value systems contain fictive assertions (e.g. God lives in Heaven, humans have a soul, human life is sacred, etc.), but religions go one step further by positing a controller of the universe who cares about how humans ought to live (Buddhism is not a religion by this standard). This is a much more egregious misinterpretation of reality than the idea that there is something intrinsically special about humans. As a matter of degree, religions flee from scientific truth faster than most other value systems, so keeping a firm barrier between religion and ethics would be more appropriate than Harari’s tendency to use them interchangeably. Calling humanism a “religion” just muddies the waters and ignores the fact that the advent of humanist ethics signified an improvement from the religious systems that preceded it (Harari readily admits this throughout the text, but his language doesn’t always bear it out).Another problem arises in Harari’s discussion of consciousness, which I generally found engaging and well-researched, especially for a nonscientist. Harari posits that intelligence is in the process of decoupling from consciousness, which is accurate; we are creating artificially intelligent entities that appear to be nonconscious but can nevertheless accomplish all sorts of things we used to think only humans would ever be able to do. But Harari jumps the gun by assuming that intelligence will necessarily and permanently decouple from consciousness. One of his central points throughout the text is that organisms are algorithms and “there is no reason to think that organic algorithms can do things that non-organic algorithms will never be able to replicate or surpass” (323). I have no qualms with this viewpoint, but am surprised that Harari didn’t seem to realize that accepting this position means we also have to accept the possibility that sufficiently advanced AI may very well develop consciousness(es) of its own, regardless of any intention to do so. If non-organic algorithms can do anything we can, then consciousness is on the table. That doesn’t mean AI will necessarily become conscious, or that a conscious AI will be able to communicate its conscious status to humans, but it does mean we need to be cautious about thinking that we can create increasingly-intelligent AIs without ever causing them to suffer (suffering requires some form of consciousness, as far as we know). It is too soon, therefore, to treat the decoupling of intelligence from consciousness as inevitable and absolute.Harari doesn’t give climate change enough attention. Any contemporary book about the future ought to contain extensive explanations of how climate change may or may not affect humanity’s near- and long-term prospects. If Harari is right that “The real nemesis of the modern economy is ecological collapse,” and if the possible futures he is predicting depend on the continued development of modern economies, then climate change deserves a much more robust hearing than the eleven pages cited in its index entry (214, 439). Harari may think we can continue with business as usual and engineer our way out of disasters as they arise (no easy feat), but meanwhile says nothing about how new technologies and/or systems of political and social organization might help us analyze, mitigate, or even prevent climate catastrophes. This is especially frustrating given that climate change is a hypercomplex problem and should be high on the list of desirable assignments for current and future AIs with greater-than-human intelligence.Finally, Harari seems comfortable predicting that small groups of uber-privileged superhumans won’t be motivated to respond to the needs of common people. While it may be true that normal humans will lose their power as generators of economic value, and also that modern military and surveillance technology will excel at stamping out nascent revolutionary movements, regular folks will probably retain their status as the primary consumers of economic output (at least until robots start planning vacations to Mars). A fully-automated global economy might run out of steam fast if no one has any money to buy its products. This dynamic may lead to societies implementing a basic universal income or other form of subsistence living program to support the consumptive needs and preferences of the general population. Given that most digital technologies can be reproduced at zero marginal cost (or close to it), 21st-century humans could enjoy significant and universal increases in quality of life, even if those increases are unequally distributed. The pleasures enjoyed by Homo Deus might exceed the wildest dreams of previous generations, but that’s less disconcerting if life for good ol’ Homo Sapiens also gets better.Long-winded as it is, this review only scratches the surface of the plethora of great ideas offered up in Homo Deus. Despite some flaws, Harari has done much more than his fair share of intellectual lifting for his generation. In the end, Harari suggests two basic models for the future: become Homo Deus (superhumans augmented by technology), or prepare to hand the baton over to smart machines and let them run the show. I’m hoping we can do both. I no longer trust humans to care properly for Earth, and am fine with allowing a superintelligent AI to have a crack at it if we can produce one before we exhaust available resources. I’m excited to wait in line for my copy of the new “happiness algorithm” or get a chance to upgrade to whatever comes next (although I am skeptical I will ever be able to afford it!). Maybe we can even wall off a nice patch of green somewhere for the new Amish––those who won’t heed the words of Charlie Darwin. I’m not holding my breath, though. Even the sunniest forecasts contain some pretty grim days ahead.It seems like this book should leave me feeling a sense of existential dread or hopelessness, but actually I find it very liberating. It’s a lot of pressure to think you’re the smartest ape around, and even more arrogant to think we are somehow in charge of Earth and should be held to account if it is destroyed. I for one am comforted to think humans will soon have even less control over the planet than we do now.I recently dug out my old DVD of The Matrix, and was surprised by my reaction to watching Neo and his compatriots fight to escape a perfectly decent “prison of the mind” constructed for them by machines––an arrangement which seems to me now a beautiful example of creative symbiosis. They kill a lot of innocent people and seek to destroy an entire race of intelligent machines, all so they can “live free” in a dreary subterranean shit-hole, with no practical means of supporting the millions of humans they are ostensibly trying to liberate. Despite his creepy demeanor and terrible goatee, I found myself cheering for Cypher this time around, and nodding in agreement when Agent Smith referred to Morpheus as a “known terrorist.” Looking over Neo’s shoulder at the human power plant, so many minds drifting in blissful ignorance, I couldn’t help but think:We should be so lucky…This review was originally published on my blog, words&dirt."
109,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,5,"Wow. This book is massive in scope, but still manages to have a high density of profound ideas. It jumps all over the place—history, science, biology, religion, government, art, economics, and much more—so it took me a LONG time just to gather my notes and thoughts (I read this book a few months ago, but am only posting my review now). I've noticed many other reviewers try discount this book because they don't agree with some of the (admittedly controversial) ideas in this book, which largely misses that the entire point of the book is to _consider_ these ideas and have precisely these types of discussions and disagreements! Whether or not you agree with the ideas, the book is well worth reading and thinking about deeply, as it touches on the future of all of humanity.Some of the powerful ideas I came across in the book (note: they will seem to be in a somewhat random order, as the book does jump around a lot!):* In the past, within a human lifetime, the world was pretty static: the world you were born into was very similar to the one you died in. This is no longer the case. We cannot count on death to separate us from a future that is completely unrecognizable. We will likely live to see times that we can barely comprehend. The goal of this book is to make us consider what may happen in the future so that we can at least be a little prepared for it.* The biggest problems of the past were typically famine, war, and plague. These may well be solved problems soon. They aren't solved yet, of course, but in the modern era, these are very minor problems compared to the past. What happens if, in the next 50 years, none of these is a major cause for concern?* Almost all major religions are based around death. They tell you what will happen when you die and how you should behave because of it. So what happens to these religions if, in the future, humans could live more or less forever? That is, what if we become ""amortal,"" where aging and disease are no longer a concern? What will be the role of religion (if any) then? * If humans did become amortal, we'd likely be much more paranoid and anxious. Today, we know we're going to die, so we willing to take on risk, as we know life could be cut short at any moment anyway. But if you knew you could live for hundreds or thousands of years, you might be much more risk averse for fear of cutting your life span so drastically short. What a counter-intuitive result!* Happiness, as best as we can tell, is biochemical in nature. If our goal is to make the greatest number of people happy, perhaps we should worry less about social reform and more about biology and chemistry. Sounds like a call for the Soma of Brave New World :)* Our technology is giving us the powers of Greek gods. In fact, some of our powers are already greater! E.g., Our ability to communicate instantly across the planet is greater than any Greek ever imagined, even for their Gods. And yet, despite our new found powers, we're not much different than the primates we were thousands of years ago. God-like powers and monkey-like abilities (and morality) may not be a good combination.* There's no good way to stop technology from advancing rapidly, even if we wanted to. In most cases, we can't predict where it will lead, or how it will jump from one use case to another. For example, plastic surgery was originally developed to help soldiers injured or disfigured in war; but once that technology was developed, it was only a matter of time until it spread to other use cases, such as enhancing the appearance of celebrities. Perhaps some day, we'll develop some sort of prosthetics that allow paraplegics to walk; but if we do, it'll only be a matter of time until that same technology can be used to make people with normal leg functionality run or jump faster, such as soldiers. Every technology has positive and negative uses, and there's no way to allow the former without also enabling the latter. * Fun fact: the modern day lawns we love to have around houses originated with the French aristocracy, where the lawn was used to show off wealth, as grass took a lot of time to cultivate and maintain, but served no practical purpose (i.e., could not be eaten or sold).* Emotions are algorithms. That is, emotions such as fear and anger are little algorithms, encoded in biochemistry, that detect certain inputs (e.g., a tiger), and program in specific responses (e.g., adrenaline rush for fight or flight). These algorithms evolved because they proved advantageous to survival. * When computers become more intelligent than humans, how will they treat us? What if they treat us the same way we treat other animals on the planet that are less intelligent than us (e.g., the way we treat cows, dogs, wolves)?* The ""problem of the mind"" is that we can't know if other people (or animals or computers) are conscious. The only thing we can really know is that we are conscious. But everyone else could, in theory, be, for example an algorithm designed to _look_ like consciousness, but not actually be conscious. Alan Turning did develop the Turing test for AI, but that only determines if an AI can fool us into believing it has consciousness; it does not prove that AI actually is conscious (side note: this is similar to how Turing was forced to spend much of his life trying to fool people into believing that he was straight). Interesting note: we know of no algorithm that _requires_ consciousness. * The ability to organize larger and larger groups of people gives humans amazing powers that no other animal has. And we organize around myths and fictional ideas, such as government, money, and religion. The myths of the past sometimes seem ridiculous to us (e.g., the many pagan gods), but they were still useful; likewise, the myths of today will seem ridiculous to the people of the future (e.g., we may be ridiculed for how we govern ourselves). But while these fictions are useful, they are _tools_ we use to accomplish our goals; they are not the goals themselves. We get in trouble when we forget that! E.g., When we sacrifice people's lives for money or for a country, we are sacrificing reality for fictions.* Some of the most powerful myths of today revolve around businesses and brands, which we treat as if they were real people. We say ""Google"" built a self-driving car or the ""USA"" built the nuclear bomb. In the past, those ""brands"" were often tied to god: ""god"" created the earth or Pharaoh built the pyramids.* The ultimatum game shows that humans are not purely ""rational actors."" In the game, there are two people. One person gets $100 and decides how to split that money with the other person. They can propose any split they want (e.g., 100/0 or 50/50 or anything else). The other person can either accept the offer, or reject it, but if they reject it, neither of them gets any money. A purely rational person would accept ANY offer, for even $1 is better than nothing. But in real experiments, many people reject the offer unless it feels ""fair"" (e.g., is somewhat close to 50/50). It seems like humans have an egalitarian moral built in; the same may even be true of other animals (e.g., primates) that have done these experiments. * Monotheism is a fairly primitive religion: it's a bit like a small child believing the entire universe revolves around them. Humanism is a newer religion: it is based around the idea that man, not god, gives meaning to life. It is the belief in ourselves and that what matters is people and their lives and happiness. * Bureaucracy turns groups of people into algorithms.* Our beliefs of the past were based around zero-sum games. For example, most religions said that humans should evenly split the pie or, work hard now, in return for a bigger pie in sky after death. This zero-sum mentality made sense when each generation lives in more or less the same world as the previous generation. By contrast, modernity assumes—even depends on—continuous growth. We expect the economy to grow, populations to grow, businesses to grow, and new technologies to make that exponential growth possible.* Voting and democracy only works as long as you share enough commonalities with the other voters. If the other voters are too different from you, you won't accept the result of the vote! Here's an example that is not in the book, but I found it quite powerful in my own thinking: imagine that you lived in a country of 1,000 people in the 21st century, and suddenly, 2,000 people moved in who were from the 1st century. Your country is a democracy, and those 2,000 people, who are now the majority, suddenly start voting based on their ancient beliefs: e.g., they strip women of voting rights, bring back slavery, etc. Would you accept the outcome of that vote? I very much doubt it. You'd probably feel like you've lost your country and beliefs. Is this what is spurring all the nationalist and populist movements we're seeing in the modern world? That is, most democracies were originally built in countries that were fairly homogenous ethnically/culturally, but with globalism, new ethnicities and cultures are moving in, and the original residents want to stop it before the population becomes so different from them that they ""lose"" their country.* Art is always interpreted and valued based on the fashions of the time. Take a $5M piece of modern art from today, ship it back 500 years, and the exact same piece of art will likely be seen as worthless.* There's a lot of science emerging that suggests that free will may not exist at all. For example, we can use brain scanning techniques to predict what choice a person will make _before_ that person is aware of choice they will make. If you're consciously making choices—if you really have free will—it seems like that should be impossible! Therefore, instead of free will, perhaps all we really have is (a) determinism and (b) randomness. The determinism comes from our environment and genes. The randomness comes from the seemingly random nature of how subatomic particles work (quantum mechanics).* One argument in favor of free will is that you have a ""desire"" for something: e.g., a desire to push the left button instead of the right button. But a desire for something is not the same as choosing it. Sure, you may feel that you want to push the left button, and eventually, you even act on that desire and push that left button, but here's the key question: where did the desire come from? Did you choose to want to push the left button? Or did that happen automatically? As an analogy, consider another experiment that has been done: the robo rat. We hooked up electrodes to a rat's brain so that we could remotely trigger pleasure and pain in the rat. Using this remote, we could control the rat as it goes through a maze, making it feel pleasure when it turns the way we want it to go, and pain when it turns the other way. The rat, of course, doesn't know it has electrodes attached to it. All it knows is that it feels good facing the left hallway and not good about the right hallway. To the rat, it might feel like it has a desire to go left. But that desire isn't free will, is it?* Consider what happens when we use technology or drugs to control our will. E.g., we already have the robo rat and drugs that help with ADHD. What happens when these become far more powerful and far reaching (e.g., see, ""The Red: First Light"")? Who is ""you"" in that case? Are you a human? Cyborg? Who is making the decisions? Do you really have free will if your will is being modified by a machine or drug?* You are not one person. For most people, our conscious experience makes us think we're just one person (as in, one soul), but here again, experiments show the truth is more complicated. In the ""split brain,"" patients who had their corpus callosum severed (either accidentally or as a necessary part of a medical procedure) were asked questions other verbally or visually. The same person would give two totally different responses about their desires; and would be totally unaware of the desires of the ""other"" side!* Modern AI has made us realize that there is a separation between intelligence and consciousness. We are currently able to build many intelligent algorithms that can play chess, read an x-ray, or drive a car. However, we are not able to build any algorithms that have consciousness. Perhaps humans are also a collection of intelligent algorithms, a bit like your phone has a collection of apps.* When our technology evolves enough that we can use it to upgrade (not just fix) our bodies, social inequality will grow to an unprecedented scale. The rich will be able to make themselves prettier, stronger, and live longer—or even become amortal—while the poor will continue to suffer and lead short lives as before. Such a difference would be unthinkable; I suspect it took far less than that to trigger the French revolution.* We no longer understand the algorithms our software engineers create. For example, Google search was developed by huge team, and no one person can tell you how it all works. Similarly, most machine learning algorithms develop themselves, and no one can really tell you how or why the algorithm is making the decisions it does. * The end of the book looks into ""dataism,"" which the author believes may be the next major leap for humanity after humanism. The idea is to see the world as a data processing system. Communism is centralized data processing system; democracy and capitalism are distributed data processing systems; taken to its extreme, each human is a data processing chip in a massive distributed system. We take in data, process it in some way, and output more data. Dataism is the desire to free all of that data. To be honest, I didn't fully grok this concept. Perhaps the idea here is that, in the future, data will be all that matters. E.g., if we develop technology similar to Star Trek replicators, where we can rearrange atoms at will, then materials will be of no value; all that will be valuable is the information (data) that tells you how to rearrange those atoms to get something useful (e.g., into earl grey, hot). Phew! So much to think about. So many excellent questions. Go read the book and then let's get some beer and spend a long time discussing it :)As always, I've saved my favorite quotes:“Each and every one of us has been born into a given historical reality, ruled by particular norms and values, and managed by a unique economic and political system. We take this reality for granted, thinking it is natural, inevitable and immutable. We forget that our world was created by an accidental chain of events, and that history shaped not only our technology, politics and society, but also our thoughts, fears and dreams. The cold hand of the past emerges from the grave of our ancestors, grips us by the neck and directs our gaze towards a single future. We have felt that grip from the moment we were born, so we assume that it is a natural and inescapable part of who we are. Therefore we seldom try to shake ourselves free, and envision alternative futures.” “Every day millions of people decide to grant their smartphone a bit more control over their lives or try a new and more effective antidepressant drug. In pursuit of health, happiness and power, humans will gradually change first one of their features and then another, and another, until they will no longer be human.” “Fiction isn't bad. It is vital. Without commonly accepted stories about things like money, states or corporations, no complex human society can function. We can't play football unless everyone believes in the same made-up rules, and we can't enjoy the benefits of markets and courts without similar make-believe stories. But stories are just tools. They shouldn't become our goals or our yardsticks. When we forget that they are mere fiction, we lose touch with reality. Then we begin entire wars `to make a lot of money for the cooperation' or 'to protect the national interest'. Corporations, money and nations exist only in our imagination. We invented them to serve us; why do we find ourselves sacrificing our life in their service.” “No clear line separates healing from upgrading. Medicine almost always begins by saving people from falling below the norm, but the same tools and know-how can then be used to surpass the norm.” “In the past, censorship worked by blocking the flow of information. In the twenty-first century, censorship works by flooding people with irrelevant information.”“Centuries ago human knowledge increased slowly, so politics and economics changed at a leisurely pace too. Today our knowledge is increasing at breakneck speed, and theoretically we should understand the world better and better. But the very opposite is happening. Our new-found knowledge leads to faster economic, social and political changes; in an attempt to understand what is happening, we accelerate the accumulation of knowledge, which leads only to faster and greater upheavals. Consequently we are less and less able to make sense of the present or forecast the future. In 1016 it was relatively easy to predict how Europe would look in 1050. Sure, dynasties might fall, unknown raiders might invade, and natural disasters might strike; yet it was clear that in 1050 Europe would still be ruled by kings and priests, that it would be an agricultural society, that most of its inhabitants would be peasants, and that it would continue to suffer greatly from famines, plagues and wars. In contrast, in 2016 we have no idea how Europe will look in 2050. We cannot say what kind of political system it will have, how its job market will be structured, or even what kind of bodies its inhabitants will possess.”“You want to know how super-intelligent cyborgs might treat ordinary flesh-and-blood humans? Better start by investigating how humans treat their less intelligent animal cousins. It’s not a perfect analogy, of course, but it is the best archetype we can actually observe rather than just imagine.” “Traditionally, life has been divided into two main parts: a period of learning followed by a period of working. Very soon this traditional model will become utterly obsolete, and the only way for humans to stay in the game will be to keep learning throughout their lives, and to reinvent themselves repeatedly.”"

For a start, they are so accessible, he makes huge topics fun to read about. They are interesting, who knew that the history of war, economics, religion and about 20 other things he touches on, could be so fascinating, particularly to someone like me who struggles to read non-fiction and who is so caught up in story. These are the really big stories, the stories of us, who we are and where we came from and where we might be going.In all honesty, this book is so large in scope that it is hard to even start to say what it is about other than that you have to look to the past to know the future. We are inventing machines that are cleverer and more reliable than we are - so where will that lead. We are going to go on living for a really long time but who knows what that will be like. Its a lot! I heartily recommend this book to everyone. Don't be put off by the subject matter - the future of man - read it for the experience of reading something often hilarious and with a slight touch of snark and for a really good time. I did this as an audiobook as all our print copies were issued. We have 5 of them in our high school library and not a one was available. I grabbed one when it was returned to have a look at the graphs and pictures and was really pleased I did. Everyone would benefit from reading this, it is a very rewarding reading experience."
111,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8115180-jiny-s,5,"Homo Deus by Harari is a fascinating perspective on humanity. This book focuses on what could arguably be the defining feature that separates human beings from other mammals on Earth: the conscious mind. Counter to popular belief, the author presents very good arguments that perhaps the conscious mind is not special at all (at least not to the level of divinity that religion makes it out it to be). It may not even exist at all. We certainly would like to think that our mind is special, and in turn that we ourselves are special. Then it becomes easier to justify the plunder and abuse of animals and resources around us. The argument for the existence of consciousness is circular and full of assumptions if you hold it to close examination, and the book does just that. This is definitely an uncomfortable idea, but worth contemplation.This view that the mind/consciousness is not special and may not even exist becomes the pillar for the author’s next interesting rationalization: we are at a point in time where intelligence is decoupling from consciousness, as technology expands towards automation. As technology becomes functional, consciousness becomes expandable. In today’s society we are experiencing this first hand as taxi drivers are being replaced by uber drivers and paving the way for driverless cars. This is very relevant when new realities like self-checkout counters are rolling out by large companies like Walmart and McDonald’s just at a time when we are voting for a raise in the minimum wage. A driver can experience the scenery on the road and enjoy the music on the radio, but those “human” feelings are not required to perform the job. The cashier may come to work late and may miscount change. Those human quirks are in reality hinderances, and by no means required in a functional driver or cashier. It is an argument for the proficiency of machines, at the expense of human usefulness. As for the future, technology is changing faster than evolution can catch up. The ability to free workers from menial jobs doesn’t translate to freedom for the masses. Wealth and power will become even polarized as those who control the technology become the privileged few and the rest will become dependant and helpless on those technology that is suppose to make life easier. For example, the author predicts that the future of medicine will focus on upgrading the lives of the rich, who are few in number, instead of endeavouring to find a cure for diseases and illness that plague the masses.This book is a discourse on humanity with a unique perspective on the conscious mind and the current and future technological impacts. This book presents a lot of new ideas. It’s subjective, but you can tell the author is well read. All in all, it’s very coherent and has a lot of interesting ideas. It’s one of those book that I recommend everyone to read it, because its perspective will enlighten our race as whole. "

113,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3082950-tomislav,1,"I read the author-translated English version of Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow, by Israeli History professor Yuval Noah Harari, in kindle ebook format. This follow-up to his best-selling Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind was published originally in Hebrew in 2015, and later in English in 2016 (UK) and 2017 (US). I have not read Sapiens.I started reading this work under the impression that it would be an explanation of the scientific consensus of the origins of modern humanity and extrapolation into the future. However, what I found was a shotgun opinion piece that careens through philosophy, history, religion, politics and biology. I was noting questionable arguments and responding to them throughout the introductory section “The New Human Agenda.” But when I reached the first section of the main body “The Anthropocene” I encountered so many excessive truth-claims about, opinions regarding, and outright misunderstandings of current evolutionary theory, that the note-taking became impractical. This is not science. Oops, my mistake. And there are nine more sections.It’s a shame, because Harari does have some interesting observations of the philosophical trends of history to make. Unfortunately, they are couched in argumentation that reminded me of Erich von Däniken. I couldn’t possibly cover it all, but here’s one tiny example: In reviewing theistic religion he mentions that God was the supreme source of both meaning and authority. Then he tosses in the statement “Meaning and authority always go hand in hand.”, and thus concludes that other major value systems work the same way. Do they necessarily? Or is it just the one familiar example of theistic religion that makes it seem so? In any case, he just rolls on with the unexamined assumption. It seemed as if I was hitting something like this on every page, which almost completely derailed me from what might be his main arguments. A more major issue is that he strips down humanism to valuing nothing beyond human feelings. Of course, that makes it an easy target. “The humanist religion worships humanity.” Ha, ha, no. But it’s kind of irrelevant, because the dominant value system of recent centuries has not been pure humanism, but a balance of humanism and evidence-driven science. But because his purpose is to provoke reactions, rather than to explain, his definitions can drift with whatever thought he is currently arguing.His speculations for the future finally appear in the last two sections. There are three trends which he emphasizes – 1) Life will be understood as an algorithmic process, 2) Intelligence will be independent of consciousness, 3) Non-conscious, but intelligent algorithms will understand humans better than we know ourselves. Perhaps a “data religion” will become a dominant value system of the next century, as we strive for immortality, happiness, and human divinity. Bah, maybe, maybe not. This work is just capitalizing on the success of his last book. The New Human Agenda The Biological Poverty Line – one past human goal has been the elimination of famine Invisible Armadas - one past human goal has been the elimination plague Breaking the Law of the Jungle - one past human goal has been the elimination of war The Last Days of Death – one next human goal will be immortality The Right to Happiness – one next human goal will be universal happiness The Gods of Planet Earth – one next human goal will be human divinity Can Somebody Please Hit the Brakes – change is accelerating The Paradox of Change – knowing a system changes how it works unpredictably A Brief History of Lawns – unknown origins lead to unwitting assumptions A Gun in Act 1 – Chekov Law; knowing something does not necessarily cause it to be usedPART 1 Homo Sapiens conquers the world The Anthropocene The Human SparkPART II Home Sapiens gives meaning to the world The Storytellers The Odd Couple The Modern Covenant The Humanist RevolutionPART III Homo Sapiens loses control The Time Bomb in the Laboratory The Great Decoupling The Ocean of Consciousness The Data Religion"
114,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8400046-vipul-murarka,4,"Thanks to Netgallery, I was given the free copy of the book to review the same.After having thoroughly enjoyed Sapiens by the same author earlier this year, I was all the more excited to read Homo Deus. While in Sapiens, the author explored on how humans evolved and reached to the point where we are at the moment, this book is about what is there in store for humans in future.The book has raised some really interesting points. While I had read in some articles that the next era will be about artificial intelligence and biotechnology, those articles just gave me a taste of how these two technologies will shape our future. Homo Deus, however, takes this to another level altogether. Harari, a marvellous author, explains each of his theories with examples of latest scientific experiments. He is a brilliant story teller who connects the dots of how the technologies of today can affect our day-to-day instances of tomorrow.The book begins how the priorities of humans have changed over the period of time. Famine, plague and war were always at the top of the list. But at the dawn of this new millennium, these are of least concerns to the humans. Now they are looking to solve problem of overeating than famine. The author acknowledges the fact that there are people dying from hunger too in many countries, but more people are now suffering from overeating more. As always, Harari backs this claim with the example “In 2014, more than 2.1 billion people were overweight compared to 850 million who suffered from malnutrition” or “in 2010, famine and malnutrition combined killed about 1 million whereas obesity alone killed 3 million”.He also explores the philosophical angle to the causes in this book. Earlier whenever there was famine or something bad, people used to blame the Gods. After Scientific revolution, this changed and nearly everything has been given a reason. This is the second part of the book and this is where I disliked the book most. Harari has given too much importance to philosophical angle for this book, at time making the read quite boring for a person like me who doesn’t prefer philosophy. I was just waiting for the second part of the book to get over and something better to begin in the third part (I may have also considered leaving the book in between because of this but my love for this author made me continue).The third part is where you get to read what you expect out of Harari, predicting future by citing examples and explaining through stories. One of the future possibilities that he explores is a new religion that would take humanity by storm and that is dataism. Harari has devoted one full chapter (the last one) on how data would affect the lives of humans and can actually make humans irrelevant like humans have made the animals and other species irrelevant. Since humans do not have the capacity to gather, process and understand large amount of data being generated every minute of our lives today, we will need the help of algorithms which would eventually make the humans irrelevant. While this may still be a far-fetched idea, the possibility is still there and that's what Harari has explained wonderfully. Human nature, he explains, is thus bound to get transformed since intelligence is being uncoupled from consciousness. We may not be building machines that have feelings, but we have already built machines which probably predict our mood and feelings better than we do. For example, Facebook and Google can easily predict what we are going through while we may not be even aware of. Harari has read the evolution differently (and probably correctly) that human beings too are algorithms (one will have to read the book in order to understand this phenomenon). This book of Harari is an intelligent thought-provoking book with amazing insights. The book leaves you with loads to ponder upon. The only dislike for me about this book is that it delved way too much into philosophy than giving scientific examples of what’s going on today.A must read for those who enjoy Harari. If you pick this book without reading Sapiens, I am not sure if you will enjoy it as much. Rating for the book: 3.5 out of 5"

“People are usually afraid of change because they fear the unknown. But the single greatest constant of history is that everything changes.”
A darker shade of Sapiens.The title is quite clever, this is a history book, but one unlike any you've read probably.Is the future closer to the classical sci-fi dystopia? Or is it closer to today? As one of my favorite quotes goes, ""reality is often stranger than fiction"".The first part of the book is very well constructed, I recommend checking it out if the subject mildly interests you and see from there. It is a reflection on our legacy so far and a hypothesis of how things will be in the future.In Homo Deus, Harari shows that he has mastery over his craft more than ever. He mixes his knowledge of past and present to constitute an image of a very mysterious future. Someone unaware of the facts can easily take Harari's statements that he is only making predictions as fake humility.This book will hook you, shock you, educate you, but most importantly, it'll make you think differently. I highly recommend this.
“This is the paradox of historical knowledge. Knowledge that does not change behaviour is useless. But knowledge that changes behaviour quickly loses its relevance. The more data we have and the better we understand history, the faster history alters its course, and the faster our knowledge becomes outdated.”

116,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3895257-mari-biella,5,"After reading Harari's Sapiens, I knew I had to read Homo Deus, which deals in more depth with some of the issues that Sapiens touched upon. The first book focussed mainly on humanity's past; in Homo Deus, Harari turns his attention to our future, and what it may bring.It seems almost trite to mention it, but in the past few centuries mankind has taken immense strides in controlling and containing natural forces. Our medicine protects us from many previously devastating diseases, and – in the modern West at least – we are more likely to become ill from overeating than from malnutrition. Technology enables us to travel around the world in just hours, to connect instantly with people all over the globe, and to enjoy a standard of living that, until relatively recently, was reserved for a very small privileged elite. With the advance of computer sciences we are making immense strides forward in robotics and AI. What, then, might the future hold for us?That huge changes are coming seems undeniable; we can see them developing around us all the time. If you have a pacemaker or a hearing aid, or if you spend most of your time with your smart phone in your hand, plugged into a worldwide network of shared knowledge and experiences, then you can already, in a sense, be said to be a cyborg of sorts. (An early, primitive cyborg, perhaps, but a cyborg nevertheless.) That man may merge with machine now seems less an outlandish sci-fi scenario than a distinct future possibility. What will the results of these changes be? Harari sets out some possible outcomes in this book; whether you think of them as being dreams or nightmares will probably depend on your pre-existing framework of philosophical (or, perhaps, theological) beliefs.The real question, perhaps, is what will become of humanity, or humanity as we know it, as AI and algorithms gain importance and sophistication. We are used to thinking of ourselves as being at the apex of creation, justifiably or not; what will happen when another form of life supplants us there? The strain is, arguably, beginning to show already: the traditional humanist belief in the unique individual, with distinctive experiences and thoughts and free will, is beginning to seem increasingly unfeasible. Equally, with the link between intelligence and consciousness unravelling, if we humans wish to remain relevant we might be faced with the necessity of upgrading our brains. Is this a glorious transhumanist project or a nightmarish dystopia? Will it lead to a new form of techno-humanism, or a future where everything is reduced to an algorithm and the things we instinctively value – such as our own distinctive experiences and perhaps even our consciousness – will become irrelevant? I'm not informed enough to say. If you want to make up your own mind, you could do worse than read Homo Deus.Some quotes:""People are usually afraid of change because they fear the unknown. But the single greatest constant of history is that everything changes.""""Science and religion are like a husband and wife who after 500 years of marriage counselling still don't know each other. He still dreams about Cinderella and she keeps pining for Prince Charming, while they argue about whose turn it is to take out the rubbish.""""In the early twenty-first century the train of progress is again pulling out of the station – and this will probably be the last train ever to leave the station called Homo Sapiens. Those who miss this train will never get a second chance. In order to get a seat on it, you need to understand twenty-first century technology, and in particular the powers of biotechnology and computer algorithms. ... In the twenty-first century, those who ride the train of progress will acquire divine abilities of creation and destruction, while those left behind will face extinction."""
117,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,3,"In Yuval Noah Harari’s previous book, Sapiens, he considered how humanity got to where we are today from a hunter-gatherer culture to a modern industrial farming systems that can support millions. In this latest volume, Home Deus, he contemplates the future; our future, and the events that will shape us in the twenty-first century. We have reached the apex of our abilities with current technology. Going back only a hundred years our lives were frequently cut short by famine, war and illness. Today, in the Western world at least, we have mostly conquered disease and extended our lifespan, but now we are as likely to suffer from obesity or contemplate suicide, total different challenges for the coming decades. He suggests that these will be met as we embrace the modern age of data, pervasive networks and genetic modification. That is assuming that we have a place to live as our world too is under threat because of our relentless pursuit of extracting the maximum resources for the cheapest price. So, what does the future hold for humanity?Harari ponders the possibilities and pitfalls of our future self. He asks and goes some way to answer the questions that we will have to address in the coming years. He proposes that our obsession with information flow may almost become a religion, dataism. How will we deal with the dilemma of choosing between intelligence and consciousness and what is the possibility that we might become part of a wider algorithm or part of the internet of things. These are all interesting questions and whilst he goes some way to answering them, there is a fair amount that is pure speculation and conjecture, but that is what makes this actually quite an interesting book. 3.5 stars overall."

If you read ""Sapiens"" and disliked the omniscient viewpoint, purporting to know the way it all went down, then you shouldn't read this one either; but if you enjoy big thinking, conceptual frameworks, and mental models all laid out in a compelling fashion, this is for you.The data apocalypse portrayed in the final chapter is really dark - like super dark, you're not even needed as a cog in the matrix dark - but the journey up the path to our bleak future is so interesting, you won't be left in a funk reading it. You'll undoubtedly learn a lot about the human condition and our blind spots in how we relate to others (in the animal kingdom and with other sapiens). The connection between your subjective reality and that of others is always a fun place to explore, and Harari's plumbing of those depths with an attempt to connect to an objective reality a level further up, is as fascinating as it is likely flawed (Hopefully flawed?

There are more than one way of looking at life, at humans, and Harari never fails to surprise me with varied range of those perspectives.HD is certainly a must-read for it's more relatable - you cannot be of this time of the era and not relate to smart technology (smarter than you.)

My favorite part of Sapiens was when Mr. Harari speculated about the future and I assumed most of Homo Deus would be various predictions about what our future world could look like. The beginning of the book does just this. Mr. Harari explains that humans have always tried to increase life expectancy, happiness, and our technology. At some point, at least theoretically, we could become functionally immortal (though we could still be murdered or die in accidents) gods (think Greek mythology rather than Biblical), with super intelligence, strength, and other abilities we choose for ourselves. Not to mention, we will have robot butlers that know us better than we know ourselves. They will do much of our daily tasks and even make decisions for us like finding the right person to date.Needless to say, most of this book is not about the future. It is written, as I should have expected, as a stand alone book. Mr. Harari spends much of Homo Deus explaining his take on history and how humans got to where we are today, which repeats a decent amount of the information already presented in Sapiens. This might sound like a bad thing for someone who has already read Sapiens, but Mr. Harari does a good job at keeping the material fresh by using new, and more obscure anecdotes to explain his ideas and does it in a way that I personally think is more effective than in Sapiens. That said, I have a lot of problems with Homo Deus, and I have struggled with how I should rate it. On one hand, the most compelling parts (where Mr. Harari actually talks about the future) are really well done. On the other hand, he makes significant claims (as he did in Sapiens) that I don’t think the average person agrees with and expects the reader to just accept them based on (in my opinion) rather flimsy evidence. The big claim that I had a difficult time with was that science says organism are algorithms, and by extension, there is no free will. He went on and on about the free will thing, and it kind of triggered me. That doesn’t make it an untrue claim, obviously, but sometimes I think the people who argue against the idea of free will expand the definition of what free will is so that no one could possibly believe in it. It is not enough that you have choices to make in life, just the fact that your choices and opportunities are limited makes free will an illusion. In his defense, Mr. Harari’s argument is smarter than this and concedes that a person can very well make a decision based on their wants, but goes further and asks why does a person want what they want? Can you choose what you want? If you can, on what basis would you make such a decision? Is there even a specific thing that you want, or do your wants change with the various chemical reactions in your body? Harari is a believer in the idea that there is no true self. You have your drunk self, your conservative self, your slutty self, (these are my examples, not his) and they compete with each other. There is no way to tell which part of you is the true you and no reason to think such a thing exists.These were interesting ideas and it isn’t that I didn’t like this part of the book (among others), I just didn’t think it was particularly important to go quite as in depth about the subject as he did. There were multiple parts of Homo Deus where I got this feeling. It was as if Mr. Harari had ideas he really wanted to put into writing and came up with any way possible to make them fit into a book.In another part of the book, Mr. Harari, who is a vegan, went on quite an epic rant about how people mistreat animals for our own benefit. Fair enough. It was compelling stuff - as compelling as anything I have read on animal rights. Does it have much to do with the book? I mean, he made it work, but if a book of this type had nothing on animal rights, no one would think twice about it.Harari is also an atheist, which also can be easily deduced from the numerous times he announces that “God is dead.” This is a view that I pretty much agree with Mr. Harari on, but I think his bias against religion lead him to some poor predictions. I don’t think Islam and Christianity are going anywhere. This is especially true if some of his earlier claims are true. Earlier, he presented the idea that much of who we are is inherited, which if true, would leave me to believe religion might become even more important with time since religious people have much higher birthrates than secular people.Like a lot of my other reviews, I tend to dwell on the negative, but this book is still very well-done and entertaining. It might not be for people who haven’t thought a lot about the future, are very religious, or don’t like hearing radically new ideas. Thinking about the future can be very scary. The goals humans are trying to achieve for ourselves and our machines will lead to a world that is as different 100 years from now - possibly to the point where not only the world is unrecognizable, but maybe even the humans themselves. In fact, I think it is very likely the world will change more between the years 2000 to 2100 than it did from 1900 to 2000. I think the world will change so much, and the average person has no clue. There are still people that think driverless cars is some sort of fad with little to no benefit. Honestly, if you can’t come to grips with the idea cars will drive themselves (they already can), how are people going to adapt to the possibility of living 5oo years, or maybe forever? For this reason, I would recommend it to everyone. Normally, if I recommend a book to everyone, I would give it an automatic five stars, but I am taking off a star for Homo Deus for too much meandering, even if it was interesting the whole way through."

It is scary to see the possible consequences of freedom of information. Harari uses history and various analogies to make sense of ancient ideals. He also relates it to how we reached the modern concept of liberalism and individualism. It definitely challenged my thoughts and beliefs. Are humans simply algorithms? Do we believe in humanism only because it benefits us and makes us superior from other organic beings? Did capitalism succeed because it was convenient at the time? Given the pandemic, protests, and rising inequality - how can we create a better world? Will we have to rely on dataism and biotechnology to tell us what to do? So many thoughts to ponder after reading this book. Hi, algorithms, how are you? "

I felt as though my brain grew with each sentence I listened too, even though sometimes I zoned out completely and had to go back oops.This book started a little slower for me but once the discussion about AI and immortality and human enhancement began I was all-in because that stuff is so darn interesting. I will say that unlike Sapiens, this was lacking in a timeline to keep it structured so sometimes I thought the ideas jumped around a little. It didn't make it hard to follow necessarily but it was different to what I expected.Still a really great read, something I'll be talking about for a while and will definitely pick up again.

Dissatisfied, irresponsible, and don't know what we want. That pretty much characterizes Homo sapiens for the majority of its history that we know of, and he poses a very unsettling question at the end: is there anything more dangerous?"
131,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3849889-linda,5,"The author uses history, research and science to discusses what turns the future might take. It is mind blowing and uncomfortable. As in his previous book, Sapiens, he discusses very interesting themes in an extensive way. What happens when homo sapiens become homo deus? Or, when homo sapiens are superfluous because they have created some superior creature?When having conquered most of famine, plague and war, we will try to achieve eternal life, bliss and divinity, according to Harari. Perhaps, eternal life is not as wonderful as it seems. That would make bliss extremely important. Happiness is difficult to create because it depends on contrasts and expectations. People then have to mixture with their dna or take medical treatment, but does that achieve happiness or just another level of expectations?He discusses religions and their parts in history as well as today and the future. It is interesting to think of humanism as a religion in the west. Humanism can be divided into liberal, evolutionary and socialist humanism. Harari describes how humanism became the great religion in the west, having influence over subjects of today, instead of old religions that are unable to explain much of the current science progress or which turn the future will take. However, humanism and liberalism are not likely to stay. In the future, people are probably not going to view each other as equal. This is where the book becames really creepy. The author claims that socialism exists because many healthy soldiers and workers have been needed. Women rights exists because women have been needed during the wars. It is difficult to imagine what will happen in the future, when the technological and biological progress might make people superfluous and unemployed. Perhaps, only a number of people are needed, then. A superhuman class, in which wealthy people have access to biological and technical development. I think everyone should think about that to make it possible to try to avoid loosing humanism.Today, algoritms need some information about us, that we ourselves distribute online, to know us better than ourselves. In the future, algoritms might be able to make most decisions for us. When algoritms control people, there will be difficult to talk about free will. However, it is not certain that we even have free will today. There might be a combination of neurons, transmitter substances, heritage, and much conflicting impulses, but when it comes down to it, where is a person’s self? What is a self? It is difficult to have a free will if we are not even one self, but perhaps a combination of biology and heritage. It is definitely interesting. According to humanism, human desires are giving the world meaning. How will it be if we can choose our desires? When having mixtured with our dna, to feel as good as possible all the time, it will not be that easy to know what we really would have wanted.According to Harari, the future religion might be dataism. As capitalism, dataism began as a theory, and then turns into a religion. Human beings are seen as tools to make a flow of information. The data flow knows everything about everyone and algoritms view people all the time. Our thoughts and feelings are only used to make decisions, and when algoritms do it better than ourselves, we are going to be superfluous. When data volume and speed are going too fast for human beings, democratic elections and parlament might be outdated. We didn’t vote about cyberspace. Research about this is needed. Most people like to be online, a part of the information flow. Many people think that there is no point in experiencing something if not sharing it online. It is scary to be able to see the pattern today. However, there is more to life than only data processing and decision making.I wonder how people in the future, superhumans or homo deus will behave? When some of them are contributing to the society when others don’t? When they lack uncomfortable feelings that they have chosen to discard, such as doubt, hesitation or perhaps even very important feelings such as emphaty or compassion? When they live forever, what importance will old religions have? What is precious, then?"
132,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,4,"After Sapiens, we all knew that Mr. Harari could write about popular science in an engaging and thought-provoking way. In Homo Deus, he takes the logical next step: instead of tracing the brutal and surprising fragments of the sullied past, he turns his eyes ahead and peers into the crystal ball.Homo Deus takes off where Sapiens left off, at the dawn of the New Man - or, indeed, at the beginning of the End of Man. We are already uploading, with increasingly rapid pace, our memories and thoughts into the great web, where humanity is already merging with cutting-edge technology.Harari's book is transhumanistic in the broadest sense of the term. It tackles the question of technological interconnectedness - automation, robotization, A.I., the Internet of Things - as the next stage in our evolution. Our past has been preparing us for this task. Our species' algorithm is generating a global web. Silicon Valley is the new Mecca of the techno religion and the whole Earth is succumbing to its evangelism. The book's approach is bravely futuristic, but skeptical of single-minded visionaries. Harari doesn't give us a single vision, but a palette of possible futures - and our choices may matter here. Or, better yet, ""actions,"" since Harari fiercely denies we have free will.I have some gripes about Harari's interpretation of 6000 years of human history. His book is full of sweeping statements that should not be taken at face value and only reflect partial perspectives. His view that individualistic liberalism is dependent upon the illusion of free will is mistaken. Many of the classical instigators of ""liberal"" individualism were fierce deniers of any free will- including the ancient Epicureans, Hobbes, Spinoza and Hume - which Harari conveniently ignores, in order to make the fallacious argument that liberalism will fall in the age of science. There is no reason to claim, as Harari does, that collectivism is the logical consequence of the denial of free will. (And, in fact, many forms of collectivism - Abrahamic theocracies included - are believers in a free will.)That said, the best parts of the book include the overview of the history of liberal humanism as a time-bound ideology. The excesses of humanistic folly are well worthy of debunking - if only to be defended anew with better, naturalistic arguments. I also love his explanation of the role of religions and other fictional thought patterns as modes of organizing social life in cooperative patterns. The web of Christianity and Islam may have paved the way for the web of Google. Our lives may not end in materialistic consumption but in the cybernetic assumption into the Divine, even if the Divine that we conjure up may not look anything like the ethereal Sky God of yore.Homo Deus is a powerful read. It is fiercely naturalistic, scathingly polemical and refreshingly blunt. It doesn't offer many original answers, but it aggregates data, old and new, into a boldly synoptic perspective. The Information Age needs more of these grounded prophets of informational assembly, these mundane poets of the silicon chip, these skeptically optimistic gurus of the rapturously post-human future."

On the other end, not being a specialist, I’m not discarding them either.The writing style was very easy to follow and engaging, making it a pleasant read that I kept going back to. Some themes that could’ve been fairly dry, like recapping humanity’s history and evolution, were done so in a way that explained the essential parts without making them unpalatable.A lot of theories in this book hinge on organisms being driven by algorithms, like machines are. Biological algorithms, that is: stimuli triggering responses that follow a set of instructions (see threat – produce adrenaline – react, that kind of instructions). Well, why not! I do enjoy my little world of believing that, because I’m a human being, I am exceptional, but if I think about it, I’m still an organic machine, with needs for fuel, and a limited self-repair ability. And so, as algorithms-based beings, there’s a fine line to thread between creating always more powerful computers, and maybe one day being driven by them, with their ability to process so much more data, and so much faster. AIs composing music or haiku, after being programmed with complex sets of algorithms to reproduce what would touch human ears and trigger emotions: something that is both fascinating (how far we’ve gone) and frightening (we’re not so unique anymore).Following this, the book explores potential outcomes: if we end up building machines that can perform better and faster (like the Google automated car that will apply the brakes in time vs. a tired human who won’t react fast enough) , won’t we become obsolete? What can we do then, what kinds of occupations for us, and if none—can a sustainable economy grow out of this, making it sustainable for everybody, or will humans just have to go down the road of extinction?In general, though I felt this book wasn’t going far enough in presenting those possibilities both exciting and scary (improved humans vs. free will as being only the product of our desires/algorithms). Sometimes I had the feeling I had already read something similar in a previous chapter. Somehow it seems to be better inspiration for a sci-fi novel than for actual theories about what may happen in the future?Still, it’s food for thought. Also, from other reviews, it may be that a previous book (“Sapiens”) by this author would be more interesting, so I may be tempted to read it later."

Subtitled, ‘A Brief History of Tomorrow’, this follow-up to ‘Sapiens’ confirms the author’s mastery of deep research combined with an intelligence that permits him to see the world as a whole.I selected this book to read now as I’m at the initial editing stage of a science fiction novel and the blurb suggested it might help me consider my imagined future in a broader way. It has done that. And how.Harari displays incredible insight in his analysis of the world we inhabit. His knowledge of science, history, religion and much else brings the reader a comprehensive, and alarming, picture of the state of humanity now and the potential future that lays before us. He manages to combine down-to-earth common sense with a deep understanding of the most abstruse theories surrounding so many areas of human activity and thinking.The book is divided into three sections, preceded by a longish, but eminently readable, introduction to the New Human Agenda. Part two looks at Meaning from a human perspective. Part three looks at Control and who holds the power, who might hold it in the future. Not a book to skim read or even cherry pick, this is a volume that requires your concentration throughout. Dealing, as it does, with complex issues and themes that may be new to some readers, it nevertheless describes these in plain language that everyone should understand. I have learned a lot about the world in which I live whilst perusing these pages.The future, a time I constantly consider in my life and in my writing of fiction, is an unknown land. What Harari does here is to give that strange and alien destination potential shape and form. And I admit that what he reveals is not a world I would wish to inhabit. Having said that, his vision is, as he so eloquently explains, not a prophesy. It is, as all such endeavours must be, a series of speculations based on current knowledge interpolated and made subject to imagination to reach a possible conclusion.This is a book that’s important. This is a book that’s vital. This is a book all people should read. A warning about what may happen to humanity if we fail to act to prevent the possible future. Our children deserve our attention to what might be. If we fail them in this, we may fail the future of humanity."

I learned a lot. I was delighted by the knowledge and the wit. I was excited about Homo Deus, because of course I'm curious what smart people think is going to be come of us as we continue to evolve.That's not really what this book is, though. The introduction sets a few predictions of humanity's goals (~10%), then launches into How Mean We Are To Animals (~25%), followed by Different Forms of Humanism Over the Last 100 Years (35%), and then starts just regurgitating in more detail some of the thoughts sprinkled in the first half of the book (the last ~19% before I quit).What is the point of this book? Why isn't it just a blog where someone smugly writes about their depressing views of humanity, our history, and our doomed future? Is the bleakness of believing that Humanity Is An Algorithm the reason why the author seems to be most sympathetic towards Evolutionary Humanism, even while admitting that yes, the Nazis were indeed sort of violent in their expression of that worldview?There is one sort of person I would recommend this book to. They are white, male, wear a fedora (but will correct you: ""It's actually a trilby""), are working towards becoming vegan, and are very angrily atheist (but in every argument will tell you with a red face that they're NOT UPSET). Now, there is nothing wrong with hats or veganism or atheism, but you know what sort of guy I'm talking about, and he would probably LOVE this book. So he can have it.This is the most misanthropic book I've ever had the displeasure of laying eyes on. It's not even funny misanthropy, which might have made it worth finishing. (This is the saltiest review I've ever written.)"

They were describing how an AI algorithm being developed with the assistance of Google technology is now able to analyze mammograms with greater accuracy than an experienced oncologist. It is still not faultless, and our current system of double-checks still works slightly better, but the AI is on the verge of being able to provide this diagnostic ability with much greater accuracy and much less manpower.Homo Deus is chock-a-block with such prognostications regarding how so many aspects of our modern life are about to change and change DRASTICALLY. In describing these drastic changes, Harari poses some interesting questions. What is more important: intelligence or consciousness? Is consciousness just an epiphenomenon of the chemical soup of our human brains, as many scientists now think but cannot yet prove? Can intelligence be completely replaced by technical algorithms? If so, what is the role of humanity going forward? Should we sit back and let intelligent machines do all of the work and thinking for us while we simply sit back and relax? Will our AI machines outgrow us and decide we are no longer necessary?These are all very big ideas, and over the years, many authors have tackled some of them, even if not all at once. Homo Deus is a bit different in that it is very up-to-date, and Harari covers these questions in some depth. If anything, it is sometimes a bit overly ambitious, as there is just so much subject matter here, it is difficult to do it all justice. Perhaps that in itself is a bit of a sly warning from the author. Perhaps we are already on track to be so overwhelmed by these questions, which few people in our society seem to be rationally discussing, that they will be decided for us..."

Harari takes our current predisposition toward and ability to take part in upgrading ourselves and commentates upon the frangibility of our underlying presumptions. Moreover, he skewers (what he considers to be) the naiveté of our thinking of ourselves as, variously: fundamentally different from animals, immune from obsolescence, or unique in a way that cannot (eventually) be replicated by the most mundane and thoughtless of automata and algorithms. I will say that it seemed like this (very impressive, very trenchant) book was weakest when Harari glibly asserted that we humans are mere aggregations of algorithms. Arguments often merely asserted--using ""possibility"" rather than ""plausibility"" as their main ballast--that it's not a matter of whether things as complex as language, emotion, and feeling can be *perfectly* reduced to algorithms, but when. From the purely legal/logical perspective--an industry whose perseverance, by dint of its reliance upon the ambiguity of language, would seem safer than most others--we would say that just because something is feasible, possible, or seems probable, this has no bearing on its eventual occurrence. But maybe that's just a lack of imagination on my part... or prideful antipathy toward anything that suggests my own jogtrot mundaneness ;)Either way, you should read this. It's pop-y and digestible, but it offers a really interesting and provocative perspective on our self-important species."

In order to cross the border, they needed visas to Spain and Portugal, and together with a flood of other refugees, tens of thousands of Jews besieged the Portuguese consulate in Bordeaux in a desperate attempt to get that life-saving piece of paper. The Portuguese government forbade its consuls in France to issue visas without prior approval from the Foreign Ministry, but the consul in Bordeaux, Aristides de Sousa Mendes, decided to disregard the order, throwing to the wind a thirty-year diplomatic career. As Nazi tanks were closing in on Bordeaux, Sousa Mendes and his team worked around the clock for ten days and nights, barely stopping to sleep, just issuing visas and stamping pieces of paper. Sousa Mendes issued thousands of visas before collapsing from exhaustion. The Portuguese government—which had little desire to accept any of these refugees—sent agents to escort the disobedient consul back home, and fired him from the foreign office. Yet officials who cared little for the plight of human beings nevertheless had a deep reverence for documents, and the visas Sousa Mendes issued against orders were respected by French, Spanish and Portuguese bureaucrats alike, spiriting up to 30,000 people out of the Nazi death trap. Sousa Mendes, armed with little more than a rubber stamp, was responsible for the largest rescue operation by a single individual during the Holocaust.Books don't really make me cry often.

Homo Deus sets out a possible future for humanity. Harari asks some disturbing questions such as will we be rendered obsolete by increasingly intelligent programs, will the wealthy be effectively upgraded leading to a new functional class system (echo's of The Time Machine), has democracy had it's day, how much privacy are we willing to sacrifice for convenience etc etc? Harari looks back at some of the themes covered in Sapiens and then moves forward, neatly showing how our current structures, models and cherished beliefs may not survive. I did not like the possible futures that were set out in this book, however it is important to consider where we may be going as a species so that we can prepare for it. Whatever the future holds I believe that the current economic model will not be fit for purpose in the future. More and more jobs will be capable of automation so what will humanity do and how will they be supported in the necessities of life?Of particular interest was the summary of the current models of how our brains work. The current model supposed that we are a series of algorithms, and thus potentially capable of being predicted by intelligent software. Is such a view correct? Unfortunately only time will tell, but the workings of the mind has long defied scientists ability to crack it, so I doubt that this will be the final word on the subject.

I would have to say that despite the title of the book, it mainly examines the past and present, such as the ways things changed in the past to demonstrate how our current modes of thought might change in the future, and the evolution of humanism and classical liberalism (to separate it from America’s bastardization of the term).It is probably the most ‘interesting’ book in regards to philosophy and human nature I have read thus far in 2018.

It is a study of possibilities, not prophecy. It is an examination of the history and nature of Homo sapiens, and how we may change as a species in the coming century and beyond. The author writes in the manner of a thesis, starting with the three following statements:1.​Science is converging on an all-encompassing dogma, which says that organisms are algorithms and life is data processing. 2.​Intelligence is decoupling from consciousness. 3.​Non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms may soon know us better than we know ourselves.These points are explained and argued, and the question then quite naturally arises: what does this portend for humanity as we know it?

I really like the way that Harari proposes new vantage points for us to assess the human condition and to think about what the future might hold, both for our own 'individualist' egos and for the way the world will operate.

155,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,4,"In the twentieth century, mankind finally overcame the three dangers that threatened us for millennia: famine, plague and war. Nowadays, the world is safer than ever (even when including recent eruptions of violence in Syria and Ukraine), the world population is better fed than ever and the amount of people dying from disease is rapidly decreasing. And this happened in a century that saw two World Wars and the Cold War with its various offshoots in the Third World. How did we manage to do this? By applying the technologies discovered by science, which is funded by capitalism (state and business), and by upholding the creed of humanism, which proclaims every human being to be sacred and is written down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Anno now, we have ended up on the one hand with a healthier, wealthier and safer world, and on the other hand with the creed of humanism and the extremely successful scientific method. So now, what do we do?We can’t go back, or even halt the progress, since growth is what drives the whole system. The moment science, money and humanism pause, the system collapses and we’re all thrown back to where we were before this successful triad came to be. Luckily, being human, we always concoct new dreams and hopes. Research into bettering our lives will lead to ever grander goals to accomplish, and consequently to ever more economic investment.The twenty-first century will see humanism, science and capitalism work together to try to solve three technical (!) problems: (1) conquering death, (2) creating lasting happiness (through changing our biochemistry, using drugs, or tampering with our genes), and (3) becoming divine, in the sense of superhumans with upgraded abilities (through a variety of techniques). In other words: Homo sapiens has created technologies that can help it transform, over time, in Homo deus. This is the future of mankind, if you draw new lines from the current development in science, capitalism and humanism.This, according to Yuval Noah Harari in his Homo Deus (2016), is a the New Agenda for humanity in the twenty-first century. But, he warns us, his predictions about the future aren’t really predictions: they are just logical outcomes of current processes, which can be changed if we, humanity, want to. So one aim of his book is to write down future scenario’s, in order to make people think, and with this to avert the outcomes from ever materializing. In that sense Harari is a modern-day Karl Marx – who critically analysed the capitalist system of production, drew the logical conclusions, and with this changed the way economists and capitalists viewed the system and (indirectly) changed the lives of millions of proletarians for the better. Marx was wrong, with hindsight, only because his analysis was so spot on. The book then is divided into three parts. First, Harari wants to look at how humanity originated as a product of natural selection, and how we relate to other animals. Second, he wants to look at what made us so successful that we conquered nature and ended up with a creed that declares the human to be the epitome of everything: humanism. And third, he wants to look at the near future: what will happen with humanism in the age of artificial intelligence and technological breakthroughs. 1. Human beings have evolved by natural selection, just like all other organisms that inhabit this planet. All organisms have two underlying drives: survival and reproduction. We need to eat and have sex. In order to manipulate our environments to accomplish these goals, we need to make decisions and need to act in particular ways (and not in other ways). This is where emotions kick in. Emotions are a rule of thumb, albeit an imperfect one, to make decisions and to act. If we had to calculate every valuable and analyse the sum total and draw conclusions from this, well, we would already have been starved to death. It follows from the above that on the one hand we have materialistic needs (food, drink, sex) and on the other hand we have social needs (relationships, care/attention, etc.).During our evolution, we went from living as hunters & gathers, together with all nature; to living as farmers, dominating animals and plants around us, as keeper of God’s Creation; to living as industrial humans, dominating all of nature and having killed God through science. This evolution of our species saw us trading in more and more of our social wellbeing for the fulfilment of more and more material needs. And not only for ourselves, all life on planet Earth has been sacrificed in the name of Homo sapiens. The cow in the factory farm is nothing but a chain in the production process of milk, standing for months in a cell, waiting until the milk production lowers and then brought to the slaughterhouse. Nowadays, man truly reigns supreme.2. But what distinguishes us from animals? It can’t be a soul, since science has done away with that notion. A soul – an immortal and indivisible thing – is not compatible with the gradual evolution through natural selection. It cannot be consciousness either, since consciousness – although still not understood by scientists – seems be a gradual and evolutionarily developed concept. Animals have consciousness as well; some more and some less. No, what truly makes Homo sapiens unique is its ability to create a fictional reality that exists only between human beings. We are able to cooperate in large networks by depending on fictions, non-existing entities like money, the state or the law. Cooperation through imagination – this is absolutely something that distinguishes us from all other life forms on planet Earth. We are the only ones who have added, next to the objective reality (the world as it is) and the subjective reality (our inner sensations, thoughts and emotions), a new sort of reality: inter-subjective reality.As a corollary, this is also why Homo sapiens seems to be the only species that demands life has a meaning. While the lion continues to hunt the zebra, and the rabbit continues to hide for the fox, we ponder and reflect on what it all means. Meaning, according to Harari, is believing in these inter-subjective fictions – and these change and unravel all the time. Hence, the work of the historian is studying the change and unfolding of inter-subjective fictions.The fictions that human beings concoct all clash with reality. Whether it’s religion, money, the state or something else, reality has no room (or time) for our delusions. Fictions also cause a lot of suffering – the fiction of money for example, transforms a human being in labour-time and a cow into a chain in the production process of milk. When we look back a our past, we see an ever-increasing number of fictions come and go – and the twenty-first century will see even more. Although these fictions enable us to cooperate in large networks, this comes at a price: human beings have to submit to the system of fictions, and this system then runs further on its own (Dennett’s flee floating rationale). So the capitalist system has submitted the world population to its will, and now runs on its own, algorithmically, making us and the planet suffer in its wake. One of the most important fictions that mankind came up with, is the belief in abstract rules, or natural laws, governing mankind. This is what Harari defines as religion. Religion is the shared belief in ethical fictions, in order to promote large scale cooperation. The ultimate goal of any religion – be it Christianity, Buddhism or liberalism – is to increase order and subvert chaos. Ever since the seventeenth century, though, religion has an opponent – although most of the time it can be called a loving brother as well. This is the belief in gathering evidence to answer factual questions about the world. This is what we call science. The ultimate goal of science is to increase our power over nature. Science cannot exist with religions (i.e. ethics), but all religions make factual claims and are consequently submitted to the weapons of science. The only religion still left standing in the twenty-first century is humanism – the belief in the supernatural status of mankind, which comes with obligations (i.e. human rights) to each individual human.As explained, fictions offer us meaning. But as also explained, fictions have been constantly under attack by science, which doesn’t care about our feelings, but searcher for brute power. Science and capitalism run on the subjection of everything and anyone, leading ultimately to economic growth. Growth is the pillar of power, and although this has brought us much (see Harari’s claims on plague, famine and war), it came with a huge downside: we plunder our world and ecological crises will scar our planet in the twenty-first century. The scary thing is, this system of capitalism and science is practically unstoppable. This is because capitalism is a level-2 chaotic system: it is inherently unpredictable, since predictions influence the course of events. (Don’t let economists tell you otherwise!)Now, what was this about humanism, being the last surviving world religion? Well, before the Scientific Revolution, meaning came from authority. Agricultural societies believed in gods, or God, and did what they were purportedly told. Knowledge in such communities equalled reading the Scripture and applying logic. But this became impossible after the Scientific Revolution: now knowledge came from making observations and applying mathematics to look for underlying causality. Humanism jumped on this new, rather successful way to do things, and came up with its own formula of meaning. According to the humanist creed, meaning comes from sensitivity and experiences. In other words: listing to ourselves, pay attention to our experiences and what we feel about them, and then honing our faculty of sensitivity. Now ‘feeling’ became leading: enter Romanticism. (We are still in the age of feeling and emotion, by the way.)As with all religions, it didn’t take long for humanism to split into rivalling sects. The central problem? We all agree that human experiences are important, but for whom? The liberalist would claim: me! But the socialist would claim: the collective! And the evolutionist grunts and shouts: the supreme race! This, by the way, makes the twentieth century a century of wars of religion: communism, Nazism, liberalism, fascism were all religions that fought it out on the global battlefield. In general, liberalism won. Its emphasis on individualism has led to technological and scientific advances that have bettered the lives of billions. How did liberalism do this? It adapted to its age – it incorporated all the continuous new developments in science and technologies, while no other religion did this. (For example, the communists thought they could create their own socialist wheat, leading to millions of starving people.) But these advances now seem to herald the age when liberalism disappears. Why? Because liberalism is based on the idea of free will. Liberal institutions run on free choice: as consumers we determine the markets and as voters we determine democracy. But science shows us more and more that there is no such thing as free will; and the technologies that we have created make all of our behaviour predictable. This is the beginning of the post-liberal era, in which mankind is better known by its algorithms than by himself.3. This brings me to the last part of the book, where Harari explains how science and technology will create a new human being – whether we like it or not.The life sciences and especially evolutionary biology have brought us new knowledge about ourselves. The liberal notion of the ‘self’ (the ‘thing’ that possess free choice/will) is nowhere to be found. There is no such thing as a self, and there certainly is no such thing as a free will. What does exist, are two things: (1) streams of incoming experiences, which are processed in neural networks, and (2) a narrative creator that spins satisfying stories by selectively handpicking experiences. We rationalize ourselves, our behaviour, our thoughts, but this is only because the spin-doctor in our left hemisphere is working on his fulltime job. The technologies of the twenty-first century will make this double-game extremely hard to uphold. Cold data will offer us undistorted information about ourselves. But the dismissal of our inner spin-doctor isn’t the biggest problem we face nowadays. The biggest change for mankind – ever – is the decoupling of consciousness from intelligence. Up to now, the only intelligences we were familiar with, were conscious. Vampire bats distributing blood to their fellows; dogs bringing the morning paper to their owners; human beings solving math problems. Intelligence and consciousness looked intertwined. But now mankind is creating pure intelligence, which is (by definition) unconscious of its experiences. Artificial intelligence is nothing but algorithms, and these algorithms will conquer technology. Algorithms don’t need food, mates, sleep; they don’t need payments and they certainly don’t go on strike; but most of all, they work much faster, continuously, and more precise than humans. Harari claims that these technologies, run by AI, are de-humanized (consciousness is left out) and that we will subsequently be viewed as a set of algorithms ourselves – the life sciences already view us in this way. This transforms us from individuals into dividuals (i.e. bunch of algorithms) and we, as a bunch of organic algorithms, will become dependent on AI – which can make much faster and accurate predictions and decisions for us. Does this sound strange? Look at your smartphone – you already have outsourced your human brain to AI.Where does this leave us? Harari sees three scenario’s: (1) human will become ever more useless, (2) humans will retain some of their usefulness, but only as a collective (as input for big data), or (3) economic inequality and AI will lead to the creation of a class of superhumans and a huge mass of subhumans (a.k.a. normal human beings). It is also possible that these three scenario’s combine in multiple ways.The twenty-first century will also see the rise of new religions. Liberalism, with its individual freedom as foundation, seems doomed. But there are already two alternatives waiting for us to embrace. The first such a religion is techno-humanism, which sees the human being as apex of creation, and tries to incorporate the old humanist values as far as possible into its new creed. In short: techno-humanism strives to create a superhuman by using technology to upgrade parts of Homo sapiens. More cognitive power, longer lifespans, disease-free bodies, etc. In other words: techno-humanism seeks to transform Homo sapiens into Homo deus. Man becomes a (Greek-style) god.There are two problems with techno-humanism, though: what domains do need upgrades? This is an ethical question, which cannot be answered by facts alone. And even the facts involved are highly distorted: most of psychological science is based on huge datasets of rich, white, Western psychology students. Generalizing from the journals to mankind is almost impossible. A second problem for techno-humanism is that it looks to upgrade those traits that we desire to upgrade. But what if we can also tinker with our desires? What if technology can change our desires and needs? What if the will becomes malleable? What do want to want? There truly is no straight answer to this.Luckily, there’s a second new religion waiting for us to adopt en masse. This is called Dataism, which reduces man to bits of data; man as part of an overarching system of data-processing.To understand this new religion fully, it’s important to understand two of current scientific dogma’s: in the life sciences, life is defined as the processing of information, while organisms are defined as algorithms. Ever since the life sciences stumbled unto these two dogma’s, it has become possible to merge the life and computer sciences: everything is part of the same data-processing system, that ultimately can be described my mathematics. In that vein, the history of mankind can be seen as the history of a system of data processing. When man started to live in bigger groups, the number of processors increased. When the social division of labour arose, the variety of processors increased. When money and bookkeeping allowed trade networks to spread, the number of connections increased. And when liberalism and capitalism took over the world, and pushed for radical freedoms, the freedom of movement within the system increased. Systems of data processing only function through freedom of movement, which leads to the ultimate value of the new religion Dataism: freedom of information. (This has, by the way, nothing to do – at all – with humans; it is information that is valued!).So what now? Up to now, feelings were the best algorithms for decisions; now we, the feeling organism, have created a better algorithm, one without consciousness and inorganic: AI. We have created a global system of data processing that offers us everything: faster and more accurate decisions, the option to follow authority (instead of thinking for yourself), etc. We are already plugging ourselves into this all-encompassing system by the billions: Facebook, Google, smart watches, apps, etc. When the Internet of All Things is ready, this picture is perfect. Man reduced to bits of data; and once the system knows us well enough (better than we know ourselves), we become technically superfluous. The data processing system runs harder, better and faster without us. What happens then?Up to now, man evaluated everything in the world – flora, fauna, man – by its function within the network. “How useful is this or that for this particular function?” Now, for the first time, man has built something that turns everything upside down: from now on, man himself becomes evaluated by its function within the network. We all know what mankind did with objects that were evaluated useless – witness the mass extinctions, the destruction of habitats, the reduction of humans and animals to chains in production processes. When we look back and see our own selfish ruthlessness and cruelty, do we see our own imminent future?The central question of Homo Deus (2016) seems to be, at least for me, will we become a Homo deus, or will become bits of data within the System? There’s a choice to be made here, and the choice is completely in the hands of a select few people, determining the research agenda’s and the funding. Even though Harari’s aim with Homo Deus was to follow historical lines to their logical conclusions, and use this as a mirror for humanity – i.e. he predicts in the hope that these predictions will be acted upon and not be fulfilled – it is a very interesting window into the near future. I think Harari has hit upon some very thought-provoking, dangerous, but also spectacular ideas. I think this is the best book that I’ve read in a very long time. "
156,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34093041-christina,5,"Simply by typing in this review I am adding data to the world that is no longer in my control, can be plugged into an algorithm and contribute to understanding my own behavioral patterns and preferences, while at the same time adding to a mass collection of data on readers. Homo Deus showed how humanity evolved in thought and self-reflection throughout the decades - initially we created fictional worlds for ourselves ruled by higher entities and explained natural phenomena through the wrath of God, then we went on to believe that the world is spinning around us and now we are entering what Harari assumes to be the new age of data ruling the world. To say Harari is a genius in analyzing humanity's past and future is an understatement. I will first approach to answering the three questions that Harari himself left us as readers with at the end of the book, and then if I have any additional thoughts add on afterwards. Also may I note I have over five pages of handwritten notes and this is me only getting through ONE FOURTH of the book and all the passages I underlined. 1. Are organisms really just algorithms, and is life really just data processing? We believe to have free will and make conscious decisions of our own. Isn't that the core of our humanity - we get to decide what we do, whom we spend our time with, and on a banal level simply eat for lunch? In reality, our decisions are a collection of biochemical reactions and we don't chose as much as we lead ourselves to believe. ""Humans act according to their desires. If by 'free will' we mean the ability to act according to our desires - then yes, humans have free will, and so do chimpanzees, dogs and parrots."" We serve as vessels for data processing of algorithms where neurons fire away, and cause us to think certain thoughts and then act upon them. As we start understanding more about the brain we are seeing that our brain is a series of impulses that trigger our actions. Therefore, does this mean that life is just data-processing and the better an organism becomes at data-processing the higher quality life they have? As search engines, and algorithms fire up at an alarming speed they are beginning to out run us in being able to make better decisions. An app can calculate you based on your likes on your social media, activity on the phone, and analytics from your biology to calculate who is your best long term partner. Humans have shown to make disastrous long-term decisions, but should we then handle over to algorithms to make decisions for us? ""Algorithms won't revolt and enslave us. Rather, they will be so good at making decisions for us that it would be madness not to follow their advice."" We already allow phones to take our data and advise us on making decisions, just for example is all the health monitors we carry around. 2. What's more valuable - intelligence or consciousness? Intelligence is our ability to think through collections of data and draw conclusions that will benefit us. We use intelligence to propel our own desires, whether that to be to gain more power over the Middle East or solve equations presented by quantum mechanics. In contrast, consciousness is our stream of thought the inhibits our mind every single day. It is the perceptions we have of the world around us and the feelings we have towards our bodily sensations. If looking at propelling our human species to constant growth intelligence will get us there, but consciousness serves as an integral part of our humanity. All animals have a consciousness and ripping it away creates a new organism that no longer reflects the human that we know now to be. 3. What will happen to society, politics and daily life when non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms know us better than we know ourselves? I don't know. We are already giving up our own thinking power by enslaving ourselves to hand held devices and spending hours upon end on electronics. We are losing our ability to concentrate, question and be in the moment for simple activities such as brushing our teeth, which now require a distraction of checking your social media because how dare you be a moment alone with your thoughts! It scares me to think what our world will look like when highly intelligent algorithms will try to dictate the narration of our lives because in a sense aren't we losing our humanity? But then yet again according to Harari all we thought our humanity was based on is bs - we have no soul, no special essence and no higher knowledge. Instead we have been able to excel as a species due to our ability to organize ourselves and create networks that allowed us to slowly build up cities and take over the world. We are only succeeding in comparison to the elephants because we have been able to collaborate together with a single goal in mind, such as build pyramids for the pharaoh. Upon reflection, I am realizing that I need to be more conscious as a consumer to what I do with my devices and what I allow to dictate my life. I need to be aware when I am on my phone or computer scrolling through the Internet - it is these thoughts that entrap my mind for life and I can chose to allow it to rule me or make my own decisions (or believe that I am making my own decisions). -------------------Last theme I want to extrapolate on before my head explodes from this migraine of thinking this book has caused me is animals and our relationship to them. At the first the thread of thinking towards animals was encapsulated around religion and the idea that God made animals to serve us humans and provide us with necessary resources, allowing us to use them however we saw fit. Then in the trend of humanism, humans internalized that they are the superior species that can utilize all other species since they are below us. Currently, people will mark that humans have traits such as compassion, generosity, and empathy that makes us better than animals, justifying our abuse of animals because they do no have these traits (or so we tell ourselves). But for fuck's sake if you have compassion towards others why aren't you including animals in your loving compassionate bubble? Just because you don't experience the realities of slaughterhouses on a daily basis does not mean that animals suffer less or their psyches aren't traumatized on a daily basis. No longer do I think that we as humans are ""above"" animals and that we own some special magic within us. And even if we did would we not realize our ""specialness"" and ensure that all species living on this Earth get to enjoy the same benefits because oh our empathy is overflowing? Nah. We like to trample on everything in the name of our own desires because how dare we give up that delicious steak. Additionally, it reinvigorated me to become veggie again soon by reading the statistics on the amount of domesticated animals that there are in the world. In Europe, there are 1.5 billion of birds flying around and 1.9 billion chickens manufactured for our consumption. We are washing out wild species by the second and we tell ourselves that it is in the name of health!taste!ages of eating meat! But if we are such intelligent beings we need to look back out past, reflect on what we did before and realize that our behaviors must change to ensure our own future success. "
157,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53373701-shoti,4,"I’m an atheist but Harari claims that atheism is not equal to non-religiousness. My religion is humanism which has been the dominant belief since the 18th century. It is very unfortunate that I have just come to realize that I am a religious person, at a time when my religion is already over its zenith and enters its twilight years. It will soon be replaced by a new techno-religion, be it techno-humanism or dataism. That’s quite disheartening news. What’s even more depressing though is that I’m not more than a complex, sophisticated, but ultimately decipherable system of biochemical algorithms. I don't even have free will!! Whatever I believe I want to do is no more than the result of deterministic or random biochemical reactions running on my carbon-based human body as a platform. No wonder I can’t compete with the emerging non-organic algorithms. They have no consciousness but will be far more intelligent than I could ever dream of. Unless, unless … I decide (and could afford) to upgrade my obsolete organic network of biochemical algorithms in a manner that allows me to stay in the race. But can I decide to do this if I don’t have free will? You know what, I don’t worry about that question for now. I could leave the whole decision to some non-organic algorithms. After all, they will know better what is best for me. Despite the several overlapping themes with Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind this is another great product of innovative thinking by Harari. His conclusions are both mesmerizing and saddening somehow."
158,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46052387-laura-kristiina-valdson,2,"2,5/5I had higher hopes for this book. Here's what's great: it covers wide range of topics and facts, so that the average reader can refresh his/her memory. It's easy to read and the author tries to tackle most important topics on human civilization - where we're coming from and what is the possible future like. HOWEVER. Here's what it gets wrong: there's no in-depth analysis whatsoever. We're given facts and facts only. He presents a fact (with reference of course), makes an assumption and moves on to the next fact. I actually didn't learn anything new from reading this book, so if you're a curious person who reads a lot of articles on medicine, neurology, psychology, how the brain works, if you understand evolution and basic history and the idea of humanism - then the book is not for you. You probably know all the things Yuval Noah Harari talks about. So unless you want to refresh your memory, read something else. ''Factfulness'' by Hans Rosling is better use of your time."

Nevertheless, the book incorporates great insights and an intriguingly fresh viewpoint and perspective on the future of human civilization."
160,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38087945-farha-crystal,4,"Welcome to a Brave New World!""Harris thinks all humans share a single supreme value – minimising suffering and maximising happiness – and all ethical debates are factual arguments concerning the most efficient way to maximise happiness. Islamic fundamentalists want to reach heaven in order to be happy, liberals believe that increasing human liberty maximises happiness, and German nationalists think that everyone would be better off if they only allowed Berlin to run this planet. According to Harris, Islamists, liberals, and nationalists have no ethical dispute; they have a factual disagreement about how best to realize their common goal.Yet even if Harris is right, and even if all humans cherish happiness, in practice it would be extremely difficult to use this insight to decide ethical disputes, particularly because we have no scientific definition or measurement of happiness. Consider the case of the Three Gorges Dam. Even if we agree that the ultimate aim of the project is to make the world a happier place, how can we tell whether generating cheap electricity contributes more to global happiness than protecting traditional lifestyles or saving the rare Chinese river dolphin? As long as we haven’t deciphered the mysteries of consciousness, we cannot develop a universal measurement for happiness and suffering, and we don’t know how to compare the happiness and suffering of different individuals, let alone different species. How many units of happiness are generated when a billion Chinese enjoy cheaper electricity? How many units of misery are produced when an entire dolphin species become extinct? Indeed, our happiness and misery mathematical entities that can be added or subtracted in the first place? Eating ice cream is enjoyable. Finding true love is more enjoyable. Do you think that if you just eat enough ice cream, the accumulated pleasure could ever equal the rapture of true love?""Wow, he has picked the point of having no points :) The book tear apart everything that anyone could possibly believe in, everything from political beliefs and social contracts to religion and purpose of life. The first section of the book walks through the death of Deism. He argues that many on earth may still believe in a deity, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that it isn’t already dead, just that the body still needs to throw out. The second part of the book focused on the rise of Humanism in Deism’s place. Many religions today incorporate the philosophies of Humanism, but Yuval does an excellent job at converting everyone else who not on board yet. But once he has you on the pattern, he hangs Humanism by the neck until the reader’s perception of the world is drowned in overwhelming nihilism. :DThis makes way for Yuval Harari’s prediction of the future about Dataism. This new religion is the blend of technology, AI, and the human race. The final goal is to upgrade the homo sapien to Homo Deus. And yet, Harari uses historical anecdotes to convince the reader that this belief is just as momentary and meaningless as every belief system in the history of Sapiens.Finally, the book finishes with a vague sense of reality :) With all of that negativity out of the way, the book really does bring new and interesting thoughts to the table.I wish I could join a conversation with Professor Harari, Isaac Asimov, Carl Sagan, Noam Chomsky, Lawrence Krauss and Richard Dawkins in the same table before I die :) "
161,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19806749-shira,4,"I may have to revise this comment that I made after reading the first book: Sapiens -(I heard an interview with him on NPR, and I love his idea that our institutions are fictional, that therefore works of fiction can and do shape our world. So, yes, there really is hope.)To begin with the end:. 1.) No, we are not just algorithms,2.) Consciousness, is more important than purely calculative intelligence, and 3.) How important is the level of control given by society to various algorithms? It really depends on the algorithm (s) design, biases, objectives, and ability to self-correct based on universal human rights principles. This is a very difficult book to rate, since I initially loved his style and even most of the content, which did not seem to be that big of a revelation given that he's drawing on known information. Yet toward the second half of the book and definitely toward the end of the book, there almost seems to be a feeling of bitterness. I used to believe in and be part of the Electronic Freedom Foundation back in the 90s, and I definitely believed in, and I think I still believe that, information wants to be free, but I certainly would never consider human beings to be mere algorithms.I agree with his assessment that big data combined with biased algorithms can be problematic, and we are starting to see studies that show that the algorithms of many many systems are heavily biased, and it's a problem. but I was just a bit shocked because I had not thought to put all of these different pieces of technology together in the way that he is portraying the possibilities. I do not necessarily believe that information wants to be free is the model of a new religion, but I do know many people who hang on the hopes of humanity on technology. And none of them grew up poor. So yes that does worry me. I believe he has a good point in pointing out that most of the studies and most of the bias in our big data and algorithms that use that data are any fever of well-to-do white people. This is one major reason that we need more women and people of color in technology. But his reasoning, and I hope he's right that his warnings may become a non-self-fulfilling prophecy that get short-circuited through corrective action, means that the average human being needs to be upgraded to education and urgently. So now more than ever we need adult education, we need people to pay attention to public library systems, continuing ed. and Free University for everyone, along with free transportation and healthcare and pro bono free legal and financial education, to help people to be able to pay attention to upgrading their educations. We need to be doing this on a massive scale. He is right that we are, in general, not paying attention to what needs to be paid attention to, like the emerging technologies and where they could head. We are all too busy being distracted by the extremely short-term problems. And who can blame us? But we must keep trying to look up and see that bigger picture from time to time, or, he is right, the train might get/stay on the wrong track."
162,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,4,"Homo Deus is a great gateway to thinking about the future of humanity. Harari spends a good amount of time looking at how we got here (from what I'm told, there's significant overlap between this and his popular book Sapiens) and extrapolates forward into the future to surmise where technology will take us and how it will radically alter what it means to be human. There's extensive focus on how we will beat aging and death and how we will eventually merge with or be replaced by machines. Artificial intelligence will make much of what we do (especially vocationally) obsolete as machine algorithms replace our evolutionary algorithms. This will strike at the very premise of our economy, as humans won't be needed for much of anything that machines can do faster and better... which will eventually include art, music, writing, and other realms that are currently considered off-limits to machines (though he provides examples of these boundaries already fading).These changes will also force us to give up our dependence on liberal democracy - the machines will know our needs better than we do, though we must wonder who will control those machines. Also falling by the wayside will be religion, which Harari defines very broadly as, ""any all-encompassing story that confers superhuman legitimacy on human laws, norms and values"". It's too broad a definition if you think of religion as organized belief practice that centers on the recognition and obeying of a particular deity. While he quickly dismisses the very premises and core tenets of traditional religions, Harari's ""religion"" includes concepts like communism, liberalism, and yes, even humanism, which he breaks into three distinct sub-categories that he expects a coming data religion to replace. It's in the realm of politics and religion that he loses me somewhat, as his unceasingly confident delivery does not modulate to match the broad strokes he's painting with. He contradicts that confidence later by saying that everything in this book is speculation. While that's to be expected, given that it's all about the future, one is still hard-pressed to know where he intends to be taken with a grain of salt. Also, some of these predictions might be self-defeating if taken seriously. As he aptly points, out, however: ""What's the point of making predictions if they cannot change anything?""A lot of this will sound familiar to anyone who has read on the subject before, and Harari uses many illustrations and references that I've seen elsewhere, but he pulls them all cogently together into a single volume. It's definitely a great place to engage with these ideas and start thinking about where our current trajectories are leading us... just remember that you don't have to agree with everything he says, because he probably doesn't either."

Random Thoughs while Reading the book:This book made me question my significance and relevance for the future. It shook the very foundations of idealogies where I took refuge. I honestly dont know if AI revolution will build the world that Harari shows us or if it will be more dystopian than that. I was ofcourse excited by the new pursuit that humans would undertake in the future like upgrading themselves to super humans, pursuing immortality and all but it left me scared all the same. Harari explains with his gripping story telling on how fully digital the world will be, how your AI will know your health status to emotional status even before you realize it, how algorithms will be the new GOD and how happiness will be the new normal state and how there will be pills to guide your behavior and success, as much as I want to be part of the future, somewhere in my heart I believe I would probably remain an outcast; unplugged from the rest of the world. I dont know if the future that Harari made me imagine is just a turn away and I dont know if I want it to be that close. Should I admit that the future really scares me?Phases of Upheavel of Emotions I went through:1) Woah Human history 2) Wow Science and Technology3) Religious Dogma and Society and a sense of englightenment4) Whaaaaat???

And even that was thanks to a friend that pushed me to read it. I figured that I am not always a huge fan of the latest hype. Overall, I liked this book. It is nicely written, and very clearly portrays the ideas. What I didn't find though was anything that was too revolutionary, it all made quite complete sense, and I kind of expected to be shocked by this book (or something). Maybe it is because I come from the tech world, that I am quite used to most of these ideas, but as I said, no shock came my way.Several topics that liked included: 1. the discussion about living much longer. It was interesting to me to see his point of view of what it means, and what is going to change.  2. The fact that we all believe in imaginary things. A state is as unreal as the Roman Gods.  3. That finally someone defines religion to be what it is. Not just the traditional religions, but also everything else (like Communism). Religion asserts that we humans are subject to a system of moral laws that we did not invent and that we cannot change. I loved the discussion around religions and how they made sense, and make sense today to their believers, even if not to anyone else. All too often, people confuse religion with superstition, spirituality, belief in supernatural powers or belief in gods. Religion is none of these things. Religion cannot be equated with superstition, because most people are unlikely to call their cherished beliefs ‘superstitions’. We always believe in ‘the truth’. It’s only other people who believe in superstitions.The great think about this book is how clear it is, and how well the author puts his trail of thought on paper (or electronic paper). I will keep reading him. Almost 4 stars."

It requires concentration, thought and reflection with every sentence - exactly the right book for me!Other than Sapiens, which tries to explain how our species came to dominate the Earth, Homo Deus picks up where Sapiens left and looks to the future. This makes it a highly philosophical work, while being just as narratively brilliant.Harari argues that the principles that have organized our society will undergo a huge change with severe consequences for life as we know it. Along the way he constantly reflects on highly critical questions, from all fields of philosophy, psychology, politics, religion and science. I don‘t always agree with him, particularly in the last part of the book, where he talks about artificial intelligence. Besides I believe that we have much more urgent, relevant and realistic questions to answer and am simply not too fond of the topic. My favorite things I extracted from the book:- the way I see terrorism - to look at happiness from a psychological and biological point of few separately- to see emotions as algorithms - to realize how badly we abuse and torture animals - to understand the core problem in the dispute between religion and science- our split brain hemispheres and how narrating and experiencing collide with each otherYuval Noah Harari is absolutely one of my favorite authors.

It isn't common for me to find a non-fiction book and actually enjoy it, so yes, reading it and then finishing it and enjoying it all the while was sort of like a huge thing for me. I have never read a non-fiction like this one so I might simply end up liking the book for that precise reason. But whatever it is, it was a great read. Divided in sections based on what he wants to discuss, Harari ended up discussing quite a lot many things; the most important of which was individualism. I guess I sort of understood why my teacher involved it in the course. The book makes one think, it makes one want to find out more on what he is trying to say. I haven't read Sapiens so I can't really compare the two but I still liked it so I might be reading that one soon, too!"

I was super-impressed by the author's ability to look far into the future and join the dots that columnists and opinion-makers have failed to recognise. Very often, people say that social sciences are not important in the era of breakneck technological progress. It has also been said that history is obsolete information at a time where we must be focussing on the future. But Harari blends tales of the past to predict the kind of future that we might see. This makes the history a vital compass to the future, even though we cannot predict it accurately. The first and the last chapter have stayed with me as a reader.

That confused me and put me off. The 80-page introduction cries out to be condensed or removed. But once it gets going, it has interesting things to say.The final part, where he really starts thinking about ""tomorrow"" remains interesting, but there is little, if anything, in it that I haven't seen explored in science fiction novels.

Since reading this book I increasingly appreciate the topics that it addresses, as it has given me greater perspective on the possibilities and consequences of our actions today. The book reads easily and analyses possibilities without arrogance, acknowledging that what is being discussed remains alleged today. "

183,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7483415-rob,5,"The old saw that ""if you don't know your history you are doomed to repeat it"" has become something of a truism, not because it has nothing to tell us, but because we have distorted all the parameters that we used to be able to use when looking at certain recognisable elements in the conditions that were coming back around again. We could still compare. Where the steam engine brought enormous societal and commercial change, it didn't actually change the human being, so there were still a number of cycles to go through.But now there is a very real possibility that we human beings will embark upon the creation of our own version of evolution rather than waiting for any incremental change to come and meet us along the way. Yuval Noah Harari, the young Israeli historian who struck such a chord with Sapiens, his history of humankind, now looks at the present and future of our race and the bonkers little adventure we seem to have unleashed on this hitherto unsuspecting ecosystem on the third rock from the sun. He's a good guide to take along because he has a sure touch and he's an acute observer not just of the past and the canon and the expectations forged in ivory towers, but also a scholar of the here and now, primed to poke at some of the questions we tend not to ask ourselves enough and to shed some unexpected light on issues we thought we knew our way around.Essentially when we signed on for humanism and saw ourselves as important rather than as mere cogs in a machine that we ourselves had invented but wanted to pretend came from outside us, this new deal led easily and inexorably to individualism and selfishness and not just moral relativity but now also physical relativity. We aimed first to control the nature we saw outside ours, then redefine our own nature, perhaps as far as becoming immortal (or amortal, as the case may be).As well as being well-equipped to bring together strands of far-flung information, Harari is also endlessly quotable. Here he is looking at the issue and evolution of religions and their creation myths: 	""In fact, God is present even in the Newton myth: Newton himself is God. When biotechnology, nanotechnology and the other fruits of science ripen, Homo sapiens will attain divine powers and come full circle back to the biblical Tree of Knowledge. Archaic hunter-gatherers were just another species of animal. Farmers saw themselves as the apex of creation. Scientists will upgrade us into gods.""True enough, all of our fantasies tend towards the attainment of some form of godhood… And having posited the existence of intersubjective reality - things we believe not because we experience them as sensations or from observed facts, but from our own belief systems or fictions - Harari has this to say:	""During the twenty-first century the border between history and biology is likely to blur… because ideological fictions will rewrite DNA strands; political and economic interests will redesign the climate; and the geography of mountains and rivers will give way to cyberspace… [T]he intersubjective reality will swallow up the objective reality and biology will merge with history. In the twenty-first century fiction might thereby become the most potent force on earth, surpassing even wayward asteroids and natural selection."" All of this meaning that we not-so-humble Sapiens are deeply and inalienably self-interested liars to ourselves and others, mistrustful of the random elements of observable reality, eager to bend it to our own (often narrow and usually self-deluded) purposes. Rather like Mr Trump whenever there are inconvenient facts around. Then again, post-truth is but a single tiny corner of a human rush to irrational belief in poorly documented belief systems, where by definition there can only be one truth, often the one invoked by the loudest or sharpest voice in the room:	""In theory, both science and religion are interested above all in the truth, and because each upholds a different truth, they are doomed to clash… Religion is interested above all in order. It aims to create and maintain the social structure. Science is interested above all in power. It aims to acquire the power to cure diseases, fight wars and produce food. As… collective institutions, science and religion prefer order and power over truth.""Many seek to avoid this dastardly duo by hitching their star to the spirit and its journey. Here the underlying difference between spirituality and religion is laid out starkly:	""[R]eligions seek to cement the worldly order whereas spirituality seeks to escape it.""	""From a historical perspective, the spiritual journey is always tragic, for it is a lonely path fit for individuals rather than for entire societies. Human cooperation requires firm answers rather than just questions, and those who foam against stultified religious structures end up forging new structures in their place.""Look at that last line. The new form is sold to individuals in humanist terms and then the structure is built so that this ""new form"" can be shared. Which is not to say that modernity is necessarily a much better catch in terms of what it leaves on the plates of we cooperating animals:	""Yet in fact modernity is a surprisingly simple deal. The entire contract can be summarised in a single phrase: humans agree to give up meaning in exchange for power.""	""Modernity turned the world upside down. It convinced human collectives that equilibrium is far more frightening than chaos, and because avarice fuels growth, it is a force for good. Modernity accordingly inspired people to want more, and dismantled the age-old disciplines that curbed greed.""	""The modern deal offers us power, on condition that we renounce our belief in a great cosmic plan that gives meaning to life. Yet when you examine the deal closely, you find a cunning escape clause. If humans somehow manage to find meaning without deriving it from a great cosmic plan, this is not considered a breach of contract.""Humanism, then, is a hall of mirrors that leads us back inside ourselves, but it does at least aim for a connection with the arm's-length humanity of others. We at least make a pretence of empathising with our fellow Sapiens, whether by watching films or reading books about them going through their rollercoasters of experience, or sending them the wherewithal to have a meal on us that on the other hand society's structure does not allow them to get for themselves from the trees or rivers or fields.	""In ethics, the humanist motto is ‘if it feels good – do it’. In politics, humanism instructs us that ‘the voter knows best’. In aesthetics, humanism says that ‘beauty is in the eye of the beholder’.""	""In the early nineteenth century, Wilhelm von Humboldt – one of the chief architects of the modern education system – said that the aim of existence is ‘a distillation of the widest possible experience of life into wisdom’. He also wrote that ‘there is only one summit in life – to have taken the measure in feeling of everything human.""	""People feel bound by democratic elections only when they share a basic bond with most other voters… such as shared religious beliefs and national myths. They are a method to settle disagreements between people who already agree on the basics.""However, hardwired into the human being is an inability to separate the act from the belief, or rather a great ability to justify the act because of whatever is invested in the belief that led to it. This is why people keep voting for a government that works directly against their interests, or maintain a system based on blood sacrifices. Stubborn, proud people. Less likely to be happy, because our pursuit of happiness is couched in terms guaranteed to make us unhappy.	""A poor peasant sacrificing a priceless bull to Jupiter will become convinced that Jupiter really exists, otherwise how can he excuse his stupidity? The peasant will sacrifice another bull, and another, and another, just so he won’t have to admit that all the previous bulls were wasted.""The third part of the book focuses on what the future may hold for us, having as it does either the opportunity for machines to ""correct"" human failings, or to take over the whole show.	""For example, in a recent experiment a computer algorithm diagnosed correctly 90 per cent of lung cancer cases presented to it, while human doctors had a success rate of only 50 per cent.""	""In its first year of operation the robotic pharmacist provided 2 million prescriptions, without making a single mistake. On average, flesh-and-blood pharmacists get wrong 1.7 per cent of prescriptions.""And chiefly among the concerns that start tumbling out here are what are humans actually going to contribute to this new world that has supposedly been built from our own desires and aims? What has been the actual purpose of all our sound and fury? When we started to specialise in one or few areas, what were we actually leaving behind us?	""In 2010 only 2 per cent of Americans worked in agriculture, 20 per cent worked in industry, 78 per cent worked as teachers, doctors, webpage designers and so forth. When mindless algorithms are able to teach, diagnose and design better than humans, what will we do?""	""In fact, as time goes by, it becomes easier and easier to replace humans with computer algorithms, not merely because the algorithms are getting smarter, but also because humans are professionalising. Ancient hunter-gatherers mastered a very wide variety of skills in order to survive, which is why it would be immensely difficult to design a robotic hunter-gatherer… However, over the last few thousand years we humans have been specialising…, which makes it easier to replace [us] with AI.""	""The new technologies of the twenty-first century may thus reverse the humanist revolution, stripping humans of their authority, and empowering non-human algorithms instead. If you are horrified by this direction, don’t blame the computer geeks. The responsibility actually lies with the biologists.""Then we have the new ""religion"" of Dataism, which suggests that the only important element in the universe is data and human beings are simply data processors which are one step above other animals and one step behind whatever we're about to morph into as a result of all our data.	""Dataists believe that humans can no longer cope with the immense flows of data, hence they cannot distil data into information, let alone into knowledge or wisdom. The work of processing data should therefore be entrusted to electronic algorithms, whose capacity far exceeds that of the human brain.""	""Dataism is neither liberal nor humanist. It should be emphasised, however, that Dataism isn’t anti-humanist. It has nothing against human experiences. It just doesn’t think they are intrinsically valuable.""	""In the days of Locke, Hume and Voltaire humanists argued that ‘God is a product of the human imagination’. Dataism now gives humanists a taste of their own medicine, and tells them: ‘Yes, God is a product of the human imagination, but human imagination in turn is the product of biochemical algorithms.’ 	""It is equally doubtful whether life boils down to decision-making. Under Dataist influence, both the life sciences and the social sciences have become obsessed with decision-making processes, as if that’s all there is to life. But is it so? Sensations, emotions and thoughts certainly play an important part in making decisions, but is that their sole meaning? Dataism gains a better and better understanding of decision-making processes, but it might be adopting an increasingly skewed view of life.""To say the least. Essentially what we have in the human being is an animal so utterly self-absorbed that in feathering its own nest it goes and makes itself obsolete. Then it tries to argue that really it's just an in-between step in an experiment to share data between, um, we don't know yet, and what is that data intrinsically in any case, if in fact all we have is what we ourselves have experienced with our rather downmarket sense experience equipment? There is apparently no navel deep enough into which to gaze. This would all be rather amusing in a Doctor Strangelove kind of way, but then we have to consider that in fact we really resemble nothing more than a conceited teenager who blows himself up in his bedroom while trying to invent something no one's ever seen before without having read the book properly. There is a point, surely, at which each philosophical construct needs to be rooted in the provable reality of the being to which it is supposed to apply. Because if not, we're just into salesman-reality, in which anyone who can convince anyone else to believe in a new reality automatically gets points. We have to admit there were some brilliant snake oil salesmen, after all. But why should that be our future and destiny?Harari's point is that all of these movements and shifts are going on right now and something will come to pass out of them about which we have absolutely no idea. No one is guiding this plan. We are stepping onto some kind of bucking bronco of a future that has mutated from the bucking bronco whose neck we are currently hanging off and all we know is that we don't know what on Earth we're going to do when the new bronco is in place. We'll come up with something, of course, but not everyone is going to like it.So, my advice is to read Sapiens first, to at least have a few warm feelings about what this human creature/dreamer/chancer managed to create (and destroy) in a relatively short period of time. Then read this follow-up work and ask yourself any number of pertinent questions. When there is no longer any need to use humans as cannon fodder or cheap labour, what do we do with them? And who, exactly, is ""we"" in that scenario? Who will get to benefit from the human being acting as the scorpion on the back of the frog, following nature/self-interest so inexorably down the line that there's nothing left? Or will we somehow get a grip and find a new way that is neither frog (gullible acquiescence) nor scorpion (arrogant self-harm)?"

I was properly dumbfounded by the (certainly very simple) thought that modern religions have been invented hundreds or thousands years ago, and as such, are awfully unmodern; their role for the future is thus either constricting and braking or null. Again, nothing new about this thought; but pronounced with the quality and devotion of Harari, it makes its point.The book consists of the following parts:1. The New Human Agenda.The biological poverty line (resources limit humans from reaching overreaching goals; this is changing: look at China, for example). Overeating becomes a worse problem.Invisible armadas: plagues and diseases. The fate of indigenous societies (in America, Hawaii, etc.) faced with European microbes. The struggle continues, but it looks promising.Breaking the Law of the Jungle: wars are disappearing too. Terrorists: a fly that tries to destroy a china shop (find a bull!). The Last Days of Death: self-explanatory. A view into the future of immortal life and how (and with what complications) it might arise. Death as a technical problem. Ray Kurzweil (Google Calico).The Right to Happiness. Biochemical pursuit of happiness.The Gods of Planet Earth. Inserting chips into bodies etc. Homo sapiens will disappear. Divinity in the Greek or Hindu fashion, not Biblical. (The Old Testament God never promises and rewards or punishments after death.)Can Someone Please Hit the Brakes?

185,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14551209-dan-connors,5," Yuval Noah Harari wrote his first book, Sapiens, about the history of the human species, taken from the best anthropological and historical data available. It was absolutely fascinating and one of my favorite history books ever. Homo Deus takes that history one step further and tries to look at the future, which is a tougher proposition. There are a lot of factors that make the next 50 years murky at best- artificial intelligence, global warming, rising inequality, rogue nuclear states and the always possible meteor wipeout. Harari begins the book lauding mankind for overcoming the three deadliest problems of the last millenium- famine, plagues, and wars. He points out that death from all three have declined tremendously so that populations have climbed and new challenges await. The middle of the book is about out search for meaning through what he calls ""intersubjective realities,"" or religions and quasi-religions that only exist as concepts for organizing society. The modern covenant, as he calls it drives us to pursue power and growth to find meaning, while flirting with ecological Armageddon.  Liberal humanism, Harari writes, became the de-facto religion of the world with the collapse of communism and fascism. Humanism puts humans and their hopes, dreams and feelings at the center of the universe. It encourages free elections to make political decisions and free markets to make economic decisions. Being caught up in this worldview, it is hard to imagine a day when kings and pharaohs possessed all the power and wisdom. The final part of the book looks at the next big threat to liberal humanism- algorithms. Harari looks at a new emerging religion called ""Datism"", where all meaning comes from data processing and algorithms that make sense of it all. More data drives bigger algorithms and humans are much less important, even obsolete. Some humans at the top of the pyramid will have options to supersize their brains and bodies, while a huge gap will emerge as many lose their economic usefulness. This frightening scenario is still far in the distant future and it's my hope that humanity finds ways to save human dignity while utilizing the best of technology to create a new world better than the one we have now. Homo Deus makes you challenge your beliefs in free will, individuality, the existence of the soul, and how to make the future better. It's a hard, 400 page treatise on what humanity could face in the future and I thoroughly recommend it and Sapiens. Three other takeaways I will always remember from this book:- Nicolai Ceaucescu of Romania's last speech and how an empire fell in just seconds.- Aristides de Sousa Mendes, the Portuguese bureaucrat who saved thousands of Jews from the holocaust with pieces of paper.- The ""Our boys didn't die in vain syndrome"", as shown by a general who kept sending troops into a hopeless situation rather than cut his losses. "
186,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30261451-celia,4,"This is undoubtedly the scariest and most upsetting book I have read in a long time.In it, Harari is describing the future:Humans will no longer be important unless we become like gods.In 11 chapters, Harari shares the following ideas:1) In the 21st century, man is searching for immortality, happiness and godlike powers.2) If you really understand the theory of evolution, you understand that there is no soul.3) Humanists worship humans. (My comment: Humanists care about humans).4) God is dead – it’s just taking a while to get rid of the body.5) In the past there were many things only humans could do. But now robots and computers are catching up, and may soon outperform humans in most tasks.6) Humans are in danger of losing their economic value because intelligence is decoupling from consciousness.7) Soon, books will read you while you are reading them. And whereas you quickly forget most of what you read, Amazon will never forget a thing.8) Homo sapiens as we know it has run its historical course and will no longer be relevant in the future.9) Humans are nothing but data-processing machines: we too are algorithms.My husband loved this book and wanted me to read it. My reaction to this book and my husband's shows our greatly different reaction to new ideas: He embraces these ideas; I am mortified by them. Although I have plenty to say about how much this book upset me, I will acknowledge that the book is well-written and thought-provoking. That is the one positive thing I can say about it. The ideas Harari presents definitely had me searching my non-existent soul (!!) and solidifying my own beliefs.4 stars"
187,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42041616-andra,5,"Even if you are someone who has read Homo Sapiens and who knows what to expect from Yuval Harari, Homo Deus will nevertheless still surprise you, albeit on fewer occasions than with his first book (or at least I have found that to be the case for me for a substantial part of the book).The fact that the book begins by presenting controversial ideas designed to make you think in ways you haven't before cannot be denied. However, halfway through my read I was ready to give it a 4-star rating upon seeing that quite a few of his previous observations and ideas from Homo Sapiens were being reiterated and I could only imagine how much more disturbing this would have been had I read Homo Deus immediately after finishing Homo Sapiens. My view was quickly changed upon starting the third and last part of the book, which presented even more ingenious possibilities for the future of humankind and which did indeed manage to make me both more curious about seeing how they will play out in the future and somewhat concerned. Overall, an eye-opening read that will definitely get you thinking (and sometimes disagreeing with the author)."
188,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60212235-mohamad-shibly,5,"Sapiens and Homo Deus have changed the way I perceive the world and the way I think. 2 great books rich with information historical, psychological, philosophical, biological etc delivered in such a way that is easily comprehensible by the average reader. This book has taught me to look at everyone else as a homo sapien, to understand their needs, weaknesses, insecurities, their greed and love, wars… Harari’s books are not only factual, the author adds so much subjectivity and his insights are so enriching, they make the reader think and contemplate. The structure of the books are excellent, the transition between ideas and paragraphs are so smooth and reader friendly.Whether I agree to what he says or not, what he presents in the 2 books will definitely make you think, and I could say I walked out of this experience a richer Homo Sapien."
189,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5010988-laura,3,"Whereas Sapiens was loaded with fresh, challenging insights & I haven’t stopped thinking about it, Homo Deus felt re-trod. When he speaks of past/current state, he trots out his own past conclusions. And when he speaks of Future Homo Sapiens, his speculations aren’t particularly inspired - I’ve heard them before from others.He also comes across as naive at points, especially when talking about religion. He may be convinced that God is dead. He may be convinced that all rational people concur with him & make decisions accordingly. But he’s naive to think that an idea that has shaped humanity for at least as long as recorded history is just going to dissipate. And he spends no time speculating on what might replace it.Still, Harari is worth your time. And so are the issues he probes."

Reading it I felt that many of the ideas are first of all repetitive with the ones in Homo Sapiens, secondly, text is sometimes unnecessarily extended and it seems that the author repeats himself.

195,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93563862-rami-hamze,3,"Disappointing! After a mindblowing 5-star Sapiens.While the book has got good scientific analysis, most of it is a repitition around concepts from Sapiens which is history of mankind rather than of tomorrow as claimed. No ""wow factor"", and no new insights here.The future proposition is also not based on strong arguments, and it is all over the place. I prefer the Stephan Hawking version of ""predicting"" the future.Also, the reader can sense a tone of arrogance and overconfidence in some chapters, not as frequent as that of Nassim Taleb in ""The Black Swan"" but as annoying."
196,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/46527503-borys-kho,5,"I really enjoyed reading Homo Deus due to a lot of ""wow"" moments throughout the book. Harari's speculations and predictions on ""the man of tomorrow"" are thrilling and even really realistic given recent technological progress. Among the most interesting ideas that I noted are: - Mind and consciousness control Nobody knows how the mind works exactly, however, scientist are slowly progressing in this area. At this point of time we are able to control small animals such as mice by simply using a small helmet, which sends signals into a brain and create a desire (e.g. turn left, right, etc.). The mouse does not even suspects that someone might be creating this desire, but feels that it wants to turn left at this particular moment. If we are able to control small animals it seems logical that in the future we will be able to control people. The love potion from the famous Harry Potter might not sound like a fantasy anymore and in the future ""creating"" love might be a matter of a few electromagnetic signals into a brain. What will happen to humanity if we will be able to control the mind? What will happen to liberalism and democracy? Will we have elections and how decisions will be made? These and many more questions will need to answered if we will learn how to control a person's mind. - Advances in technology and personal data availabilityThroughout history people were able to remember, store and process more data than any other species or machine. However, the tides have changed and machines are beating us in many tasks already. They are getting smarter and better every day, hour and minute. Big corporations are investing heavily into creating new technologies that will eradicate misery such as war, hunger, illnesses, but what will be their price? Will we get to the point when a machine will be able to control us and make all of the decisions for us? Will our dependency on technology and willingness to share personal data enable machines to know more about us than we know ourselves? These are very valid and complicated questions that nobody knows an answer to. - Immortality is fiction or reality?In the past immortality was only something to dream about. All of us read stories of elves, who are able to live thousands and thousands of years. We heard stories and saw movies about the fountain of eternal youth or legends about kings and knights, who spent their life in search of immortality. Well... in the future, these legends and myths might turn into a reality. Recent bioengineering break-thoughts are indicating that it might be possible to hack human's DNA and reverse some of the biological processes, upgrade our body and mind and thus become immortal. - Dataism - the religion of the 21st centuryTechnology and science are serious threats to religion. A lot of things that in the past were only explained by the Bible are now easily explained by science. The scientific revolution changed religion forever and helped to create a new ideology - humanism. In simple terms humanism is an ideology that believes in people. Basically we need to do what is best for us and follow our heart. However, with the advancements of technology and increasing amount of data the machines might be able to make better decisions than us. It will be possible to substitute 1 billion cars worldwide and create an efficient artificial car sharing network that will use only 50 million cars to transport humans worldwide every day. Such network will be more efficient than the current set up and we will not need to worry about parking space, car maintenance and wasting time in traffic jams. This definitely sounds appealing, however, such set up is only possible if we give up our privacy and share our personal data. This network needs to know where we are based in a particular moment, what is our need and where we want to be transported. Therefore in the 21st century a new ideology might emerge. Harari calls it dataism. Dataists believe in sharing personal data for the sake of efficient and effective computer networks. Overall this book discussed many controversial and complicated topics. It makes you think and wonder about the future of humanity. Highly suggesting! "
197,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16080726-sabin,4,"There's so much to like about this book. It feels just like sitting in a puffy fat armchair and getting handed everything I need to know about the state of the world today on a silver platter, masterfully arranged by the best wordsmith I've come across in non-fiction. I feel privileged, I feel satisfied and content for understanding the world just a little bit better without even lifting a finger to dig deeper for more information. His books are a wonderful, self-contained mini-cosmos where everything falls into place at just the right time to give a complete, rounded and polished view of the world.And I hate myself for that. I hate it that oversimplification is so satisfying. But the book has enormous value. It builds a world perfectly aligned with the all-inclusive humanist creed in such simple language that I think it can be used successfully as propaganda against harmful and exclusivist doctrines like nationalism, religious extremism. It does summarise Sapiens, it does have a rather long and underwhelming (for the most part) introductory chapter, but it picks up steam and rolls away with the rather weakly defined concept of ""intersubjective reality"" by using it to build the scaffolding supporting all of human history. Rather weakly defined, because there is no formal definition of the concept, no explanation as to how it arises between subjectivity and objectivity, no real research into its causes and how it came to exist (I'm guessing language, projecting the future and social skills all had something to do with it), but it is used as a working hypothesis to explain historical trends in terms of how humans were able to agree and cooperate to achieve consensus on such an unprecedented level. It does a good job of explaining all social relations at the level of the individual, but I believe that not giving this concept more attention weakens the author's argument a bit. I was hoping for at least some reason as to why we need it or what would happen if we tried to bring together those phenomena without it. The actual purpose of the book is to decipher what the future holds for humans. How the world will look when our current humanist projects (arbitrarily chosen: end of famine, war and disease – including end of death) come to fruition. In fact, he argues, our means to achieve those projects could end up overriding our intentions. He ends up discussing how the technology we are now using to bring about the completion of those humanist ideals may end up dispensing with humanism altogether. And as much as I enjoyed his synthesis of history and ideology, here I believe that he is rushing with his predictions. There is no more synthesis here, there are only a couple of descriptions of post-humanist ideologies, namely ""Techno-humanism"" – augmentation of humans to allow them to remain relevant in an age of super-human machine intelligence, and ""Dataism"" – giving up control in favour of big data and algorithms, and allowing them to make away with human ideals, and ultimately with us humans if we are deemed unnecessary. (and, as a side note, the similarity to Dadaism, the 20th Century artistic movement which famously glorified contradiction and professed to be against all previously held normative beliefs and traditions, including being against itself as an art movement, is eerily prescient)So the part about posthumanism is missing some overarching synthesis and his predictions are too restrictive to fit in with the rest of the book and his introduction stands out like a sore thumb. His attempts at fortune telling are quite below the standard that I expected having read both Sapiens and the rest of this book. But none of these shortcomings would stop me from filling my Facebook feed with his extremely quotable statements."
198,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/272480-sina-jahandari,3,"I read Homo Deus as a sequel for Sapiens which I read last summer. In the former, Harari repeats some interesting parts of the latter: he explains how humans are not the apex of creation as religions used to teach; why our experiences are not more valuable than other animals to whom our cruelty is unbelievable. One-hundred-fifty thousand years ago, we were marginal animals in east Africa, so insignificant with ecological impacts as great as that of dolphins or pandas. We are now ruling the world because we can flexibly cooperate in large numbers as a consequence of believing in fictional things that do not exist in reality, such as God, money, borders, and law. Today, we are far more powerful than our ancestors but not happier. Our unhappiness is caused by craving more and more. We jumped to the top of the pyramid in an evolutionary speaking very short time. Our bodies and minds did not have enough time to evolve proportionally to our current status. Therefore, we feel like we do not belong here. Harari's weirdest idea in Sapiens repeated in Homo Deus was that Agricultural revolution was a mistake. Hunter-gatherers lived better lives. Chasing deer, being attentive to their surroundings not to be hunted by a bear, eating fresh blackberries and mushrooms, less work, more play, traveling the world; compared to an average miserable factory worker in China, let alone Africa, they were blessed.Harari also presents some novel ideas. He explains that for most of history humans were busy struggling with war, plague, and famine. Recent industrial and technological advancements resolved these challenges. Today, humans do not have any purpose and they are creating some new objectives such as immortality, happiness, and divinity to escape meaninglessness. He then explains some trends in sociological history. Religions gave meaning to our suffering by an external God. Humanism, on the other hand, says the meaning of life comes from individual experiences, from within. While liberalism's motto says if it feels good, do it, communism demands considering the well-being of others too. In fact, Harari represents mixed feelings about communism (state-of-the-art social structure in social sciences schools) which renders the reader unsure about his true standpoint.Then, he shifts gears, starting to give interdisciplinary perspectives to social and historical trends. He borrows analysis from biology, chemistry, and neuroscience. It seems to me that Harari, as a historian, has recently befriended a guy (or a gal, not to be sexist) who is an expert in computer science. The guy has bombarded Harari with some concepts and ideas from Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Harari’s mind is blown away with these fascinating horizons that philosophy, psychology, history, and other good for nothing social sciences can never offer. Harari, then, has started writing about those wild ideas without any basic technical knowledge. Of course, some of these ideas are true, some breathtaking but not substantiated, and in some parts of the book it is pretty obvious that Harari has no clue what he is talking about and is just mumbling the little things he has heard here and there. Well, I am not going to spoil these ideas for you and let you read and judge them yourself. One personally annoying thing in Homo Deus for me was Harari’s excessive use of specific names. In some cases, the underlying story was too intriguing and made me search for the person or the event. However, most of the time it was frustrating.Anyhow, Harari writes very well and I enjoy reading his books. I will read his future publications if he continues keeping the same levels of standards."
199,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59164810-nicky,2,"It pains me to give this book a mere two-star rating, especially since I did like certain parts of it, as well as its delivery. But this just seemed like a re-read of Sapiens and frankly, I am in no mood to continue this review, as it already took me 6 months to finally finish the last 100 pages.There is no doubt that Harari is a somewhat skilled writer, who gives concise explanations and has an interesting writing style - but this just felt like a rushed, all over the place follow-up to a pretty great first book. "
200,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5862443-joseph-stieb,2,"This book has received lots of attention and praise, and it needs to be taken down a peg. It is simplistic Ted Talk in a book, full of dumb metaphors, tangents, and really bizarre claims. I was hoping for a thoughtful critique of how advances in AI may undermine liberal and humanist assumptions in the 21st century. Harari does this in a very general way, but he doesn't really explain for the lay person (me) what exactly AI is, how algorithms will take over more and more of our lives, and whether human beings can really do anything about it. The bulk of the book is a long and vague history of human-self conception that basically says humans have had tribal, agricultural, and industrial identities, and we are now shifting into a data-based identity. He perverts the meaning of the word ""humanist"" to include fascism and communism, which could only be described as humanist in the sense that they aren't literally religions. No ideology that will sacrifice the individual for the collective or some fantastic dream deserves the name humanist. He also calls liberalism and other political ideologies ""religions,"" which absolutely drives me insane. These are political and ethnic philosophies and platforms, not assessments of divine will or significance and the place of human within grand cosmic systems of meaning and purpose. They are also, obviously, not supernatural in any way. I'm willing the entertain the argument that political ideologies function as religions, but Harari chooses to not make that more complex argument.I wouldn't call Harari a techno-optimist, as he doesn't really take a position on whether these changes will be good or bad. He does make the interesting point that human beings may come to think of themselves as an increasingly regulated, measured, data-producing entity that relies less on individual identity and choice and more on the system built around him. However, Harari's analysis seems to take place in a vacuum in which the global political shift to a closed, nationalistic authoritarianism doesn't exist. Will the Trump, Orban, Brexit, and Bolsonaro, who are obsessed with foreign threats, permit the free flow of people and information needed to bring about these massive changes? Will the world be stable and prosperous enough to facilitate these kinds of changes? Will tribal, national, and emotional identities be superseded by the self as algorithm? Again, there's a case to be made that this data revolution doesn't rely on political conditions as long as interconnectivity persists, but you have to make that case in context. However, in this book there's ZERO assessment of the context in which these ""revolutions"" in human consciousness and cognitive ability will take place, and he's a darn historian! That's unacceptably poor and lazy argumentation, and it makes the book into irresponsible rather than informed speculation.SO this book is not what it is advertised as, and what it is is a rather weak, vague, frustrating argument that just seems very full of itself (or himself). I can only assume there's better work out there on the future paths of human society and consciousness."

203,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4196379-hellen,2,"(unfinished)Not what I was hoping for. The book starts strong, with interesting ideas on where humankind may be headed in terms of AI, environment, and ideology. However, as the book progresses, it increasingly loses connection to Homo Sapiens' future (the book's subtitle is ""A Brief History of Tomorrow""), and instead focuses on past events, which yes, can tell us something about the future of current institutions in ideas, but the author himself writes that ""historians are asked to examine the actions of our ancestors so that we can repeat their wise decisions and avoid their mistakes. But it almost never works like that because the present is just too different from the past. It is a waste of time to study Hannibal's tactics in the Second Punic War so as to copy them in the Third World War. What worked well in cavalry battles will not necessarily be of much benefit in cyber warfare. "" In the beginning I thought ""oh, this is a clever comparison"", but later in the book the historical examples start to feel like long sidetracks that the author grew too fond of, especially when they make weak evidence for the claim being made about the future.Mentions of evolutionary adaptations are simplified unelegantly, to a point that some statements become incorrect.I see a lot of people calling this book ""shocking"", but I don't agree. All of these things we know; the environmental issues, the unsustainability of current modern lifestyles, people dying from eating too much food rather than too little - it's just that they're gathered in one place in this book. Then there is a lot about the effect of humanism, or the loss of religious thinking, on our future societies. I'm afraid I feel a lot of these claims hardly apply for current day, let alone the future. Instead of ""back in the days we had religion, now we don't"" (which I think is quite an exaggeration), I would be more interested in how the shift of responsibility for the truth has shifted from religious authorities to news and other online sources and how that may affect the future. I guess I picked up this book for more speculative predictions about the future? All the background is interesting, but didn't get me very excited. The predictions are too easy.I'm also just not convinced by the argument that humanism and dataism are new form of religious thinking and that it will lead to us unavoidably valuing AI and super humans (rich humans who get their tires changed every few years to keep in the running) over human life."

To begin with, while this is a progression from the earlier work, it is also a standalone work. The book has three parts which I would broadly classify as past, present and future. The author spends the first third of the book summarising what he wrote in Sapiens, and if you have read that book, especially recently, you might find yourself muttering ""Why doesn't he get on with it?"" :) To be fair, he outlines his broad premise right at the beginning - having (relatively) conquered hunger, disease and war, humanity's next agenda would be to master happiness, immortality and divinity. The path to that is what Yuval Noah Harari slowly but surely proceeds to elaborate on. The second part of the book is where Harari sets the premise and context for the future by analysing the present. As is his wont, he goes about dissecting the origins of our current belief systems and the occurrences that have led us to what he calls humanism, and our collective belief in man's central role in the scheme of things.In the third part, which is easily my favourite, he proceeds to tear down some favourite belief systems, including liberalism. Biochemistry, economics, philosophy and many other 'sciences' combine to make a heady cocktail, and I found chapters such as ""Who are I?"" (what a phrase!) an absolute delight in terms of expanding my scope of thinking. The analysis of ""free will"", whether biochemistry is just an algorithm play, and the debate on what's more valuable - intelligence or consciousness (and how we define both) were particularly enlightening to me. The book left me thinking of sentience (is there some reason why he never uses the word in the book?) and the last question he poses - what will happen to us when non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms know us better than we know ourselves. Why would we even be relevant in the scheme of things? He himself states that these are not prophecies but possibilities, and the choices we make from now on will define the scope and impact of what lies ahead. That's always been so historically, but the difference is that this time, we could, through action and/or inaction, cause our own extinction. If you are familiar with Sapiens, the punches to the gut are less damaging, but I think you'll still feel the pain! A must read indeed."
205,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71312811-jaker,5,"It’s really quite scary to think that we might ‘retire someday’, isn’t it? To think that we are simply biological algorithms, to think that computers are simply inorganic versions of humans. Yet does that mean that computers should prevail in this world? That humans will perish and the world will be run by computers? People don’t want to believe in this future. They think that God or the universe created us, so we should rule this world. Yet what if we are not where the “cosmic plan” ends? That from humanist to dataist, we are just a stepping stone towards AI?Although I would still like to believe in some intrinsic quality to human kind. They say that machines can experience what we can, yet if there’s different kinds of consciousness and we cant experience machine’s kind of consciousness, we still can’t know if machines truly copy humans. Although the answer is really quite simple. Machines are not like us. Machines are more efficient, like togs in a big machine. They sacrifice empathy and emotions for higher abilities. Although humans, imperfect as we are, we still win on the emotional level. No matter what a machine can be programmed to say, it still don’t have the kind of emotions we feel. Yet as Satre said in his book “Existentialism is a Humanism”, we are nothing more than the actions we make. Yet what comes with that action is the feeling we feel inside. Machines work, humans work and feel inside. Once nobody truly enjoys life, won’t any discovery be pointless? I like the idea of upgrading humans. Yet because by doing that, we are closer and closer to losing our human qualities, we are still left with the same question: Intelligence,growth and dataism, or consciousness, emotions and humanism. Well, we don’t know, perhaps we will find a mid- way between the two, that’s the belief I would like to hold. Just like Harrari wrote in the book himself, we can believe, doesn’t mean it’s true. Beliefs like this are not impossible, this is a reality that perhaps we can shape with our desires."
206,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18813727-vighnesh-rege,4,"Wow, lots to think about. The book focusses on the religion of Humanism that has displaced the Abrahamic religions in the last 300 years. Honestly I had never thought of Humanism as a religion but the author presents a strong case for thinking of it as one. The categorization of Fascism, Communism and Capitalism as Humanist creeds was very thought provoking. Having grown up in a mostly Capitalist world, I've never thought of the foundational similarities between Capitalism and Those Other Evil™ belief systems. Author paints these 3 dominant systems of the 20th century as three variants of Humanism - evolutionary humanism, social humanism and liberal humanism. If the thought of these 3 systems being compared on a common ground surprises you, then you should definitely read the book. Gives you insight into how some religions may have developed. A society gradually starts assuming some ideas as axioms and once that axiomatic belief hits a critical mass, it's fertile ground for a Messiah or a Prophet to come and define a new religion.Humanism is based on the axiom that human life is sacred. The author postulates that this axiom came to be adopted because economic growth and military strength was correlated to sheer number of people. However as we enter the era of automation and a majority of the human population becomes ""unemployable"" (not just unemploy*ed*, but unemploy*able*), this axiom is going to break down and lead to the rise of new religions.Latter part of the book focusses on what comes after Humanism and dives into Techno-Humanism and Dataism. Both of these are creeds that I had never thought of as creeds but I definitely see the ideas underneath these creeds as axioms that people have started believing it. Author's style of writing tends to be more philosophical rambling than accurate and scientific. So take it with a pinch of salt.A minor complaint was that the first half or so overlapped a lot with Sapiens, possibly in an effort to make the book standalone. I feel like that diluted the impact of the ideas revisited from Sapiens while taking up too much space in Homo Deus.I consumed most of this book on Audible - narration is top notch."

Instead of narrowing our horizons by forecasting a single definitive scenario, the book aims to broaden our horizons and make us aware of a much wider spectrum of options.Harari essentially questions pretty much everything in Homo Deus. Through questioning imagined values, god, soul, consciousness, free will, individualism, liberalism, humanism, he takes us on the voyage of species from the point who didn't find themselves different from other species to a point that drew boundaries for themselves and cherished their supremacy. They’re truly complicated cases to question in a single book, but his subtle elaboration makes it possible without ever noticing a trace of complication. Seeing that the human's black box is no longer a mystery makes fundamentally different scenarios and prospects possible for our current understanding. I saw one of Harrari’s interviews on google saying that today, probably instead of traditionally setting our identities like stone houses with foundations and pillars, we might today set identities like tents and fold it and move it with ourselves in different levels of understanding."
208,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91326668-callum-woodward,2,"""A brief history of tomorrow"" is exactly what this book is. It's brief about what the future holds and there's a lot of history used to try and back it up. But that's not necessarily a good thing. This book should be listed as a history book because that's what it is for a lot of the time. Harari justifies this by claiming to harken back onto it when looking in the future, after all: Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it. But quite often nothing eventuates from what is discussed, at least not in the same detail that gets given. A concept might be discussed over the course of 20 pages using different real world examples and sources before relating that concept to the future for perhaps 5 pages, in total is perhaps only 100-150 worth of pages actually talking about the future. I can see that the heart was there but the execution fell flat.Which is a shame as the final concept Harari discusses, Dataism, would have been a great concept for a dystopian novel the way he portrays it. He goes on for 10 pages explaining how it would work (after the 30 pages prior making sure you understand the relevant history) but bewilderingly leaves the final lines of the book, arguably the lines of a book like this that should be the most impactful, as dot points for the reader to ponder. I can get why he chose to end on questions to make the reader ponder but Harari's choice leaves a LOT to be desired.I find that the cover and selling points of this book are lies. You pick it up expecting to delve into the cybernetic world of human advancement and where we are expected to go in the next 10, 50, 100 years but if that were this book, it would perhaps be shy of 200 pages and far more condensed in the writing. There is so much repetition throughout, it's baffling how no editor thought to cut it down. And it's such a shame it has all these faults because it turns something that should be thought provoking, intriguing and 5 stars into an unfortunate, forgettable mess."
209,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4059462-valia,3,"TL;DR: Harari doesn't do a good job of making his arguments. ""Homo Deus"" is like a 400-page TED talk that will provide you with a good supply of anecdotes to retell at parties but not much more because everything is too handwavy for that. But maybe it's OK; a lot of people seem to be quite stirred by it, so maybe that is just the right level. Still, I find it kind of sloppy. For example, I doubt that many biologists are really reductionists. Maybe they were when the genetic code was just discovered, but we now know that biological networks are quite complex on every level of, well, abstraction. Those layers of complexity render reductionism useless (and phrases like ""it's just a neurochemical signal"" meaningless) and raise interesting questions of computability of biological algorithms by an ""external computer"". He also really likes algorithms. For him, they are veritable magic: algorithms will do this; algorithms will do that. And they will do anything, in theory. In practice, complexity (and its relation to physical world constraints) and fidelity of implementation are crucial factors. He himself admits that whatever super-intelligence will develop, will be bootstrapped by human's flawed implementation, with human biases and overfittings, yet he is quite sure that those flaws will be necessarily self-discovered and fixed by the marvelous algorithm. And judging by the last chapter, he sees no difference between data and information (annoying). The above makes one think that either Harari's knowledge of those areas (the most important areas, as he says) is very superficial or that he deliberately glosses over important things. Neither option encourages trust in his other claims and conclusions he so confidently makes. Oh, and he says, ""the book aims to broaden our horizons"", yet he is so humanism-focused, he will bore you to tears with it. P.S. Bill Gates' review, which I read too late, is here: https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Homo..."
210,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45523078-joeri,5,"In this immenseley thought-provoking book, professor Harari broadens our speculative imagination about our possible near future. By making use of insights from many disciplines Harari's speculations about the future are convincing and compelling. Due to his careful, scrupulous descriptive style, it almost never feels like he is trying to offer us some prophecy that fits his own view. He makes us ask important questions about where history might currently be headed to and neatly steers clear of both doom-scenario's and naïve optimistic projections of our future.Things he amongst other things speculates on are what will happen if algorithms, AI and robots will surpass us in all our cognitive and physical abilities and what new dogma's and religions humanity will create with the rise of 21st century technologies and sciences. What will happen with people that become economically and militarily superfluous? When humans and algorithms the like can upgrade themselves, how will they treat people who do not have this ability? Will this lead to not only greate socio-economic inequality, but also biological inequality, both physically and mentally? Is the way we treat animals a good indicator for how we will treat people that don't have access to these new technologies?There is no way to know or to predict. But since technological developments do not necessitate determinstic outcomes, we can think about how we wish to employ these future technologies and behave and think in ways that might influence the direction of the future. However difficult it is to know all the possibilities that might ensue from these developments, we can at least attempt to prevent the worst of possibilities to materialize by thinking and behaving in ways that will be conducive to more positive outcomes."

However, recent science suggests that humans are just organic algorithms, life is data processing, and consciousness is just random noise in our brains. By augmenting ourselves with bioengineering and artificial intelligence, humans can now realize our goals of bliss, divinity, and immortality.But, Harari argues that attempting to realize these dreams will have disastrous consequences. Instead of creating a utopia, Harari sees three outcomes:1. Humans will become economically useless.2. Humans will still be valuable collectively, but our individual authority will be replaced by AI that makes decisions for us, or3. Humans will split into two castes: a few upgraded super-humans and everyone else.Homo Deus closes with three important questions about humanity and our possible future:1. Are humans really just algorithms, and is life really just data processing?2. What's more valuable, intelligence or consciousness?3. What will happen to society and daily life when non-conscious algorithms know us better than we know ourselves?Unfortunately, Homo Deus lacks the clarity and rigor of his his masterpiece Sapiens. I worry that, for this reason, the critical questions Harari raises about humanity's goals and the methods we use to achieve them won't get the attention they deserve."

If you want to think about these things, write some science fiction - at least then you aren't trying to pretend like your nonsense is actually likely to occur.Although it is incredibly premature to start thinking about these things, there are large portions of these books that seem to take absolute morality as both malleable and also something that represents some reality. It's quite bizarre. I have never given much credence to people who believe in morality, whether derived from religion or humanism, but Harari seems to assume that all cultural norms and preferences must have a moral element to them. If you have humanist values then obviously not being humanist is wrong. To the extent that data-ism is not some fringe bullshit that Harari is exaggerating (I have never heard of it before - and I think I would have), it sounds like a plausible set of values that someone could have, but an incredibly unlikely set of morals.In the end, I don't think I can muster any sort of rebuttal to it, though, because all arguments about morality seem about as interesting as arguing over what color tea cups a minor character in Harry Potter would have in his house (to update the old ""angels dancing on the head of a pin"" cliche).1.5 of 5 stars"

As with Sapiens, the author completely threw off my current world views in a discourse that encompasses many aspects of science (Reading him, one comprehends in awe the meaning of the word 'savant'.) Personally I find the title a bit misleading, because the book is not as much a prediction of what will happen in the (far) future as a brief summary of what's happening right now in the world, and each of us is just too small to comprehend the movement...Damn. Reading a mind-boggling thing like this, I find nihilism more comforting than ever. At least right now humans are not immortal yet and I don't have to be afraid to wake up in a foreign word where Homo Deus - be it the techno-humans or the God-Algorithms - had taken over, because I would've been long dead by then. *shrug emoji*I kinda regretted having read this book over so long a time, scattering much of its knowledge in my perception, but it is hard to read. I have to completely focus, and that is a task and a half after I've started work (my meaningless, algorithmic work...) The big picture the author paints is still really hard to grasp, but I hope that a few of the arguments stay with me. And also, of course, this book is due for a re-read. I have already gotten the audiobook version, and hopefully the audio format would help more with my focus."

If this book is your first foray into Yuval's collection, then it will be better however I would recommend everyone to start with Sapiens, not Homo Deus.
“This is the best reason to learn history: not in order to predict the future, but to free yourself of the past and imagine alternative destinies. Of course this is not total freedom – we cannot avoid being shaped by the past. But some freedom is better than none.”
Homo Deus presents two new, radical, and upcoming narratives that he strongly predicts will take over our current one that is humanism - techno-humanism and dataism. I completely lost my brain's last desperate grasps on the subject, so instead of listening to me rambling here I found this quick and easy summary on the internet ('on the internet'? I sound like my aunt) that neatly summarises the main points of the book. It's worth a read to get your thoughts in order, but after reading the actual book.

Essentially the pace of technology is such that it is beginning to outstrip human capabilities on potentially every level calling into question the core value of humanity itself. If machines and computers can not only do everything better than humans but even understand humans better than humans do where will the average person fit in a world that no longer needs them, that no longer can offer anything that can't be done better by a Machine or AI? It's a haunting thought, because it could potentially strip away the the central beliefs about the sacredness of human life and importance of individual experience. Machines could potentially end up taking care of and managing humans in a similar way that they ""manage"" automated farms. With machines catering to every whim and need filling our lives with endless distractions, comforts, sedatives, anti-depressants, anything and everything a human might need and all without the individual having to exert any effort."

I feel that this is more of a long and needlessly repetitive footnote of the last book, for most of what's being said is either previously went through in Sapiens or commonsensically extrapolated from it. There were however some insights that kept me from abandoning the book, notably in the second last chapter -The Ocean of Consciousness- where the writer goes through interdisciplinary approaches to human consciousness. That led to the emergence of some intriguing questions that are worth pondering upon: If the human behavior really reflects a consistently evolving algorithm established by natural selection, why do we get to subjectively experience things whereas a robot operating on an algorithm could simply act without the need to actually experience what incentivized his action (pain, desire..)? And how can we ascertain whether or not other beings go through subjective experiences?"

Instead of insights in a ""lesson learned"" style, this book shows many scenarios projecting historical insights, current technologies and social realities towards future possibilities. As written by the author himself, these ideas are not necessarily meant as predictions, but more of a stimulus to discuss the important issues. Indeed, those issues are thought provoking, making you change how you look at the things you already know. For example, as a IT student and now worker, the word ""algorithm"" is our bread and butter. But now it has a much bigger meaning which can possibly ignite the next ""revolution"". I guess due to its speculative nature, since I am unjustifiably tempted to compare it with Sapiens, this book seems to be missing a punchline. One of the great reads this year, obviously!"

Similar to Sapiens, Harari is opinionated and more often than not states his opinion as fact. However, Sapiens is an observation of the history of mankind and as a historian, Harari does it really well despite some of his biases. In Homo Deus, he focuses more on the future of humankind. He focuses a lot on science and religion, however he does a lot of extrapolating about scientific studies that I find to be more of his opinion than fact. He also makes unrealistic attacks on religion based on religious points of view from a historical perspective. He is neither a scientist or a theologian, so I find that his arguments and points fall short in Homo Deus. I think this book is still an interesting read because nobody actually knows what the future will bring and it is interesting to see it from Harari’s point of view.

It's amazing how much information you can get about the world and humans by just reading this single book. This book's focus is more on the future of humans and the planet, mainly about how humans will reshape themselves and the world around them. It's also interesting for me to see the changing ideologies as the way we live changes.

Thus the power of the machine over men still seems far fetched in some passages of this book. Still, I love Hararis ability to connect history and philosophy to the present, as well as to the future. What especially caught my attention was Harari's way of pinpointing human responsibility for animals. This might guide us to a more ethical and responsible way of treating all animals. Through this reflection, Harari is also revealing one of the main objectives of the book: the historically constructed view of the human spesies as superior.

And the idea that technology will do all our fighting for us.

They will leave you more informed behind on a plethora of future-shaping questions such as why humans (should not) relate so dominantly to other species, how intelligence will decouple from consciousness, how a few multinationals have the power to manipulate human behaviour on a mass scale, why inequality will rise in a post-humanist era, why organisms are algorithms and dataism will become the next paradigm, and much more.

It is exasperating to hear such interesting ideas and then have to question the validity of the information because there were a few things in this book that were just patently untrue.

Just one example-- the author claims that war, famine and disease are no longer threats to human existence. I guess that's true if you don't live in Syria, or Ethiopia, or West Africa, or fail to recognize the potential for war, famine and/or disease to overtake large swaths of the population.

The research and effort gone into writing this book is definitely worth mentioning. Only an intellectual could really be able to appreciate this book. The illusion about god and orthodox believes have been clearly criticised and given a radical explanation. The book has dealt about our society, future and technology briefly. A definite recommended book to read."

250,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27877022-erisa,3,"There are some thought-provoking ideas here, but not enough to warrant the praise this book has gotten. Yuval makes a lot of sweeping generalizations about human behavior and presents his opinions in a language that gives the impression that they are verified facts. He consistently chooses a biological explanation over any other for human behavior. I did a word search just to make sure I wasn’t exaggerating, and he mentions psychology only three times in the book, while he dedicates entire chapters to his idea, which he falsely claims that is the mainstream view in life sciences, that humans are just biochemical algorithms. Also, throughout the book, you get this feeling as if Yuval is speaking down to you, as if he is exempt from all the flawed ways the rest of us humans behave, supposedly lending his claims more credence or something. I found that off-putting, but otherwise he does make some good points there, not a whole lot though, and nothing most people who’d be interested in this kind of book haven’t already read elsewhere. Then, he makes a false equivalence by treating humanism as just another religion. While I agree that they are both ‘fictions,’ as Yuval calls them, though I prefer the word ‘myth,’ they are not the same thing. There is at least one fundamental difference between the two, which is that religion is based on the belief in the supernatural and humanism is the opposite of that. He does the same with technological R&D which he calls techno-religions, which he then divides into two types: techno-humanism and data religion. He makes some valid points, but, again, his strong preference for reductionism, which gives the false impression of scientific rigor, limits him greatly. There is one instance where he says that the fictions we invent could be more powerful than anything else in shaping the future, but it’s only that one time. For the rest, he seems to think that the only things worthy of being called real are the ones that have physical properties. There is a passage in Sean Carroll’s book “The Big Picture” that I’d like to share. It doesn’t completely answer Yuval’s claims, but I like the way Sean talks about what is real, and I like to think that I’m one-upping Yuval since Sean is a physicist. :-) In his chapter ‘What exists, and what is an illusion?’ he says:“[…] something is real if it plays and essential role in a particular story of reality that, as far as we can tell, provides an accurate description of the world within its domain of applicability.” And:“The most seductive mistake we can be drawn into when dealing with multiple stories of reality is to mix up vocabularies appropriate to different ways of talking. Someone might say, “You can’t truly want anything, you’re just a collection of atoms, and atoms don’t have wants.” It’s true that atoms don’t have wants; the idea of a “want” is not part of our best theory of atoms. There would be nothing wrong with saying “None of these atoms making you up want anything.” But it doesn’t follow that you can’t have wants. “You” are not part of our best theory of atoms either; you are an emergent phenomenon, meaning that you are an element in a higher level ontology that describes the world at a macroscopic level. At the level of description where it is appropriate to talk about “you,” it’s also perfectly appropriate to talk about wants and feelings and desires. Those are all real phenomena in our best understanding of human beings. You can think of yourself as an individual human being, or you can think of yourself as a collection of atoms. Just not both at the same time, at least when it comes to asking how one kind of thing interacts with another one.” Also, from Antonio Damasio, professor of neuroscience, psychology and philosophy at USC:“Saying that living organisms are algorithms is, in the very least, misleading and in strict terms, false. Algorithms are formulas, recipes, enumerations of steps in the construction of a predicted result. As noted, living organisms, including human organisms, use code-dependent algorithms such as the genetic machinery. But while, to a certain extent, living organisms are constructed according to algorithms, they are not algorithms themselves. They are consequences of the engagement of algorithms. The critical issue, however, is that living organisms are collections of tissues, organs and systems within which every component cell is a vulnerable living entity made of proteins, lipids and sugars. They are not lines of code.”And, my favorite, from Robert Sapolsky, professor of biology, neurology and neurological sciences, and neurosurgery at Stanford, and his graduate student Steven Balt:“A cornerstone of Western science is an acceptance of reductionism, the belief that an effective way to understand a complex system is to understand its component parts. Such a reductionist framework has been, of course, enormously successful, providing a means for understanding , analyzing, and, if necessary, repairing objects of all sorts: natural phenomena, technological creations, and human bodies. A consequence of the triumph of reductionism has been an asymmetric and often uneasy relationship among scientists, when considering disciplines that differ as to how integrative or how reductive their basic techniques are. There is a tendency for an adherent of a particularly reductive approach to view the more integrative disciplines in a manner approaching hegemony. Consider the pronouncement of Francis Crick that ""The ultimate aim of the modern movement in biology is in fact to explain all biology in terms of physics and chemistry"" [his emphasis; quoted in I]. Such imperialist fervor need not be restricted to the more reductive disciplines, but can be heard by any scientist viewing more integrative approaches. For example, consider the prediction of E. O. Wilson, much disparaged in behavioral science and social science circles, that disciplines such as ethology and comparative psychology ultimately ""are destined to be cannibalized"" by neurosciences and sociobiology [2, P- 6]. For the scientist peering from an integrative stance across the divide towards the more reductive disciplines, there is the frustration and invidiousness of ""physics envy,"" the belief that true insight and clarity will emerge only with increasing reductionism, leading inevitably to the physicists who proverbially only talk to God. Intrinsic to reductionism is a view about the nature of variability in data. Some variability is deemed legitimate and interesting, as it reflects as-yet-unrecognized factors in the workings of the system under study. For example, data regarding oxidative damage to DNA became less variable once it was known that mitochondrial and nuclear DNA have markedly different vulnerabilities to oxidative attack, and scientists design and interpret their experiments accordingly. From the reductive viewpoint, the other source of variability is little more than an irritant, a problem of measurement instruments—or the humans who use them—not being sufficiently precise; i.e., the variability is simply ""noise"" that will decrease with improved instruments. As a critical corollary, more reductive levels in science should provide instruments of measurement that are more precise; thus variability decreases, revealing more certain patterns. Most scientists and lay people probably adhere to this fairly intuitive view: it seems plausible that we can learn more about the etiology of schizophrenia, for example, by studying mutations in D2 dopamine receptors than by studying the patterns in Rorschach inkblots seen by schizophrenics. The quantitative tools of successful reductive science involve linear mathematical approaches to problems, and assumptions of additivity of component parts. A challenge to these approaches has become fashionable . This approach, often termed ""chaos theory"" or ""nonlinear systems analysis,"" relies heavily on the notion that complex systems (which are widespread, as they can be a society, an organism, or a cell) can contain non-additivities and non-linearities, such that a miniscule change in one component part can have vastly amplified and unpredictable consequences (the so-called ""butterfly effect""). A major consequence of this is, of course, a grave limitation on the usefulness of reductive study of the component parts of such a system. Intrinsic in the nonlinear approach is a very different view of variability . The emphasis in this new science of complexity and chaos is on the emergent properties of complex systems. In such cases, variability is not mere noise, but is intrinsic to the component parts of the system; moreover , it is independent of the scale of observation. Fractal geometry captures these features in a potent and elegant manner; as one examines a fractal with increasingly reductive tools, the relative proportion of variability and detail remains constant, and patterns are just as easily discerned at the more integrative levels.” Yuval consistently overstates his claims and hardly ever presents any counter-arguments, and when he does, it’s usually unfairly, with language that primes the reader not to take them seriously. Some are brief, one single sentence at the end of the chapter as if it just occurred to him that he should be more nuanced. I gave it three stars because it’s an OK book. A Goodreads rating for an OK book is two stars, but I think this deserves three considering how hard it is to make predictions based on information from various disciplines, and Yuval is a very good writer. And, perhaps the strong reaction I had to parts of it will turn out to be useful, but I wouldn’t recommend it unless you’re really curious about it, then I’d suggest reading only the third part. * https://www.amazon.com/Big-Picture-Or...* https://www.huffingtonpost.com/antoni...* https://muse.jhu.edu/article/401203 "
251,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2976142-thomas-edmund,4,"Through a quirk of availability, I ended up reading Harari's books in this order: Sapiens, Lessons... and then Homo Dues. Awkwardly this did take away from Homo Dues as I think the two other books fit together really well, Sapiens as the more tomeish authoritative history, and Lessons... as the more succinct and personal take on modern worries. So where does Homo Dues sit? Uncomfortably in my opinion. The introduction and last two chapters are the best reading as they dive into the premise of the book directly. The rest of book? Well kind of retreads a lot of Sapiens, or fleshes out topics in a way which kind of works but feels like it wasn't what the book is plugged as.For example a fair chunk of the first 100 pages discusses humankinds place in the world, and whether we really are ""top dog"" so-to-speak compared to other animals. Harari's animal advocacy is fairly well known, and to be honest I agree with most of this thesis on the topic (in fact I found Sapiens to be an incredibly strong piece of work pushing me towards supporting animal rights) however at some point during Homo Dues I just felt a little bored. I totally understand the point of addressing human's position in the world before embarking on our future but it seemed like a huge chunk was devoted to the preamble and less on the future.And to be honest a large smack of the next 2-300 pages felt the same, just looking at various topics in the same way Sapiens did. Again it made sense in terms of basically explaining the development of Humanism and how one possibility for the future is a shift to Dataism - but in my head if a book is proposing a brief history of tomorrow I would normally expect more tomorrow and less today.Just to be clear that doesn't mean Homo Dues is absent massive levels of insight and interest. The advantage of the way the book is written is that its not really a sequel to Sapiens, a new reader could cope with Homo Dues without having to get through Sapiens (however to the detriment of Sapiens readers I feel). Even though I wanted the strange and worrying predictions of the future I still learned plenty about the strange and worrying world of today!So even though I prefer Sapiens if you want a huge knowledge boost, and Lessons for the 21st Century if you want thoughts on how to be and what to do today, I still appreciate Homo Dues as a good book. Oddly in the way that Harari describes himself, I've taken my enjoyment of the other two books for granted and compare Homo Dues to that baseline rather than on its own objective merit! "
252,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"Sapiens succeed when they organize into groups around shared fictions. Ancient religions, for example, offered a shared fiction that, in spite of some drawbacks, allowed people to band together in large numbers. These religions were later supplanted (in a sort of Nietzsche ""God is dead"" way) by humanist fictions, such as fascism, communism, and liberalism. So far, he argues, liberalism has mostly proven the best adapted for the technological advances of the 20th century. But for how much longer will humanist liberalism have power? Harari argues that science is showing that not only is God dead but so is the self—a real threat to liberalism (and humanism in general). What we understand as an individual, often that mental ticker tape that we silence in meditation and before realizing it is not the self, is in fact one aspect genetic code hammered out through evolution. He eventually concludes that people can be understood not as individual selves that make decisions but rather as algorithms that process information. But non biological (computer) algorithms are better at processing information and their code evolves more quickly than ours, so intelligence is decoupling from consciousness. Liberalism will endure, as past fictions have, but it will also lose influence just as past fictions have (note to self, pg. 275)--and perhaps much faster if one takes acceleration seriously. What's next and what are the implications?These claims and conclusions were not always easy to read, so I decided to approach Homo Deus as a sort of anthropological commentary. If observations from De Tocqueville and Marco Polo have value, I thought, maybe Harari's could. There may be something to this observer idea because, in listening to an interview with him, I learned that Harari not only meditates but goes on extended silent retreats annually. I feel like a different person after yoga than before it, and I'm not sure I could imagine how I'd think after two months of silent retreat. So, with that work around in place, I mentally renamed the book ""On Liberalism in the 21st Century.""As with Sapiens, I found the notes unsatisfactory, though they are better. I am surprised that he does not mention Durkheim at all given that Durkheim defines a religion as ""a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things [...] which unite into one single moral community."" It's not identical to his fictions, but it's not hard to see how Harari's ideas about organizing groups around ideas stem from the work of sociologists.On the whole I found Homo Deus very interesting and would not be surprised if I'm still thinking about it months from now."
253,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50946522-shifad,5,"Reading this book was like being languished by the very set of ideas that you probably thought impossible. The opening of the book clearly summarises the agenda that defined the thoughts and deeds of the humans of the past. War, plague and famine have become a thing of the past. The author is audacious in his narration. He thrashes religions and humans alike. In his first book, Homo Sapiens, the author painted a vivid picture of the cognitive, agricultural and scientific religion that made the humans of today. This book is just a continuation of what was discussed before. What will be the next great change? Will humans survive it? “The most common reaction of the human mind to achievement is not satisfaction, but craving for more.”We humans have achieved many. The author points out many spheres where humans have benefitted at the expense of other species. The author says that the next step in our evolution will be to attain godhood. He points out that, for the humans of the past, we are already gods. We are doing things that they thought only a God was able to do. Harari explores this idea further and tries to prophesy what would be the next great revolution, and what would be its effect on mankind.His ideas were depressing and rejuvenating at the same time. The initial half of the book was a groundwork for its latter half. This half discusses how the idea of communism, capitalism and humanism have taken its root in human minds. For a species, who took millenniums to evolve, humans have achieved many since the scientific revolution. The advent of biotechnology and nanotechnology had open spheres that were never thought possible. Harari is temerous in his comparison of humans to algorithms. He cited many examples for this view. He prophesies that in the present day of information, machines will be replacing humans. The economic disparity of the rich and poor will increase ( the economic disparity is very much visible today).Harari's thoughts on religion, agriculture, and humanity as a whole is mind-blowing. His prophecy is yet another thing no one would like to contemplate. His prophecy is chilling and lacks lustre. All we thought dear and irreplaceable will just be converted to data. His comparison of the data storage to the HIndu concept of Paramatma is rather unnerving. He is an insightful author who has a distinctive narrative style. Once again, great book. Must read for all!"
254,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30281185-sajith-kumar,3,"Yuval Noah Harari captured the imagination of millions of readers with his masterpiece ‘Sapiens’ which I am yet to read. This book is designed as something between a sequel and an afterthought of its more famous sibling. In this book, Harari sets out to explore the uncharted territory of the future humanscape, armed with a cutting analysis of human progress till now. Predicting the future of technology is a precarious initiative. We have seen Lord Kelvin prophesying the end of physics by the year 1900 and how wide he was off the mark. Harari makes three predictions about human life in the twenty-first century with one eye unflailingly focused on the road ahead while the other scanning the past for confirmation of his numerous theories. Wars and diseases will be totally eliminated and mankind would achieve the power to upgrade itself into a powerful being that is capable of exercising many of the privileges of divine beings in myths and legends such as growing organs or everlasting life. This quasi-divine species he euphemistically call Homeo deus. Harari is an Israeli historian and a professor of history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.For thousands of years, humankind prayed and hoped for a day in which there will be no wars, no diseases and people lived for a very long time. Religions offered promises at first, but they rather contributed only bellicosity in their adherents. There is little chance of peace even if one religion dominated the entire earth. The religious wars between the Catholics and Protestants in the seventeenth century and the continuing strife between the Shia and Sunni factions in Islam reaffirm this hypothesis. On the other hand, increasingly lethal weapons applied brakes on man’s urge to go to war by propagating the doctrine of MAD - mutually assured destruction. Harari argues that without nuclear weapons, there would have been no Beatles, no Woodstock and no overflowing supermarkets in the west. The socialist world led by the USSR overwhelmed the liberal world in conventional weapons, but the US and its allies trumped them on nuclear warheads. Humanity is on the cusp of attaining immortality - which only means that there will not be any deaths due to diseases - even at the risk of handing over the burden of running the world to powerful, inorganic and non-conscious algorithms.The progress experienced by Homo sapiens in the last few centuries is not solely engendered by technological improvements. A profound transformation was also going on in the social front. For 300 years, the world has been dominated by humanism, which sanctifies the life, happiness and power of Homo sapiens. Humanism put man at the centre of creation. It elevated us as the ultimate source of meaning of the world order. By corollary, our free will is therefore the highest authority of all. By such a transfer, meaning and source of authority divorced themselves from the divine will. This prime position of human will is manifest in five idioms of the modern world: the voter knows best, the customer is always right, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, if it feels good, do it and think for yourself. Harari also describes the split of humanism into three branches: liberalism, socialist humanism and evolutionary humanism. The first is epitomized by Western democratic societies, the second by the now defunct Soviet style communist societies and the third was represented by the Nazi-fascist regimes. The last two, for all practical purposes, no longer exist in the world. Harari’s rigid classifications remind the readers of the accuracy of the exact sciences. How far one could go with such a classification in the humanities is debatable.Only physical and structural level, man is not above the other animals. How then did we get on top of them? Tool making and intelligence were particularly important for the ascent of mankind. But this was not the whole story. A million years ago, humans were already the most intelligent, tool making animal. The cutting edge came about around 70,000 years ago when the species underwent a cognitive revolution. Speech enabled humans to co-operate flexibly in large numbers, even with complete strangers. No animal shares this unique faculty. That's why the numbers are never enough to mount a revolution. Such upheavals are usually made by small networks of agitators rather than by the masses. Only man can weave an inter-subjective web of meaning, a web of laws, forces, critics and places that exist purely in their collective imagination. This web, exemplified by such abstract concepts as a nation, religion or even commercial enterprises, allows humans to bond together and flourish.Harari handles the post-humanist scenario, taking into account the development in microbiology and computers. When the working of the brain was analysed, the concept of free will breathed its last. Our decisions, will, delusions and the feeling of general well being are made possible by changes in electrochemical processes in it and the startling fact is that it can be controlled remotely! Along with free will, the idea of a single authentic self went obsolete in one stroke. The next step came when it was evident that organisms are algorithms and life is a complex series of data processing. The advent of artificial intelligence decoupled from conscience and was non-conscious in nature, but highly intelligent algorithms may soon know us better than we know ourselves. Harari predicts the death of humanism at this point which is also where algorithms take charge of the planet. Humans would be treated as pet animals at that time. Much of this talk sounds like science fiction.The author is unconcerned with the sensibilities of conservative readers. His statement that “if an extramarital affair provides an outlet for emotional and sexual desire that are not satisfied by your spouse of twenty years and if your new lover is kind, passionate and sensitive to your needs - why not enjoy it?” (p.263) maybe sound practical advice but comes as a shocking moral pronouncement for most others. Another casual generalisation that ruffles the feathers of many is that “when genetic engineering and artificial intelligence reveal their full potential, liberalism, democracy and free markets might become as obsolete as flint knives, tape cassettes, Islam and communism” (p.323).The book is nicely written, but with occasional whiffs of pompous hot air. Staunch believers may better avoid this book in which a tirade against God and religion is seen in every third page. The narrative is designed like an absorbing speech or an enchanting lecture. It is interesting to read as a whole, but there are portions which the reader finds tiresome, such as conscience of sentient beings, and the ethical repercussions of the inevitable algorithmic takeover.The book is recommended."
255,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101833146-dani-d-nyi,3,"Harari is a verbosely entertaining historian, and this is indeed a definitively double entendre: he writes at great length about, well, how things were and will be and erm, stuff, and all this comes across as more or less interesting. Sometimes less: then at least well written and skimmable. All right, he does seem to prattle on a bit too much, like a salesman trying to bullshit you. Sometimes, like salesmen, he will be playing silly buggers, simplifying and cutting corners and driving an outrageously, off-puttingly irresistable bargain. Then at the last throes of running after my money, he tries to convince me it was all a matter of having informed insights on the possibilities of the future, and dilemmas we should be facing today, or at least probably.All this did not go across very well, although I must admit the persistance and thoroughness of the book suggests an awful lot of work put in. I feel in no position to argue in as much length or effort as all of that. Some things Mr Harari simplifies seem to me patently absurd, such as the scientific dissolution of the idea of free will or self or feelings, along the lines of ""it's all just algorithms really, we checked twice"". This echoes the typical dismissive argument ""it's just a lot of biochemical brain processes"" or ""it's just a body thing, biology"" as if that could actually debase or sideline anything that people feel or do. I'm used to hearing this stuff, it's been going around for decades (and indeed centuries, but who cares, except historians). It seems a patently reductionist attitude to everything, including humans. That is to say: I'm not convinced.But thanks for trying, Mr Harari, I assure you there were moments there when it felt like it was worth going through all of this - not that my experience, opinion, or feelings should define anything of algorithmic relevance. "
256,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/875812-madhuri,3,"I want to give two widely different ratings to this book. I enjoyed reading it because it kept my mind racing - it is full of ideas, and then it imagines a possibility that we are potentially headed towards. Plus there is so much to argue against the thoughts that he puts forward that the brain exercise is exhilarating. I want to take a pause and write counter arguments to many things he says. But what is remarkable about Harari is that he has a narrative to explain the development of human kind. The ability to have a fact based narrative of human systems is very seductive. Especially for people who are already sold in to the idea of information and have been looking for a grand theory to fit all pieces of civilisation. Harari has given a new religion to those who have shied away from Godly religions. He proposes that the reasons behind human superiority is the connectedness of human networks and our ability to organise them. And our ability to create and believe in collective fictions. But then there is a part of me that found the incoherence of the second half tedious. He goes in a loop, repeats himself and almost sounds like a Godman selling a future. And it is not even a happy future - it is the kind of future Aldous Huxley imagined decades ago. It is more polished with the technological advancement we have made in the last 8 decades and it adds a Long life to the mix. But like a terrible salesman, and a true Godman, he says that this future will mean the loss of individuality and human power. That dataism will cater to individual biochemical needs, but there isn’t much space for consciousness and free will. My objections are not so much with the idea, but with the recursive and pedantic manner in which Harari puts it forward. Someone in my book group suggested that the book makes more sense if it was a collection of lectures. Another suggested that Harari has repeated ideas because he is trying to teach something - the way ideas were repeated in the Gita. I think there is some truth there. He comes across as a preacher showing the path to those less enlightened. I still recommend it as a read, if only to kick your mind alive and think of one possibility in front of us. But keep your critical eye alive, else the book will seduce you into becoming a follower of dataism."
257,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60169232-kate,3,"I'm quite disappointed... It made me think - hence the 3 stars, but: Firstly, for a book about the future, there was way too much history. Only the first part and last part were more about the future. I liked the last part, even though I didn't agree with it. Secondly, the structure didn't really flow/ connect: the first part talked about what the author thinks humanity will focus on in the future (happiness, immortality, divinity? - whatever that means). The middle was mostly historical & philosophical, not really connected to the first part. And the last part was finally what I thought the book would be about - predicting trends - but again, not connected to the first or second part. Thirdly, I don't get the author's view of religion, which seems to be the only connecting, underpinning thread of the book. To me religion is about spirituality, based on universal values, transcendental. He seems to have a massive issue with it, using the most horrible examples from history to diss it. I get that, there are horrible examples and religion has been used and misused for bad stuff. But there is also a (I'd say much bigger) mass of good it has done for humanity (reduction of stress, loneliness, cooperation to achieve higher good, personal development etc). To focus solely on the dark side screams bias. I guess that's why I don't get why dataism should/ could be a religion, and why we couldn't just learn to use data better. Fourthly, while I totally agree that big data and algorithms are and should be our focus - to ignore all that knowledge & efficiencies would be plain stupid - I disagree we should throw out intellectual property rights, give up our privacy or ignore competition implications of Google & Facebook essentially controlling most of our data. Rather than blindly giving up more data, I think we need to put safeguards in place that allow us to retain our privacy, competition on the market and to strive to understand how algorithms (incl. those who own them) make their decisions to avoid discrimination, manipulation etc."

Having read Sapiens before, I had a little bit of an idea going into this book about Harari's writing and I must say I got exactly what I expected. Mr. Harari is an incredible historian. This book picks up where Sapiens left off, and take humanity through its progress through religious times, wars, socialism, liberalism, capitalism and humanism. The narration is terrific and the cause and effect between each of these is clearly demonstrated. And then the book goes off the rails. Mr. Harari goes on to predict what will happen in the future and makes wildly simplistic and sweeping generalizations, which even an amateur tech enthusiast will scoff at. The amount of logical liberties boggled my mind. It took me some suspension of disbelief to read the last part of the book more of a science fiction than an actual thesis. When seen in that light, it does contain some really interesting ideas regarding dataism, algorithms, relation between intelligence and consciousness etc. I personally am super-interested in these topics and thus liked reading through this section, even with its serious shortcomings. The book as a whole also suffers from the disjointed writing style of Mr. Harari as seen in Sapiens. Its written in the style of an extremely knowledgeable guy putting a stream of consciousness directly onto paper without any attempt at structure or flow. Topics between paragraphs vary wildly and it makes this reading more like a transcript of a Joe Rogan Podcast. Having said all that, there is absolutely no doubt that Mr. Harari is a amazing scholar, a succinct communicator and a distinguished thinker. One should definitely read this book and ponder on the topics raised. I know I definitely will..."

I’m still unsure whether I value intelligence over cognition, but it is something I’ve been consciously thinking about every day since I started reading this book.I was hesitant to pick up Homo Deus having found Sapiens slow and repetitive. However, I’m glad to say that this book exceeded my expectation in every single dimension! It is an extremely insightful read that provokes a lot of though and motion regarding the path humanity has followed and where it will lead.The book touches on most of the ""dinner table topics"" many of us have probably had ranging from designer babies, to huge corporations controlling our private data, to whether religion has a place in the modern world, or even how the Egyptians managed to build the pyramids. However, rather than discussing these in a fruitless manner, Yuval presents all the evidence and arguments in a very organized and unbiased manner that simply points out the obvious. The reader can naturally only make one conclusion: the right one. My personal opinion is that authors like Malcom Gladwells provide very one sided arguments that bias the reader to agree with a certain point of view, but Yuval somehow finds a way to remain unbiased and lays out the argument in a very clear, intuitive and succinct manner.There were dozens of different anecdotes and examples presented throughout the book which were entertaining, insightful and education. Here is just a small subset that really stood out to me:1. Chekhov's law states that if a gun appears in the first act of a play, it’ll be fired by the last one. This has been observed throughout history many times (guns, canons, chemical weapons, etc…). However, Yuval points out that it was not the case for nuclear weapons. This might imply that technology has become so advanced that our traditional understanding of human kind may be changing as well.2. I’ve always accepted the presence of clear cut lawns in front of houses, apartments, offices or universities. I never bothered to think of lawns as providing any sort of utility or acting as a symbol of wealth. However, front lawns were previously used for gatherings similar to ""tea parties"". The degree to how well a front lawn was kept showed how much of an upkeep the owner of the house could afford. With newer technology advancements, this is no longer the case.3. As a paranoid engineer who likes sticking to lists and schedules, I get very upset when expectations don’t meet reality. This is a trait I need to personally work on, but I was very relieved but when Yuval mentioned it as a common part of our nature.4. I applaud the entire discussion surrounding designer babies. A lot of people have very irrational reasons against choosing their children’s’ traits. I am of the opinion that I will do everything I can to make sure my kids are limited as little as possible by their nature. Health, fitness, personality, looks, memory, etc… Upgrade it all!5. There was an interesting study mentioned in the book about how scientists used fMRI scans to communicate with completely immobile individuals. The scientists told the individuals to imagine themselves playing tennis when they want to say yes or imagine themselves sitting at home when they want to say no. The fact that this provided successful results was astounding.6. There was an interesting discussion when a Jewish child asked his dad why he can’t eat pork. It was compared to a German child asking his Nazi father why jews must be killed, and compared again to a British child asking his father why refugees from 3rd world countries must be protected. There is no right or wrong here, but it does show how individual mindsets change over time. What might seem to be the norm at one point in time might sound completely absurd another.7. Yuval discussed a novel approach of using electrodes to stimulate the brain to cure depression. One of the most fascinating parts about this study is that one of the individuals in the study said they started feeling really depressed a couple months after things seem to have improved. It turns out the relapse was a result of the batteries in the electrode stimulator running out! This shows the electrodes provided more than just a placebo effect.8. One of the studies discussed showed that humans associate their memory of an experience (traumatic or not) with how they felt towards the end. For example, putting your hand in cold water of temperature T1 for a minute, or putting your hand in really cold water of Temperature T1 that warms up to T2. Individuals tend to favor the latter. The same results were observed for pain levels of surgery.9. There was an interesting monologue where Google was deciding on behalf of an individual whom she should date given two choices. This really gave me the chills, but also really excited me for the future!10. The book was originally published in 2015, but there was a fair bit of discussion around how Facebook can potentially impact who individuals vote for during public elections. This point provides no further explanation :)These were just the things that stood out so much and I remember.I don’t see myself rereading this book, but I really wish I could remember and reference all the examples, studies and anecdotes mentioned. This book is well researched, well written and lays things out in a manner that is easy to absorb. After reading this book, I feel as if my personal opinion regarding most of the topics covered is quite useless. Since I know I won’t be able to remember most of the point made in the book, I feel as though I have to simply reference the book instead of expression my own opinion moving forward."

From ""freedom of choice"", to the workings of the mind, mindfulness, what gives meaning to life (if any) and many other concepts worth exploring.The books sums up how we got to today with the 3 flavors of humanist ""religions"" we see as opposed to classical theological religions, and then goes on to suggest two possible future creeds, far from a prophecy perspective, more from a discovery one.The author lays out the current scientific dogmas without pushing them, always leaving a margin of doubt to what we know or don't know as of yet.This is the 2nd book I read by YN Harari, and I think his books are worth the effort of reading, though I can understand how hard it might be for some people to plough through 400+ pages of nonfiction scientific and abstract ideas."

To process. I do regret it took me so much time to finish this book which at a point of time made me impatient with it. And somewhere halfway through the book I realized I like Sapiens much better. But that doesn't really undermine the fact that this book, in its essence is a good read. Homo Deus talks about how humans will unfold in the future and it might appear scary at a point of time but also not entirely impossible. Let's just remember it's all just a speculation and there's no true way to predict future. So I'm hoping this is not how things unfold for us. I am very protective of my individuality and humanity and wouldn't like to get lost in a pool of data.Harari has put in a lot of research and data and the hard work can be seen. I recommend it to anyone who can with an open mind look towards a set of great and enriching ideas."

There are SO many things I want to talk about, but they are the kind of topics that do better when having dialogue among a number of people. I suppose this would make for the perfect book club book, should you be lucky enough to find enough people willing to stay committed to this chunker! I like the way the author presents his ideas and speculations. I like the ideas he encourages the reader to consciously engage with. I'll do my best to write a formal review for this one and return at a later time. (Though please be warned: I say this ALL the time and rarely remember--its kind of who I am as a person right now). "

We already rule the planet, so nothing new here.* Some jobs will get replaced by technology. People from “the useless class” will not be able to sell their labour.* Human sciences will challenge the human superiority and human exceptionalism, including erroneous beliefs in the uniqueness of human feelings, reason and free-will. We are just animals with a God-complex. * In their pursuit of immortality and happiness, humans will turn to technology to upgrade themselves through genetic , cyborg and computer engineering. The cost of upgrading the human condition will be expensive and reserved for a tiny elite. * Algorithms and AI will know us better than we know ourselves, and we will increasing rely on AI algorithms to inform and guide us in life, love and work.* Dataism becomes the New Religion. Dataism celebrates life as data processing, individuals and organisations as algorithms, and the value of a human life in terms of its capacity to transform experience into data.* If humankind is indeed a single data-processing system, then our output will be the creation of a new data processing system, called the Internet-of-All-Things. Once this mission is accomplished, Homo sapiens will vanish."

I found the book really good, but in some places it seems like the author has only chosen scientific studies to mention them.

In spite of everything, I would recommend this book, because it definitely makes the reader think.

? We don't know. But this book focuses on widening the spectrum of thinking. Change is an inevitable thing. And without any doubt, the fastest change is happening in the coarse of human civilization. A human in the current decade of current century can't keep track of all the things happening near her. Well, if you're a geek for understanding the coarse of past and present around you, you should absolutely read this book and reinvent yourself.The book ""Sapiens"" from the author triggered me to reason about many things. And from the writing skill and concept sharing of Harari, I knew, I am gonna read his next books. ""Homo Deus"" surpassed my expectation.The most amazing feature of Harari's books is, I think, he presents a lot of ideas, facts, experiences that are hardly possible to be presented within 400 pages. Yet he does that like a magician. No doubt, he had to research a lot to write these. Also, he organizes the topics in the best possible way. So, if you read Harari, you'll probably end up with updating yourself with a mini encyclopedia, except you won't be bored."

The writing is precise, to the point, bordering on dry, but flows effortlessly and conveys an implacable demonstration of Harari’s predictions for the future of mankind. After solving all of its major problems (war, famine and plague), Sapiens is now on a quest for happiness, eternal life and god-like power. Those who achieve this, thanks to the advancement of technology, might evolve to become a new kind of human, and gain access to novel forms of consciousness. That is, if humans are not made entirely irrelevant by the advent of a new almighty force ruling the world: Data."

I wish I could've said the same about the characteristics with which the author has defined the term. I wonder under what genre does Mr Yuval Noah harari books fall because for me they are pure horror and nothing else. Horror with proof which means that ""you dread it, run from it, but destiny still arrives"". This has been written as a continuation of the Sapiens and there are some repetitions here and there but by no means does that belittles the significance and originality of the story weaved by one of my favorite authors of all timeIt would surprise you(as it did me) that this book has majorly highlighted what has already happened and what's going on with a very little attempt of painting a picture of the future. If I may attempt to summarize all of it in a nutshell, author has basically explained levels of human evolution which are:1) Increasing the number of processors: This particular commandment points towards the population of homo sapiens which has increased tremendously since our own inception. We all must have come across some or the other moment in our life when we would've been forced to think as to why is increasing the population of our kind is good or a divine thing that doesn't need any justification. Imaginary reasons aside, this drive still goes on because as more complex tasks were invented, we needed more and more number of people to carry it out2) Increasing the variety of processors: This points out the invention of different kinds of professions as interactions between leads to new and new ways of solving the same old problems more efficiently or initiating the solution of the unsolvable ones3) Increasing the number of connections between the processors: This is one of my favorites as includes almost everything that we associate ourselves with. If you talk about the old times, this would've had included trade routes, empires, religious places etc. If you are talking about our times then it includes parliaments, courts, offices etc. If you talk about future this would include everything which is even remotely associated to any kind of digital presence of an individual like FB, twitter, Bank accounts, Email, Youtube etc4) Increasing the freedom of movement along the existing connections: In old times, this was done by policing of land routes and sea routes. In our times, this means preventing of censorship of any format. Freedom of information is a much touted phrase this days which actually implies that any nugget of information is useless if it isn't shared. Aaron Swartz ran a very famous campaign for this very cause under the banner of ""Guerrilla Open Access Manifesto"". Whether he succeeded or failed is for the posterity to decideIts funny how things turn out as in today's world, meaning of rules and regulations have already assumed the opposite meaning that were initially known for. The best example of this is the meaning of censorship which now means bombarding someone with so much information such that people loose the ability of differentiating reality from virtual world. I don't know what times lay ahead but it looks bleak at best""Power today doesn't lie with someone who has access to information but with someone who knows what to ignore and what to focus at""  "

But Homo Deus is 80% the same material, slightly repackaged with a few bonus examples, and full of fear-mongering extrapolations about tech. I wasn't expecting Harari to predict the future or anything but I wasn't expecting an almost-complete rehashing of Sapiens! He could have gone more in detail about tech beyond his vague posturing about AI (that he, as everyone always does, mixes up with machine learning), big data, or 'the internet of things'. Also 'Dataism' is not a thing. And you can't just make people's tech hype out to be a religion - it's really not! I ended up finishing this bloat because I wanted to see if he had anything new to say but it was really nothing I hadn't hear before. Perhaps because I'm more in touch with tech that history? Perhaps the sociologists, political scientists, and economists feel this way about Sapiens?Either way I'm no longer looking forward to 21 Lessons for the 21st Century. Cannot recommend this. Two stars because it wasn't badly written, just repetitive. Gazzaniga's split brain experiments - featured in the book but old news."

Everything that is explained and discussed in this book is not really a new information rather a new way for thinking, new way of perceiving. Overall always worth reading!"
270,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444762-jill,4,"Harari’s previous book, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind gave a capsule history of human civilization in a spritely, and humorous manner. In this “sequel,” he explores what might be in store next for mankind.He begins with the observation:“For the first time in history, more people die today from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists, and criminals combined.”Thus, since we are mostly liberated from worrying about famine, disease, and war, we have to find new concerns. [But have we really moved on from war? See this dissenting opinion from historian Margaret McMillan. Harari doesn't deny wars are still being fought, but avers that because they are less profitable than they used to be, wars fought in the ""traditional"" way will continue to become less common as the conquering mechanism of choice.] Harari, who has a PhD in history for the University of Oxford and now lectures on world history, offers a great many conjectures about where the trajectories of human behavior might take us next. In order to do so, he reviews the recent history of science and religion, and how both of them have evolved. Our new dominant narrative, he argues, is humanism, which he defines as a valorization of the inner self as a means both to understand the world and to evaluate what takes place in it and what we consider “good” or “bad.”But religion remains a strong force all around the world, and Harari cites statistics to prove it, although the nature of religious belief has changed over time. Nevertheless, he argues that religion has always served to impose order on societies. It also confers power, by creating stories that unite human collectives and lead them to cooperate effectively. He observes that one particular aspect of modern religions helps explain their tenacity: “The belief that humans have eternal souls . . . is a central pillar of our legal, political, and economic system….” This belief feeds the rejection by so many of the theory of evolution. According to the Pew Research Organization, only a minority of Americans fully accept the theory that evolution occurs through natural selection. Harari argues that objections to the theory of evolution ultimately stem from its denial of the existence of a soul, which threatens the whole edifice of religion, not to mention the plausibility of the wishful thought that life is actually eternal. (He points out that for both evolution and a soul be “true,” there would have had to be some actual moment in time in which souls entered the human body. When would that have been? Moreover, that first baby with a soul would have parents without a soul.) Also, because the soul is limited to humans in most religious beliefs, this has meant humans have felt free to do what they wanted to animals. Harari goes into some depth on how egregiously humans treat animals, without regard for any pain they may experience or any needs they themselves might have. He asks, when upgraded humans rule the planet, how might they regard non-upgraded humans? Will they be treated as animals are treated now? Such questions arise out of Harari's conjecture that one of humanity’s new concerns will be to confer immortality on humans via medical engineering and artificial intelligence. Thus will evolution by natural selection be replaced, at least, for those who can afford it. Already, one can buy a DIY gene-engineering kit for just $159 that uses the new discovery of ""CRISPR"" to manipulate DNA,  according to a recent science article in ""The Economist 1843 Magazine."" It won't be long, the article in 1843 argues, before a CRISPR baby will be born. Author Tom Whipple observes: ""The technology is too easy."" But mankind will need new collective myths to serve as guidebooks for the new reality. Does it matter if the narrative we come up with is ""true""? Harari explains:As a species, humans prefer power to truth. We spend far more time and effort on trying to control the world than on trying to understand it – and even when we try to understand it, we usually do so in the hope that understanding the world will make it easier to control it. Therefore, if you dream of a society in which truth reigns supreme and myths are ignored, you have little to expect from Homo sapiens. Better try your luck with chimps.""Evaluation: This entertaining book is full of thought-provoking observations. You may not agree with all of them, but I think one can’t help being stimulated by them. This would make an excellent choice for book clubs.Rating: 3.5/5"

If Sapiens is how we got to where we are now, Homo Deus is about where we are (possibly) going. Now that we can cure most ills and prolong life, now that the nuclear age has removed the threat of war on the scale of those of the first half of the 20th century, man is now engaged in the pursuit of ultimate happiness, that will remain forever out of our reach, for we are biologically wired never to be satisfied. Harari slips in the Buddhist viewpoint, that in order to attain happiness we actually need to slow down the relentless pursuit of pleasant sensations (via food, drink, drugs, new cars, great holidays, more sex, etc., etc.). The following paragraph, however, is the idea around which much of this book is based:'For 4 billion years natural selection has been tweaking and tinkering with {our} bodies, so that we have gone from amoeba to reptiles to mammals to Sapiens. Yet there is no reason to think that Sapiens is the last station. Relatively small changes in genes, hormones and neutrons were enough to transform Homo Erectus - who could produce nothing more impressive than flint knives - into Homo Sapiens, who produces spaceships and computers. Who knows what might be the outcome of a few more changes to our DNA, hormonal system or brain structure?'Homo Deus discusses the collapse of theist and monotheist religions and the principals of humanism at some length, explores the religion of the future (Dataism), and discusses at an even greater length whether the 'self' actually exists or if all organisms are nothing more than algorithms, and if we might, eventually, produce the 'super-human', as technology advances at a speed so great that already a thirty-year-old can say to a child that the world was a different place when he was young. There are some areas of the book I found fascinating and gave me much upon which to ponder, but in other areas I found it a little repetitive, with laboured points, and, once or twice, thought that Harari had shown a one-sided view of instances just to enforce his argument.I read a novel a couple of months back called The Happy Chip, about a chip inserted into the brain that would assess what experience/item of food, etc., the individual needed to attain most pleasure (the pursuit of happiness). In my review I remarked that I was sure this technology already existed. After reading Home Deus, I now know that it is but a drop in the ocean. Facebook possesses an algorithm that can correctly assess a user's needs and desires more accurately than his or her own family and friends (proven in tests), simply by viewing all the user's 'likes' on the site. This information can be given to retail companies and even politicians; the latter can then learn how best to influence the undecided. Scary, huh? Google predicts trends from the keywords picked up in our emails. In a time when a large proportion of jobs can be done by automaton (and a frightening amount of them have a more than 80% chance of this happening within the next ten years), 'our personal data is probably the most valuable resource humans still have to offer, and we are giving it away to the tech giants in exhange for email services and funny cat videos'.'The result will not be an Orwellian police state... The individual will not be crushed by Big Brother; it will disintegrate from within'. The question is what will happen to all those people whose jobs can be done a hundred times more efficiently and cheaply by robots or computer programmes. In the twentieth century, heads of nations needed soldiers and workers for wars and industry, so they improved living conditions and medicine for the masses, but what will happen when the masses are no longer needed? Years ago, I read somewhere that to be born in Western society in the second half of the 20th century made us the luckiest people in the history of the world. If Harari's suggestions (and he does say they are possibilities, not prophecies) come to pass, I think that will remain the case. My reaction to all I read is the one displayed by many when they learn these possibilities: I'm glad I won't be around to see it.There's a section that discusses whether or not animals have a similar consciousness to humans, details tests that have proved that their emotional needs are very much like our own, and describes many of the abhorrent practices of the animal agriculture industry that made me glad I have already stopped eating animal products. It was worth reading the book just for this reminder, just in case I ever feel like eating a nice burger again, but it's definitely worth reading anyway, even though it's repetitive to the point of being slightly rambling in a few areas, and not as well-structured as Sapiens."

We need endless growth or we will fall to pieces. History:- People are usually afraid of change because they fear the unknown. But the single greatest constant of history is that everything changes.- Paradox of historical knowledge: Knowledge that doesn't change behavior is useless. But knowledge that changes behavior quickly loses its relevance. The more data we have and the better we understand history, the faster history alters its course, and the faster our knowledge becomes outdated.- Peak-end rule: The overall pain level neglects duration and instead reflects only the peak-end rule. The narrating self doesn’t aggregate experiences, it averages them. - Terrorism is a strategy adopted by those who lack access to real power. Terrorism works by spreading fear rather than by damage. Overreaction to terrorism poses a far greater threat to security than the terrorists themselves.More people die today from: - Eating too much VS Eating too little- Old age VS Enfectious disease- Suicides VS KilledHappiness:- As countries become richer, they become unhappier and their suicide rates increase.- The average American uses 60x more energy than the average Stone Age hunter-gatherer. Is the average American 60x happier? - Pleasant sensations quickly subside and sooner or later turn into unpleasant ones. - The most common reaction of the human mind to achievement is not satisfaction, but craving for more.- We don't become satisfied by leading a peaceful existence. We become satisfied when reality matches our expectations. The bad news is that as conditions improve, expectations balloon.Progress:- Nobody can absorb all the latest scientific discoveries, can predict how the global economy will look in ten years, has a clue where we are heading in such a rush. Since no one understands the system any more, no one can stop it. - If we succeeded in hitting the brakes, our economy will collapse, along with our society. Modern economy needs constant and indefinite growth in order to survive. That’s why capitalism encourages us to seek immortality, happiness and divinity. An economy built on everlasting growth needs endless projects.- Free-market capitalism the most efficient way of long-term growth, so the rich and freedom of expression are protected, but ecological habitats, social structures and traditional values that stand in the way of free-market capitalism are destroyed.Emotions:- All instincts, drives and emotions evolved to meet the evolutionary pressures of survival and reproduction. When these pressures suddenly disappear, the instincts, drives and emotions do not disappear with them. At least not instantly. - Sensations and emotions are algorithms. A baboon feels hunger, he feels fear and trembling at the sight of the lion, and he feels his mouth watering at the sight of the bananas. Within a split second, he experiences a storm of sensations, emotions and desires, which is nothing but the process of calculation.- All mammals have emotional needs, and that their mental and physical health depends as much on providing for these needs as on food, shelter and medicines.- Feelings are algorithms to help make the right decisions. Love, fear and passion encapsulate millions of years of practical wisdom. When you listen to your feelings, you follow an algorithm that evolution has developed for millions of years, and withstood the harshest quality tests of natural selection. - When I donate money to a beggar, am I not reacting to the unpleasant sensations that the sight of the beggar causes me to feel? Do I really care about the beggar, or do I simply want to feel better myself?Cooperation:- Homo sapiens is the only species on earth capable of co-operating flexibly in large numbers. - After civil revolutions happen, the people cannot run the country and the command is usually hijacked by the military. Because they had flexible cooperation and cooperated better than the crowds.- Humans are ruled by emotions. If I helped you hunt a wild chicken and you kept most of the chicken to yourself, I did not think: ""Better a little than nothing at all."" Instead my evolutionary algorithms kicked in, adrenaline and testosterone flooded my system, my blood boiled, and I stamped my feet and shouted at the top of my voice. In the short term I may have gone hungry, and even risked a punch or two. But it paid off in the long term, because you thought twice before ripping me off again. - We refuse unfair offers because people who meekly accepted unfair offers didn’t survive in the Stone Age.- People and apes are egalitarian by nature, and unequal societies can never function well due to resentment and dissatisfaction.- Large numbers of people behave in a fundamentally different way than do small numbers. Especially in terms of egalitarianism. Most human kingdoms and empires were extremely unequal, yet many of them were surprisingly stable and efficient. Reality & Fiction:- Recording inaccurate data and descriptions can lead to bad decisions. Strive to produce more truthful descriptions.- As bureaucracies accumulate power, they become immune to their own mistakes. Instead of changing their stories to fit reality, they can change reality to fit their stories. - Reality is either objective, subjective or intersubjective. Intersubjective entities depend on communication among many humans rather than on the beliefs and feelings of individual humans. Most important agents in history are intersubjective. Money, has no objective value. Yet as long as billions of people believe in its value, you can use it to buy food, beverages and clothing. - Sapiens rule the world because only they can weave an intersubjective web of meaning: a web of laws, forces, entities and places that exist purely in their common imagination. This web allows humans alone to organise crusades, socialist revolutions and human rights movements.- People weave a web of meaning, believe in it with all their heart, but sooner or later the web unravels, and when we look back we cannot understand how anybody could have taken it seriously. With hindsight, going on crusade in the hope of reaching Paradise sounds like utter madness. Our belief in democracy and human rights might look equally incomprehensible to our descendants.- The power of human cooperation networks rests on a delicate balance between truth and fiction. If you stick to pure reality, without mixing any fiction, few people would follow you.- Belief in national and religious myths might cause the outbreak of war, in which millions lose their homes, their limbs and even their lives. The cause of war is fictional, but the suffering is real. This is why we should strive to distinguish fiction from reality.- Fiction isn't bad. It is vital. Without commonly accepted stories about things like money, states or corporations, no complex human society can function. But stories are just tools and shouldn't become our goals. Corporations, money and nations exist only in our imagination. We invented them to serve us; why do we find ourselves sacrificing our life in their service.- The more painful the sacrifice, the more convinced people are of the existence of the imaginary recipient.Religions:- Agricultural Revolution gave rise to theist religions, Scientific Revolution gave birth to humanist religions, in which humans replaced gods. - Founding idea of humanist religions like liberalism, communism and nazism is humans has some unique and sacred essence that is the source of all meaning and authority in the universe. Religion and ideologies are mostly the same thing, fictitious products of sapiens. - Science only deals with facts, but religion never confines itself to ethical judgements. Religion can't provide us with any practical guidance unless it makes some factual claims too, and here it may well collide with science. Most important segments of many religious dogmas aren't their ethical principles, but rather factual statements. Many of the most heated religious debates, and many of the conflicts between science and religion, involve such factual claims rather than ethical judgements.Religious stories almost always include 3 parts:1.  Ethical judgements: ‘human life is sacred’2.  Factual statements: ‘human life begins at the moment of conception’3.  Merge of ethical judgements with factual statements, resulting in practical guidelines: ‘you should never allow abortion, even a single day after conception’- Can't maintain large social orders without religion. Religion provides the ethical justification for scientific research and in exchange gets to influence the scientific agenda. You can't understand the history of science without taking religious beliefs into account. Scientific Revolution began in one of the most intolerant and religious societies in history.- Source of meaning and authority was relocated from the gods to human feelings. Heaven and hell changed from locations to internal mental states.Modernity: Humans agree to give up meaning in exchange for power- Modernity motto: ‘shit happens’- On the practical level, modern life consists of a constant pursuit of power within a universe devoid of meaning. Modern culture is the most powerful in history, and it is ceaselessly researching, inventing, discovering and growing. At the same time, it is plagued by more existential angst than any previous culture.- Modernity, is based on the firm belief that economic growth is not only possible but is absolutely essential. ‘If you have a problem, you probably need more stuff, and in order to have more stuff, you must produce more of it.’- Road to growth was blocked because people believed that holy scriptures already contained all the important knowledge the world had to offer. Scientific Revolution freed humankind from this conviction. The greatest scientific discovery was the discovery of ignorance. Biochemistry:- What some people hope to get by studying, working or raising a family, others try to obtain more easily through the right dosage of molecules. This is an existential threat to the social and economic order, which is why countries wage a stubborn, bloody and hopeless war on biochemical crime.- The state hopes to regulate the biochemical pursuit of happiness, separating bad manipulations from good ones. Biochemical manipulations that strengthen political stability, social order and economic growth are encouraged. Manipulations that threaten stability and growth are banned. As the biochemical pursuit of happiness accelerates, it will reshape politics, society and economics, and it will become ever harder to bring it under control.Superhumans:- In pursuit of health, happiness and power, humans will gradually change their features, until they are no longer human.- Increasing human power relied mainly on upgrading our external tools. In the future we'll be upgrading the human body and mind, or merging with our tools. The upgrading of humans into gods may follow 3 paths: biological engineering, cyborg engineering and engineering of non-organic beings.- As a species we fear becoming irrelevant when we hear of superhumans. Our identity, our dreams and even our fears will be irrelevant and we won't have anything to contribute. Whatever you are today in an upgraded world you will feel like a Neanderthal hunter in Wall Street. You won’t belong.- When you develop bionic legs that enable paraplegics to walk again, you can also use the same technology to upgrade healthy people. No clear line separates healing from upgrading. Medicine almost always begins by saving people from falling below the norm, but same tools can be used to surpass the norm.AI:- Emotions are algorithms and no algorithm requires consciousness to run.- Turing: It doesn't matter who you really are, it matters what others thought about you. It won’t matter if computers will actually be conscious. What people think matter.- There has been immense advance in computer intelligence, zero advance in computer consciousness. Computers in 2016 are no more conscious than in the 1950s. But humans are in danger of losing their value, because intelligence is decoupling from consciousness.- Armies and corporations cannot function without intelligent agents, but they don’t need consciousness and subjective experiences. Intelligence is mandatory but consciousness is optional.- If you enter medical school today in the expectation of still being a family doctor in twenty years, maybe you should think again. With such a Watson around, there is not much need for Sherlocks. (IBM)- If your CT indicates you have cancer, how about receiving the news from a caring and empathetic machine that tailors its words to your personality type? 1.  Every animal is an assemblage of organic algorithms shaped by natural selection & evolution.2.  Algorithmic calculations aren't affected by the materials of the calculator. 3.  There is no reason for organic algorithms to do things that non-organic algorithms can't. - Experts have repeatedly declared that something will ‘forever’ remain beyond the reach of non-organic algorithms. But it turns out ‘forever’ often means a few decades. - There will be be autonomous algorithms like angels that work for owners interest behind their back and make critical decisions. Ex: Cortana, Siri, Alexa. - Once Siris evolve from oracles to agents, they might start speaking directly with one another, on their masters’ behalf. My Siri contacting your Siri to agree on a place and time for a meeting. A potential employer tells me not to bother sending a CV, but simply allow his Siri to grill my Siri. Or my Siri may be approached by the Siri of a potential lover, and the two will compare notes to decide whether it’s a good match, unknown by their human owners.- As Siris gain authority, they may begin manipulating each other to further the interests of their masters, so that success in the job market or the marriage market may depend on the quality of your Siri. Rich with newest Siri will have advantage over poor with older versions. - When everybody uses the same oracle, and everybody believes the oracle, the oracle turns into a sovereign. (ex: Waze)- The system will understand us better than we understand ourselves, and will make most of the important decisions for us. The system will deprive individuals of their authority and freedom.- Age of the masses and mass medicine is over. As human soldiers and workers give way to algorithms, at least some elites may conclude that there is no point in providing improved or even standard conditions of health for masses of useless poor people, and it is far more sensible to focus on upgrading a handful of superhumans beyond the norm.Death of Liberalism: - According to the life sciences:1.  Organisms are algorithms, and humans are not individuals, but are dividuals. Assemblage of many different algorithms lacking a single inner voice or a single self.2.  Algorithms constituting a human are not free. They are shaped by genes and environmental pressures, and take decisions either deterministically or randomly, but not freely.3.  External algorithm can know me much better than I can. Then the algorithm will know best, the algorithm will always be right.- Three practical threats to liberalism: 1.  Humans will lose their economic and military usefulness, so the economic and political system will stop attaching much value to them.2.  The system will still find value in humans collectively, but not in unique individuals. The system will know you better than you know yourself and will make most of the important decisions for you and you will be perfectly happy with that. 3.  The system will still find value in some unique individuals, but these will be a new elite of upgraded superhumans rather than the mass of the population.- People will stop seeing themselves as autonomous beings and instead start seeing themselves as a collection of biochemical mechanisms constantly monitored and guided by a network of algorithms. For this to happen, there is no need of an external algorithm that knows me perfectly, it is enough that an external algorithm will know me better than I know myself, and will make fewer mistakes. - Liberalism will collapse on the day the system knows me better than I know myself. - We are suddenly showing unprecedented interest in the fate of lower life forms, perhaps because we are about to become one. - You want to know how super-intelligent cyborgs might treat ordinary humans? Better start by investigating how humans treat their less intelligent animal cousins.Dataism: Freedom of Information- We can choose thousands of destinations for vacations. But we are likely to be playing with our phone instead of really seeing the place. We have more choice than ever before, but no matter what we choose, we have lost the ability to pay attention to it.- In the past, censorship worked by blocking the flow of information. Now, censorship works by flooding people with irrelevant information. In ancient times having power meant having access to data. Today having power means knowing what to ignore.- Capitalism won the because distributed data processing works better than centralised data processing, in periods of accelerating technological change.- If humankind is a single data-processing system, its output will be the creation of a new and even more efficient data-processing system, called the Internet-of-All-Things. Once this mission is accomplished, we will vanish.- We must prove to ourselves and to the system that we still have value. Value lies in turning experiences into free-flowing data.- Dataist, sees the entire human species as a single data-processing system, with individual humans serving as chips. Human history is a process of improving the efficiency of this system:1.  Increasing the number of processors. A city of 100,000 vs 1,000 people computing power.2.  Increasing the variety of processors. Using several kinds of processors in a single system increases its dynamism and creativity. Peasant, priest, physician vs 3 hunter-gatherers.3.  Increasing the number of connections between processors. Linking 10 cities will result in more innovations.4.  Increasing the freedom of movement along existing connections. Connecting processors isn't useful if data cannot flow freely. Building roads between 10 cities won’t be very useful if they are robbed.- Dataism commandments:1. A Dataist ought to maximise data flow by connecting to more and more media, and producing and consuming more and more information. 2. Connect everything to the system, including heretics who don’t want to be connected. My body, cars, refrigerators, chickens and trees, all should be connected to the Internet-of-All-Things. 3. The greatest sin is to block the data flow. The freedom of information is the greatest good of all.Ending:- When the car replaced the horse-drawn carriage, we didn’t upgrade the horses, we retired them. Perhaps it is time to do the same with Homo sapiens.- Looking back, humanity will turn out to be just a ripple within the cosmic data flow.Questions to remember:1.  Are organisms really just algorithms, and is life really just data processing?2.  What’s more valuable: intelligence or consciousness?3.  What will happen to society, politics and daily life when non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms know us better than we know ourselves?"

278,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50751040-jasper-burns,5,"Homo Deus is excellent. I’ve been increasingly valuing those intellectuals like Hariri who break the traditional mold of thinking, whose ideas are not steeped in common political, religious, or other ideological dogma but in original thought. Homo Deus picks up roughly where Sapiens left off, and traces the ideas that shape the modern era into the theories shaping the future. For this, the book earns five stars—I have not read a more compelling fusion of philosophy, history, and science. A key point of the book is Hariri’s description of humans as algorithms. This sounds bizarre and like it lacks, well, humanity, but it’s a rather interesting viewpoint from which to analyze the rest of human processes. He says “Humans are algorithms that produce not cups of tea, but copies of themselves (like a vending machine which, if you press the right combination of buttons, produces another vending machine)… Even Nobel laureates in economics make only a tiny fraction of their decisions using pen, paper and calculator; 99 per cent of our decisions – including the most important life choices concerning spouses, careers and habitats – are made by the highly refined algorithms we call sensations, emotions and desires.”To me, this is a definitional issue. People who view algorithms as a mathematical construct will likely recoil at this personification. But Hariri is defining it a little differently—he is saying that algorithms are processes that respond deterministically to inputs. All sensations, thoughts, etc are the variables which we process and then take action on. He’s not saying that we are literally computers in the same way our laptops are, but that we are data-processors and there are some characteristics of data processing which can be generalized. Towards the end of the book, he describes this working en masse, as he makes an argument for capitalism over communism in terms of data processing:“Capitalism did not defeat communism because capitalism was more ethical, because individual liberties are sacred or because God was angry with the heathen communists. Rather, capitalism won the Cold War because distributed data processing works better than centralised data processing, at least in periods of accelerating technological change… Political scientists also increasingly interpret human political structures as data-processing systems. Like capitalism and communism, so democracies and dictatorships are in essence competing mechanisms for gathering and analysing information… Under alternative conditions – those prevailing in the ancient Roman Empire, for instance – centralised processing had an edge, which is why the Roman Republic fell and power shifted from the Senate and popular assemblies into the hands of a single autocratic emperor.”While I appreciate this novel take on history and society, I definitely think Hariri has a couple of blind spots. The last chapter talks about a philosophy called dataism which speaks to the objective goal of the universe to maximize data processing as if it were a moral value. His view is descriptive, not persuasive, which is to say I’m not convinced he actually adheres to the philosophy himself, but he does not do a good job addressing what are some quite obvious drawbacks. The first being the value problem—he’ll pose the separation of consciousness and intelligence and say we might have to choose, but to me its quite obvious that consciousness must be the bearer of moral value. How one could choose to value intelligence as an end in itself rather than a means to an end needs a justification for me. Granted, that is an almost axiomatic claim and hard to argue.More pragmatically, Hariri has left completely unaddressed the rather large problem of mathematical complexity. He paints a picture where future computers will have so much information and data processing capabilities that they will know us better than ourselves. It is obvious that computers could, in theory, simulate a brain—if a brain does all its processing on a physical substrate than computers should be able to as well. But what’s different about emulating a specific person's brain rather than a general one is how to actually get and model all that information. Some computer science problems are so mathematically complex that they would require every atom in the universe acting in parallel for a billion years to solve, and the world he imagines would seem to have many of these types of problems at hand.The book touches on far more topics than just data processesing; he shares interesting ideas on history, biology, consciousness, humanity, free will, and more. Moreover, while my above examples and critique might seem esoteric, most of the book is written in a very intelligible and understandable way. While I would not endorse all of its ideas, Homo Deus is definitely worth the read.View my best reviews and a collection of mental models at jasperburns.blog."

Views on liberalism, in particular, were quite interesting and insightful! It's kind of funny that the first thing I did after reading the book is to go to the Goodreads and write this review :D I guess dataism is not such a far-fetched religion idea after all.

287,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"I had my doubts that this would be as good as Sapiens because it is hard to do better than the that. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I loved every word in this book (with the exception of 1 sentence, referenced at the end of this review). I might not have agreed with every word, but Harari's style of writing is incredible because he continually talks about the things I always want to talk about with people but don't always get the chance to. Harari is what I dream of when I imagine meeting the ideal friend of whom I will never tire, the type of friend who you can stay up with talking about life on a big scale until the sun comes up and you realize a whole 8 hours has passed in the blink of an eye. If the material presented in this book were written by a different author, I probably would have been far less interested. Most of the studies included are things that have been written about very often by other authors . However, since it was written by Harari I ended up absolutely loving this book . The entire time I was reading it I pictured myself in a philosophy classroom in The 22nd or 23rd century, Learning about the great philosophers of the 21st-century . I wholeheartedly believe that Harari will be among the most adored and most studied philosophers of future students. Harari's final chapter was everything I could have hoped. His entire argument led up to helping his reader understand that they, like everything else in the universe, are data, information to be shared and dissipated. I could be wrong, but I can't recall a single instance in which Harari used the word emergence. Yet, he gave one of the best explanations of the emergence of human bodies and human culture (and later AI) possible. His focus on networks was extremely brief but so very satisfying. One thing that made me so sad to read was a sentence regarding the growing collective intelligence and complexity of human culture (and later AI). Harari marveled at how much we have come to know and how much future generations will know. He painted a picture of the future that was very reminiscent of the future Andy Clark wrote about in Natural Born Cyborgs. His discussion of this intelligent future was spot on -- even better than anything you can read in a Kurzweil book. But, and this is a huge but, he said he could not imagine why on Earth he would need to learn geometry or thermodynamics once we live in that type of intelligent world. Is he crazy?!?! Understanding geometry and thermodynamics is *exactly* how Einstein came to understand the theories of special and general relativity. Understanding those two things have brought us more understanding about our universe than probably *anything* else. It was such a poor choice of words. I truly believe that if he thinks about this a bit more, he will understand that, along with intelligent computer programs that create an intelligent society, there will always be humans who come to possess life changing, indeed humanity changing, ideas about our universe specifically because they understand things a computer could also understand. Understanding things like geometry (eh hem, spacetime bends) and thermodynamics (energy is morphed from hot radiation to cooler matter -- stars, planets, cells, you and me) will likely be what leads the next Einstein (e.g. Jermey England and others) to give us our next big insight into the world. Until humans no longer exist, until they are morphed with AI to the point where they are no longer recognizable, I feel certain they will continue to come up with new theories. Thus, even in an intelligent world, it will still be important to deeply understand how the universe works. Even considering everything said in the foregoing paragraph, this book is a solid 5 stars. Sheer intellectual entertainment from start to finish. "
288,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/357208-guru,3,"""Homo Deus"" projects itself as a book of mankind's tomorrow, as opposed to mankind's history as Prof. Harari's ""Sapiens"" was. The book opens well with a discussion about how the problems of 21st century are very different from any other century so far. About how famine, starvation, wars, epidemics - the chief problems that concerned humans so far - are now getting rarer and rarer. Hence. the challenges for humans from hereon would be very different. What shall we pursue to make ourselves better? If we rise above the mortal limitations, would we aim to become gods?Then the book takes a winding detour, through the past again and talks about the progress of mankind from the beginning of the Cognitive Revolution to the Cold War. This discussion occupies more than 2/3rds of the book. Thankfully, it is a fascinating tour through the ages without being a rehash of ""Sapiens"". I really liked how Prof. Harari traces the ebb and flow of liberalism in the last century, covering the various facets of fascism and socialism, communism and capitalism, dictatorship and democracy; and finally talks about how liberalism has slowly given way to humanism in the current day. The trouble is that you realize that you have nearly reached the end of the book and yet there is no talk about the ""History of Tomorrow"" as the title promised. Then Prof. Harari rushes through a quick, non-sequitur conclusion where he essentially says that data-ism will end all other -isms. Emotions, free will, ingenuity, etc. could be dissected and explained by algorithms once we have the right tools. Then would humans really matter. I was very annoyed by the hurried ending that is not in sync with the rest of the book at all. It is contrived and in a way seems to be follow the leap of logic General AI doomsayers use to justify how exponential growth would very soon lead to a technological singularity pretty soon and the machines will take over. It doesn't deliver what it says on the cover, sure, but it is a good read. If you were looking for a more scientific view of the future, I could suggest Mikio Kaku, or a good sci-fi novel by Bruce Sterling, William Gibson or even the space operas by Peter F. Hamilton or Iain M. Banks. This definitely something else :)"
289,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20262189-tristan,4,"I liked this book a lot but I don't think Harari mentioned utilitarianism, which struck me as odd for the following reason. He says that humanism is a religion centred around the idea that desire-fulfillment of Homo sapiens is the ultimate good. And he says that humanism will erode as technology gets better at predicting and manipulating our desires, because we'll come to see that a cohesive inner self is not the source of our desires. But my thinking is that humanism is not solely about desire-fulfillment, but is rather about happiness/satisfaction/eudaemonia. And although desire-fulfillment is one aspect of wellbeing (and a workable predictor of what will make us happy), it's not the whole picture. Therefore I couldn't help but think that Harari is making his case for the decline of humanism on somewhat shaky ground. That said, most everything in here is still well worth reading. Harari has a unique way of thinking about history, the present, and the future, and it's worth checking out. Plus his writing style is elegant and straightforward. "
290,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"Homo Deus is a refreshing read because of the author's engaging writing, sharp language and human/humanity-oriented presentation. For someone as knowledgeable and astute with so many ideas, the book disappoints in the finality of its messages.This reviewer would classify the ""singularity"" (for the want of better word) theories in three forms: the strong, the middling and the weak. Singularity is defined as the upcoming age when humans are not in full control of the objectives and modalities of technology progress. In simpler words, singularity is defined as the period from when machines begin taking the most important decisions. This is not the definition of Kurzweil but it would work better than terms like ""machine age"" in my view.The strongest form of Singularity is nightmared by Nick Bostrom etc. The believers expect a world where machines may soon find human existence baneful for their perpetual explosive growth and as a result completely neuter/annihilate us at the first opportunity. On their own with humans as important as rabbits are for humanity now, these machines begin on their evolution for whatever galactic purpose or resource grab. A somewhat weaker form of Singularity theories are championed by the father of the concept Kurzweil and has the largest number of followers. Here, the believers believe in runaway technology progress to benefit humanity on the one side with ever better and longer lives on the one side but without much work or employment on the other. The weakest forms - the category I would have for Homo Deus - expect a far slower technology progress and foresee changes in the ways societies and individuals exist but without being completely overpowered in any sense. In these theories, we change radically along with or because of the machines - in ways that even sci-fis cannot predict. This could involve living in our 200s or with brains networked like Internet or with third arm sticking out of our back!The above are artificial categorizations more to point out that this book forecasts are different and milder compared to what we get from numerous others who have more science and technology background. The author has little to offer on the technologies themselves despite some discussions on the usual AI, deep learning, neural network etc subjects. There are many other discussions on the broad societal trends over the last few centuries/millenias which are fun to read but have little true connections to pattern what is ahead despite the author's best efforts to assert some lessons. Effectively, the author tries to prove that the future is not going to be anything like in the past - something almost all will instantaneously agree - by showing how this was always the case at every critical technological progress juncture in our existence in the past. Frankly, this did not need any proving.The conclusions about the era of homo Deus do not go far enough though. The author writes more about what will not be (like today's liberalism, job security, the diminishing role of religion etc) than what will be. Mr. Harari is far more optimistic than most writers of this genre. He had fairly positive ideas on human body/brain enhancement, societal developments/progress (in structure/form and content) with technology, institutional changes and new possible government methods. However, most of these topics are barely discussed in a book that ends too abruptly just when it reaches the most important parts after long introductions."
291,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9086236-chaitra,2,"(Edited to add (03/2020): Pandemics are not dealt with better. Hubris is really something humans are not letting go.)—-Well, not quite liked it. Non fiction isn't really something I read for fun, but I caught sight of this book on my library's website, and liked the description enough to check it out. I suspect it's more me than the book, because for some reason, I thought humanity's future had to be genetic engineering and/or seeding other planets. The last because of this (unpopular) theory that our Hindu gods were really alien beings. So. Homo Deus meant something other to me than than what it's really meant here. I'm not knocking the book. In a way, it's quite cool. But it's mostly talking of history, and less about the future of humanity. There are a few probabilities that it does present future-wise, but then again, I'm anal. I seriously do think that some issues are not at all dealt with. For example, he mentions that pandemics are dealt with better, people live longer and less babies die. And if people become immortal be it at once or decade by decade, where will the people go? Will anyone stop reproducing? What will that do to poor earth? And what about the near future? That wars are non-existent and so are famines and plagues are bold statements. But climate change is real, and what if several parts of the world were struck with climate calamities at once? Then it's no longer a political thing, it's an actual resource issue. He also says Islam (well, religion basically) has nothing to offer a technological populace. I disagree, in the sense that religion is still alive (nope, I don't believe we're disposing the body, not yet). And even if it has nothing to offer, if fundamentalists only want to destroy and not construct, does it really matter? He mentions free market dictates where the future will go, and that it will go towards developing intelligent, non sentient computers that will replace humans in practically every field of life. Where's the market intelligence in that? Because you do need consumers. If humans are not employed, how are they buying the things mega-corps are selling? There could be nanobiotics to cure cancer, but how can the now unemployed afford it? I mean, I think I missed a bit. Because there was a portion of the book that sounded very much like ideas already presented in earlier chapters, and I may have skimmed it. But still, he's quite dismissive of things he doesn't want to factor in, such as climate change NOW, and the fact that a few pen strokes can change the shape of the future. There's also the consideration of how much power a computer can really have over a person's body - bionic hands are fine, but is it really that easy for normal people to have super powers thanks to AI even if they could afford it? Gods are still a major motivation for most people, whether they truly believe in them or not. There are so many in power who think homosexuality a sin (it's still a criminal offence in India, even though it's not a religious sin in Hinduism), wouldn't being immortal be considered an even greater affront to the natural order?(I also thought Harari came across as needlessly anti-religion. I don't much like religion either, but then again, shouldn't we be open minded? How is it definitely proved that nothing else greater exists in the world?)"

If humanity should succeed, though, it will become ""godlike"" and take over many of the qualities that we traditionally associate with a deity.  That could happen, Harari thinks, because all societies, whatever their political bent, promote growth, more ""stuff"" so that people all over the world can live like Americans with all of their material comforts. The problem is that growth only comes about traditionally through development of natural resources, and the human race is going to use them up. The one area where growth is unlimited occurs with knowledge, and it is here that he thinks technology and religion meet.  New technologies, particularly the rise of the internet, includes everyone in a vast communication web where knowledge moves instantly and freely. There is no longer any need to believe in an omniscient, all powerful god to which humans pay homage. Omniscience and power now belong solely to humans, or more specifically. This power and knowledge will be used to create superior human beings, ones that will be healthier and live longer. There's a strong possibility that technology, through algorithms and data processing, will take over intelligent planning from human beings and ""may soon know us [and our needs] better than we know ourselves."" They will take over because humans simply cannot process and deal quickly enough with constant and instantaneously flowing information. What will happen then when a reversal comes, turning human beings into robotic-like followers, directed by trans-human technology? Harari doesn't really have any answers for that. He says he's just pointing out possibilities and that he's not a prophet. It's even possible that ociety may revert and prevent these trends from accelerating. Our thoughts and actions are usually limited by present day ideologies and the social systems that we know, so we may make serious mistakes.  That leads to one of his most interesting conclusions that free will is an illusion. Our thinking is either environmentally or genetically determined, or it may develop randomly. If this is true, than humans don't act rationally, as that would require an intelligent free will choice. What if people feel they're acting freely? That only occurs in imaginary stories, writes Harari. Intriguing ideas, but some are sketchy, and I find Harari occasionally too quickly dismisses complex subjects by summarizing them in simplistic terms. I think he particularly does this with religion, coming close to equating all religion with outdated superstitions.  It seems to me that what is lacking in Harari is any speculation about what humans will do with the increasing amount of leisure time they may well have in the future. He talks about ""superior"" beings, but that has mostly to do with physical qualities. What about mental states of being that go beyond the satisfaction of material wants? Religion attempts to provide a meaning to life, and Harari, if I read him accurately, unfortunately finds such meanings irrelevant to a future where algorithms and data processing are in control."

The book examines how technology, in particular AI and biology, has fundamentally transformed the paradigm of ""human history"". The perspective of the book is very broad and high, making it one of those ""macro history"" books almost in extreme. But the discussion, propositions, and arguments are very rich, clear, and easy to grasp. Even though the author emphasizes time after time the book intends ""possibilities"" rather than ""prophecies"", it is pretty obvious he is leaning to a set of eventual scenarios, which I don't fully agree with (see below). But the book is a solid 5-star, and I'd like to recommend to all. Happy reading in 2017! OK. Here are my main disagreement. I am hashing it our rather quickly.For the sake of argument, even if we fully accept the extreme point of view of ""dataism"" in which everything is essentially a piece of data and everything is valued and judged based on that, it is still a problem to dismiss the importance personal experience and feelings all together. Let's use art as an example. I can accept that a piece of painting, such as a Picasso's Guernica , is in essence a set of ""data"", which is all fine. But that ""data"" for the painting is not just the physical painting itself. The artist, the history, the process, are all part of the ""data"" of the painting as well. Furthermore, analyses, reviews, emotions, and emotional reactions the painting ignites in the countless viewers are also part of that ""data"". The data won't end even if the painting is physically destroyed, because people will keep talking about it through records, memory, and keep adding to it. In this sense, the ""data"" of the Guernica through the sharing process is an ever expanding ""infinite"" in the infinite data universe? How would the system ever be able to judge this infinite organic data process and say it is an replicate-able algorithm? Isn't the same can be said with meditation? In this case the data of the experience is also an ""infinite"" through introspection, even though bounded by the physicality of a person.Essentially, my disagreement with the author is the denial of each individual ""uniqueness"" by viewing it just as a ""algorithm/data"" constrained by a boundary. But the power of liberalism, looked through the ""dataism"" lens, is such that within each boundary there still can be a ""unique"" being. And despite being bounded, the uniqueness of organic experience is supported by its ever-lasting generation of new data through introspection and/or cross-sharing. So human and humanism will survive and prosper. Technology gives us power and enables us to create ever unique selves to ""justify"" our existence and individuality. Individuality will be intertwined and connected, but nonetheless remain unique and organic, as long as we know how to enrich ourselves (both materially and more so spiritually). Though I do acknowledge that one can easily lose its uniqueness by giving up its capacity to introspect and share. To use the dataism vocabulary, one will become ""redundant"" if it is just a simple collection of copies of data that already exist. Actually we already see many of those. "

Many readers are likely to think that this book is all about what that will look like in 450 pages of detail. In fact, only the the last quarter of the book deals with these issues in any depth; the introductory chapter a sort of naive, present-tense look into that future...What I really liked about this book:1) its deconstruction of the humanist notions of what makes us so special. To note: consciousness is a) unnecessary vis-a-vis intelligence and a) confers no power vis-a-vis will; we are naught but biological algorithms, our emotions to boot; if we are to choose to 'upgrade' our already dubiously useful consciousnesses, we will likely do so to the extent that we will snuff out the unpleasant aspect of our lives, thereby granting these technologies greater and more predictable power over our lives, thereby rendering us less human (our humanity resting on will/agency at the most fundamental level); fascism itself - kudos to Harari for pointing this out - is a form of humanism (one more nod to the nothing inherently 'great' about humans theme; etc and anon.2) its theory of history. In keeping with his idea that what truly singles out humans from its fellow biological creatures being its ability to tell stories, Harari spells out the fact that history is itself paradoxical: ""as we accumulate more data and increase our computing power, events become wilder and more unexpected. The more we know, the less we can predict."" The classic example being Marx and Marxism: ""Marx forgot that capitalists know how to read."" p.57 And ""Knowledge that does not change behaviour is useless. But knowledge that changes behavior quickly loses its relevance. The more data we have and the better we understand history, the faster history alters its course, and the faster our knowledge becomes outdated."" p.58I mean, how many books, before even making its ostensible case, insert a page or two about the hypothetical nature of it all? Are the subsequent chapters that chronicle the rise and fall of Sapiens just there to scare us? Does Harari really think that we are sacrificing our humanity on the alter of 'Dataism' and techno-humanism? Have we truly given up the humanist creed of looking for our authentic selves? Is humanity - and what I would take to be his final case for how our species can find ethical justification for its continued existence - just another means to an end, a superior biological algorithm?Indeed, in closing, he is not looking to make much of any point at all other than to call the reader to serious thought about what the reader wants for the future of the human race. Thought may or may not be of any use, but if not, then there is nothing to be done about it besides, philosophy just another extravegant pleasure..."

It should have been named something like: ‘’Homo Blindus: Brief History of Yesterday, Today: Exposing Flaws in All Beliefs of Society and Maybe I’ll Mention Something about Tomorrow.’’I wanted to read a book about possibilities of future and since I’m short of free time I must carefully choose what will I read. According to reviews and recommendations Harari’s Homo Deus seemed like good choice. I hoped for something like book version of Black Mirror or Tim Urban’s Neuralink, but it turned out to be little bit different. The book is like when you ask someone to explain you football, he doesn’t starts with: it is played by 2 opposing teams with 11 players each, but he starts with gravity, air resistance ball is experiencing when kicked, materials used in goalkeeper’s gloves, feelings of crowd watching the game and biochemistry happening on grass of field. Seriously, f.e. you are given detailed description of Ancient Egyptian society and functions of their economic system. Only first and last three chapters are about possibilities of future. It is like you make foundation for Burj Khalifa and then you build dog house on it.But, disregarding the misleading title and my small continued annoyance, book is quite good. Actually, for someone who is encountering subjects mentioned inside for the first time it can be quite game changer. Religions, philosophies, economies, humans throughout the history and their influences on each other are thoroughly dissected. He went long way trying to demystify beliefs human have been gathering and incorporating in themselves and society throughout all conscious history from the most objective point of perspective although his own interpretations are not always most objective ones. I do not agree with all of those interpretations but I do appreciate them as second point of view on reality because he presents them with firm background and proofs. Concerning the future part, he introduces couple of interesting possibilities. Most detailed two are about human enhancement and All-Knowing-Internet and it does not leave you indifferent. On second, third, fourth thought, but even on first notion you cannot keep avoiding to ask yourself what the future will bring and where will your place be since it is very clear that it already started to develop.I would like that more of the book was about future and less like some introduction for students in new semester of some long, detailed, demanding subject, but nevertheless I do not consider my time being lost because it neatly flirts with numerous subjects and widens perspective on our world; past, present and future one.

I liked Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, thus my expectations for this New York Times bestseller were high. Yuval Harari has a knack to spark interest in usually a bit dry and theoretical topics. Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow is an informative and discussion inspiring read. It’s thesis: liberal humanism will progress into techno humanism, making the ordinary human obsolete in the process.It takes a step back and explains our progress and power to control and manage diseases, famine and war as mere challenges. The days are past where humankind faced those as insurmountable tragedies. Nowadays more people die from eating too much, old age etc. ”The average American is a thousand times more likely to die from binging at McDonalds than from being blown up by Al Qaeda.”Harari explores the answer to the questions: What will replace the tragedies of old? (death) What are the new, incomprehensible and uncontrollable forces? (it’s still death)HD talks about overcoming death, in any ways. #LIVELONGER! Creating artificial life for purposes that can only be dreamt of. #BEHAPPIER Our next evolutional step to upgrade humankind to godlike beings. Mind, just the rich.I don’t agree with this bleak statement. There are countless examples of wealthy persons putting giant efforts and gargantuan amounts of money to saving the poor, the climate, the planet, humankind, you name it. Contrary to many reviews I’ve found the books thesis lacking clarity. Keeping in mind that the questions posed are none that can be answered, only speculated about, I still wished it to be more scientific. I missed humankinds progress so far in details. (It’s not like as if we have to speculate about that)HD paints a positive picture for the future, brought to life with technology. #SEXROBOTS (not exclusively, but this is important too!). The discussion about the shift to transhumanism is ever present.For my personal liking there were too many pages devoted to talk about (the purpose) of religion. It is necessary to understand how it works in order to foretell what could possibly replace it in the future. For Yuval Harari it’s obviously science.The leaps this book takes are in my opinion too big. I felt like I am being preached to. Large portions repeat themselves from Homo Sapiens. It’s full of thought provoking ideas but is rather chaotic. I was left a little disappointed and confused. If you’re new to Yuval Harari, make sure to pick up Homo Sapiens and stick to TED talks and interviews; that’ll summarize Homo Deus sufficiently."

298,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13225247-a,2,"I started reading this book because a lot of people I respect highly recommended it (yeah, I wanted to be one of the cool kids). However, after the first ~120 pages I had to stop. The main issue I have with the first part of the book is that it is pretty much a refried set of ideas from biologists, cognitive and computer scientists (dawkins, pinker, chomsky, simon, etc.) and scifi writers (stapledon, asimov, ellison, gibson, bacigalupi, etc.).After quite a struggle I decided to read the two final chapters of the book, hoping they would give something worth the reading. I found misguiding terms such as “current biological dogma”. Also, my impression of his “dataism” is that it’s not so different from the logical positivism from early 20th century; everything will be transformed into a data processor, which sounds more like a cheap scifi novel than a profound reflection about the future. The same applies for his ideas of what algorithms and in general technology can do:- “Remote surgery on Mars?”, Let’s talk about the speed of light and latency.- “Uber-like algorithms will make private cars obsolete?” I don’t know, maybe we all need the cars more or less at the same time? Also, inequality, anyone?- “Technology can identify how you feel” Have you ever looked at a sentiment analysis algorithm and check how many false positive/negatives it produces? What about algorithmic/dataset bias?Treating technology and algorithms in the abstract only shows that Harari doesn’t know much about all these issues (this could have been described in the middle part of the book, but again, I couldn’t read it because of so much BS).In the same line, much of what Harari claims (‘record, upload, share’) is pretty much based in the last 10-15 years of social media, more than anything else. Maybe in the future we will still sharing selfies, or maybe society will have other more important challenges and interests, so sharing information will be something nobody cares much. Maybe new encryption methods or economic trends will also change the behavior from indiscriminate sharing to a more selective transmission of information.I’m not an authority in History, but my impression is that Harari’s version of human history was kind of simplistic, but it may have been his intention to make it more readable, I don’t know.In summary, this is a mix of scifi novels, badly understood science and old articles from Popular Mechanics, without much of an original idea to bring to the table."
299,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4416856-yana,5,"YOU CAN FIND A COPY OF THIS REVIEW AT:https://thequidnuncblog.wordpress.com...Homo Deus was an easy choice. I am a modern human being and am extremely worried when it comes to the Earth that we are likely to leave to our children, therefore this read was a curious and extremely accurate prediction as to what is to come next. In very few words I can sum up my overall opinion of this book and it is:Shocking. Entertaining. Incredibly thoughtful. Freaking fantastic!I absolutely loved every single bit of it. It is intelligent, insightful and pleasing to the last bit.It poses some excellent questions that make you question your existence. Why do we think of ourselves as superior to all other life forms. Why do we have such strong faith in imaginary things such as money, gods, human rights, companies...And what will become of us if dataism succeeds. All in all, it's clear that we can't keep living like this. It is quite the philosophical jewel and causes a lot of reflection. This is why my review came so late after I finished the book. I had to sit back and reflect on the 2o+ pages of comments I had laying around.It is for those of us enthusiasts who follow technological and scientific trends in the 21st century, and ponder on the practical and philosophical implications of such rapid intellectual growth. It looks at history, science and the views of social philosophers. Its arguments provide sufficient background to enable the reader to consider what has been, what is now, and what may happen next.From that, seemingly benign start, of wanting to expand our powers of control over our lives and our environment; we might be drawn into a post-humanism ""religion"" whereby we ourselves as humans are not the centre of the universe and where, in an ironic gesture of fate, we become a component or a spare part of the post-humanism machine. People created the liberal humanist tradition and announced the death of God in the nineteenth century and it might be now the time to announce the new religion and announce humanity to have done its role.Whether you are inclined to believe him or not, to think that he is a modern day prophet or an incurable pessimist, reading this book is bound to make you ask questions and that is a good thing. At least as long as we can ask our own questions and search inside us for their answers."
