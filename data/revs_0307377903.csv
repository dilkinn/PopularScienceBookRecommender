0,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4828849-michael-burnam-fink,4,"Haidt is much better psychologist than political philosopher, and this book is both monumental and dangerously flawed.On the good side: Haidt draws broadly from research in psychology, anthropology, and biology to develop a six-factor basis for morality (Care/Harm, Liberty/Oppression, Fairness/Cheating, Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, Sanctity/Degradation), and show that moral judgement is an innate intuitive ability accompanied by post-hoc justifications. Morality serves to bind non-related groups, i.e. society, together, and moral skills have been favored by various evolutionary mechanisms over human history. This theory is, frankly, really good and really well developed.Haidt then goes on to show that Liberalism draws from only the first three moral factors while Conservatism draws from all six. This explains both the differences between liberals and conservatives, and why conservatives beat the stuffing out of liberals at the polls. This is also incontrovertible.But Haidt is unwilling to follow his theory to its ultimate question: Can a democratic political system that privileged the rights of the minority procedurally sustain decision-making based on all six moral factors? Care/Harm, Liberty/Oppression, and Fairness/Cheating are universal factors; everybody uses them, and we mostly agree on when they are upheld or violated. Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, and Sanctity/Degradation are intrinsically provincial factors; they're different for every culture, and every individual. A moral order for a pluralistic society which takes the latter three factors seriously must either force people to uphold a morality they do not believe in, or segregate people based on their different interpretations of morality. Perhaps I'm particularly sensitive to such concerns because I'm a liberal Jew, but forcing false beliefs on and/or ghettoizing people seems profoundly wrong. Conversely, giving a Moral Minority the ability to gum up the works whenever they feel their rights are under attack is killing good governance. Where conservatism fails is that we are no longer living in separate communities. It's one global economy, one atmosphere, one water cycle, one oil supply, etc. Haidt faults liberalism for damaging American moral capital in the 60s and 70s, but he doesn't explain how conservatism can become big enough rule the globe. "

According to Haidt you have a more balanced morality, a realistic view of ""human nature"" (beware anyone who says they understand human nature), and some other good stuff I forgot about. He points the finger at liberals but seems unaware about the political dangers of conservatism. He discusses liberals with disdain. With conservatives there is a kind of awe and he rarely discusses their hypocrisies. Of course he conveniently says we are all hypocrites and should not worry with it. There lies the reason why he is so kind to the contemporary right, which is a clan of hypocrites without equal. Haidt believes we do not reason so much as we rationalize, which really makes one wonder how we managed to even invent the wheel or start using fire. It also explains why he never includes ""truth"" in his limited moral universe. The Persians made it the center of their morality. I guess it would just complicate things, so like any hack, he ignores it, much the same way evolutionary psychologists often dodge the issue of suicide. It also makes it easier to accept contemporary conservatism, which has grown alongside tepid moral relativism. The above thoughts make him seem like a man at home in the world before the English Civil War administered the first blows for egalitarianism. In other words, this is perfect neo-liberal dreck for our vapid post-modern world. A fashionable book that in time will be mocked and at best studied as a curiosity, the main curiosity being why this man is taken so seriously. I suppose he just went to the right schools, just like the guys who sent us to Iraq, deregulated the banks, etc.Most of all, Haidt simply does not understand either side of the political fight. If Republicans love authority, why do they disdain the government? On the flip side the same holds true for government loving liberals. That is because the question is not how much government we shall have. The question is over who shall rule. Conservatives throughout history are defined by their acceptance of gross inequality, which is why any authority that approaches fairness is opposed by them. Haidt grasps this somewhat when discussing fairness and equality but not with the same success as Corey Robin.UPDATE: Years later and still ticking as my most popular review. It is not my best written or most nuanced. As such it requires an update, since it was very much a product of 2013. Has my opinion changed? I can make my case against the book with less vitriol, and a few lines do not really work so well. For instance, my point about rationality is a stretch. I saw Haidt as part of a gradual process, aided on the left and right, to debase the value of rationality. I could go on, but I think our declining faith in reason as an ideal, if not a full blown reality, is in part why you get FOX News and campus protests. My point though could have been better made, but I won't change the review. The old dog has been around for too long now. More to the point, the book still suffers from some flaws in research. It has a bias and more to the point has a limited understanding of morality. Haidt dodges questions of truth and hypocrisy because they would undermine his argument. I have no time anymore for arguments, left or right, that ignore their internal contradictions or other view points that would question their basic premises. Haidt's work is not without merit, but it is already showing its age.Yet, this review of Haidt shows its age. It was written when I was firmly on the left. I am not any longer, having seen the rise of anarchist views and resurgent critical theory. In 2013 I had seen years of right-wing hypocrisy, arrogance, and idiocy (Bush years, Tea Party). The left has responded in kind with its own blend. As such, the nation cannot hold together since both sides utterly hate and distrust each other. Our government system cannot handle such discord. It could not in 1861 and it will not today. In 2013 I may have appeared to be on the left, but since then much has changed, and I find myself being cast out by those in my camp for disagreeing with tactics and goals. I am a man without a party or a tribe and soon the wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. Gone are the days online or in person when debate could be heated, but without hate. Just read the comments. Conservatives came to attack this review, and they almost always do so by using some ad hominem attacks. I was called a liar, told I was unreasonable with a ""bloated sense of compassion."" One person wrote ""I'm only enraging the situation by disagreeing with your obnoxious liberal elephant and will only make it more combative."" My answer? ""Not at all. Unlike what we see today on campus, I am all about debate."" This is where we are today. We no longer trade ideas online. Instead we look to score points, certain of how ""the other"" will react.The war starts among the people before it ever gets formalized. Bleeding Kansas and the Boston Massacre were preludes. We are seeing our own preludes in 2017."
2,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4369435-jay-kamaladasa,2,"I had great expectations for this book after watching the author give an introduction in the Colbert report. However, the book didn't hold up to it's name. These are some of grudges I have against this book:1.) The author doesn't tackle conservative vs. progressive morals. He tackles left wing vs. right wing morals. This is a typical blunder made by the average American. And I would've overlooked it, as the book is geared towards an American audience. But the author is a professor in moral psychology; he should've known better. To illustrate what I mean; in America, conservatives fight for free markets, the freedom to bare arms, and less government intervention. However in countries that have not embraced capitalism as much, the liberals (or progressives) are the ones who fight for free markets, less government intervention and individualist ideals such as the right to bare arms and freedom of speech. It would've made much more sense in a philosophical context if the argument was about progressives (who want change) and conservatives (who want the things the way they are). But then the narrative would be too simple: of course we don't live in a perfect world, so we have to change society and it's prejudices and beliefs. Then the real question is what do we do to bring about change? This of course is a difficult question, and I don't expect an answer from one single book. But it's sad to see the author moving away from this simple approach for the sake of being in the ""middle ground""; which brings to the second point. 2.) The author tries too hard to stay on the ""middle ground"".Have you ever witnessed fights where you absolutely know that one party is being unreasonable, and someone comes along and tries to be ""fair"" to both parties? Obviously the unreasonable party profits and the reasonable party loses because the negotiations were trying to be ""fair"" to both parties. It's a simple case of the ""Anchoring effect.""; whoever anchors the furthest from the truth, wins. The author's six moral foundations is an excellent example for this. He defines Care, Liberty, Fairness, Loyalty, Authority and Sanctity as the six pillars of morality. In his haste to become neutral he assumes that these should be given equal weight. Really? Does he not know what Authority and Loyalty has done for us human history? Forget the mass genocides, and mass cult suicides, he should at least be aware of the classical psychology experiments like the Stanford Prison experiment, the Robber's cave experiment, and the Milgram experiment.. But no, the author gives the same value to Authority that he gives to Care. This is not a simple side argument, this is his main thesis. He derives everything else he says in the book from this comparison. And obviously, as we say in the scientific community; garbage in, garbage out. 3.) The author's epiphany comes from his visit to India, where he associated conservatism with likeable people. He probably didn't stay long enough to see the dark side of the culture. Unlike the author, I was born in the East. And I can tell you first hand that the morals which seem to paint a pretty picture of eastern culture, is just a pretty picture - nothing more, nothing less. Hiding behind that pretty picture is a culture of corruption, a culture where shame and guilt are the driving forces of society and a culture where an individual is judged by his/her group (race, creed, school, hometown etc). A culture where you must bow down to someone just because they are older than you, or are in a higher paygrade than you.I understand there are problems with the current individualist culture in the West. But believe me, the East is not the solution. Far from it, it's a backward step in human progression. The solutions to the problems of the West should come from the minds that have already evolved passed the hive-mind. Having said all that, the book is a good read. It's written beautifully with a style commonly found in most best selling non-fiction books these days. It get's you thinking, even if it's in the wrong direction. And it does point towards why there's a rift between left-wing and right-wing American political groups. I agree with the author that a lot of left-wing supporters just go with the tide and need to realize where the right-wing groups are coming from. What I don't agree is placing the philosophical ideal of conservatism on the same ground as the philosophical ideal of progressivism. "
3,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,5,"I was hopeful this book might provide me with some sociological tools and rhetorical tricks to clear away the views of those who disagree with my positions on politics and religion. Of course this book does not deliver on this unrealistic hope. What the book does provide instead is an explanation why not everybody agrees with my definition of morality. This knowledge does not make disagreements go away, so the best I can hope for after reading this book is to comprehend the intuitive motivations of both myself and others, and then comprehend why those motivations can lead to morals that steer reasoning to opposite conclusions.The author, Jonathan Haidt, is a psychologist who has specialized on the nature of morals. This book could have been more accurately titled ""The Moral Mind."" The book is divided into three parts. The main point of the first part is what Haidt calls the first principle of moral psychology: Intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second. The second part of the book explores the second principle of moral psychology: There's more to morality than harm and fairness. The third part presented the principle that morality binds and blinds.Part One This author weaves together a history of moral psychology and the author’s own story to create a sense of movement from rationalism to intuitionism. The author throws in historical anecdotes, quotations from the ancients, and praise of a few visionaries. The author then set up metaphors (such as the rider and the elephant) that recur throughout the book. He then discusses the evidence to “tune up” the reader’s intuitions about moral psychology.The message here is that value judgments are seldom products of rational deliberation. We are hardwired by evolution to function first with our emotional brain at an intuitive level, and what follows may claim to be rational reasoning that explains our judgment but is actually rationalization of quick intuitive decisions. The inherited human brain is also social in nature and must exhibit behavior that is compliant with a person’s social environment (i.e. group or tribe). This explains why people don’t necessarily vote for their own self interests. Instead they vote in compliance with the values and belief system of the group they most closely associate with. Part TwoThe main point of this section of the book is that conservatives base their morality on six types of considerations or value judgments: care/harm, liberty/oppression, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, and sanctity/degradation. Liberals base their morality on three areas: care/harm, liberty/oppression, and fairness/cheating. Haidt says this gives conservatives an advantage when campaigning for votes because they can appeal to their supporters in six ways and liberals can appeal to only three. Part ThreeHaidt in this section drives home the point that the tendency for humans to form morals has been ingrained into humans by evolution. Humans are products of multilevel selection, which made us both selfish and groupish. Haidt describes it as being 90 percent chimp and 10 percent bee. He suggests that religion played a crucial role in our evolutionary history--our religious minds co-evolved with our religious practices to create ever larger moral communities, particularly after the advent of agriculture. Quotations of Interest to MeI was surprised to learn from the following quotation that conservatives understand liberals better than liberals understand conservatives. After the following quotation in the book Haidt explains the reasons for the lack of understanding on the part of liberals.""In a study I did with Jesse Graham and Brian Nosek, we tested how well liberals and conservatives could understand each other. We asked more than two thousand American visitors to fill out the moral Foundations Questionnaire. One-third of the time they were asked to fill it out normally, answering as themselves. One-third of the time they were asked to fill it out as they think a ""typical liberal"" would respond. One-third of the time they were asked to fill it out as a ""typical conservative"" would respond. This design allowed us to examine the stereotypes that each side held about the other. More important, it allowed us to asses how accurate they were by comparing people's expectations about ""typical"" partisans to the actual responses from partisans of the left and the right. Who was best able to pretend to be the other?The results were clear and consistent. Moderates and conservatives were most accurate in their predictions, whether they were pretending to be liberals or conservatives. Liberals were the least accurate, especially those who described themselves as ""very liberal."" The biggest errors in the whole study came when liberals answered the Care and Fairness questions while pretending to be conservatives. When faced with questions such as ""One of the worst things a person could do is hurt a defenseless animal"" or Justice is the most important requirement for a society,"" liberals assumed that conservatives would disagree.""The following quotation is not really part of the main focus of this book, but I found it interesting because it illuminates an irony about many Christians who emphasize ""correct belief"" (i.e. orthodoxy) whereas modern polling shows ""correct belief"" not to be a reliable predictor of neighborliness and good citizenship. Haidt is quoting from Putnam and Campbell's 2010 book, American Grace: How Religion Divides and Unites Us.""Why are religious people better neighbors and citizens? To find out, Putnam and Campbell included on one of their surveys a long list of questions about religious beliefs (e.g., ""Do you believe in hell? Do you agree that we will all be called before God to answer for our sins?"") as well as questions about religious practices (e.g., ""How often do you read holy scriptures? How often do you pray?) These beliefs and practices turned out to matter very little. Whether you believe in hell, whether you pray daily, whether you are a Catholic, Protestant, Jew, or Mormon ... none of these things correlated with generosity. The only thing that was reliable and powerfully associated with the moral benefits of religion was how enmeshed people were in relationships with their co-religionists.It's the friendships and groups activities, carried out within a moral matrix that emphasizes selflessness. That's what brings out the best in people.Putnam and Campbell reject the New Atheist emphasis on belief and reach a conclusion straight out of Durkheim: ""It is religious belongingness that matters for neighborliness, not religious believing."" The following is Haidt's definition of moral systems:""Moral systems are interlocking sets of values, virtues, norms, practices, identities, institutions, technology, and evolved psychological mechanisms that work together to oppress or regulate self interest and make cooperative societies possible""This definition makes morals dependent on the social environment. There is no one single definition of morality that is true in all cultures.Some Links of InterestThe following links came from the Book's Website.Here is a pdf file of Chapter 9, the chapter on multi-level selection.Here is a pdf file with all figures and images from all chaptersHere is a pdf file will all of the references (the bibliography)Here is a pdf file with all of the end notesYou can read the introduction to the book here, and you can read a condensed version of Ch. 12 (on politics and polarization) at Reason Magazine.Here is a summary/outline of the book, with interesting comments and links, from Jan C.

Unfortunately, it’s much harder to ignore the antagonism of the larger political sphere. At the heart of our irritation and often outrage toward other people’s belief systems is a lack of understanding. In this cogent, thought provoking book, Jonathan Haidt not only explains the psychological and moral bases of various belief systems, but he also goes on to propose viable bridges among them. It’s heartening to imagine that the national discourse could one day learn from his example.
The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion,
 by Jonathan Haidt (Pantheon, 2012)"
4,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,2,"For a long time now I have been coming to the conclusion that if one is to believe capitalism is essentially a meritocracy - and if one is also to acknowledge that the inequities of capitalist societies mean that social mobility (particularly in the United States, for instance) is virtually non-existent, then one also needs some way of explaining how something that looks like it is without merit actually is the embodiment of merit.And often this is where 'biology' comes to the rescue. Genes have, for over a century, provided a way to explain complex social inequalities and to make the victims responsible for their victimhood. This book fits within that long tradition.Now, a key scientific idea that should guide such investigations is Occam's Razor - that is, any explanation ought to start with the fewest number of assumptions and then only add entities (such as genes, say) when it was shown categorically that they are necessary to explain facts that can't be explained in any other way. That is, if you were trying to explain human behaviour in society, for instance, you might pause before talking about genes, if for no other reason than that they add a level of complexity to your answer that you might well be able to do without.The part of this book that particularly stopped me was this quote about research he conducted in both the US and Brazil.""Unexpectedly, the effect of social class was much larger than the effect of city. In other words, well-educated people in all three cities were more similar to each other than they were to their lower-class neighbors.""You might think that after reaching this finding he would consider the role that social class plays in forming moral reasoning, that he might look more closely at why people from lower social classes might find it attractive to believe in a wider range of moral imperatives than do those from the educated middle classes and see what benefits this provides working class people. But that is almost the last time he mentions social class at all, other than to point out about 100 pages later, that working class people are likely to vote Republican and against their own economic interests because they are voting in line with their moral interests. Yes, undoubtedly the case - but why is that so? Why is that related to social class? Why are the working class most likely to vote against their economic interests? You see, I can't accept the bio-babble that certain genes have shuffled their way down to the bottom rungs of society and that makes these people more authoritarian and more religious and so therefore more likely to vote Republican. The other thing that simply isn't explained here is why society has changed so comprehensively in the last 30 years. You know, after WW2 the Keynesian consensus was so well entrenched that even Milton Friedman is quoted as saying, ""We are all Keynesians now"". And yet, today that might as well have been a million years ago. Today greed is good and dogs eat dogs - there is a universal war on the welfare state - if this is down to genes and innate moral feelings, they really must evolve very, very quickly - even faster than the 50,000 years talked about so extensively in this book.Another alternative might be to look at how social structures impact on moral feeling and behaviour. This would have the benefit of operating at the same level as the phenomena that is trying to be explained. Who benefits from the existing arrangement of society, what tools do they have at their disposal to justify that arrangement, how might the ideas that have become increasingly accepted by various groups in society over the last few decades (something the author himself acknowledges by saying how much more partisan the US has become over that time) help us understand these shifting preferences?To me, one of the major shifts in society that has run concurrent with this shift towards more partisanship and heightened conservative feelings of the working classes, has been the vastly increased inequity in society. Rather than turn to genes to explain this, I would look to what Bourdieu refers to as symbolic violence. If one section of society is to have more than another section then it can only sustain this in one of two ways - it can either use literal violence (something that has happened extensively throughout history and remains ultimately the reason for a police force and a state) or it can use symbolic violence - that is, make it clear to everyone that the reason why the goods of society are unequally divided is because some people have more natural ability and have applied more effort (that is, have more merit) and therefore they deserve more of the good things.This book is full of psychological examples presented to prove certain points along the way. The one I will use to explain my point about the power of merit in justifying inequality is a game they get students to play in psychology classes. They have two players and one of them is given $10 and told they can divide that amount anyway they see fit between themselves and the person they are with. The catch is that the other person can reject the offered division and then neither of them will get anything. A neoliberal economist would say that even if the division is $9.99 to $0.01 the second person should accept the offer since they are better off with one cent than without it. And yet, this isn't how the game pans out. People punish those who offer them less than what they think of as a fair division - say 60:40 - and often the first person will offer 50:50. But this is an odd version of the game - a kind of null case. The money in this game has appeared out of thin air and so the first person's claim to it is viewed as having been purely a thing of luck. As soon as there is any suggesting that the first person might have 'deserved' the money, then the dynamic between the players changes immediately. Then the second person expects much less of the goods, and would feel outraged if they were offered a 50:50 split. Now they actively want the other person to have their 'fair share' of the reward - that is, most of it.So, when Trump says, ""My father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars."" This isn't just a man blowing his own trumpet, or even him just twisting the truth for his own aggrandisement, it is, in fact, virtually a necessity in modern day social discourse. You have to be 'self-made' or the moral justification for your having so much is undermined by your lack of merit - according to the rules that govern our society as a meritocracy, you have to be able to show natural ability coupled with hard work as the basis for your wealth, and invariably, no matter what advantages people start out with, that is the story they tell. I think work by people like Jean Anyon into how different social classes are educated and the levels of authoritarianism that are manifest in those different educational experiences, or bell hooks' work on how African Americans learn to operate in a system of dual consciousness coupled with a kind of self-loathing that perpetuates white supremacist modes of oppression upon black bodies, or Goffman's work on the presentation of self in society, or Bourdieu's on how social classes manifest distinction and thereby social cohesion - similar to the findings related here back to Durkheim, although without the bio-babble - provide much more compelling and interesting visions of social phenomena since they are explained is social terms, not biological ones. And as I implied at the beginning of this review, I've never liked supposed biological explanations for complex social phenomena and I immediately bristle when they are presented as the simplest explanation for the state of society. Occam's Razor should immediately demand their removal until they can be shown to be not just 'helpful' but necessary to explaining those phenomena. I don't believe that has been done here. "
5,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1711431-eric-w,5,"""This book is about why it’s so hard for us to get along. We are indeed all stuck here for a while, so let’s at least do what we can to understand why we are so easily divided into hostile groups, . . Politics and religion are both expressions of our underlying moral psychology, and an understanding of that psychology can help to bring people together. My goal in this book is to drain some of the heat, anger, and divisiveness out of these topics and replace them with awe, wonder, and curiosity. We are downright lucky that we evolved this complex moral psychology that allowed our species to burst out of the forests and savannas and into the delights, comforts, and extraordinary peacefulness of modern societies in just a few thousand years. . . I want to show you that an obsession with righteousness (leading inevitably to self-righteousness) is the normal human condition. It is a feature of our evolutionary design, not a bug or error that crept into minds that would otherwise be objective and rational.""I hardly feel qualified to make any kind of judgments on this book having little background in philosophy, especially moral philosophy, so I especially appreciate Haidt's lucid summary of the development of moral philosophy through examples and hypotheticals.I remember several years ago having a visit from the local anti-abortion denizens, nice people, very concerned about youth, etc. They steered the conversation to abortion, their favorite topic. Being of a liberal and hopefully rational and reasoned mindset myself, I described a book I had recently read,The Facts of Life: Science and the Abortion Controversy by Harold J. Morowitz, James Trefil, a small, excellent analysis of the abortion debate that contains a plea for looking at the issue rationally. I described their suggestion that we need to decide what constitutes ""human"" and then see when the fetus acquires the capability (cerebral cortex) to be human, etc. etc. To which the response was, ""well, I don't believe that."" All debate and discussions ceases when that statement arrives. Now, I could have said, well, you old biddy, I don't give a fuck what you believe, I'm trying to find some common ground here."" But, my mother having raised me as a good little boy who is always polite to old people, I merely sat there rather stunned. That's the problem. How do you create a discussion of issues when either side can just say, well, I don't believe that.This is not just a conservative or right-wing problem. Try having a rational or reasonable discussion about the merits of circumcision, climate. autism, raw milk or veganism. I guarantee the true believers will immediately assemble with truckloads of vitriol. We all suffer from what Haidt calls ""confirmation bias,"" that is, our gut tells us what to believe first and then we seek out justifications for that belief.Haidt's book reaffirms what has become fairly obvious: we divide ourselves into tribes and those tribes consist of like-minded people which we use to validate our intuitive predispositions. His stated goal is to attempt to find a way to bridge the divide between two different moral world views., and to find a way for each side to at least understand the other's perspective.Both left and right are motivated by the moral foundations of care, fairness, liberty, loyalty, authority and sanctity. But they differ qualitatively: liberals tend to care more about suffering and violence; conservatives care about harm done to others but not as intensely. Conservatives, on the other hand, place more emphasis on fairness, i.e. getting what you deserve. Both sides value liberty but have differing definition as to what constitutes the oppressor. Similarly, with fairness, each side values it but define it differently: liberals view it from the standpoint of equality while conservatives look to proportionality, i.e. fairness is being rewarded for your accomplishments and if you work harder you should be rewarded proportionally. The biggest divisions relate to sanctity, authority and loyalty. You can easily guess where the preferences of conservatives and liberals lie. Haidt suggests that liberals will fail to gain wider acceptance until they come to terms with those three moral values and find someway to create their own vocabulary validating them. I would add that liberals will have to be more accepting of groups, particularly religious ones (as much as I despise them,) which serve an evolutionary need to discount selfishness and promote group adherence and benefits.To some extent that's why I am so puzzled by the right's celebration of Ayn Rand who promoted the antithesis of group-think by celebrating independence and selfishness, i.e. think of yourself first and what benefits accrue to yourself through your actions. She hated coercion both governmental and religious, in particular, yet both encourage group adherence and loyalty.I just wonder how much of what Haidt says come from his intuitive side (the elephant) and how much from the rational or reasoning part (the rider.)Here's a quote that struck me: ""And why do so many Westerners, even secular ones, continue to see choices about food and sex as being heavily loaded with moral significance? Liberals sometimes say that religious conservatives are sexual prudes for whom anything other than missionary-position intercourse within marriage is a sin. But conservatives can just as well make fun of liberal struggles to choose a balanced breakfast—balanced among moral concerns about free-range eggs, fair-trade coffee, naturalness, and a variety of toxins, some of which (such as genetically modified corn and soybeans) pose a greater threat spiritually than biologically."" "
6,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz,4,"I expected this book to be good, but I did not expect it to be so rich in ideas and dense with information. Haidt covers far more territory than the subtitle of the book implies. Not only is he attempting to explain why people are morally tribal, but also the way morality works in the human brain, the evolutionary origins of moral feelings, the role of moral psychology in the history of civilization, the origin and function of religion, and how we can apply all this information to the modern political situation—among much else along the way.Haidt begins with the roles of intuition and reasoning in making moral judgments. He contends that our moral reasoning—the reasons we aver for our moral judgments—consists of mere post hoc rationalizations for our moral intuitions. We intuitively condemn or praise an action, and then search for reasons to justify our intuitive reaction. He bases his argument on the results of experiments in which the subjects were told a story—usually involving a taboo violation of some kind, such as incest—and then asked whether the story involved any moral breach or not. These stories were carefully crafted so as not to involve harm to anyone (such as a brother and sister having sex in a lonely cabin and never telling anyone, and using contraception to prevent the risk of pregnancy).  Almost inevitably he found the same result: people would condemn the action, but then struggle to find coherent reasons to do so. To use Haidt’s metaphor, our intuition is like a client in a court case, and our reasoning is the lawyer: its job is to win the case for intuition, not to find the truth.  This is hardly a new idea. Haidt’s position was summed up several hundred years before he was born, by Benjamin Franklin: “So convenient a thing it is to be a reasonable creature, since it enables one to find or make a reason for everything one has a mind to do.” An intuitionist view of morality was also put forward by David Hume and Adam Smith. But Haidt’s account is novel for the evolutionary logic behind his argument and the empirical research used to back his claims. This is exemplified in his work on moral axes. Our moral intuition is not one unified axis from right to wrong. There are, rather, six independent axes: harm, proportionality, equality, loyalty, authority, and purity. In other words, actions can be condemned for a variety of reasons: for harming others, for cheating others, for oppressing others, for betraying one’s group, for disrespecting authority, and for desecrating sacred objects, beings, or places.  These axes of morality arose because of evolutionary pressure. Humans who cared for their offspring and their families survived better, as did humans who had a greater sensitivity to being cheated by freeloaders (proportionality) and who resisted abusive alpha males trying to exploit them (equality). Similarly, humans who were loyal to their group and who respected a power hierarchy outperformed less loyal and less compliant humans, because they created more coherent groups (this explanation relies on group selection theory; see below). And lastly, our sense of purity and desecration—usually linked to religious and superstitious notions—arose out of our drive to avoid physical contamination (for example, pork was morally prohibited because it was unsafe to eat).  Most people in the world use all six of these axes in their moral systems. It is only in the West—particularly in the leftist West—where we focus mainly on the first three: harm, proportionality, and equality. Indeed, one of Haidt’s most interesting points is that the right tends to be more successful in elections because it appeals to a broader moral palate: it appeals to more “moral receptors” in the brain than left-wing morality (which primarily appeals to the axis of help and harm), and is thus more persuasive.  This brings us to Part III of the book, by far the most speculative.  Haidt begins with a defense of group selection: the theory that evolution can operate on the level of groups competing against one another, rather than on individuals. This may sound innocuous, but it is actually a highly controversial topic in biology, as Haidt himself acknowledges. Haidt thinks that group selection is needed to explain the “groupishness” displayed by humans—our ability to put aside personal interest in favor of our groups—and makes a case for the possibility of group selection occurring during the last 10,000 or so years of our history. He makes the theory seem plausible (to a layperson like me), but I think the topic is too complex to be covered in one short chapter. True or not, Haidt uses the theory of group theory to account for what he calls “hiveish” behavior that humans sometimes display. Why are soldiers willing to sacrifice themselves for their brethren? Why do people like to take ecstasy and rave? Why do we waste so much money and energy going to football games and cheering for our teams? All these behaviors are bizarre when you see humans as fundamentally self-seeking; they only make sense, Haidt argues, if humans possess the ability to transcend their usual self-seeking perspective and identify themselves fully with a group. Activating this self-transcendence requires special circumstances, and it cannot be activated indefinitely; but it produces powerful effects that can permanently alter a person’s perspective. Haidt then uses group selection and this idea of a “hive-switch” to explain religion. Religions are not ultimately about beliefs, he says, even though religions necessarily involve supernatural beliefs of some kind. Rather, the social functions of religions are primarily to bind groups together. This conclusion is straight out of Durkheim. Haidt’s innovation (well, the credit should probably go to David Sloan Wilson, who wrote Darwin's Cathedral) is to combine Durkheim’s social explanation of religion with a group-selection theory and a plausible evolutionary story (too long to relate here).  As for empirical support, Haidt cites a historical study of communes, which found that religious communes survived much longer than their secular counterparts, thus suggesting that religions substantially contribute to social cohesion and stability. He also cites several studies showing that religious people tend to be more altruistic and generous than their atheistic peers; and this is apparently unaffected by creed or dogma, depending only on attendance rates of religious services. Indeed, for someone who describes himself as an atheist, Haidt is remarkably positive on the subject of religion; he sees religions as valuable institutions that promote the moral level and stability of a society. The book ends with a proposed explanation of the political spectrum—people genetically predisposed to derive pleasure from novelty and to be less sensitive to threats become left-wing, and vice versa (the existence of libertarians isn’t explained, and perhaps can’t be)—and finally with an application of the book’s theses to the political arena.  Since we are predisposed to be “groupish” (to display strong loyalty towards our own group) and to be terrible at questioning our own beliefs (since our intuitions direct our reasoning), we should expect to be blind to the arguments of our political adversaries and to regard them as evil. But the reality, Haidt argues, is that each side possesses a valuable perspective, and we need to have civil debate in order to reach reasonable compromises. Pretty thrilling stuff. Well, there is my summary of the book. As you can see, for such a short book, written for a popular audience, The Righteous Mind is impressively vast in scope. Haidt must come to grips with philosophy, politics, sociology, anthropology, psychology, biology, history—from Hume, to Darwin, to Durkheim—incorporating mountains of empirical evidence and several distinct intellectual traditions into one coherent, readable whole. I was constantly impressed by the performance. But for all that, I had the constant, nagging feeling that Haidt was intentionally playing the devil’s advocate.Haidt argues that our moral intuition guides our moral reasoning, in a book that rationally explores our moral judgments and aims to convince its readers through reason. The very existence of his book undermines his uni-directional model of intuitions to reasoning. Being reasonable is not easy; but we can take steps to approach arguments more rationally. One of these steps is to summarize another person’s argument before critiquing it, which is what I've done in this review. He argues that religions are not primarily about beliefs but about group fitness; but his evolutionary explanation of religion would be rejected by those who deny evolution on religious grounds; and even if specific beliefs don’t influence altruistic behavior, they certainly do influence which groups (homosexuals, biologists) are shunned. Haidt also argues that religions are valuable because of their ability to promote group cohesion; but if religions necessarily involve irrational beliefs, as Haidt admits, is it really wise to base a moral order on religious notions? If religions contribute to the social order by encouraging people to sacrifice their best interest for illogical reasons—such as in the commune example—should they really be praised?The internal tension continues. Haidt argues that conservatives have an advantage in elections because they appeal to a broader moral palate, not just care and harm; and he argues that conservatives are valuable because their broad morality makes them more sensitive to disturbances of the social order. Religious conservative groups, which enforce loyalty and obedience, are more cohesive and durable than secular groups that value tolerance. But Haidt himself endorses utilitarianism (based solely on the harm axis) and ends the book with a plea for moral tolerance. Again, the existence of Haidt's book presupposes secular tolerance, which makes his stance confusing.Haidt’s arguments with regard to broad morality come dangerously close to the so-called ‘naturalistic fallacy’: equating what is natural with what is good. He compares moral axes to taste receptors; a morality that appeals to only one axis will be unsuccessful, just like a cuisine that appeals to only one taste receptor will fail to satisfy. But this analogy leads directly to a counter-point: we know that we have evolved to love sugar and salt, but this preference is no longer adaptive, indeed it is unhealthy; and it is equally possible that our moral environment has changed so much that our moral senses are no longer adaptive.In any case, I think that Haidt’s conclusions about leftist morality are incorrect. Haidt asserts that progressive morality rests primarily on the axis of care and harm, and that loyalty, authority, and purity are actively rejected by liberals (“liberals” in the American sense, as leftist). But this is implausible. Liberals can be extremely preoccupied with loyalty—just ask any Bernie Sanders supporter. The difference is not that liberals don’t care about loyalty, but that they tend to be loyal to different types of groups—parties, demographics, and ideologies rather than countries. And the psychology of purity and desecration is undoubtedly involved in the left’s concern with racism, sexism, homophobia, or privilege (accusing someone of speaking from privilege creates a moral taint as severe as advocating sodomy does in other circles).I think Haidt’s conclusion is rather an artifact of the types of questions that he asks in his surveys to measure loyalty and purity. Saying the pledge of allegiance and going to church are not the only manifestations of these impulses.For my part, I think the main difference between left-wing and right-wing morality is the attitude towards authority: leftists are skeptical of authority, while conservatives are skeptical of equality. This is hardly a new conclusion; but it does contradict Haidt’s argument that conservatives think of morality more broadly. And considering that a more secular and tolerant morality has steadily increased in popularity over the last 300 years, it seems prima facie implausible to argue that this way of thinking is intrinsically unappealing to the human brain. If we want to explain why Republicans win so many elections, I think we cannot do it using psychology alone.The internal tensions of this book can make it frustrating to read, even if it is consistently fascinating. It seems that Haidt had a definite political purpose in writing the book, aiming to make liberals more open to conservative arguments; but in de-emphasizing so completely the value of reason and truth—in moral judgments, in politics, and in religion—he gets twisted into contradictions and risks undermining his entire project. Be that as it may, I think his research is extremely valuable. Like him, I think it is vital that we understand how morality works socially and psychologically. What is natural is not necessarily what is right; but in order to achieve what is right, it helps to know what we’re working with."

Morality binds and blinds.” ― Jonathan Haidt, The Righteous MindJonathan Haidt give a nice social science explanation for how we align politically and how we are built to disagree. This is one of those books that seems to fit in the same evolutionary psychology space as Bob Wright's The Moral Animal. It is a combination of ethnography + evolutionary psychology + experimental psychology.In 'The Righteous Mind', Haidt isn't seeking simply to explain why some people vote Left and others vote Right, or why some people believe in God A and other believe in God B. Haidt's bigger purpose is to explain how we are all hardwired to use reason NOT to MAKE our moral decisions/choices, but rather to use reason to BUTTRESS the choices (about God, politics, etc) that we've already made.While I think his approach is a bit too simplistic, I still use his Moral Foundations Theory to explain why my father and I might have some overlap in values but different political views. I like the whole matrix of:1. Care/harm: cherishing and protecting others.2. Fairness/cheating: rendering justice according to shared rules. (Alternate name: Proportionality)3. Liberty/oppression: the loathing of tyranny.4. Loyalty/betrayal: standing with your group, family, nation. (Alternate name: Ingroup)5. Authority/subversion: obeying tradition and legitimate authority. (Alternate name: Respect.)6. Sanctity/degradation: abhorrence for disgusting things, foods, actions. (Alternate name: Purity.)Do I agree that liberals rank certain of these values higher than conservatives? Yes.Do I agree that conservatives might value some of these foundational values more than liberals? Yes.Do I agree that this list is the end-all, be-all of our Moral compass? No. I think this is a good beginning. It is another social science draft that gives another way to look at how we think, how our thinking has evolved, and how we interact with each other. Any theory involving the human brain is bound to be a bit of a game in the dark. I think there are answers and many of the answers are compelling, but not all answers will be final or correct. Look, there were certain parts of this book that just felt right, so I will spend a bit of time building a rational reason why it feels right and then post that reason on Goodreads."

Calling his subject moral psychology he pretends to offer us universal truths when, in fact, he is dealing only with parochial matters; currently fashionable political concerns in the U.S. As if he discovered it, he dwells repeatedly on the well recognized phenomenon that opinions are rarely reached through reason but rather the reverse; once held, reasons are found to justify and defend opinions. In the matter of moral prejudices emotion governs reason. More accurately, it governs rationalization rather than reason. The author confuses the two. But, since emotions dominate, he concludes - as many before him did - that to change opinion you must make your appeal emotionally; giving credence to the moral standing of opposing opinion. To change opinion you must perceive and appreciate the moral stance behind opposing opinion. Good advice but hardly original. To demonize your opponent cannot bring about peace and compromise. For political liberals that means recognizing that conservatives are not without morality. To unveil conservative morality he parces morals into five, later morphing into six, categories. This strikes me as a scheme as good as any other. I can imagine parsing it otherwise, though. As to his demonstrating his thesis with graphs I am highly suspicious of his results. No error bars are given. No details on the data. Nor on the randomness of his sampling nor even does he list the questions he used. (He does mention some of them.) Considering that close to a third of his 420 pages is devoted to addenda - mostly chapter notes - a few details of his investigations could have been included. Such a mountain of notes often reveals, not scholarship, but rather a desire to impress untutored readers. So I discount his research. The essential thing that it does is to grant morality to conservative thinking. A good gesture towards peaceful accord.There. I've spared you the pain of reading 318 confused and poorly written pages with over 100 of addenda. Lucky you."
9,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,1,"At first I gave this book 3 stars because I felt like I might have been too critical. After thinking about it a while, I decided I was not merely critical enough. This book should be renamed ""How to Justify the Action of Oppressing Human Beings In the Name of Getting Along."" You can take any of Haidt's current examples of what to him ""seems"" like an oppressive act, as he assures you there is some merit to the thinking of oppressive individuals, and replace it with any of the most embarrassing atrocities committed by human being in our past. You will find that his explanations of, ""They meant well"" and ""What they were really trying to do was (insert good intention which requires the exploitation or subjugation of other human beings not in the ingroup),"" could apply to the absolute worst atrocities of the past. So, if you are interested in finding a middle ground at the expense of the most vulnerable members of our society, this book will make you feel great. If you choose to read it, you will be treated to the tired old argument that suggests that if someone gives to charity (btw Haidt- that would be a charitable act toward only those people they find acceptable) they must be a better human being than someone else who does not donate money or time to a designated ""charity"" but instead marches in the streets or takes other time consuming action that result in SOCIAL CHANGE for the groups who needed it most. This book was disappointing on so many levels for me. I love the studies he talked about. I was sure I was going to love the book before I even turned to page one. But each turn of the page demonstrated how easy it is for some to use ""science"" as a means to help people justify the continuation of horrible behavior that has been going on for far too long. I am shocked at the good ratings this book received. "
10,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david,4,"Despite some painful infelicities of style, this book is compelling and generally well-argued. Two aspects irritated me -- I thought several of the author's chosen analogies were dreadful -- clunky and not particularly apt. The silliness of the metaphor that humans are Homo Duplex -- ""90% chimp, 10% bee"" -- is just so jarring that it distracts the reader from the argument. Similarly, I found his other recurrent metaphor, that for our rational and intuitive mental processes -- ""The mind is divided like a rider on an elephant, and the rider's job is to serve the elephant"" -- to be severely deficient. And the less said about the unfortunate phrase ""taste buds of the righteous mind"" the better. Not to mention crimes against the language like ""groupishness"", ""Durkheimogens"", or the ""hive switch"".However, though I did find these stylistic tics annoying, in the end they are minor flaws in a book which was fascinating, highly readable, and thought-provoking. I found it considerably more interesting than I did ""The Happiness Hypothesis"". The first third of the book, about the origins and dimensions of moral intuition, is very much the author's home turf, and he writes about it lucidly and authoritatively. The second section, which attempts to explain the development of human moral sense in evolutionary terms, was not fully convincing (to me). But it was thought-provoking and well-written -- the arguments are laid out clearly, so the reader can judge them on their merits. On the topic of religion, Haidt's arguments are considerably more interesting, and expressed with far greater civility, than the shrill invective doled out by the anti-God group of Dawkins, Dennett, and Harris.The last couple of chapters in the book, in which the author examines the polarization and loss of civility that has crept in to American political life in the last decades, are fascinating. In particular, his explanation for the difference in moral priorities between liberals and conservatives rings true. Both sides battle it out, on a variety of social and political issues, each convinced they occupy the moral high ground, increasingly dismissive of their opponents. Whether or not you believe Haidt's claim that this very human trait of moral superiority is a logical result of evolutionary pressure, its potential to be destructive in the political sphere is obvious. The author (wisely) offers no magic solution to the ever-more bitter polarization of the American electorate, concluding instead with what is essentially a call to the better angels of our nature. The question posed by Rodney King, back in 1992, has never been more relevant - ""Can we all get along?"" I highly recommend this book."
11,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"This book is well-written, edited, and well-organized. Each chapter explores a concept, followed by a nice summary. The book is a mixed bag for me. Some parts are fascinating, while other parts are a bit technical and dry. But so much of it is original and fresh, that I give the book five stars.Haidt proposes six foundations of morality; care/harm, liberty/oppression, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, and sanctity/degradation. Haidt claims that liberals (Democrats) are interested in the first three of these foundations, and don't bother with the latter three. Conservatives (Republicans) care about all six of these foundations, almost equally. As a result, conservatives have a more sure footing in morality, and understand liberals better than liberals understand conservatives. Again, neither liberals nor conservatives are ""better""--but care about different things because their moral thinking is different.A few days ago I finished the book How We Decide, which describes how the emotional/intuitive mind plays the lion's share in making decisions, while the rational mind forms reasons for our decisions. Jonathan Haidt agrees with this idea, and develops a metaphor throughout his book; an elephant and a driver, in which the elephant plays the role of intuition, and the driver, symbolizing reason, tries to keep the elephant in line. I thought that the most interesting part of the book is Haidt's explanation for why people practice religion. Religion is such a universal phenomenon, that it practically begs for an explanation using adaptation through natural selection. Religion evolved--both as a biological adaptation and as a cultural meme--in order to cement the sense of belonging and trust among groups. People within these groups are more likely to care about each other, to help each other to survive, and to combat other, alien groups.Jonathan Haidt interleaves the story of his political tendencies; he started out as a pure liberal, but experiences in his life--and thinking about politics and psychology--led him toward a conservative vein. But Haidt does not say that he favors liberal or conservative thinking. What he does favor, is trying to understand other people's ways of thinking. The most important part of the book lies in the idea that one cannot hope to persuade someone to change his mind, without first understanding his way of thinking. Dale Carnegie used a quote from Henry Ford, ""If there is any one secret of success it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from their angle as well as your own."" To illustrate the point, the last page of the book has a wonderful cartoon:"
12,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,5,"There were many points as I was reading this that I had to check my assumptions and back down. Automatic groupings based on similarities tend to almost ALWAYS lead every single one of us to post hoc reasoning.What do I mean?Everyone jumps to conclusions based on their intuition. That feeling of rightness then leads us to find reasons and arguments why it is so.Unfortunately, this is proven to be the means of how almost every single one of us uses reason. Over and over, we're constantly reminded of bias, of selective reasoning, of checking our assumptions, of realizing that not only our memories but our very foundation of knowing a thing is based on a lie.And it's not like we do it on purpose. We try very hard to do the right thing all the time.Unfortunately, Haidt makes a very convincing and well-researched argument showing us how we are all led by our noses. I don't particularly like his descriptive analogies, but their meanings are solid. The breakdown? We are all led by our taste. Our moral foundations. Right from wikipedia, the first five are:Care: cherishing and protecting others; opposite of harmFairness or proportionality: rendering justice according to shared rules; opposite of cheatingLoyalty or ingroup: standing with your group, family, nation; opposite of betrayalAuthority or respect: submitting to tradition and legitimate authority; opposite of subversionSanctity or purity: abhorrence for disgusting things, foods, actions; opposite of degradationHaidt adds:Liberty, as in the opposite of oppression.This means an awful lot for our current climate. Each side claims supremacy in each of these moral bullet points but often one side will do one better than the other in certain areas.Liberals lionize Care.Liberals and Conservatives focus on different elements of Fairness. Social justice over Economics. Conservatives lionize Loyalty, while often Liberals point to the nasty effects of it. (But it is still absolutely necessary, with precautions.)Authority and Respect also come up in very different ways between the groups, too. Conservatives assume that a breakdown of Authority leads to anarchy, while Liberals (broadly) see the abuses of Authority and focus on Respect. This last is usually about equality.Sanctity is a strange one. It's the one that ties closest to religiosity on both sides. Disgust at the horrible things people do, the degradation of public institutions, the incalculable loss of life and liberty. I see a lot of outrage here and it's almost always a pure gut-punch that rarely gets post hoc reasoning. It's almost always virtue signaling for either side.And then there is Haidt's own contribution: Liberty. Usually associated with Freedom. Conservatives tie it to maintaining a moral way of life, maintaining institutions, and their economics.Liberals ask, ""Liberty for whom? Whose Freedom is maintained? Who gets left out?"" The fundamental CONCERN for liberty is the same. Each side wants liberty and freedom. But here's where it gets funky:Which side believes they are beset with impurities that must be expunged? Which side is BEING expunged?If you can point to BOTH SIDES, then you might actually be rising above bias confirmation.Of course, nowadays, party members are actively told never to converse with the opposing party. In fact, the very idea of finding common ground is usually used as a way to ostracize a party member. So what happens? An individual is forced to find their moral grounds ONLY from the party that they must maintain fealty to. And all the while, real communication breaks down. The greater similarities fall away in gross mistrust and purity signaling. This is true for both sides. The Us VS Them is now in full swing and it is almost NEVER based on facts or reason. It is tribalism. It is intuition based on previously formed moralisms that are the foundations for every decision we make.It doesn't make it right, but it does make a lot of sense. It's a good argument for bringing back a kind of religion. One that is actually based on the welfare of all its members, that break down divides between social groups, that actually provides a safe space for all kinds of people to talk.Odd, right? We can even leave deities out of it. But we must respect it. This is how we have always gotten along. Uber individualism just doesn't work. We all need people to survive.And come on -- it's TIME TO DE-ESCALATE. "
13,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4450335-brad-foley,4,"It's maybe not a stretch to say this book blew my mind, and in the best possible way. Some context: I'm a liberal far to the left of Obama, and I religiously read the New York Times and the Guardian - so I'm true blue pink. However, 30% of the country in which I live, including many well educated and erudite people hold views that I find completely incomprehensible, if not reprehensible. But, I think it's fair to say that they actually honestly believe they are right. Haidt promises to explain how this paradoxical state of affairs could be - and I think he delivers, drawing on his own extensive research, and the research of others. And at this point I think I should say, while my instincts are Far Left, I think I value evidence more than ideology; and thus this book, with it's page-after-page of experiments and results was overwhelmingly convincing to me. This isn't to say that the terrain Haidt describes won't change (and possibly change a lot over the next 20 or 30 years) but it feels like moral psychology is well on its way to being biologised (a good thing to my mind) and is approaching fully scientific status.And this is where the conundrum hits. Haidt describes the innate variation in the moral ""tastes"" of individuals in a population. These dimensions are emphatically not ad hoc entities. Much of the book (past the first fluffy chapter) is devoted to describing how Haidt and others came to construct and validate these moral ""tastes"", through extensive ongoing questionnaires and experiments. I won't spoil it, but the experimental sections were a whole lot of fun to read. Some (lefties) base moral judgments on only 2 dimensions - liberty and care. Others (most conservatives) use an additional 3 or even 4 dimensions of morality - in-group loyalty, authority, sanctity, and fairness. Others (say Libertarians) emphasize a different subset of these values (fairness and liberty). When we argue morally, many times we argue past each other, because we assume things about what is right or wrong, and take for granted some kind of shared logic. But when someone makes an argument to me that appeals to (for instance) the sacred status of the priesthood, or the divine right of kings, my response is normally incredulity. Because to my mind these things have no moral status (or even a negative moral status). Where I think the book becomes challenging, then for me personally, is that if I believe all the former (and I do) it becomes imperative to actually exercise my understanding of others' arguments. Partly, this is so that I can formulate better counterarguments. Partly, this is because (as Haidt suggests) I might find that other people see things that I miss. For instance, many rituals that I find, well stupid, and maybe harmful, serve purposes of group cohesion that I simply don't understand - to my detriment. Other rules concerning purity and sanctity likewise serve social functions that we tinker unawares with to our detriment. A good example here is probably the idea of gay marriage. I think I have come to see that the conservative horror at the idea has more grounds than I would have believed. Gay marriage isn't simply extending a right, in fairness, to a group that deserves it (though it's that, too). It really does change the whole meaning of marriage quite a lot. For most people marriage is a sacred institution. It might be that we need to argue that accepting gay marriage actually changes marriage, *as a sacred institution*, for the better. (My use of ""sacred"" here is theologically content free).This is all very interesting, but tricky. And frankly I think Haidt gives too much away sometimes. I especially took exception to his chapter on Libertarians and health care. But, I think (I hope) I do so on narrow points of economic feasibility (health care is arguably different from other commodities.) But this is the point. Hopefully if we learn to really see things from other points of view, we can be respectful, and move the dialogue to a point where we're arguing based on evidence and not mutually incompatible (and blind) biological instinct."

15,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,1,"The main selling point of the book is the controversial thesis that conservatives have a more sophisticated and complete ""moral matrix"" than liberals. Haidt says conservatives have a complete sense of taste whereas liberals can only taste sweet. This implies that liberals have a dangerously inaccurate version of reality that they are using when deciding what ideas to swallow and what to spit out. Such a bold claim should be backed up with solid proof. Haidt needs to show where the ""complete"" matrix produces better results with specific examples. But when he does try to go over real policy issues toward the end of the book, he concludes with a wishy-washy statement that everyone's right and both sides should listen to each other. OK, fine; but that isn't consistent with one side having a more complete morality than the other. So then we have to twist the words around to say that the conservatives don't have a better or more complete morality, just a different one, but that contradicts the main point of the book. I was surprised that truth/dishonesty was not somehow an important dimension of morality. Haidt is writing this as a scientist and truth is the principal moral value of science; see Bronowski: 

. But I guess it's handy to avoid discussing the immorality of lying when you're just B-S-ing.P.S.

17,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49126210-h-kon,4,"As a liberal westerner, I think it is a natural reaction to perceive hierarchical systems, ideas of loyality, and ideas of sanctity as intellectually flawed and oppressive concepts. Jonathan Haidt tells us how such reactions are generally much more intuitive than they are rational. Most rationalization is often post hoc, and is also often used as a tool to intellectualize intuitive beliefs. Therefore, it would be erroneous to assume that people of conservative views are wrong and perhaps stupid for holding their beliefs. If it is true that our views are intuitive and are often backed up through post hoc rationalization, then we could safely assume that the disparity between liberals and conservatives is often not logical, but rather entirely built on moral presuppositions. This is what Haidt describes as the moral Matrix. The moral Matrix consists of 6 values that are inherent in mankind, through evolution: care/harm, liberty/oppression, fariness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion and sanctity/degredation. Haidt concludes that liberals only show interest in the 3 first sets of values, and view the 3 latter as ""backwards"", whilst conservatives show intererst in all 6. This would explain why, through the lens of a liberal, ideas of loyalty, authority and sanctity seem so primitive. They are simply not part of our moral code, therefore, understanding the other sides' arguments, especially if you are a liberal, is nearly impossible.Haidt explains to us why both liberalism and conservatism is necessary in a functioning society, and why one cannot have a society based on one but not the other. Look at Stalinist Russia or Nazi Germany. Liberalism and conservatism functions as forces of yin and yang (chaos and order).Therefore, ideas of equality, progress, social justice and rejection of social norms, are incredibly dangerous if not governed by opposing ideas that can put order into these progressive ideas and make them function in society as best as possible. Just as conservatism, if not governed by forces of equality, progress, social justice and a rejection of social norms, can result in oppression of its people. Fundamentally, liberals are very good at noticing when a hierarchical system is being oppressive and needs change, and conservatives are very good at noticing the chaos that might arise from such forces of change. They are both necessary and often compliment eachother."
18,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,4,"From a psychological standpoint, The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion earns five stars. The book loses some of its appeal when Jonathan Haidt veers into political philosophy, however - especially when he raises the biased question ""why are religious people better neighbors and citizens?""Let me backtrack. The Righteous Mind is split into three sections. The first focuses on how intuitions come first and are followed by strategic reasoning, the second shows that there are six moral foundations (Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating, Liberty/Oppression, Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, and Sanctity/Degradation), and the third hones in on the belief that morality binds and blinds. By the end each part made sense in relation to one another and came together to pack a strong moral philosophy punch. Though the book had some dense sections - like the history and biology of moral philosophy - Haidt included interesting scenarios, research, and anecdotes to alleviate the doldrums.My favorite aspect of the book was how Haidt looked at morality in many different ways; by the end, he writes that one thing he hopes readers will take away from his book is that there is not just one form of morality that applies to everyone. While I learned about some of the subject matter in my AP Psychology class last year, I had never heard of the six moral foundations before. The 100 pages of notes at the back of the book reveals how much work he put into his research.But I didn't particularly agree with or admire how he framed conservatism as the better ideology in terms of incorporating all six moral foundations. Liberals also understand that if ""you destroy all groups and dissolve all internal structure, you destroy your moral capital."" Though he does a good job of stating that we need the opinions of both sides to form a more cohesive nation, he fails to elaborate on whether it's really possible to operate on a perfectly equal blend of every moral foundation. If we force people to obey authority and to submit to whatever is deemed sacred in that particular society, are we not therefore harming certain individuals and cheating others out of their rights? He praises religion and refutes New Atheism, but doesn't present the chaos religion can cause. What if we have a religion that operates to some extent on all six moral foundations, but endorses the extermination of Jews and prejudice against gays? Then what? Overall, I recommend The Righteous Mind for anyone searching for a thought-provoking book regarding psychology, politics, philosophy, and religion. Jonathan Haidt did a great job of remaining almost absolutely neutral, though with a book like this I can't blame him for leaning toward one side instead of the other.*review cross-posted on my blog, the quiet voice."
19,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3336310-sylvie,2,"This book has many qualities, but ultimately its negatives outweighed its positives for me. First of all, I must give poor marks to his driving metaphor of the elephant and rider. It seemed counterintuitive as an example and wasn’t helpful to me at all in illustrating or clarifying his main point (which I actually understood just fine) that “intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second.” Secondly, early on in the book Haidt tells an anecdote about his time in the field where he displays such an extraordinary amount of white male privilege that he had me suspicious about his conclusions the rest of the time. After spending some time in a male-dominated, strictly hierarchical world, Haidt began to see “the beauty in a moral code that emphasizes duty, respect for one’s elders, service to the group, and negation of the self’s desires.” Hmm, I wonder if he would have felt that way had he been a woman and unable to do his research.At first, I thought that that initial tone was why something seemed to nag at me throughout. I mean, sure, it was weird to present a theory about the six innate foundations of morality, but say that liberals only used three and conservatives six, but he’s a scientist, right? And one that was loudly trumpeting his liberal viewpoint. Yet, he never seems to fully explore how people might be interpreting the questions in his surveys or consider other ways for interpreting the three foundations that liberals are supposedly “deficient” in (loyalty, authority, sanctity). I understand there may be more to morality than harm and fairness, but he gives these additional factors equal weight and I didn’t really see the rationale why.So I guess I wasn’t really surprised when he reveals at the end of the book that at some point he became a conservative. Wow, that could have been a great illustration of his point about political divisions and understanding the other side had it not been buried in the concluding section. Instead, it just came off as intellectually dishonest and had me doubting all his research.Which is a shame because there are definitely parts of the framework that he presents that got me thinking and that I will use going forward. But I had hoped this would be more of a road map for understanding and compromising with those of opposing viewpoints and it wasn’t. You’re left sort of thinking there isn’t any hope to meet in the middle or be able to reason with people you consider to be wrong."
20,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish,5,"Ordinary people like myself occasionally glimpse pieces of truths we believe are important to explain how we live and understand the world but we never seem to get enough distance, or time, or examples to really state definitively what it is that makes us happy, or contentious, or willing to put ourselves out for another. Jonathan Haidt, fortunately, knows how to excavate the origins of our value systems, and has worked with colleagues to theorize and test what we believe and why and to discover the origins of those beliefs. I am thrilled this information is ready for us to use, allowing us to leapfrog decades of daily lived experience.Best of all, Haidt writes in a clear but casual and unstudied way so that the information is easier to absorb. He does not compress all the studies he is telling us about to the least number of syllables or conclusions, but writes as though he were speaking in a spirit of open enquiry. This is particularly important because he is examining the roots of our belief systems, those things that may lead us to diametrically opposed political points of view. At the very end he answers a question I’ve had for quite some time—about the differences and similarities between the liberal and libertarian points of view—that I have never been able to grasp.This book came out in 2012, so anyone who hasn’t had a chance to look at it is placing themselves at a disadvantage in today’s world of political discourse. Haidt freely admits that he is a liberal, and that before he published this book he wanted to put his learning as a social psychologist to use giving liberals insights into their political opponents, so that they might structure liberal arguments to appeal more broadly. He discovered something he didn't expect. He discovered that liberals can be handicapped in their presentation politically because they do not place much emphasis in their thinking on certain foundations of moral thought more commonly used by conservatives.Perhaps more importantly from my point of view, is that in his explanations Haidt shows us the way liberals can move closer to conservative viewpoints without sacrificing the essential contribution progressive thinking makes to a well-balanced society. I firmly believe that neither side on their own has all the correct answers and we need some diversity of thought to innovate at the rate we need to succeed in the future. But we will also need a level of social cohesion or hive mentality which is not available to us at the moment with all the political disagreement.In his concluding chapter, Haidt reminds us that his work shows us that “there is more to morality than harm and fairness….the righteous mind is like a tongue with six taste receptors.” Because not all of us use them all the time doesn’t mean they are not there. Those receptors can be used to construct a moral matrix which will differ with political viewpoint. Conservatives use more moral foundations than do liberals (or libertarians), including Loyalty/betrayal, Authority/subversion, and Sanctity/degradation. Both sides of the political spectrum use Care/harm, Liberty/oppression, Fairness/cheating, but to different degrees. That is to say, liberals define their morality mostly using Care/harm and Liberty/oppression rather than the other dimensions of morality, while conservatives use all six dimensions. Libertarians mostly use Liberty/oppression and Fairness/cheating and only a little of the other four dimensions. Therefore, liberals and libertarians, as you may have noticed, have many overlaps in political goals and tactics that conservatives do not share.Haidt praises early conservative thinkers (Edmund Burke, Friedrich Hayek, and Thomas Sowell among them) for expressing the importance of social capital as opposed to financial capital, physical capital, or human capital. “Social capital refers to a kind of capital that economists had largely overlooked: The social ties among individuals and the norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness that arise from those ties. When everything else is equal, a firm with more social capital will outcompete its less cohesive and less internally trusting competitors…”This just sounds right, and has been backed up by a number of observations and studies by folks looking at the issue, not from the morality standpoint, but from the competitiveness standpoint. It meshes with something that has been niggling in my mind, around notions of diversity, inclusion and exclusion, nationhood, immigration, bilingual schools. Diversity is fine, good, and necessary for a healthy and inventive society but in the end we have to come together around some basic principles and if we don’t, we have very little indeed upon which to build a nation. Language helps. Social agreement around common tasks is also necessary. I make a distinction between morality as taught in churches by organized religions and moral man, but there is some overlap. Personally I question whether indoctrination by religious groups can get us to social cohesion, but it did work for hundreds of years. The leadership of some churches has been shown to be corrupt; I think religion can work to create social capital, but on a case-by-case basis.Haidt says:  “Moral systems are interlocking sets of values, virtues, norms, practices, identities, institutions, technologies, and evolved psychological mechanisms that work together to suppress or regulate self-interest and make cooperative societies possible.”Apparently conservatives are more clued into this than are liberals, so liberals among us best take some of Haidt’s lessons to heart. We can’t all do whatever we want whenever we want wherever we want without sharing some responsibility for/to our social group. The good news is that this connectedness is one of the richest experiences we will probably have in our lifetimes.Get this book. It is packed with insights. So many I could write for weeks and not touch all it raises. But it is extraordinarily helpful in sorting through things one may have observed in one’s lifetime, but were unable to substantiate, or formulate into conclusions. Haidt and his group have created the studies, looked at the data, and come to surprising and useful conclusions about our political differences and moral man."
21,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5864678-jan-rice,4,"First of all, some people get annoyed with Jonathan Haidt. I didn't have that reaction to The Righteous Mind. I guess I got rid of it with The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom. It just seemed like he was selling something or trying to convert me to his point of view. He can rub people that way. If you have tried to read Haidt and have had that reaction, I suggest reading Thinking, Fast and Slow first. Daniel Kahneman has the ability to teach similar topics, in the field of cognitive science, that is, without raising the reader's defenses. Since I had already read Kahneman when I read Haidt for the first time, I could see similarities and keep my defenses low.It's worth doing so because this is a good book. In fact, in much the same way that there is evolution even though some people don't believe in it, this book points to some likely facts about the way the world is (i.e., the world of people and opinions and social systems) that will be the case even if you or others ""disagree.""This new book by Haidt is offering support for the view that human beings' rationality is not the ultimate pinnacle of development. He is not a rationalist. He is an evolutionary psychologist, and, as such, he thinks rationality is a relatively late development. Moreover, rationality isn't the single most reliable way we can decide what's right and wrong, at least not without a lot of hard work. In fact given its head (er--no pun intended) rationality will simply come up with justification for what the individual already wants, or wants to believe. That is an important point in a book on moral psychology. Most of the time people who think and who claim to be searching for truth are only searching for justification for what they already believe. People will only search for truth under three circumstances: (1) If, before deciding on their opinions they learn they will be accountable to an audience. (2) They don't know the audience's view(s). (3) They believe the audience is well-informed and interested in accuracy. Isn't that amazing!The upshot of Haidt's not being a rationalist is that he concludes morality originates from human nature--evolved from it, in fact. In his view, then, one cannot reason oneself into morality. Haidt gives some attention to philosophy, showing that Hume's views, for example, are those that current findings support, as opposed to Kant's rationalist views.Haidt thinks liberals (using that term the way Americans do) limit their views of morality only to issues of compassion and fairness, while the views of cultural conservatives, on the other hand, also include such values as respect for authority, group loyalty, and sanctity versus degradation. It's not that liberals don't have those other values, they just don't articulate them, and don't usually give them official value. He shows by bringing anthropology into the discussion that those other values are real. Therefore he thinks conservatives are better able to understand liberals than vice versa. A sizable reason for this book is the hope that liberals will stop looking at conservative values--and at conservatives--as deranged and sick. He has had the experience of broadening his world view and hopes others can, too. He'd like us to be able to look at ourselves. I'm afraid, though, that conservatives look at liberals as sick, too, judging from my opportunities to interact with them via social media.His book is researched-based. He doesn't just give us his views; he supports them with findings.I particularly liked learning about the speed with which evolution can occur. In breeding fox cubs, it took only nine generations for physical signs of domestication to appear--including changes in fur color! He also gave a picture of how combination genetic/cultural evolution happens with humans. We do something to change our environment, for example, raising dairy herds in cold sections of Europe, followed by the adaptive breeding of lactose tolerance in the community. He doesn't believe human evolution came to a screeching halt 50,000 years ago but that it is still happening. He explains how we interact within groups, how we evolve as individuals within groups, and gives the theory for between-group evolution. In essence when becoming civilized we domesticate ourselves, and he has some interesting things to say about that.As I sit here writing this review and also thinking about these school shootings and other gun massacres we have been troubled with, it occurs to me that it is a failure in that process of civilization. The result is ""lone wolves."""
22,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2240923-john-brown,5,"After this year's presidential election I emailed my sister, a smart, super-competent, true-blue, bleeding-heart, save the weeds and snails, liberal, who volunteered to do campaign work for Hilary Clinton in Colorado during the 2008 Democratic primaries and, of course, voted loudly for Obama.""Are you kidding me?"" I asked. ""How can anyone who doesn't have a carrot for a brain want more of the same? I don't get it. Obama? How can so many Americans be that gullible? I'm totally baffled."" And that puzzlement wasn't rhetorical. I was seriously baffled.""Are you kidding me?"" she replied. ""Mitt Romney? How could anyone vote for Mitt Romney? Talk about baffled."" Then she went on a rant listing all of Romney's supposed deeds and positions of sooper evil and stupidity. Then she questioned how anyone could support that Hitler in his Mormon clothes.Okay, she didn't say ""Hitler,"" but she did claim he was ""evil"" and ""despicable."" And when I think of evil, my first thought is always of folks like Mitt Romney.Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, leader of the Juarez drug cartel, which is responsible for hundreds of gruesome murders each year and . . . Mitt Romney. Oh, yeah. They're like brothers. In fact, wasn’t Romney’s dad born in Mexico? And, hey, one of Romney’s sons even knows Spanish. That boy wasn’t on a church mission there. No, he was making connections with the jefe!Sonia Montoya-Cadena, the one who ran a human trafficking ring in Denver exploiting young girls for sex and . . . Mitt Romney. Yeah, Romney’s just like that. If he could run slave brothels, he’d do it in a minute to make a buck. In fact, doesn't Bain Capital own a couple of slave brothels in Iceland?I wanted to unload. I was prepared to destroy her with fiery analysis of the first order.Thundering analysis.Mountain crushing logic.She was so freaking blind.Except,She never actually considered what I had to say in any of my previous emails. It never mattered how powerfully vast my brilliant logic was. She'd demonstrated wax ear time and again. All of my intellectual might couldn't even make a dent in her liberal force field. I brought blood and thunder and it always seemed to bounce off her like bullets made of styrofoam.Nevertheless! Clinton? Obama? Save the chickens?I made a comment that sent Smart Sister into DEFCON 5. Foolish me. Eventually, her liberal ire cooled and she decided to order comrade Putin to stand down and not push the big red button.Meanwhile, I started to think.I noted that if things didn't change, the Republicans wouldn't be winning the presidency any time soon. If they couldn't beat Obama when the economy was in the tank, then there really was no hope. Which meant we are going to end up like Greece, with continuing inflation (which is not only an annual pay cut on the disgustingly rich, filthy rich, and annoyingly rich, but also on the middle class, poor, destitute, and various and sundry hobos), huge debt, stupid taxes, ridiculous health care, Soviet-style redistribution, blah, blah, blah.I asked myself, like all Republicans did, what could we conservatives do differently? Follow Obama's example and improve our operations to get the vote out? Build up a conservative La Raza? Do the right thing with the children of illegals? Get someone willing to land more blows on the opposition (Romney could have decimated Obama in debates two and three, but he didn't; he totally failed to define his opponent).Maybe it was in the messaging. Maybe what we needed to do was develop something that actually changed minds.At this point a faint ding sounded in the distance in my mind. A small light bulb suddenly flipped on and illuminated a dark cubby of my mind.Hadn't I just read about studies showing how a soap opera in Mexico, a radio play in Tanzania, and sitcoms in America actually changed viewer attitudes and behaviors about literacy, HIV, and abortion? Didn't I already know about the power of concrete and vivid storytelling? Not sermon-telling, but storytelling.Why, yes. Yes, I did.Had I not witnessed the use of storytelling on U.S. television for, what, fifteen years by those wanting to build sympathy for homosexuals? (A good thing, even if I disagree with some of the gay agenda.) And the cheapening of sex by others? (A bad thing.) And the clearly conscious promotion of many other attitudes and beliefs via various media programs?I determined there was something to this.If people were going to vote for fiscal responsibility in Washington, something like this was going to have to be done. It wasn't going to happen in flame wars.About this same time I was browsing through the recent Radio West programs. I saw one called ""The Righteous Mind."" It was an interview of Jonathon Haidt about his new book The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion.Hey, wasn't that addressing my question?The program blurb states: ""Monday, our guest is the social psychologist Jonathan Haidt, whose latest book sets out to explain the root causes of the divisions in our society. At the heart of his argument is the idea that the human mind is designed to ""do"" morality. But when we separate into tribes – say political affiliations or religious denominations – we focus on different moral foundations. Haidt joins us to explain why he says we need the insights of liberals and conservatives to flourish as a nation.""I listened. And loved the program.Haidt shared a number of deliciously insightful things about how our mind works and how we choose our affiliations. He shared so many insights that I immediately requested his book at my library. The library ordered a copy for their collection. I, of course, was first in line to read it. I just finished the book.It's one of the best books I've read all year.Haidt explains why my sister and I were both baffled by people who voted for the opposition candidate. He explains how human morality works. How our reason does not lead us to make the judgments we do, but instead more often acts like a lawyer to justify our positions to others.As soon as he explained that I saw how I had done that time and time again. For example, in this election cycle I blamed Obama for the economy. In the Bill Clinton re-election I vigorously argued that the President doesn't have any effect on the economy and is lying if he takes credit for it. I'm not saying that Obama didn't do things that might have hampered the recovery, but how did I know his actions exacerbated our problems? What evidence did I really have?Haidt explains that there are six basic moral bases then points out which ones drive liberals, conservatives, and libertarians, and how we can use that knowledge to disagree more constructively.He provides strong insights into how our reason and intuitions and judgments work, the evolutionary function of our morality, and how our wiring for group affiliation affects it. I didn't agree with some of his conclusions. He sometimes takes his points too far. For example, he seems to suggest that people in cities are pre-disposed to be liberal. And that's why they live there. Um, no. That's not why they live there. They live in cities because that's where the jobs are. The agricultural revolution made sure of that, remember? In his effort to explain the smaller biological basis of our beliefs, he also downplays the larger effect our families and groups have. But despite these excesses, he shares so many fresh and exciting ideas that they don't matter. And he shares them all in such a fun and clear way that I couldn't help but stay up late a number of nights reading this book.Do you know how much I wanted to trash Obama to my sister? That Soviet-style central planner. That drunken sailor spender. That choom wagon pot head.And yet, you and I also know that will never work. I now know better why. Because of Haidt, I think I see a better way. I certainly see how I have done exactly what drives me mad about those who have drunk the opposition candidate's Kool-aide. I see that I have my own conservative force field that deflects liberal bullets (and perhaps even blinds me to the truth sometimes). And why I need to watch my reason, that cunning lawyer part of my brain.Haidt, a liberal, has given me, a conservative, a great gift. I intend to use it. If you are interested in the two taboo topics of politics or religion, if you enjoyed Malcolm Gladwell's book Blink or the Heath brother's Made to Stick, if you want to find a better way to influence than flame wars (as fun as they can sometimes be), then I think you will enjoy the wonders Haidt shares in his fine book.Don't just take my word for it. Listen to the Radio West program http://radiowest.kuer.org/post/righte... for a taste of what awaits you."
23,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,5,"Don't be put off by the title of this book (or the subtitle 'why good people are divided by politics and religion'). Although they are technically correct they don't give a full sense of the glory of what is certainly the best popular science book I have read this year, and comes easily into my top ten ever.Jonathan Haidt is a psychologist who specializes in morality. We are inundated with books about human behaviours and traits - and many of them are rather tedious - but this is a totally different beast. Not only is it a real page turner but it is full of 'Oh! Is that why?!' moments when the reader gets an explanation for some strange behaviour of human beings that they have never fully understood.I ought to say that this isn't like a book about general relativity, say, where even though there are alternative theories, the core has been vastly tried and tested over the years. What is presented here is the work of Haidt and his team and there may well be psychologists who disagree with his model in its entirety. But the great thing is that, if there are, his model explains why they do.I don't want to over-inflate the importance of this, but I felt a bit like I did as a teenager when reading Isaac Asimov's Foundation trilogy. The idea that the Foundation's mathematics could predict the way human society behaved into the future was entrancing. But, in the end, it was fiction. Reading Haidt's ideas I got a similar jolt, but based on sensible relatively simple observations. It's almost too right to be wrong.The Righteous Mind suggest that we make moral decisions intuitively and then justify them using rational argument. It presents six dimensions (care/harm, fairness/cheating, liberty/oppression, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion and sanctity/degradation) as the framework in which we make these moral decisions. And shows how the two main political wings differ in that the left almost entirely bases its thinking on the first two dimensions (with a touch of the third), while the right tends to use all six much more evenly. This apparently simple observation results in some truly impressive insights.Every politician should be forced to read this book before taking office. And everyone who believes that people from the opposite end of the political spectrum is evil, wrong and stupid should also read it. As should every wild-eyed scientific atheist who proclaims that religion is entirely bad and without redeeming features. And every fundamentalist religious supporter who believes liberals and atheists should be burned.Perhaps the most fascinating part of the book is the way that Haidt, a left wing intellectual atheist, comes to realize that his own position and views are blinkered, just as much as any right wing religious bigot. Truly brilliant.Review first published on www.popularscience.co.uk and reproduced with permission."

 before taking on Haidt's oevre. I wholeheartedly endorse the aforementioned recommendation, so do with that what you will. Excuses, excuses:I am absolutely committed to reviewing this book...at some point. 

Jonathan Haidt

 does an excellent job of using analogies to help his readers understand lofty propositions in moral philosophy. For example, he likens the five dimensions of 
moral foundations theory*
 to taste receptors on the tongue.  I was feeling clever (and in the mood for a bit of procrastination) and thought: 
""Hey Mara- maybe you should be super cool and awesome and do a quick illustration of moral foundations as tastebuds.""

""Good thinking Other Mara, your ideas are always great and never take unexpected and/or detrimental turns, let's do it!""
 Well, shock me, shock me- turns out that both Mara and Other Mara were quite rusty in their illustrator skills, and it took an inordinately long amount of time, with less than satisfying results. But, since the collective Maras wasted their time, here is our ""

25,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4252261-tom-la,5,"Wow. Wonderful, lucid, important and challenging work. In these days, when it comes to political opinions, ""You’re an idiot!” has everything necessary to be considered the ultimate representation of Internet discourse. If you care to better understand why, within yourself, people who disagree with you on politics or religion tend to be categorized as human beings with a profound intellectual disability (maybe today more than ever), this is the perfect book for you. At the very least, if you read this book you'll get a chance to understand where these ""idiots"" are coming from with their breathtakingly ""wrong"" morals and opinions. Professor Haidt is a psychologist who specializes in the study of morals. Contrary to many books I've found in this field, ""The righteous mind"" is not filled with self-evident fluff: Haidt draws from the latest research in neuroscience, genetics, social psychology, and evolutionary modeling, even if the take-home message of the book is one of the Great Truths found in most of the world’s wisdom traditions (the speck in our neighbor's eye). It begins with the realization that we are all self-righteous hypocrites. The book is divided in three main parts, and each part presents a major principle of moral psychology: 1). ""Intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second"". Central metaphor: the mind is divided like a rider on an elephant, and the rider's job (contrary to what rationalists said) is to serve the elephant. 2). ""There's more to morality than harm and fairness."" The central metaphor of these chapters is that the righteous mind is like a tongue with six taste receptors. Secular Western moralities are like cuisines that try to activate just one or two of these receptors, either concerns about harm and suffering, or concerns about fairness and injustice. But people have so many other powerful moral intuitions, such as those related to liberty, loyalty, authority, and sanctity. 3). ""Morality binds and blinds"". The central metaphor of these chapters is that human beings are 90 percent chimp and 10 percent bee. Human nature was produced by natural selection working at two levels simultaneously. Individuals compete with individuals within every group, and we are the descendants of primates who excelled at that competition. This gives us the ugly side of our nature, the one that is usually featured in books about our evolutionary origins. We are indeed selfish hypocrites so skilled at putting on a show of virtue that we fool even ourselves. But Haidt digs deeper, and shows how human nature was also shaped as groups competed with other groups. As Darwin said long ago, the most cohesive and cooperative groups generally beat the groups of selfish individualists. Darwin’s ideas about group selection fell out of favor in the 1960s, but recent discoveries are putting his ideas back into play, and Haidt tends to agree with them. We’re not always selfish hypocrites. We also have the ability, under special circumstances, to shut down our petty selves and become like cells in a larger body, or like bees in a hive, working for the good of the group. These experiences are often among the most cherished of our lives, although our hivishness can blind us to other moral concerns. Our bee-like nature facilitates altruism, heroism, war, and genocide.Once you see our righteous minds as primate minds with a hivish overlay, you get a whole new perspective on morality, politics, and religion. Our “higher nature” allows us to be profoundly altruistic, but that altruism is mostly aimed at members of our groups. Religion is (probably) an evolutionary adaptation for binding groups together and helping them to create communities with a shared morality. It is not a virus or parasite, as some scientists (the intellectually deficient “New Atheists”) have argued in recent years. People bind themselves into political teams that share moral narratives. Once they accept a particular narrative, they become blind to alternative moral worlds.Mr. Haidt describes at length the fascinating research that he and his colleagues have carried out through a website called YourMorals.org. The site asks visitors to state their political and religious preferences and then poses a range of questions meant to elicit a moral response. Participants might be asked, for example, if they agree or disagree with such statements as: ""One of the worst things a person can do is to hurt a defenseless animal""; or, ""It is more important to be a team player than to express oneself""; or, ""In the teenage years, parental advice should be heeded.""More than 150,000 subjects have provided answers, which have been categorized according to the ""moral foundations"" that Mr. Haidt and his collaborators consider the best candidates for ""universal cognitive modules"", that is, the intuitive ideas that all cultures draw upon for their ethical norms. These moral foundations fall under six broad headings: 1. care2. fairness3. liberty4. loyalty5. authority6. sanctityWhat Haidt has found is that all Americans, left, right and center, are strongly (if not equally) moved by the first three moral foundations. Both liberals and conservatives ""care"" when they see harm, but liberals care more: They are more disturbed by suffering and violence. Conservatives are more concerned with fairness, defined as getting what you deserve. And both sides champion liberty, though they have very different notions of the likeliest oppressors.However, Haidt's research points to sharp divisions only with the last three moral foundations: loyalty, authority and sanctity. As he writes, ""liberals are ambivalent about these foundations at best, whereas social conservatives embrace them."" In these moral precincts, family, country and tradition take precedence over the individual. He is also careful enough to point out the American definition of ""liberal"" vs. the European one. I think that makes his research more universally relevant. Haidt does not mean to suggest that American conservatives have gotten it right in their particular mix of the six moral foundations. But he insists that liberals will find it hard to win the confidence of a broad cross section of Americans if they cannot develop their own vocabulary of loyalty, authority and sanctity.I'm glad I found this gem of a book, thanks to the author's most recent TED talk that you can find here: https://youtu.be/D-_Az5nZBBM"
26,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2125534-matthew-ciarvella,2,"I enjoyed Haidt's approach to the psychology and if you'd asked me my opinion of the book during the early psychology chapters, I'd have said this is a four star book.But when Haidt starts going into the political philosophy of liberalism vs. conservatism, things start going downhill in a hurry. I'll agree that liberals don't respond to one of the points on his Six Foundations of Morality Theory; the Authority/Subversion scale. Okay, sure. But two of the points (Loyalty/Betrayal and Sanctity/Profanity) are so narrowly constructed that they're essentially meaningless.His basic argument is that his research shows that liberals only use 3 of the 6 foundations (Care/Harm, Liberty/Oppression, and Fairness/Cheating) while conservatives employ all six, thus giving them an ""advantage"" in understanding their opponents (as explained in the chapter ""The Conservative Advantage."")Haidt explains that it was his experience in India that caused him to open up to non-Western ideas of morality, which made him appreciate Sanctity/Profanity much more than he did as a liberal atheist.His flawed assumption, however, is that Sanctity can only be expressed by conservative sexual norms and adherence to organized religious tradition. Despite warning us over and over about the dangerous of assuming one's own morality is universal, he seems unwilling to construct Sanctity as anything other than a conservative norm. He mentions, incredibly briefly, that liberals have some notion of Sanctity as it relates to nature and the environment, but it's really the conservatives who believe that the body is sacred (through not having premarital and/or homosexual intercourse). His claim is that the liberal concern for the equality of gay people stems from the Care/Harm and Liberty/Oppression foundations and aren't constructed from notions of Sanctity. I disagree. I think that my conceptions of the Sanctity of love and the Sanctity of nature are every bit as meaningful as one's experiences attending church.Haidt's data may not support my version of Sanctity. If the questions being asked are about church and the value of conservative sexual norms, I'm Profane. But ask me about the Sanctity of lying on my back and looking at the sunlight filtering through the branches of the trees as the sun crests over the lip of a canyon and I'll tell you that I feel Sanctity as strongly as any conservative.I picked this title up because I saw it on a reading list of ""five books that will change your mind."" I really wanted it to do that. I think Haidt made a strong counter-argument against the New Atheists' argument that religion is a mental parasite. But when it comes to explaining political philosophies, Haidt doesn't just fall short. He misses the target entirely."
27,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9644323-zachary-bonelli,5,"(Originally posted at http://www.zacharybonelli.com/book-re...)Pretend for a moment that you grew up and now live in a completely different country. Let's call it Unrealia. Unrealia has two major political factions, Blarg and Frangle.Now imagine growing up. The moment you can begin to process news and literature from a social standpoint, you notice something—every time the Blargs do something, it looks pretty awesome. And every time Blarg politicans talk on television, everything they say seems to make sense. Their decisions and reasoning seem rational and morally sound.Then you hear the Frangle politicians talk. As a child you are wary. You might even see a handful of their behaviors as disgusting or distasteful.As you grow into a teenager, this effect only worsens. Other high school students begin to talk about politics, and you become incensed at some of the things your peers say. ""How can they be so stupid?"" you think. ""Can't they see what's sitting right in front of their faces? How can they possibly justify such a narrow-minded, destructive worldview?""Teenagers think (and say) a lot of stupid things. It's okay. The majority of us grow out of it. But I've met no one who experienced a vast political ideology shift since high school. Moving into adulthood, our core values tend to persist. They continue to constrain how we think and feel, and they color all of interactions with other adults. If you were to live in a real country, instead of Unrealia, you might even say those colors are red and blue, for example.It would take a major jolt to push you out of that very confortable self-filtering and see your own perceptions and biases for what they really are.The Righteous Mind was just such a jolt for me.Whichever side of the divide you find yourself on, Jonathan Haidt's book is a fascinating exploration of the human social psyche, and absolutely crucial for understanding ourselves and human culture broadly speaking.Haidt first constructs a model of human social psychology. The conventional wisdom is that our morals arise from reason. On the surface, this seems to make sense. When we sit down to analyze our values, we always invoke rationality to list our reasons for believing the things we do.Haidt reveals that in actuality, according to large swaths of sociological research, these rationalizations are largely post hoc. Put another way: the vast majority of the time, we make moral judgments within milliseconds of receiving a stimulus, and we engage our rational minds afterward, solely to find the evidence that will allow us to justify the conclusion we have already arrived at.And not just some people. Not just people in the other party. Not just people with religious affiliations. Or just people in cultures we don't like. Every human being does this.Haidt uses the metaphor of an elephant and its rider. Our internal moral response is like an elephant. It knows what it wants and it's dead set on just that. The rider is our rational mind. He is largely a lawyer or press secretary—his job is to justify all the decisions that elephant is making.Is changing the elephant hopeless? No. Given the right circumstances, the rider and external stimuli can conspire to convince the elephant to change his ways. Unfortunately, the way we talk about poltics, religion, morals and ethics (at least in my country) does not usually lend itself to such conditions.But before we can learn to talk to each other about our morals and values without driving each other crazy, we have to learn what our morals actually are, if not the rationalizations of intense thought.According to Haidt, morals and ethics actually arise from ""modules"" (clusters of neurons in our brains) that helped us develop ""intuition"" during the early stages of our evolutionary development.Early humans needed to care for their extremely vulnerable young, and so modules for alleviating pain and protecting the vulnerable developed. Early humans who cooperated with one another readily had an advantage over groups where distrust ran rampant, so modules for fairness developed. Early humans needed to avoid pathogens, so evolution started selecting for those people who had a sense of cleanliness, eventually leading to concepts of purity and sanctity.These evoluationary brain adaptations are the source of our knee-jerk moral-emotional reactions, that we then employ our logic and reasoning to justify after the fact.Now here's the really amazing part. Not all people's modules are exactly the same. For some people, certain modules pack a stronger emotional punch than others. Some people (like yours truly) will become impassioned if you talk about a care/harm issue. People like me jump the fore, ready for defense or offense, or whatever it will take to achieve care and prevent harm.For some people... meh. Such people certainly don't like harm by any means. It just doesn't excite them or stir their passions.Now fairness and apportionality, there's a module that can stir some emotions among certain individuals. Some people are incensed at the idea that other members of their community might get resources diverted to them that they didn't actually earn with hard work.Me? Meh. Don't really care. Don't get me wrong, I don't like it if someone gets something for nothing. Or by cheating. I don't want it to happen. BUT OMG HOLY CRAP. SUFFERING! WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT SUFFERING! NOW!This is just the configuration of my modules.Haidt identifies six in all: Care/Harm, Fairness/Apportionality, Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, Liberty/Oppression and Sanctity/Degradation.Most importantly for the United States, our Conservatives and Liberals and Libertarians have been growing steadily more and more divergent for the past thirty years at least.Liberals (like me) are generally obsessed with Care/Harm and Liberty/Oppression. We like Fairness/Apportionality, but we'll throw it to the curb to get more Care.One of the book's best quotes: ""Libertarians are liberals who like markets and lack bleeding hearts."" They care about Liberty/Oppression and Fairness/Apportionality and are willing to sacrifice Care in order to get either of the two.And then there are American conservatives, who Haidt analyzes as concerned roughly equally with the entire spectrum of six. But just to make life difficult, the triggers for Care/Harm, Liberty/Oppression and Fairness/Apportionality are different for conservatives than they are for liberals and libertarians.Here, laid bare, is the rosetta stone that unlocks one of the great mysteries of my life. No longer will I have to have conversations like this:Individual: ""I think we should execute more prisoners, because it will serve as a deterrent—""Me: ""HOLY FUCK! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?! ARE YOU INSANE OR JUST REALLY STUPID?""Or this:Individual: ""We're better off not having a social safety net. It will keep Cadillac-driving crack-baby mommas from stealing my tax money in the form of food stamps—""Me: ""ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND? YOU ARE MORALLY DEFICIENT. I DO NOT BELIEVE YOU HAVE HUMAN EMOTIONS. OR LIVE ON THE SAME PLANET AS I DO.""Such reactions happened because I was failing to understand the basic moral language that these individuals were using to analyze the world. Now that I've read The Righteous Mind, these conversations can take a much more nuanced and civil tone:Individual: ""I think we should execute more prisoners, because it will serve as a deterrent to other crimes.""Me: ""I can understand how establishing a strong Authority/Subversion moral foundation would be appealing in the face of such grave crimes as murder. However, there is an ethic of Care/Harm that conflicts with your proposed solution. Perhaps there is a way to address this problem that would not violate any of the six ethical foundations. What would you think of imprisoning such an offender for life with no chance of parole? I hear it's less costly than execution anyway.""Or:Individual: ""We're better off not having a social safety net. It will keep Cadillac-driving crack-baby mommas from stealing my tax money in the form of food stamps and leeching off of me and the rest of society.""Me: ""Yes, I can understand how a social program could make you feel this way. I don't particularly want someone taking money from me unfairly either. What you're saying is in alignment with a Fairness/Apportionality ethical foundation. And while that foundation doesn't excite me personally... at all, my rational mind understands how applying such an ethic can be beneficial for society. Would you perhaps be willing to talk about the configuration of possible social programs, such as food stamps, in more detail? I feel the existing program addresses the very real issues of starvation and malnurishment within our society. Perhaps we can somehow achieve that without encouraging the program's recipients to buy Cadillacs or birth crack babies?""To put this more simply, The Righteous Mind has allowed me to set my rage aside and talk about important social issues with people who hold vastly different views from me. It has given me a new tool for understanding morality and ethics, one that is vastly more useful than any available to me prior.The Righteous Mind is not likely to change your political or moral views in any way. It didn't change mind. It did something much, much better than that. It gave me a framework for understanding those viewpoints that differ from my own as real, human, and most importantly, valuable to consider."

It is the longest I’ve written because for me this was highly consequential book. When I finished, I returned here to the top and now provide a bulleted summary. (this is only about half of what I could fit, so it ends abruptly).•	The last 200 years of moral philosophy has overlooked several key foundations for morality by largely focused on Utilitarianism, the idea that what does the most good for the most individuals, is the primary foundation for morality (justice)•	Most morality (what is “best”) is intuitive, driven by genes and “tastes”, not rational. Studies bear this out clearly, the rider (brain) rationalizes post hoc what the elephant (body) does intuitively•	The underpinnings of western civilization are espoused largely by a small segment of the world’s population, those that are WEIRD (western, educated, industrial, rich and democratic)•	WEIRD people (typically more liberal politically) have trouble understanding, even are repulsed, by the clannish, ritualized practices of groups (religious, political, cultural)•	Morality is largely dictated by inborn (ie genetic) “tastes”, evolved in individuals, which are multi-faceted (Care, fairness, loyalty, authority and sanctity)•	Conservatives appeal to a broader palette of tastes whereas liberals and libertarians greatly rely on Care/Harm and Fairness/Justice, respectively. This gives conservatives a political advantage.•	Groupish behavior is evolved (Darwin had this right) as well as individual human species, and largely explains their success. Data show groups reinforce themselves and reject others.•	Humans are 90% chimpanzee (individualist, competitive with each other) and 10% bee (work together for the wellbeing of the “hive”) – we are remarkably adept to switching quickly to protect the “hive” when it is in peril. (think 9/11 and now Covid19)•	Historically groups (religions, churches, political parties, nations, states, cities, counties etc) thrive when they have common “sacred” objects – totems which cannot be challenged (think faith) which allow them to better organize (think respect for authority) and eliminate free riders (those that take and do not give, this is why “welfare moms” resonates with the far right clan)•	Conservatives understand liberals better than liberals understand conservatives – studies are clear.•	A better understanding of our political polarization requires an understanding of moral foundations (which “tastes” are appealing to one group vs another)This will be a long review, as I want to capture my learnings in an organized way before my memory drifts and only the key takeaways remain (more on that). When I saw this book and read the subtitle, I knew it was the book for me, as I have dearly loved family and friends on the far ends of the political spectrum. I desperately want to wanted to understand those on the far right. Being center left myself, I understand the far left better, for better and worse. America needs to come together before we devolve into civil unrest. Written in 2012, this was before the unexpected Trump era and this book is even more relevant as it explains how he tapped into and exploits a particular mindset. The underlying ethos is less well understood by the left. Another aspect I liked was that the author is an academic, who admits his bias, but it never seems to color his analyses, which employ the proper scientific method to social psychology, for which he has a PhD. He has many years teaching and is highly credentialed. Being a scientist myself, I was thrilled to learn just how carefully designed his studies were to avoid reaching the wrong conclusions. My PhD is in a “hard” science, biochemistry, and I must admit my bias against “softer” disciplines was unfounded. I took a course in ethics in college and learned there just how hard it is to unpack morality. Once I tried to essay on the moral failings of suicide, and I agonized over that, finally concluding the body itself tries to not die – my evidence of a natural cause for morality (that was the best I could do). This book is a real landmark, I think, and I will love to read Haidt’s thoughts in the future in the post Trump era.The “pure reason” basis for morality proposed by Plato and the ancients was tossed on its head by David Hume, the 18th century Scottish philosopher, who argued that it is the “passions” that are really driving. Haidt accepts this and uses the Elephant (intuition, or passion) as a metaphor and the Rider (the head, trying to steer through reasoning). The elephant is the powerful entity reacting to perceived threats, real on imagined. Haidt and his students demonstrated over and over that most moral reasoning operates this way in humans, where they justify their moral beliefs with reasoning, after they’ve already decided what is right. Where Haidt differs from Hume is he shows that it is not “experience” that informs this intuition alone, in fact much of it is innate (i.e. genetic). Again, Haidt demonstrates this with scientific methods and his studies bear this out. This has been my experience as well, as in college when I tried to justify my emotional repulsion for suicide with logic. Haidt says “Our moral thinking is much more like a politician searching for votes than a scientist searching for the truth” (p. 89). The author goes further, where his studies have concluded that “…we care more about looking good than truly being good. Intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second. We lie, cheat, and cut ethical corners quite often when we think we can get away with it, and then we use our moral thinking to manage our reputations and justify ourselves to others. We believe our own post hoc reasoning so thoroughly that we end up self-righteously convinced of our own virtue.” (p. 220). But lest you think he is devolving to pure cynicism; he argues later that this serves a vital moral function.The author explains why the world doesn’t see America the way we do. He introduced me to the acronym WEIRD (western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic). Most people like this (myself included) just don’t get how tiny a minority we are, yet we control most of the resources and this informs much of our morality. These people (liberal, by and large, as the term is used in the US) are obsessed with the utilitarianism introduced by John Stuart Mill, the highly influential 19th century British philosopher whose ideas underwrite provide the foundation for liberal democracy. What we see in America today, to some extent, in the populist tendency, is a departure away from the “educated and rich” aspects of WEIRD. Our drift from egalitarianism (through global economics) has left behind these people, and that’s how Trump gathered them in by promising a return of distribution of riches to them (this hasn’t happened, by most accounts, but more on tribalism to come). Haidt shows that student’s natural intuition for disgust is more likely to be put aside by educated college students when the overall good is served (he uses humorous disgusting cases that WEIRD participants find acceptable because no one is harmed – e.g. eating an animal that the owner previously defiled in ways I won’t name here). He will expound that libertarian morality is disproportionately informed by Mill’s idea that the policy which does the least harm to the most people (liberty/oppression) trumps most others.Haidt credits Hume with getting something else right, that there are “tastes” for morality that cannot be explained by rational moral reasoning. “Moral judgment is a kind of perception, and moral science should begin with a careful study of the moral taste receptors (p. 135). He believes modern science has since vindicated Hume on this idea: “You would think, then, that in the decades after his death, the moral sciences progressed rapidly. But you would be wrong. In the decades after Hume’s death the rationalists claimed victory over religion and took the moral sciences off on a two-hundred-year tangent.” (p. 135). A rather audacious claim? Haidt makes his case that the rationalists on morality got it mostly wrong, and the elephant is actually in control of the rider. He has data to back it up.Hume’s “taste” receptors for morality are largely inborn. Haidt’s approach is to study morality by how the mind “actually” works, as opposed to how it “ought” to work. That is the basic thesis of his study. He argues that Immanuel Kant, the 18th century German philosopher, got it wrong when he only focused on justice. He likens it to a restaurant with only one item no the menu, insufficient for the full palate of moral taste sensors. There are five such moral foundations, Care, fairness, loyalty, authority and sanctity. Kant (and Kohlberg’s error) according to the author is that he focused only on the fairness foundation to the exclusion of the others. And here’s where it gets interesting, Haidt studied these 5 aspects on hundreds of subjects and found that the very liberal over-value Care and Fairness whereas the very conservative value all of them more or less equally. As a political scientist, this imparts and advantage to conservative politicians who can appeal to a broader palate of tastes. The study of group behavior is a key to understanding morality – Haidt likens the college football scene at the University of Virginia to a political rally or religious service, where loyalty to team and flag waving create a collective hysteria that takes on a life of its own. His study of other cultures shows how pervasive this practice has been in the history of mankind. As a liberal, you might find this slavish devotion repugnant (I must admit I often too, but on occasion have felt the power and protection and ecstasy when in the bosom of my group – e.g. musical events where the likeminded devotees are united as one). Why do humans do this? One reason is it requires adherence to the group codes, and punishes nonadherents and “free riders” - those who do not contribute to the group but only take. The value of group behavior has been studied in the animal kingdom, and Haidt claims that is what humans are spectacular at, and they accomplish much more than a group of individuals. This explains why the right in American politics are terrified by a lack of hierarchy and structure, and the very idea of communism or socialism conjures up thoughts of a disorganized horde of selfish individuals. Of course, this is not what Marxist theory says, but the point is that individualism (universal fairness) from the left is so directly opposed to the this tribal, or group mentality. Haidt credits Darwin and later Durkheim for figuring out how humans adapted these to advance technologically – he argues the data is clear that civilizations that did this led to more stable and successful organizations. In other words, loyalty to group (kin, religion, tribe, etc…) is morally superior in this aspect in that it leads to greater success and happiness for the group.To explain what makes humans so groupish, Haidt argues it happened over a relatively short period of time in history and through natural selection. And it is innate – he cited a Russian study where within 10 generations an animal breeder, by breeding the least fearful and social individuals, created an entire population of docile foxes. Another study by Muir in the 1980s where groups of 12 hens in cages were studied to see which laid the most eggs. What he found was that the best layers were also less aggressive and healthy. By successive breeding he created a brood where the mortality was 8% compared to 67% in the original group (yes chickens are vicious). He argues that it is the same in humans, where group loyalty is valued thrive. Therefore, loyalty is a virtue, a higher moral state. New DNA evidence shows that, contrary to Stephen Jay Gould’s claim, human genomes evolved massively over the last 50,000 years, leading us the most successful species on earth. (one can argue that our planetary conquest has passed its zenith). One of the more interesting sections included the claim that we are “90% chimpanzee and 10% bee”. Most of the time we are like chimps where individuals compete for dominance and the goodies. But we have an innate switch where we go into hive mode, like bees, forgetting our selfishness and work together, become hyper social, to protect the hive from threat or competition from other groups. Who can deny the way Americans came together once the planes crashed into the towers on 9/11. Suddenly our selfishness vanished and former enemies joined arms against a common good. Haidt argues this was a critical social adaption to illustrate the value of patriotism as a moral virtue. In the west we often romanticize the lone hero, struggling alone against the horde. But this is alien to other cultures, where admittance to the group and destruction of the self is seen as a higher good. Self-abnegation is a ritual in most non-western cultures, where puberty rites are designed to purge the selfish inclinations for acceptance into the “hive” of adulthood, where new obligations are required. Often hallucinogens are used to erase the self, and the experience of peyote and mescaline and LSD takers often leads to a (sometimes permanent) release from the prison of “self” into a state of joyous community with the “one” (that being, the group, the universal state of man). Experimental studies with Americans in placebo blinded trials show that this drug often has this positive effect, sometimes permanent (some people say the experience was life changing). I say all this to show that the rationalist, individualist moral reasoning for fairness traditionally espoused by western philosophers does n’t begin to capture the moral foundation of loyalty. Finally, Haidt shows it may be biochemical – studies where game players were given oxytocin made less selfish decisions – however only with their team – to other teams they were aggressively competitive!Religions are perhaps the most tightly cohered group type – where adherence to code is strictly enforced and the “free rider” problem can be aggressively managed. Personally, I have always found this drives me away from such organizations as I discerned from young age that the disparity of such structures and the actual teachings of Jesus. I have since come to realize the schisms in Christianity have been ongoing for 2000+ years. Perhaps that is why I lean left, I have always thought of the “fellowship of man” to be global (all 8 billion of us) and"

(Also, if you have to describe more than 2 or 3 diagrams and figures, maybe audio should be nixed as an option. That just became way tedious to listen to.)All that aside, there's some fascinating stuff in this book which, as much as I would love to claim is obvious.... Really only seems that way. As the book progressed, I felt myself having more and more visceral reactions to some of Haidt's statements and arguments, and having to examine why I did so. And I have come to realize that I'm a kneejerk liberal, but when I actually think about it, I'm more moderate...ish. But it is good to have my awareness raised about why I tend to kneejerk react to certain stimuli, though it'll take quite a bit of effort to actually stop wanting to knee people when that impulse is triggered. ;)Anyway, I do recommend the physical book rather than the audio. The author did a fine job of reading it, but had I known that there would be pictures, I'd have read it with my own eyeballs. It's pretty interesting and uses a whole lot of studies and historical context to explain why we think the ways we do, and for that, I'd shove this into as many hands as possible. But get comfy because it does take a bit of time to get there."
30,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9628169-charles-j,5,"In today’s world, discussion about morals is a lost art. In part, this is because stupidity is on display everywhere, and encouraged to be so, even though most people’s thoughts and opinions are less than worthless, as a glance at Facebook or ""The New York Times"" comment sections will tell you. More deeply, it’s because America is dominated today by the nearly universal (but wholly unexamined) belief that the only legitimate principle of moral judgment is John Stuart Mill’s “harm principle”—that no restriction on human action can be justified other than to prevent harm to another. ""The Righteous Mind"" is an extended attack on the usefulness of the harm principle as the sole way to understand and justify human morality, combined with detailed explanations of the much broader ways in which people can and do view morality. The author, Jonathan Haidt, uses this framework to understand political differences, and to plead for an increase in rationality and civility to arise from that understanding.I am not hopeful such an increase will happen. But this book is fascinating beyond belief. For a relatively short book, it packs in a tremendous amount of insight. It is therefore difficult to review or summarize; I could spend pages discussing relatively minor matters covered in the book. The author, Jonathan Haidt, has and applies the talent that eludes other science writers such as Steven Pinker—the ability to condense complex material without losing impact. The result is a book well worth reading.Haidt divides his book into three main parts. The first and third deal with how humans engage in moral reasoning, and how that affects politics. The middle part deals with, in essence, evolutionary psychology—how humans became as we are now in regard to morality, and what that implies for us today. The first part of the book contains what is perhaps Haidt’s most counter-intuitive claim, on which the entire book rests—that the majority of moral reasoning is intuitive and pre-rational, and that the rational side of each person participates primarily to justify a conclusion already reached, which reasoning is “useful to further our social agendas.” Haidt uses the metaphor of an elephant (intuition) and rider (reason)—mostly, the rider does what the elephant says, although sometimes the rider can guide the elephant, or at least influence him.He begins with a captivating review of how moral psychology has been studied and viewed by academics over the past few decades. In the 1960s through the 1990s, it was believed, following Jean Piaget and Lawrence Kohlberg, that children had no inborn moral impulses, but figured out morality for themselves through their interactions, so-called “rationalism.” This theory believed that as children become able to see the world as others saw it, they come to understand that fairness is everything, and build their morality around metrics of equal treatment. Moreover, as Elliot Turiel showed, children can differentiate between arbitrary and universal rules, nearly always believing that harm to others is wrong regardless of what is dictated by formal rules. As Haidt notes, these researchers’ conclusion, that morality’s chief aim is reducing harm and creating fairness, and that any other moral judgment is imposed arbitrarily from without by societies and cultures, dovetailed precisely with the then-rising American liberal (i.e., progressive) consensus, of maximizing personal freedom without limitation or end. This further reinforced its accuracy in the minds of its investigators, because it fit with what they personally believed.But this science was all wrong. These researchers fell into the trap of believing that because American children, and certain groups of Americans they studied, based their morality on fairness and non-harm, all others also did so. Haidt relates how he personally started with the same beliefs that were popular at the time (in the 1990s), but when he started reading Richard Shweder, an expert in Indian moral psychology, and went to India for some time, immersing himself in the culture in a non-judgmental way, he began to understand that people there viewed the world very, very differently. He began to wonder what that implied for morality—was the American view overly narrow and simplistic? At the most basic level, the difference in morality he saw was between individualistic, American-type views, and sociocentric views, “placing the needs of groups and institutions first, and subordinating the needs of individuals.” Harm in this view is not irrelevant, nor is fairness, but they are far from the most important consideration, whereas in an individualistic culture, where society cannot make any non-harm based demands on its individual members, it is the only thing that matters. Individualism basically came on the scene during the Enlightenment and only in the West; the rest of the world is still primarily sociocentric.Beginning to see this, Haidt spent the next years conducting ever larger studies, among a variety of cultures and classes, to see what the moral views were of people in hypothetical scenarios, some of which involved harm, and some of which involved other possible moral principles, such as loyalty and purity. He began to realize that it is simply false that children create morality for themselves out of the harm principle; instead, they have certain innate impulses, which are guided and enhanced by learning from the culture in which they grow up. There are many more innate impulses than mere avoidance of harm to others (which is also innate, not formed by rational thinking, contrary to Piaget and Kohlberg) and there is a complex relationship between those impulses and culture.Haidt then turns back to a history lesson, starting with Plato’s ""Timaeus"" and looking at various ways we have viewed the relationship among mind, reason, and morality. He discusses Hume, Jefferson, and most importantly for his book, Darwin. Haidt notes how in the mid-twentieth century, the idea that there was any native, or inherent, element to human nature became toxic, leading to the demand that all right thinking people reject that human nature exists, with the necessary conclusion that morality is purely the result of reasoning, with no innate component. He discusses how ideology was used to suppress those who thought otherwise, such as Edward O. Wilson, excoriated for daring to challenge the scientific consensus, but rehabilitated today.Over time, as evidence built up to the contrary, this monolith eroded, and an inherent human nature became recognized (though it is still denied in some quarters). For Haidt’s purposes, the crucial element of this realization was that various experiments showed that intuitions were critical to moral conclusions, with reasoning playing second fiddle. “Moral reasoning was mostly just a post hoc search for reasons to justify the judgments people had already made.” We “see-that” before “reasoning-why.” We do this not to tell ourselves why we believe something, but, for evolutionary reasons, to “find the best possible reasons why somebody else ought to join us in our judgment.” It is important to realize that intuitions are not irrational, they are a type of cognition, not inherently of less worth than abstract reasoning. And, most critically, if you want to convince others you have to address their intuitions, not their reasoning, since the former comes first, and for the most part trying to address their reasoning is like addressing the rider where the elephant is actually in control. In fact, people who don’t make moral judgments this way, who instead use pure reason, are psychopaths, incapable of normal human interaction. (Almost all psychopaths are men, Haidt mentions—throughout the book, although he does not emphasize it, it is obvious that Haidt views men and women as far from interchangeable, probably for the evolutionary reasons he stresses in other contexts).Finally, in this section, Haidt demonstrates through the results of experiments that many of the reasons we state for believing as we do are social in nature—designed to enhance our popularity, justify ourselves to others, justify ourselves to ourselves, engage in confirmation bias, and, critically, find reasons that result in actions benefiting not just us but our group—all just like a politician, although here Haidt is not making specific political claims. Our stated reasons are largely manufactured to accomplish these goals after we have already concluded our moral judgments. This implies, among other things, that we cannot get good behavior by rationalism; that philosopher kings are not going to be more moral than anyone else; and that teaching ethics is worthless (which I have long believed, so I am sure Haidt is correct)—we should instead be conditioning intuitions.So Haidt, in the second part, turns to the specifics of those innate intuitions. More specifically, he sets out to prove that, given that morality is largely based on intuition, that those intuitions are much more, and much broader, than the harm and fairness intuitions that are the sole focus of “modern secular Western morality.” Haidt’s objection is not that the harm principle, in particular, is unjust or wrong, but that any moral theory resting on a single principle is not in keeping with how people really view morality, and therefore both largely useless as an explanation and overly constraining as a hortatory method.“Modern secular Western morality” is what Haidt also calls (following a group of cultural psychologists), WEIRD morality, where the acronym stands for “Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic.” “WEIRD people are statistical outliers; they are the least typical, least representative people you could study if you want to make generalizations about human nature.” They “see a world full of separate objects, rather than relationships.” In other words—most people, and nearly all of the rest of the world, have totally different moral intuitions, and therefore moral concerns, from what we are told by the dominant voices in the West are universal intuitions and concerns. WEIRD morality is “blind” to the concerns of others. (You’d think those obsessed with “multiculturalism” would welcome this conclusion, but you’d be wrong—liberals hate this conclusion, since it denies the primacy of autonomic individualism, a higher good.)When he realized this, Haidt had a “red pill moment,” where he “stepped out of the matrix.” He realized, of himself and his fellow liberals, “We never considered the possibility that there were alternative moral worlds in which reducing harm (by helping victims) and increasing fairness (by pursuing group-based equality) were not the main goals.” The remainder of this long section is devoted to expanding the foundations of moral judgments beyond harm and fairness (clarified as pairs of opposites, “care/harm” and “fairness/cheating”) to include four others: “loyalty/betrayal”; “authority/subversion”; “sanctity/degradation”; and “liberty/oppression.” Again, it is hard to do justice to the incisive and insightful nature of this analysis. Suffice it to say that Haidt is correct, and once you view questions of morality, and of individuals’ views of morality, through this framework, rather than being confined in the straitjacket of mere harm and fairness, you understand what drives people much more than you did before.Haidt emphasizes that these six ways of viewing the world (and perhaps others) are innate—not in the sense of wholly predetermined, but in the sense of being “organized in advance of experience”—a “first draft” inherent in each person when born. Those traits lead people along different paths, often reinforcing their inherent characteristics, though not always. He notes repeatedly how, as with so many claims later proven wrong, a scientific “consensus” insisted until the 1990s that each person was a blank slate, but that has been proven definitively false. All six foundations, Haidt believes, originated in evolutionary behaviors, which Haidt identifies for each, but that does not make any one, or set of them, more or less valid than another. They all operate simultaneously in each human being. And they are all necessary for a good society. “We [Shweder and Haidt] believe that moral monism—the attempt to ground all of morality on a single principle—leads to societies that are unsatisfying to most people and at high risk of becoming inhumane because they ignore so many other moral principles.”Of course, as will be obvious upon a moment’s reflection, and as Haidt explains, liberals draw their conclusions by relying on only three of these foundations (care, fairness and liberty), and often only two (fairness easily gives way to liberty, if oppression is thought to be present). Haidt is himself liberal, and he admits his original personal response to these insights was to try to aggressively put them to use to help Democrats win elections (John Kerry’s election, to be specific). His concern, then and now, was that since most conservatives (he identifies libertarians as very closely allied to liberals in their moral judgments, so here and elsewhere he means Burkean conservatives) rely more-or-less equally on all six foundations, their appeal is broader than the liberal appeal, which only offers something to a subset of the population.Although he mentions Edmund Burke, Haidt’s exemplar of a conservative is not Burke. He also mentions other relevant thinkers such as Thomas Sowell (who invented the terminology of the “constrained vision” of human capacity, on which Haidt in part relies to characterize conservatives) and Robert Nisbet (the originator of modern conservative theories of community), but does not rely on them either. Instead, Haidt chooses someone more obscure—the turn-of-the-century French sociologist Emile Durkheim, the polar opposite of John Stuart Mill. Among other things, Durkheim believed in the centrality of the family and the critical importance of a society consisting of networked, overlapping groups, in which the individual as individual played little role. He is Haidt’s exemplar of a conservative fully realized in the sense of relying on all six of Haidt’s foundations of moral judgment, and Durkheim reappears repeatedly in the second half of the book.While religion is the focus of a fair bit of discussion in this book, it is all about the evolutionary value of religion. But the reader is left with the lurking feeling that much of what Haidt ascribes to evolutionary pressure, to the “first draft” of intuition, is in fact the latent Christianity that is the utterly dominant moral backdrop of the West, even now. It may be true, for example, that human beings have an innate sense that others should not be unduly harmed, or that oppression is bad. (Haidt ascribes these to the evolutionary motives of keeping children safe and “a response to adaptive challenge of living in small groups with individuals who would, if given the chance, dominate, bully, and constrain others”—but when weapons were developed, could be resisted). But our interpretation of our intuition, the second draft made after the first draft of intuition, flows purely from Christianity, and it is hard to distinguish where one ends and the other begins. To non-Christian cultures, for example, the Golden Rule is either unimportant or insane. Nobody has an innate urge to obey it. The much more usual moral judgment of “care/harm” is that of the Roman dictator Sulla, who wrote as his epitaph, “No friend ever served me, and no enemy ever wronged me, whom I have not repaid in full.” This suggests that Haidt’s project of reclaiming some agreement on moral issues through better understanding others is doomed, since if it is true that what understanding we have relies largely or wholly on latent Christianity, as that disappears what agreement we have is likely to disagree as well.As to the validity of Mill’s harm principle as the touchstone of moral judgment, we can do no better than examine the barkings of progressive philosopher Martha Nussbaum. Although Haidt does not mention her, she is in many ways the anti-Haidt. A large part of her recent career has revolved around her exaltation of the harm principle as the sole valid method of moral judgment, and the rejection of disgust, or what she claims to be disgust, as well as sanctity, as invalid. She has become famous for this, mostly because her positions conveniently fit right into the Zeitgeist, in that her claims all traditional morality, especially sexual morality, to be rejected in favor of total individual liberty, the holy of holies of modern progressivism. Although I have not read her 2010 book ""From Disgust to Humanity,"" by all accounts its reasoning is exactly what Haidt finds most disturbing, and most cluelessly narrow. Her book is an extended attack on any moral judgment that cannot be justified adequately to Nussbaum on the exclusive ground of Mill’s harm principle, and most especially on any moral judgment that depends in any way on a decision regarding sanctity or purity (i.e., in her mind, on moral judgments that are the opposite of “Humanity”). Nussbaum further discovers a Constitutional imperative to enshrine in law her beliefs and way of looking at morality, which would have surprised any American jurist prior to 1950, and something Haidt, with his plea to understand and value all the different bases for moral judgments, doubtless finds troubling. But that, of course, is why Nussbaum is so widely praised—she offers apparent intellectual cover for WEIRD individuals to write their preferences into law in a way that cannot be appealed and cannot be legislated against by the majority who still honor the morals of sanctity. Presumably somewhere in her work Nussbaum enunciates why she believes the harm principle is the only moral criterion that can be permitted to exist; no doubt, her argument relies on assertions that only it is “rational.” But as Haidt shows, this is just the result of a parched inability to understand human beings, and a rejection of the cognitive function of intuition—which is why Nussbaum and her many allies are, though they don’t realize it, on the wrong side of history.The third part of the book focuses on why these intuitions developed from a Darwinian perspective, and in particular on “group selection”—behaviors in groups, especially moral behaviors, and why Haidt believes they developed, namely in order to confer evolutionary advantage on a group level. This is another view that until recently was an utter heresy against the scientific consensus, and it is also the view that causes Haidt to attack the New Atheists (Dawkins, Harris, etc.) as blinkered and ignorant, for refusing to see the obvious truth that religion confers group advantages, especially “cooperation without kinship,” and is not a negative “parasite” or “virus.” (Haidt himself is an atheist, so this is in a sense an intra-atheist dispute. And his definition of religion, following Durkheim, is “a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things,” in order to create a community. This definition is broader than revealed religion, and could easily include, for example, the belief system of modern liberals and their institutions sometimes called the “clerisy” or the “Cathedral”—but that’s a topic for another day.) Here also Haidt veers into brief discussions of evolutionary genetic change in the recent human past (he believes it can and did happen, and continues to happen, but avoids excessive exploration, presumably so as not to get into the disputes that have embroiled Gregory Clark and Nicholas Wade, although he cites the latter several times).[Review finishes as first comment.]"
31,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/502680-david,5,"How do we make ethical and moral choices? Many people throughout history, as well as today, say we make choices based on reason. We are faced with a choice, we weigh our options and choose what we think is right. This reason may be impacted by emotion or tradition or religion. Or there's the nature/nurture debate - are we born with proclivities or does our family and society shape us?Haidt argues that we make choices almost immediately, based on intuition. After that reason comes to our aid, mostly to help us find arguments to support what we've already chosen. The image he used here is that of a person riding an elephant. The elephant veers one way or another (intuition, our choices) while the rider has little to do but go along with it (reason). In other words, the person (reason) does not control the elephant (intuition). It is the other way around. Haidt goes on to encourage us to beware of moral monists, people who argue that morality comes through only one path. Instead five factors go into our moral choices: care/harm, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion and sanctity/degradation. Later research caused him to add a sixth one, separate from fairness, as liberty/oppression. What is interesting is that conservatives utilize all six while liberals only utilize three (care/harm, liberty/oppression, fairness/cheating). Haidt argues this gives conservatives an advantage because they can relate to people on numerous moral levels. Liberals scoff at things like loyalty and authority to their own detriment.Finally, in the third part, Haidt argues for the communal aspect. Morality binds us together. When it comes to our religion and politics, we are like football fans who cheer our team on and dismiss any rational arguments against our team simply because they go against our team. I think we see this everywhere today. As we are bound together, we are blind to the other side. We do not talk to those on the other team as much and instead assume the worst about them. Interestingly, Haidt ends by pointing out issues where he thinks liberals are right and some where conservatives are right. Throughout the book he weaves his personal story and this recognition of good arguments on both sides is a testament to how his own research has allowed him to change.Overall, this was a fantastic book. It was also disturbing because it makes clear how susceptible we are to all these things. I am guilty of this when I dismiss people and just assume I am right. Worse, when we fail to befriend others and listen to them we just talk past each other (at best) and are reduced to seeking power and dominance since rational arguments are fruitless (at worst). I highly recommend this for anyone interested in religion, ethics, morality and the big debates in our culture."

Dialogue, debate for the point of view of the others universe - are replaced by the emphatic clamor of personal visions, in an aggressive and militant way. What determines our need to adhere to pro-life, pro-choice , or other labels ?"" Why don't we listen to the other one, and why don't we want to do it either ? Why do we need our opinions to be so firm ? ""This is exactly the context in which I read Haidt's book. "" The Righteous Mind "" is a book to be read with suspicion of our own minds and the mechanisms that push us into those ideological trenches, which I was reffering about above. Haidt has no qualms about making you uncomfortable, and I think he had even fun writing this book.  Why don't atheists want to sell their souls ? Another experiment created by Haidt requires self-proclaimed atheists to sign a paper, declaring that they are irrevocabily selling their soul, to the person conducting the test. What are the foundations of the majority refusal to sign ? Haidt concludes with a metaphor in which our mental processes can be compared to an image in which there is an elephant, and a leader of it.The elephant represents intuition, our instinctive start, while that apparent leader - represents reason. The question that arises is who leads whom, of course, in matters of morality. You will conclude for the example abouve, that the explanation comes after the intuitive start we have in the first phase. In many situations, we reason not in search of the truth, but to support those intuitive impulses, related to the question we are looking for an answer to.Haidt identifies six major sources that can cause the elephant to relegate its leader to the position of a simple press- officier : Care for others, fairness, freedom, loyalty, authority and sacredness. Each of these is analyzed by presenting different perspectives on the same moral stimulus. "" Spread my work ethics, not my wealth' "" - vs - "" Tax the wealthy fair and square' "" - are both expressions of an equity of social and moral necessity.  Does this mean that one is immaculate, and the other - répréhensible ?Many questions, few answers. As a conclusion, Haidt inoculates in the reader's mind - the necessity of doubt, of suspicion of our own convictions.  Whether this is good or bad, remains at the discretion of the reader."
33,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl,5,"Fascinating. Enjoyably readable, if you don't try to keep up with the extensive end-notes. Scientifically and philosophically convincing, if you do....Haidt is synthetic. He works on original research, traveling to conduct experiments on different people and groups of peoples, and he reads extensively & widely, and he interviews other scientists.The biggest takeaway *I* have is that many ppl are voting Republican because they are conservative and feel, deep in their genes, that they absolutely cannot vote liberal. Conservatives value loyalty and fear (or fight, or stand against...) betrayal, value authority and fear subversion, value sanctity and fear degradation, and value proportional equality, equality of more of opportunity, over equality of outcomes, the 'it's not fair' of children. They are utterly concerned that liberals' concerns with caring over harm and with autonomy & liberty over oppression have become too extreme and have cost us the ability to live in a society that can work together for the greater good. Anomie has been demonstrated as a result of living in a more individualistic community, one with less structure as given by the authority and sanctity of a traditional foundation, eg one based on a religion. And, I theorize, anomie is contributing factor to behaviors such as the mass shootings at Columbine, Sandy Hook, etc.I also have been led to (more fully believe and) understand that if more politicians and more scientists read more literature they would understand human nature better and most of what Haidt took such care to investigate and describe would be self-evident, and we'd be able to live in a healthier yin/yang harmony instead of in a state of partisanship that drives moderates and the open-minded to choose a team and vilify those not on it. (Haidt explores not just Right and Left in the US, but also New Atheists in the sciences.)Now mind, Haidt doesn't say exactly any of that. He says enough that I feel confident he wouldn't disagree with me, but for more details, read on for actual bits of what he does say:.........[I]ntuitions (including emotional responses) are a kind of cognition. They're just not a kind of reasoning.The first principle of moral psychology is Intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second.I should note that people vary in the degree to which they feel strong intuitions, in their ability to construct reasons, and in their openess to the reasons of others. See Bartels 2008.[Most subjects of psychology experiments have traditionally been undergrad students, but they're] WEIRD: Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic. [In Haidt's early work] The Penn students spoke almost exclusively in the language of the ethic of autonomy, whereas the other groups [including those in Brazil] (particularly the working-class groups) made much more use of the ethic of community, and a bit more use of the ethic of divinity.[From Gary Marcus, Haidt derived this definition of innateness:]'Nature provides a first draft, which experience then revises....”Built-in” does not mean unmalleable; it means “organized in advance of experience.”'Darwin … just has to explain why you have tear ducts in the first place.... The current triggers change rapidly. We care about violence toward many more classes of victims today than our grandparents did in their time.... Pinker [points out that] jokes about wife beating were common and acceptable in American movies and television programs up through the 1960s.[Michael Tomasello said] “It is inconceivable that you would ever see two chimpanzees carrying a log together.” {ok, I, Cheryl, am not so sure about this. The point intended was that non-humans show no evidence of being able to collaborate when complex planning and division of labor is required, of shared inentionality, but I suspect that they're not nearly as incapable as the quoted claim implies. Besides which, humans don't always work well together, either, as we can see when we watch me and my son try to clean and reorganize the garage...} [Haidt expresses gratitude for the feedback from Lesley Newsom re' the chapter on group selection:]'I think it is important not to give readers the impression that groups competing necessarily meant groups being at war or fighting with one another. They were competing at being the most efficient at turning resources into offspring. Don't forget that women and children were also very important members of these groups.'[Haidt thanks Hogan, Kaiser, and van Vugt for exploring our hive mind, our team spirit:]Focusing on leadership alone is like trying to understand clapping by studying only the left hand.... The real puzzle is why people are willing to follow.[Results from the questionnaires at YourMorals.org: ]When asked to account for the development of their own religious faith and moral beliefs, conservatives underscored deep feelings about respect for authority, allegiance to one's group, and purity of the self, whereas liberals emphasized their deep feelings regarding human suffering and social fairness.[Conservatives understand] the importance of what I'll call moral capital. (Please note that I am praising conservative intellectuals, not the Republican Party.)I believe that liberalism—which has done so much to bring about freedom and equal opportunity—is not sufficient as a governing philosophy. It tends to overreach, change too many things too quickly, and reduce the stock of moral capital inadvertently. Conversely, while conservatives do a better job of preserving moral capital, they often fail to notice certain classes of victims, fail to limit the predations of certain powerful interests, and fail to see the need to change or update institutions as times change.[re' 'parochial altruism'] We need groups, we love groups, and we develop our virtues in groups, even though those groups necessarily exclude nonmembers. If you destroy all groups and dissolve all internal structure, you destroy your moral capital. Conservatives understand this point.Blackmore is a meme theorist who originally shared Dawkins's view that religions were memes that spread like viruses. But after seeing the evidence that religious people are happier, more generous, and more fertile, she recanted. See Blackmore 2010...............Now, I don't take everything he's decided to be the ultimate truth. Heck, he, himself, doesn't. For example, I'm not convinced of the value of all his metaphors. I definitely do like the rider & the elephant: it makes sense, there's good evidence for its accuracy, and it's easy to understand. But the 90% chimp and 10% bee doesn't work as well. I think our sense of community, team spirit, hive mind, is *much* more than 10% of a determinant to our perspective, beliefs, and behavior. And I don't think we can be reduced to just those two critters, either... can't Haidt grant us humans a bit of bowerbird, at least?And he has a bit of trouble defining religion vs. spirituality, and teasing out what they mean to people. He tries to claim that organized religion can be abandoned but that humans have a need to sacralize *something* and cannot be purely rational... but if we look at the conservatives who vote Republican, we see *very* structured religions... and what about agnostics, atheists, and New Atheists? He does quote Putnam and Campbell: ""It is religious belongingness that matters for neighborliness, not religious believing."" I see another s*load of research and then another book in the works....My second biggest takeaway is that there's hope for a more harmonious world community, or at least a less partisan US. If individuals can reach out with respect to people with whom they disagree, we can unite for the common good. We've shown it in the few decades that have passed since Stonewall to Orlando, we've shown it after Katrina and after 9-11, we show it every day on smaller-scales. It all matters, and it all makes a difference; let's keep up the good work.Books I am adding to my to-read list:Not by Genes Alone: How Culture Transformed Human Evolution by Peter J. Richerson Strangers to Ourselves: Discovering the Adaptive Unconscious by Timothy D. WilsonWhy Everyone (Else) Is a Hypocrite: Evolution and the Modular Mind by Robert KurzbanMeaning in Life and Why It Matters by Susan Wolf(Some of these books are kinda old, in this swiftly-evolving field...

34,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5237420-ana,5,"This is a book that helps you think about your morality, without pushing you into any of the extremes of the spectrum. I didn't agree much with the discussion on religion, as I think it was helpful in the mast as a moral exoscheleton, but it shouldn't be anymore. At the same time, I don't and hope I will never fall on the other extreme, where everything that matters should only come from our rational brain - extremism in any form is after all, too radical for any good process to come out of it in the long run. I did find the discussion about politics fascinating, especially the study of Republican and Liberal morals, using the six levers that Haidt argues people push when they are part of either of the two groups. This is where I found it useful to place myself in a concervative's shoes, and I hope I did a good job of it, as seeing something through someone else's eyes while maintaining yours open is the best way to enrich your own value as a human being.

35,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27078093-alice-lippart,3,"Definitely interesting, though probably even more interesting to an American audience. A bit dry in points and sometimes repetitive, but I definitely felt like I learned something."
36,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1951999-susan,1,"I am appalled by this book. There are a myriad of things wrong with it, and many, many beautifully written reviews help outline them. I strongly encourage you to browse through them, because I will not be thorough enough or eloquent enough to do the political arguments justice here.On the plus side, I will say that the book is thought provoking, well-researched for the points Haidt wants to make (we'll get to that), uses metaphors well to express his ideas clearly, and is well written to draw readers in. He presents interesting ideas about the development of morality and how it is differently applied by different people. It fits, and explains a lot. If, or to the degree that he is right, it does give ideas about how people can find ways to talk to each other across what look like unbreachable chasms.My first split with Haidt came early, right in chapter one. Haidt spends the first 10 pages of the entire book explaining that Piaget and Kohlberg were the psychologists who identified the framework of moral psychology and its development, and that they had ""pretty much defined the field"" by the time Haidt became interested (p. 11). There is an endnote here, which leads to p. 325, which stated the only reference I found to Carol Gilligan, a pioneering woman in the field (my words) who ""argued that Kohlberg had neglected the 'ethic of care,' which she said was more common in women than men."" This outright dismissal of women occurs in every possible way at every possible level throughout the remainder of this book. Gilligan (I know from my Master's level coursework) redefined psychology, demonstrating that girls and women develop differently than boys, who were (and still are) considered normative. For a handful more examples, (1) when Haidt introduced the Liberty/Oppression foundation (one of his six pillars of morality), he states that it developed because our distant ancestors had to deal with bullying alpha males. Weapons evened things out, then language created the ability to unite in order to shame, ostracize, or kill anyone whose behavior threatened the group. But it was all about the alpha males (p. 170-71). (2) Haidt talks about people as mostly selfish (90% chimp) but sometimes groupish (10% bee). At one point he discusses the biology that can make people have a group-level adaptation for group-binding... he calls this the hive switch... and discusses oxytocin. It's a neurotransmitter primarily occurring in mammals that binds mothers to their offspring. But his cited research is about giving oxytocin to men to see if it made them care about other men more (p. 233-34). (3) When he talks about Hives At Work, he only uses a male-dominated business model. He is clearly talking about corporate for profit businesses (traditionally dominated by men), and not any of the industries where women have worked or thrived for decades (and function very differently) (p. 236-240).(4) Chapter 9 is titled ""Why Are We So Groupish?"" and addresses the question of how humans came to care about the group, rather than only the self. From p. 189 to p. 217, Haidt argues based on cells and animals and males. On page 217, there is finally a note that states that a female reader on an early draft said to him, ""I think it is important not to give readers the impression that groups competing necessarily meant groups being at war or fighting with one another. They were competing to be the most efficient at turning resources into offspring. Don't forget that women and children were also very important members of these groups."" I honestly thought, ""Finally! He's going to reinterpret the chapter acknowledging the role of women!"" Instead, he said, She's right, restated her paragraph for two sentences, went in another direction for three sentences, and then summed up the chapter with no mention of how female presence was different.Haidt's perspective on race is just as one sided, though it shows up less often, yet is more blatantly appalling. On page 239, he says (and backs up with cited research endnotes) that people can feel more groupish at work when the institution works to ""increase similarity, not diversity..... So don't call attention to racial and ethnic differences; make them less relevant by ramping up similarity and celebrating the group's shared values and common identity.... There's nothing special about race. You can make people care less about race by drowning race differences in a sea of similarities, shared goals, and mutual interdependencies."" Spoken like a privileged member of the dominant group. I don't doubt that there is research backing this up... but I sincerely doubt that it is research that would stand up to rigorous scrutiny for broad sampling across representative groups. No one whose skin tone has made their race the target of systemic political, economic, and judicial oppression in this country for the last 400 years is going to be lulled by his statement that ""a great deal of research in social psychology shows that people are warmer and more trusting toward people who look like them, dress like them, talk like them, or even just share their first name or birthday"" (p. 239). At the end of the book, Haidt brings up race again, and talks about how and why liberals hurt people they are trying to help when they bring diversity into the mix. But here, again, he chooses examples that, while real, emphasize his affiliation with White liberals in the halls of power. He identifies with policy makers who act from without (p.308-09), rather than ground-up activists who work from within, helping neighborhoods and communities come up with their own solutions. Everything about _The Righteous Mind_ reflects Haidt's White, advantaged, male perspective on the world. It is so thoroughly engrained that he seems unable to see it, even when it is pointed out by a colleague. It is the water he swims in; the air he breathes. It starts in the first 10 pages and lasts until the last five. Because of this, I find it impossible to evaluate the validity of anything in the middle."
37,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4148547-tucker,3,"This book was ultimately a mixed bag for me. There is one supremely interesting component, which comes in part two, and which consists in the elaboration of what Haidt calls Moral Foundations Theory. MFT is roughly the idea that our evaluative judgments of rightness and wrongness of action are guided by intuitions that encode the world in terms of six dichotomies (care/harm, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, respect/disobedience, sanctity/degradation, and liberty/oppression). The idea that there is more to morality than harm and fairness seems to me to be quite right and interesting, as its at least common for some of us not to realize that, e.g., concerns of group loyalty and sanctity matter to us. By far the best parts of the book were those that illustrated broadly what it means to think out of concerns for sanctity. I think the book actually (accidentally) makes the compelling case that we all do this, although we westerners are less likely to think, e.g., that concerns of sanctity do or should belong to our understanding of the moral order.The fundamental problem I have with the book is that the story the book tells to support Moral Foundations Theory suggests that these dichotomies should be universal, but a large part of the book is devoted to arguing that political liberals organize their moral judgments only in terms of three of them, ignoring the dichotomies of loyalty/betrayal, authority/disobedience, and sanctity/degradation. I wasn't at all convinced by the psychological evidence used to justify this conclusion (much of which seems to presume that there's just one way to encode rightness or wrongness in those axes, whereas you might think, as I do, that differences between conservatives and liberals correspond to what we encode as violating norms of loyalty, authority, and sanctity), and Haidt seems keen to use the conclusion to develop a narrative that lays the blame for the increasing polarization of the electorate squarely on the shoulders of the American left. There are parts of morality that we liberals, supposedly, just don't get. The problem I found with this analysis is that it just seemed to me to assume a view of what it is to be sensitive to concerns of loyalty, authority, and sanctity that grants that the conservative point of view is right about what is sacred, what it is to whom one should be loyal, what authorities are worth being recognized. This is an easy trap to fall into, because a lot of language associated with words like 'sanctity,' 'loyalty,' and 'authority' have acquired connotations and associations with very particular conceptions of how one *should* respond to considerations relevant to these axes. If you step back, however, and consider the virtues of loyalty, deference, and reverence for the sacred more abstractly, my suspicion is that you would find that liberals and conservatives actually encode the world in these terms to exactly the same degree. The disagreement is, I suspect, purely and simply a disagreement in the *content* of ideals of loyalty, deference, and reverence. Unfortunately, this makes Moral Foundations Theory much less potent for generating prescriptions about how to heal our fractured political discourse. The problem is not as simple as teaching an uneducated listener how to appreciate jazz.Unfortunately, instead, the apparatus of Moral Foundations Theory gets marshaled in the service of hippie-punching (a favorite past-time of fellow moral psychologist, Steven Pinker, and many, many other ardent ex-liberal centrists). I don't want to suggest that Haidt's criticism of the American left is entirely without merit: we could do more to highlight the ways in which our moral discourse *does* make contact with concerns of loyalty, deference, and reverence, and we could certainly think more seriously about how our Utopian ideals satisfy the constraints implied by those virtues. But I don't think Haidt makes a very convincing case that liberals (but apparently not libertarians or social conservatives) have a moral 'blind spot.' He can only entitle himself to that conclusion by assuming that certain conservative views are correct -- which he often does, for example, in describing the ""failures"" of liberal social reforms of the 60s and 70s (which supposedly destabilized and disrupted minority communities, schools, &c.) with next-to-no scientific evidence cited to support such evaluative judgments. I'll also mention that Haidt's discussion of figures from the history of philosophy is pervasively misinformed (e.g. his discussion of Plato, which gets Plato's position wrong in basically every possible way) and sometimes just juvenile (e.g. his discussion of Kant is largely limited to several paragraphs of speculating about whether Kant may have been autistic, and how, if true, this could account for the content of his moral theory; true or not, it's a little insulting). This was a huge distraction for me in the first third of the book (which was also, I thought, by far the weakest)."
38,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1257629-karl-o,3,"This was an interesting read and though I disagree with Haidt in many crucial points, such as the role of reason in our lives, he presents in this book challenging ideas which cannot be taken lightly. However, I believe Haidt deliberately ignored the role of education, and though he acknowledged the good role discussions play in removing personal biases when people pursue their goals and agendas, he ignored it in his theory of the Moral Foundations. Discourse and education can play a huge role in developing both a set of ideologies and a personal narrative with which we examine our own beliefs and values. His ""demonstration"" about the shortcomings of reason, with the usual story of a consensual incest between a brother and sister, is not as strong a demonstration as the conclusion he tries to reach, namely that intuition always plays a much stronger role in our lives than reasoning. ————————————————————————Came across two pieces in the NYT (one by by Gary Gutting and and the other by Michael P. Lynch) about this book along with Haidt's reply, and I can say that I stand by my rating of 3-stars.

I am purchasing the book in paperback, too, because I missed bits here and there while listening. One drawback with audiobooks, for me, is that I only listen to them while doing other things which means distractions are inevitable, and rewinding becomes tedious when you are trying to garden, or clean house, or cook a meal, or accomplish some other thing involving your hands! However, I do like them and this one is especially well done. I recommend Haidt's book without qualification to all thinking persons who plan to continue living amongst other humans, hopefully peaceably. "
41,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18185192-athan-tolis,5,"My brother-in-law Tom and I disagree a lot about politics. I don’t think we’re “divided,” but we disagree. So he bought me this book and asked me to read it. I’m the cynical type and assumed from the start that it probably reinforced his beliefs and was bound to also reinforce mine and we’d end up a bit further apart, but what the heck, “The Righteous Mind” was a peace offering!It’s really three-books-in-one and author Jonathan Haidt does not attempt to hide that; he does split the book into three parts. The book is held together by the fact that all three parts seek to explore answers to a deep question: what is morality?Part 1 is a less analytical version of a Daniel Kahneman’s “Thinking Fast and Slow” (which, in a wonderful demonstration of the fact that ideas mature simultaneously in people’s heads, came out exactly one year before this book) where instead of System 1 and System 2 you have “the elephant” and “the rider.” Haidt has picked his agents’ size in accordance with his belief that “the elephant” does most of our deciding and that the logical, Cartesian “rider” mainly acts as the “press officer” for “the elephant,” barely ever having any influence on outcomes and most of the time coming up with rational excuses (to ourselves and to everybody else) for all the gut decisions we make.I really really hope he’s wrong. I like to think of myself as somebody who has over time allowed intellect to overcome my deepest nativist, tribalist “wiring” on a whole host of issues. I sincerely hope my first reaction to a number of situations is better informed these days than it was when I was growing up in 1970s Greece. But one has to concede that on issues we have never tackled intellectually we probably run with our instincts.This part of the book is backed up by proper research done in the lab at UVA, it’s not a list of the author’s personal musings. And it has good structure, taking you through all the quirks and all the pathologies (for example, if you’re all “rider” and no “elephant” you’re a psychopath!) and some of the original philosophy on the issue as well (Plato vs. Kant with a bit of Hume thrown in by way of Thomas Jefferson.) And you also get a decent explanation for how our brain adjudicates moral dilemmas in our favor / to our advantage.Part 2 is again based on research taking place in academia, the extensive project Haidt runs at UVA, aimed at establishing a “Moral Foundations Theory.” This seeks to replace the previous dichotomy in moral reasoning between utilitarianism and deontlogy with a wider, descriptive, menu of choices. It is utilitarian, but the claim is that the utility we maximise has deontological inputs. The main take-away here is that humans have six separate “taste receptors” for moral reasoning. We decide wrong or right based on six criteria:1.	Care / Harm2.	Fairness / Cheating3.	Loyalty / Betrayal4.	Authority / Subversion5.	Sanctity / Degradation6.	Liberty / OppressionThe author basically says we decide right from wrong based on how decisions tickle us on all these fronts. And we’re all different people. We’re all programmed by our genes with a set of preferences / tastes in all six departments and through our life, starting with our parents and evolving through our experiences as adults, we build our moral compass based not on a North/South axis like utilitarianism or deontologism, but on how decisions / events score on our personal scoreboard of receptors.He does not just say these things, he has the proof. He runs a massive study that puts questionnaires in front of people. This was a strong reminder for me of how lucky I am not to be a psychology researcher, they must have some of the most boring lives coming up with all these hypothetical scenaria and tallying up the reactions of strangers…From there an ENORMOUS American parenthesis is opened, which in my view detracts from the book. Extensive research done at UVA has shown (and there is zero reason to doubt this, it’s just that I could not care less) that people who identify as liberals (and vote for the Democratic party) mostly care about #1 and #2 above, whereas people who identify as conservative (and vote Republican) actually care for all six. And, as a result, the two are talking at cross purposes because the six ""taste receptors"" may often point to different decisions from the two. Republicans sometimes play down Care and Fairness because they are also attuned to Loyalty, Authority and Sanctity, is the main point, and this drives Democrats crazy. And this, allegedly, explains how a steel worker can still vote for Trump, even though Trump’s shenanigans may actually leave the steelworker worse off.OK, whatever.Part 3 of “The Righteous Mind,” unlike parts 1 and 2, does not involve any academic research, it’s much more the author engaging in a bit of philosophy, mixed with the theory of evolution.For starters, and here I’m fresh off reading “Blueprint” by Nicholas Christakis, who thinks the same, societies are themselves “superorganisms.” We humans got on top of all other creatures because at some point we figured out how to each be part of a tribe that took control of a piece of land. And we owe our very existence to these tribes. Then our DNA evolved along lines that only become possible if you are part of a tribe. So we have a huge brain relative to other animals because our society can take care of babies who are useless for a year after their massive head has managed to get out of the birth canal. But now we’ve got that huge brain, it’s in our DNA that we do.In short, there is interplay between our genetic makeup, our genes, and the way we live our lives and, in particular, the fact that we live in groups.Second, these superorganisms that are our societies / tribes / whatever have a technology (he does not use that word, that’s me being lazy and not looking up in the book what he said) called “religion” that makes groups of people do better. So, you know how religious people are likelier to, dunno, help out the needy? Turns out that is an advantage. Not only that, but religion is full of mysticism / mystery / mind altering stuff whose main aim is to flip “the hive switch” in our brain that temporarily shuts down the 90% of us who is “ape” and activates the 10% of us that is “bee.” When my former classmate Bill Vesterman quit his Wall St. job and enlisted following September 11 that’s what happened in his brain, this book claims: a bit how Robocop has some deep down protocols that don’t come up every day when he’s on the beat, Bill woke up one morning thinking his country needed him more than he needed his Wall St career and that was that, the next five years of his life were spoken for.I like all that, but I don’t like at all Jonathan Haidt’s conclusions.Having established that some people think mainly as individuals and some think mainly as part of the group, he goes on to 1.	claim that both are right, so we westerners need to show more understanding for people with different principles from ours2.	mock John Lennon’s “Imagine” (p. 358) saying it’s basically stupid to think we can smoke people out of their hivesI could not disagree more. Not to spend too much time on this, but I have exactly zero respect for the fact that in Saudi Arabia I could take my son to go watch an execution or a whipping when we’re bored. Our morals are better than theirs, not different. Or rather, more evolved. It was possible to go watch a fun execution in France as recently as 230 years ago, when masses would agglomerate around the guillotine. We westerners are not necessarily more moral than the Saudis, but we’re at a minimum 230 years more advanced, period. I will never come around to the point of view that they have their way on this and we have ours, sorry. That’s not to disparage the Saudis, it’s to prove by contradiction that Haidt has reached a wrong conclusion.And I really really take issue with the general idea that conservative culture derives any superiority from emphasizing loyalty / authority / sanctity of a particular inside group versus that of the whole. Rather than mock the words of John Lennon, Haidt would do well to try and understand them.I regardless found this to be an excellent book, because I never could have written these paragraphs if I had not read “The Righteous Mind.”"
42,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22938523-jacob-appel,5,"In the name of full disclosure, this is not the sort of book I usually read, but Haidt and I happened to have been taught by the same high school English teacher (about ten years apart) and that teacher's husband passed along the book to me. I am very glad that he did. Haidt has amassed considerable data in the social psychology of liberals and conservatives, advancing an argument that self-described liberals pay more attention only to three domains (care, liberty, fairness) while largely dismissing three others (loyalty, authority, sanctity) while self-described conservatives value all six to different degrees. The results have significant implications for the American political system. Having read through a number of the negative reviews on this site, I want to emphasize that this is empirical data, not a normative argument. And I found the data both revealing and potentially helpful for when I teach and engage with others. Haidt draws heavily upon the arguments of Scottish philosopher David Hume and French sociologist Emile Durkheim to construct a broader explanation for human political and social behavior. I confess that I haven't read Hume since college or Durkheim since graduate school, so I am far from an expert and rely on Haidt's assessments. (If nothing else, maybe this book will see more families discussing Durkheim at the dinner table.) I do think it worth mentioning that many critics question Durkheim's methods--for example, his approach to the comparison of Catholic and Protestant suicide rates--so I am reluctant to fully embrace Durkheim's world view on Haidt's data alone, although he has certain made a plausible case. (Incidentally, Edmund Burke receives only three mentions in passing....)I don't necessary accept Haidt's normative propositions, and toward the end of the book, his claims grow somewhat less persuasive. I am reminded of Peter Singers observation, ""On the facts of human nature, they might be right, but they would be wrong to draw a moral conclusion from those facts."" Haidt can tell us a lot about how people do behave and offer some insight into why. But he cannot tell us how people should behave. Sure, we can all stand to listen and learn from one another. And yes, as he says in channeling John Stuart Mill and Bertrand Russell, all of history is marked by the tensions between a party of stability and order, on the one hand, and a party of progress and reform, on other other--and there is often benefit in that dialectic. The challenge is that sometimes one of those parties goes off the rails (think the Khmer Rouge or Madame Defarge on the left, or Alexander III of Russia and the Pinochet/Videla/Medici darkness on the right), and figuring out if that has occurred -- when the pendulum swings too far -- is a moral challenge that empirical data simply cannot answer.As I am a bioethicist and writer, not a social psychologist, I merely offer some reflective musings on what I found to be a highly engaging and informative book. Well worth the read. I do urge others to pick up a copy and form their own opinions. "
43,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11772404-rheama-heather,4,"1. Fascinating exploration of the cultural construct of morality.2. If you skim through the dry academic research bits, that is. (There’s a lot of those.)3. I happened to watch  I, Tonya  this weekend, and that film and this book complement each other perfectly. “What’s the truth? We all have our own version of the truth.”"
44,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25360918-blair,5,"A Change of Mind…Once upon a time, as a good liberal, Jonathan Haidt used to believe that people acted mainly from rational motives. Morality was something we learned from experience, by trial and error. Much of it is simply meaningless social convention, but some of it has value as a means of preventing harm. Religion, of course, is an irrational relic from the past that is now impeding our progress.Today, as a good scientist investigating the psychology of morality, he tells us that the evidence he has found requires that he longer believe those things.…Based on a Theory of MindWhat we like to call our reason, or rational mind, is only a small part of what is happening inside our brain. Socrates grasped this concept (reason should rule), and this idea is now well established in modern psychology and neuroscience. Haidt likens our reason to a rider on an elephant, where the elephant usually decides what to do, and the rider justifies that decision to support the illusion about who is in charge. The metaphor of a public relations officer is also used. The rider often has little insight into what the elephant is thinking.The mind is a story processor that we use to construct a narrative to interpret our life experiences. These narratives are not necessarily true stories – they are simplified and selective reconstructions of the past, often connected to an idealized vision of the future. Life narratives are saturated with morality.I think this model is too simplistic, so I will correct it. The rider (our reason) is there for a reason: the strategic planning that the elephant (our unconscious) cannot do. The elephant obeys the rider’s commands, but the rider gets all its information from the elephant. The “public relations officer”, or storyteller, is part of the elephant, meaning that it operates at an unconscious level. The elephant generally knows what it is doing, so it is easier for the rider to believe its stories. The rider can train the elephant, but this requires a lot of hard work. So we usually don’t bother.A Morality that Binds and BlindsAny social order requires its members to put some of their selfish desires aside and work as a team. Force is a crude and expensive way to achieve this. Morality is a set of rules that members of a society internalize to get them to behave as a group. It is mainly learned unconsciously from the behavior of those around you, with a rational frosting on top to justify it.Religion is not simply a useless meme colonizing people’s minds. It is essential to establishing a moral order that binds us together to create a sense of belonging. As Haidt puts it, using an evolutionary perspective, “Religiosity evolved because successful religions made groups more efficient at turning resources into offspring. Europeans are the least religious, and turn their ample resources into few offspring.” Those who have a different version of morality are viewed with disgust and contempt. Haidt likes to tell us that morality that both binds us to our group, and blinds us to the motivations of those outside it. Thus our righteous minds reflect needs of the tribal society we originally evolved from.Binding and Blinding for Liberals and ConservativesHaidt then tries to apply his theory of morality to today’s culture war. To understand what he is telling us, we must clearly distinguish between theoretical liberalism and conservatism on one hand, and political parties that use those terms but are actually an inconsistent alliance of convenience between various interest groups. For example, conservatives support a free market and technological progress that is radically affecting our social structures. Liberals tend to resist anything that might change the physical environment from how it used to be.Haidt contends that political beliefs are based on fundamental character traits. In general, liberals are novelty seeking, and are more open to other cultures. They have less need for order, structure and closure. Conservatives react more strongly to perceived threats, and care more about guarding boundaries and traditions. Conservatives “trust their gut”, meaning they defend the unconscious ideas instilled by their culture. Liberals trust their reason, forgetting that reason is often motivated by other unconscious ideas.Part of our liberal story is how much more rational and open-minded we are than conservatives. Haidt points out that studies asking people to pretend to be their political opponents show that conservatives have a much better understanding of liberal thinking than the other way around. It seems that liberal group-think is the more blinding.Political Stories about Moral FoundationsThe central idea of the book is that morality is based on multiple foundations. He identifies six, but of course they overlap and could be divided differently. He contends that liberal morality is based on fewer of those foundations than conservative morality. I would put it differently. Both sides tell a story that emphasizes different foundations, but in reality they both have very selective interpretations of all of them. Here is my view of his moral foundations:Fairness: Everyone loves fairness, but its interpretation reveals very different ways of seeing the world. Liberals see fairness as a collective entitlement to equality of outcomes, while for conservatives it means an individual’s right to earn wealth through hard work and initiative.Care: This foundation is central to the liberal story. Liberals tend to care about people they don’t know, such as minorities at home or oppressed people overseas. This kind of caring is becoming elevated into a cult of the “victim”. Conservatives also care, but tend to confine it to people like themselves who they actually know.Liberty: Liberals want liberty from moral restraint, while conservatives are more concerned with economic liberty. Both claim to support freedom of expression, but are willing to suppress it if there is a threat to their other values.Loyalty: Conservatives are known for expecting loyalty to their nation and it symbols. But I think liberals are just as loyal to their own less visible values. Look at the hysterical reaction to anything perceived as offending victims, such a remark that can be interpreted as racist.Authority: Respect for authority is part of the conservative story. Liberals think of authority as oppressive, but they are willing to use the authority of the state to enforce some of their moral values.Sanctity: Haidt loves to test reactions to a scenario such as “A man bought a chicken, used it for sex, then cooked and ate it. Nobody saw this happen.” Conservatives are unconditionally disgusted, while liberals observe that nobody got hurt. But liberals can be sanctimonious about different issues that are important to them.A Few Politically Incorrect NotionsA culture war about human nature has been raging for hundreds of years. Conservatives claim human nature is fixed, and we dare not change the ancient wisdom that keeps our impulses contained. Liberals contend that the mind is a blank slate, and humanity is perfectible with the right thinking and social intervention.Haidt points out that the evidence does not fully support the liberal side, claiming that genetics determines many aspects of our personalities. “We are talking about the degree to which you like jazz, spicy foods, abstract art, your likelihood of getting a divorce or dying in a car crash; your degree of religiosity, and your political orientation as an adult.” I think any parent with children can confirm that. He tells us there are measurable genetic differences between liberals and conservatives, mainly related to neurotransmitter function. I have not had time to check if this really reflects the best thinking of the scientific community. It is interesting to see Siddhartha Mukherjee in The Gene: An Intimate History confirm the genetic basis of novelty seeking, a key liberal character trait.“Diversity” has been elevated into a central liberal value. It amounts to a celebration of all the different-looking people who agree with us. There is much less tolerance for any conservative contribution to political diversity.Haidt points out that emphasizing diversity actually worsens anti-social attitudes such as racism. He states, “Ethnic diversity reduces social capital. It reduces both bridging (trust between groups) and bonding (trust within a group), and leads to isolation.” This is not intended as an excuse for segregation. He advocates we try to focus on the common similarities uniting diverse people in order to build social cohesion. It is a direct rebuke to seeing diversity as a positive value, as we do when we celebrate ideas such as multiculturalism.Read It and ThinkI have read this book twice, several years apart. Both times I have been deeply impressed with his insight into why we behave the way we do. The book is not intended as an even-handed political analysis, so forget the “why doesn’t he criticize conservative hypocrisy?” And no, his definition of a liberal might not match yours. If you think he is being unfair, that simply shows how limited your thinking is.Progress in our thinking and understanding can only be achieved by overcoming the instincts that interfere with clear thinking. The rider needs to learn to do the hard work to gain better control over the elephant. This book is a useful step in that journey."
45,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/103651878-talia-debenedictis,5,"What a great book! I feel like I’ve been saying this a lot recently but this is an important read!It feels comical to attempt to summarize the key ideas in this book because Jonathan Haidt is a master of communicating, teaching and most importantly ingraining ideas and arguments. So, to write a short synopsis of this book I will use Haidts’ book’s tag-line, “Why good people are divided by politics and religion”. In today’s societal and political climate, I often feel like people’s thoughts on other parties or groups sounds like “they are idiots”, “they are stupid”, “they are mean”, “they are ignorant”, “they are evil”. But when you listen to people try to explain their beliefs, sometimes even in super logical arguments, it seems to never land with people on the opposing side. Haidt spends most of his book addressing why this is the case. Towards the end of the book, after you as a reader gain Haidt’s trust, he suggests a path forward towards flourishing community and common understanding in our country. To give some context for what Haidt discusses, here are the three “principles” that he expounds upon in the book:1. Intuitions come First, Strategic Reasoning Second2. There’s More to Morality than Harm and Fairness3. Morality Binds and BlindsHaidt’s ideas, research and arguments are incredibly persuasive. I think he accurately describes what many Americans experience in terms of defining morality and engaging with the morality of others. And it gives language for how to discuss these ideas without getting into a yelling match over Donald Trump. Conservatism and liberalism are SO much bigger than Trump versus Bernie. I am eager to use Haidt’s work to start conversations with my family and friends.I couldn’t review this book without commenting on maybe my favorite part, Haidt’s writing. He is an extraordinary teacher. The book is academic, contains lots of research, is almost 400 pages but is digestible for your average curious reader. And I would argue that is due to Haidt’s ability to teach. For example, before he discusses each idea, he tells you exactly what he is about to explain and at the end of each chapter includes a summary of what he just wrote, to an extreme degree by making it a section at the end of each chapter called “IN SUM”. I think I learned as much about teaching, persuasion and communication as the psychology he was presenting. At least for me, when I am being taught an abstract idea (such as the findings from PhD moral psychology research) I can track with the concepts if they are explained in enough detail. But the idea is still fresh and not a part of my day to day vocabulary. If someone starts building upon that idea, I fall off. If I keep reading, I likely will only soak in about 50%- 75% of what the author is attempting to communicate, which is such a shame! BUT, thankfully and refreshingly Jonathan Haidt is not that communicator! He ingrains ideas by repeating or reframing concepts a sometimes annoyingly large number of times. By the end I was like “I get it! I function like a rider on an elephant!” But that concept, explained in chapter one, is now deeply cemented in my mind and I can grasp ideas that build on top of it.TLDR; All to say, great book! A dense but digestible entry into moral psychology and a important foundation for understanding the beliefs of people not like you."
46,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,5,"The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion, by Jonathon Haidt, is a disquieting book. And also exciting. Haidt is an engaging and thoughtful writer. I much enjoyed his previous book, The Happiness Hypothesis, in part because he pulls together diverse information to draw a larger story.  Righteous Mind develops many of the same themes – the elephant metaphor plays large again – to conclude that we believe we are rational, but our rational mind only serves to justify our intuitions.Haidt argues that our moral sense underlies our political leanings and the elephant leans according to our moral sense, with the rider only explaining these leanings. We liberals, according to Haidt, draw our conclusions from only two moral taste buds – Care and Liberty – while conservatives have a broader palate, also paying attention to Authority, Fairness, Loyalty, and Divinity (libertarians have an even narrower palate than liberals). He argues that liberals would be more effective in communicating with the larger population if we spoke to the whole spectrum of moral values.I read Righteous Mind as another in my string of books trying to understand our president-elect and the 2016 election. I have been persuaded by both Vance (Hillbilly Elegy) and Haidt to consider how we communicate, although it remains difficult for me to understand why Trump is seen as the common man, while Hillary Clinton and Barrack Obama are ""elites."" I understand the electorate's desire for a ""disruptor"" – and Trump seems well-suited to that position – although I would prefer a disruptor who refocused the path than one who blew it up. Nonetheless, I am frustrated and confused that Trump ignores or bends facts to fit his thesis (clearly, this attacks a strong value of mine). It makes no sense that many voters were willing to vote based on what Trump claims, rather than his history of actions (of bankruptcies, defaults on contracts, sexual assault, and verbal attacks. Go back, though, to the elephant metaphor: we are not rational beings first and foremost, but act based on intuitive reactions to moral issues. While I'm not happy with this argument (back to my values), Haidt argues that the elephant leans and the rider explains – and in most cases, there is evidence both for and against (although I would argue that the evidence is not equal on both sides of the argument). It is somehow our job to frame our arguments – honestly – so they are heard by people like us, but also by people with different backgrounds and values.Haidt also argues that we need to listen to a diversity of viewpoints. It's not just that we should speak for a diverse audience, we should also listen to a diverse group, as our arguments and solutions will be richer when we do.I'm trying."

Here's why:1/ It is a beautiful melange of many insights from various fields psychology,philosphy, history, biology, sociology that is set out to explain why people are divided by politics and religion... Well-written, well-organized with summary at the end of each point made. 2/ My frame of thinking about the world changed and much needed to contemplate onwards. The book hit me at so many levels that my conscious mind can not grasp and express it all at once. All the books i've read in biology/evolution, atheism/religion connect with this one to open a grand new perspective on human mind.. One notable point for me: The rejection of rationalist view from New Atheism and (R.Dawkins, S.Harris, D.Dennett and except C.Hitchens). The arguments are developed throughout the books and mostly concentrated in 1st and 3rd principle of moral psychology. Moral Psychology- 1st Principle of: Intuition comes 1st then strategic thinking. The metaphor Rider/Elephant: Elephant (Intuition) often in control of Rider (Reason) but not a dictator. The process: Triggering event - Intuition - Judgement - Reasoning. David Hume's view: Reason serves Passion.- 2nd Principle: The plurality of morality, rejects moral relativism. There is more of Morality than just Care/Harm, Fairness. There is no one true configuration of morality for all societies, time and place.The author laid out 6 dimensions and analyse how they fit into Liberal/Conversative or other society's moral matrix: Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheat, Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, Sanctity/Divinity, Liberty/Oppresion. - 3rd Principle: Morality binds and blinds people.

These topics are singled out of course because they tend to be the two that people are most passionate about, and which therefore have the greatest potential to cause enmity and strife. According to the psychologist Jonathan Haidt, the fact that we disagree over politics and religion is not necessarily such a bad thing. For him, though, the current wrangling between political and religious (and non-religious) factions has gotten rather out of hand, as it has recently reached such a pitch in the West (and particularly in America where Haidt resides) as to be threatening the very fabric of our nations.Now, according to Haidt, at least some of the enmity and strife between people of different political and religious stripes is caused by a failure to understand precisely where these beliefs ultimately come from--as well as a failure to understand how one's opponents understand their own beliefs. In an effort to remedy this situation, and to bring a degree of civility back into the ongoing debate, Haidt sets out to supply just these understandings in his new book `The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion'.According to Haidt, understanding political and religious beliefs begins with an understanding of the human moral sense as it was laid down by evolution over the past several million years. For Haidt, the moral sense actually consists of (at least) six moral modules, each of which evolved to answer a specific challenge that our ancestors faced in the environment in which our species evolved. Briefly, the six moral modules are 1. The Care/Harm Module; 2. The Fairness/Cheating Module; 3. The Loyalty/Betrayal Module; 4. The Authority/Subversion Module; 5. The Liberty/Oppression Module; and 6.The Sanctity/Degradation Module.While all of us come prewired with the six moral modules, each of them stands to be either amplified or quieted as well as somewhat modified by a host of internal and external factors. The internal factors include our personality and its development, while the external factors include the environment in which we are raised (including our cultural milieu), and the particular experiences that we have--the latter of which help to shape, among other things, our view of human nature, which itself influences our view of what a good society consists in. It is these internal and external factors--which differ for all of us--that explain the plurality of moral and political views and ideologies across cultures, as well as within the same culture across individuals.In addition to the six moral modules, Haidt maintains that human beings have also evolved an overlay of group-oriented sentiment or `groupishness' sometime in the past 140,000 years, and as recently as in the past 10,000 years. This `groupishness', Haidt claims, not only explains some of our moral and political sentiments, but also helps explain our attraction to religion, and other group-oriented pursuits, such as our fondness for teams, clubs and other such organizations. While our groupishness is particularly adept at binding us to the organizations of which we are a part, it also sets us against those who are a part of opposing groups, and makes it especially difficult for us to identify with them and to appreciate their point of view. The end result is that people not only have opposing viewpoints when it comes to morality, politics and religion, but they are often even unable to appreciate (or truly understand) the viewpoints of their rivals--hence why politics and religion are such flashpoint topics.For Haidt, though, once we come to understand where our political and religious views are ultimately coming from, it should be easier for us to appreciate the views of our opponents, which should help us to see that they may in fact have something to offer to the debate. And indeed, when it comes to politics, Haidt maintains that both the left and the right do have something to contribute to the matter, and that the best solution to the political problem requires borrowing insights from both sides.The book showcases a very thorough and comprehensive understanding of where our moral, political and religious beliefs ultimately come from, and an informed and nuanced approach to the political and religious debate. There is much to be learned here and I highly recommend the book. A full executive summary of the book is available here: http://newbooksinbrief.com/2012/04/02..."
49,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6192529-frieda-vizel,1,"Disclaimer: I could not finish this; I read half and then the conclusion.If someone with a prestigious title and bloated vocabulary talks a long enough shpiel, you will eventually lose sight of their actual stream of logic and agree with their conclusion merely because you lose trust in your ability to follow. It's the ""talk until they nod glassy eyed"" approach to rhetoric. It's pathetic.Such is the ploy of this very effective intellectually fraudulent work, which should be called Morality Twister, the game. The fallacies are especially hard to spot when they are dressed up as allegories. After all, will you disagree that an elephant does most of the walking, and the rider only has partial control? You might not even care to have an opinion here, or not even realize that you agreed with the premise because you let your guard down as you trudged through this fine African safari while the author led you to a conclusion about ethics, morality and politics. You agreed on a premise about elephants - the latter of which you really might know nothing of - I don't - but in the end of the ride, your elephant has taken off and is flying into total absurdity, but you go along with it, because after all, you are merely a rider. And there you are, in Wonderland on your saddle, agreeing that -- you are confused? Morality is relative? Conservatives are logical? Wait, what are we talking about, hand me a drink in a hollowed out coconut and blow the sand out of my sandals. This vacation is weird.Yup. Furious.The book is filled with flaws that are hard to see because the logic isn't lucid. It's all allegory, storytelling and suspect statistics. And name dropping. I'd file this book under the genre of ""NYTimes op-eds by absurd talking heads commissioned so as to include the inane with the thinkers, so as to represent all American voices."" I.e.1. Claim: 'accurate definitions of morality are deduced using only the scientific method, not theory.' I just read Neil Postman's book on the Technopoly, in which he derides the use of the scientific method in the social sciences. Postman makes arguments better than I ever can, showing that the use of ""numbers"" and ""proof"" to understand the human condition is flawed. (he cites the couple that's been together for years but still takes a test to see if they are a good fit!) If we remove all the ""data"" from these arguments, nothing is left.2. Claim: The author ""proved"" Shweder's claim that morality is more than about not causing harm. How? By 1, using the 'scientific method' and asking his study subjects if anyone got harmed by cutting up a flag, which the subjects saw as problematic. The author has zero awareness that framing the question as ""did someone get harmed"" versus ""did this do harm to someone or something"" would garner quite different results. He does not seem to realize that the concept of moral harm incorporates protecting the collective and the social narrative, a preservation technique most people are not aware of and can't explain. So if you frame the question as: did someone get harmed? You would predictably hear that it is not so, even though in the larger context these actions, which fracture the social cohesion, are a threat to the group and hence, the people. Even though, the reason people protect social conventions is because they are afraid of the harm that comes from dissolving them.3. Claim: Because humans clearly don't only derive their moral compass from reason, we must conclude that morality is hardy a product of reason.Seriously; can we oversimplify more? 4. Claim: 'Morality is not about emotion versus reason. It is about intuition versus reason.' I would suggest the author consider the argument that morality comes from the physical heart and reason from the brain, because we are really still stuck at a time in which either or dichotomies are the most reasonable explanations. ::sarcasm::5. Claim: 'Intuition fuels reason.' Again, oversimplification. Intuition is the learned behavior, the less analytic aspects of human nature. It works alongside the logical mind in harmony, one system complimenting the other. 6. Claim: 'Reason is post-hoc to explain our biases.' The author discovered the chicken-and-egg answer! Viola, oh-so-simple, isn't it!Etc, etc, etc."
50,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2706364-ross-holmes,2,"Was sitting at around 3 stars for this book until the last chapter, where Haidt drops all psychology and starts talking only about politics, and borderline sermonizing about The Free Market in a way that his little to do with his thesis. Would I have been less annoyed by this move if I agreed with him, as a lot of this book is trying to suggest? Probably, but because it set off my annoyance alarms, it's more apparent to me that this move is disjointed and unwelcome. Haidt's research is extremely interesting, but his conclusions are consistently frustrating. I think a large part of why I found this so frustrating is that my own trajectory has been so opposite Haidt's. This book is openly not only a psychological study, but also the story of how studying moral psychology took Haidt from being a self proclaimed ""liberal (democrat) partisan"" and atheist to siding more often with conservatives as he learned to understand their ways of thinking and desire for sanctity and tradition. As a leftist who was raised tea-party conservative, and as a Christian who maintains a grip on the ""sanctity"" dimension of politics that Haidt laments a lack of on the left, I think he makes a lot of major missteps in his engagement with conservatism that he might have avoided it if he hadn't approached it as an outsider. Most importantly, he frequently makes the classic evolutionary-psychology mistake of assuming that ""this behavior is explained by an adaptation that was at one point beneficial to the survival of some group of humans"" implies ""this behavior is justifiable and possibly even good"" on any level. Early on, the fact that his trip to India and association with rich Indian families led him to feel that he should excuse culturally ingrained classism and misogyny is a major red flag (and ignores social movements within that country). More tellingly, in the last chapter, his major complaint about the faults of ""liberal"" policies is that they erode important traditions and hierarchies--in other words, they're wrong because they don't have conservative priorities! You would think he should be immune to a tautology like that this deep into the study of why people on the opposite sides of politics have trouble understanding each other. Overall, this book was a pretty even split between frustrating and enlightening. Reviews also seem to be evenly split between sides of the political spectrum, which I guess proves some of Haidt's points--both to his benefit and to his detriment."
51,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,4,"This is probably the best book that I’ve read when it comes to explaining the origin of morality in humans and how it developed and shaped us as individuals and societies. It makes a great case for the theory that, when it comes to morality, intuition comes first and reasoning second. Our moral judgments are largely based on our gut feelings – or to be more scientifically accurate, based on how our prefrontal cortex reacts to a situation. The book also makes a (less convincing) case for group selection and that religion played a crucial role in our evolutionary history. The most important part of the book is where Haidt tries to break down moral psychology into six principles which are held across all societies and cultures. He then uses this to explain why perfectly good and sane people can have such widely divergent opinions about moral and political issues. He picks the American liberal-conservative conflict as a focus example to develop this theory. It turns out that liberals mainly use only three out of six moral foundations, whereas conservatives put roughly the same emphasis on all six. The fact that liberals (and various types of free-thinkers throughout human history) reject the other three foundations (loyalty, authority, sanctity) for moral reasons and because they can contradict the first three foundations (care, liberty, fairness) doesn’t cross Haidt’s mind apparently. Haidt himself is an atheist liberal. This book is a worthy effort to make everyone see the roots of our conflicts with others regarding moral and political issues. That’s all fine, and now I can see better how the other side is thinking, but does this mean that I’m supposed to rethink my opinion that someone like Newt Gingrich is a big festering pile of shit? Absolutely not. It’s impossible that I’m not right about this. "
52,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3178652-adam,5,"I don't just suggest you read this- I dare you. I had two very distinct experiences with this book. During the first half, I was impressed and, honestly, amazed at Haidt's effortless ability to express things about American politics that I've never heard expressed before. I can't say that I felt particularly challenged by Haidt's analyses, but I had a delightful experience of, ""Oh, yeah, that. I never heard it put that way, but it makes a lot of sense now."" The second half, though, had me wanting to throw the book at the wall. I don't like to think of myself as politically dogmatic, but I found myself having intense emotional reactions to some of Haidt's positions. Luckily, I didn't just burn the damned thing, I kept reading. I won't add any spoilers, I'll just say that my mind was blown... in a good way. I imagine it will be hard for many readers to open their minds and actually hear what Haidt has to say. I know it was for me. So, yeah, read it. I dare you."
53,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,2,"37th book for 2018.The core of the book is Haidt's ""Moral Foundations Theory"", which posits that human morality is based around six moral dimensions (i.e., care/harm; liberty/oppression; fairness/cheating; loyalty/betrayal; authority/subversion; sanctity/perversion). He applies MFT to political affiliations and finds that those on the left of politics are mostly concerned with care, liberty and fairness, whereas those on the right care about ALL six dimensions; which is the reason (according to Haidt) that Republicans keep winning elections against democrats. There is just too much fluff in the book. He never really explains how he derived the MFT dimensions? Are the dimensions really independent? If conservatives offer a more inclusive morality why are the Republicans so much more partisan and less collegial (e.g., see: How Democracies Die). The discussion of group selection seemed ill-connected to the rest of the book. Not sure why this book got such great ratings.2-stars."
54,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,5,"Fascinating--especially if you want to gain some empathy for people on the ""other side"" of the political spectrum. Haidt follows 5 moral centers through evolutionary history to show why we care about loyalty, care, etc...However, he doesn't fully explain why some people prefer only two of them (liberals) vs. all five (like conservatives). "
55,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4251182-david,4,This was a fascinating book that does not come down on the left or right but sees value in both and that the way forward is to be found in a conversation between the two. 4 out of 5 stars Highly Recommended.

57,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6108634-therese,5,"A fascinating exploration of the question of why really nice, good, kind people can wind up diametrically opposed on political issues. The style is extremely readable - by turns using storytelling, personal biography, and humor to make its points while connecting the dots engagingly between vast quantities of research from different disciplines, including social psychology, anthropology, neuroscience, evolutionary biology, philosophy, and on and on.Some of the big ideas here are that ideological, moral, and political diversity are necessary and beneficial to us as individuals, groups, and as a species. Our thought processes have evolved to make us terrible at critiquing our own ideas, great at rationalizing them, and excellent at critiquing others' ideas. So, we really do need people disagreeing with us to help us learn and grow and discover where we're wrong. Another major point is that moral diversity and pluralism are for real - there isn't one essential morality that we just have to discover through a process of logical reasoning, and that we either virtuously practice or wickedly fail to practice. Instead, Haidt identifies six ""moral foundations,"" or key virtues, that turn up over and over again in his research to understand the different value systems of individuals and groups. Different people combine those values in different ways, giving them different weights, and tell different stories about them. People may be predisposed toward some of the moral foundations more than others, but they also can revise and rewrite the stories as they go and change their views. So, in Haidt's telling, what we end up with is not ""anything goes"" moral relativism where anything anyone does is cool (an idea I remember from grad school when I lived in a group house with a bunch of anthropologists who were assholes - they would joke that they could justify just about anything morally, including stealing other people's breakfast cereal, because undoubtedly there was some obscure tribe somewhere that considered it moral behavior ...) Instead it's moral pluralism, where there are different ways of conceiving of moral values that appear repeatedly across cultures. To my mind, this goes toward an argument for seeking to preserve a pluralist, multiparty democracy that allows for dissent, debate, disagreement, and interparty cooperation and understanding, as well as civility, respect, and kindness toward those who disagree with us, rather than demonizing them as immoral.One question the book raised for me, though, had to do with his research and conclusions about the way liberals and conservatives (as U.S. politics conceives these terms) weight the different moral foundations. He finds that on a spectrum from politically left to politically right, those further left place a very high value on Care and Fairness, and a very low value on Authority, Loyalty, and Sanctity, while those on the far right place a fairly equal value on all six moral foundations. What he doesn't discuss is that where the values end up on the right is in the middle of the scale of weighting of the values, which makes me wonder whether an alternative interpretation is that it's not that conservatives care about all six of the foundations, but rather, that they are kind of indifferent to all six. I wonder if a possible explanation there is that the foundation of Authority serves as kind of an overarching value for conservatives, so that instead of thinking about moral foundations and differentiating between, conservatives believe in just following authority to decide which virtue is most important in any given situation. As in, perhaps they are more often unthinking and unreflective about morality, because of their trust in authority, while liberals tend to agonize more individualistically about which values to prioritize (and this follows from their rejection of the value of Authority). I don't know if that's at all plausible, but it does create room for a less complimentary vision of conservatives than Haidt's - since Haidt suggests that conservatives have an edge over liberals in valuing a broader swath of possible moral foundations, such that they can reach and influence people better with their rhetoric."
58,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5940482-alex-stroshine,5,"This has been one of the most thought-provoking books I've read all year. As I read along I kept thinking to myself, ""This makes sense, people are driven by their moral intuitions rather than sober reason (except for me, right?)!""In ""The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided By Politics And Religion,"" moral psychologist Jonathan Haidt effectively demonstrates that our culture's proclivity to value reason is unwarranted. Instead, we are moved more by our moral intuitions, our beliefs, and only after reacting do we find intellectual or rational justification for our beliefs. Haidt uses the metaphor of an elephant and a rider; the elephant are our beliefs and intuitions and the rider is our reasoning. Haidt explains, ""The rider is skilled at fabricating post hoc explanations for whatever the elephant has just done, and it is good at finding reasons to justify whatever the elephant wants to do next"" (p. 54). Haidt observes that ""Reasoning can take us to almost any conclusion we want to reach, because we ask, 'Can I believe it?' when we want to believe something, but 'Must I believe it?' when we don't want to believe. The answer is almost always yes to the first question and no to the second"" (p. 107).A significant portion of the book is dedicated to Haidt's ""Moral Foundations Theory"" which is based on six foundations: care/harm, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, sanctity/degradation, and liberty/oppression. According to Haidt's analysis, liberals gravitate to the first two foundations and liberty/oppression while conservatives are able to tap into all six, although different strands of conservatism stress different foundations (libertarians prize liberty/oppression above all, whereas social conservatives more evenly divide the six foundations). This gives conservatives a big advantage because they are able to rouse people in more ways by appealing to a larger set of deeply-held beliefs.Haidt also discusses WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrial, Rich, and Democratic) morality. This morality is prevalent among liberals in North America, Europe and Australia who seek to impose it upon their compatriots and the Global South, but WEIRD morality is ironically NOT reflective of many of these cultures, especially in the Global South itself. Unlike much of the world, during the Enlightenment the West made a fundamental switch in its conception of society from a sociocentric to an individualistic culture (p. 16-17), although we still find ourselves desiring to be ""groupish.""Throughout the book Haidt utilizes the results of studies and explains his own evolution in thinking about moral psychology. He admits that before he conducted studies in India, he was a standard liberal who easily dismissed the conservative moral vision but even though he still identifies with liberal politics (he was motivated to pursue research into moral foundations theory because he lamented how John Kerry and the Democrats seemed unable to tap into moral foundations during the 2004 campaign) he is gracious and even-handed, fairly representing other sides. He draws on evolutionary psychology a lot while also touting the insights of the famous French sociologist Emile Durkheim. He quotes neuroscientist Gary Marcus who explains, ""Nature bestows upon the newborn a considerably complex brain, but one that is best seen as PREWIRED - flexible and subject to change - rather than HARDWIRED, fixed, and immutable"" and ""Nature provides a first draft, which experience then revises...'built-in' does not mean unmalleable; it means 'ORGANIZED IN ADVANCE OF EXPERIENCE'"" (p. 152-53). This book is more like a 4.5/5. There is a lot of content, a lot of paradigm-shifting. It certainly warrants a re-read. Haidt very helpfully provides summaries at the end of each chapter that recall the key points he's raised and that help remind readers of the content. I'd like to think my rider is much more in control than my elephant but Haidt provides a provocative and stimulating study of human nature and morality. "
59,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"Haidt's The Righteous Mind is a really fascinating book. I don't know where you'd categorise it -- I've read people saying moral psychology, political philosophy, sociology, anthropology... As far as I can gather, Haidt gathers up research and thought from different fields in setting out this book. And what does he seek to explore? Well, not so much ""why good people are divided by politics and religion"", as the subtitle would have it, but the more fundamental question: why do people make different moral decisions with the same information? He pulls in a lot of research as he goes through this. The fact that disgust makes people more conservative; if you can portray something as dirty (Jewish people, gay people, whatever kind of sex you disapprove of, people of colour, people with disabilities) then you're halfway to calling it immoral already. Particularly for people who tend to be more conservative anyway. In fact, more easily disgusted people are usually more politically and socially conservative. (I'm an aberration; now I think about it, I wonder if that's because I have obsessive-compulsive tendencies causing my fear of germs and disgust responses, rather than actually thinking that way naturally.)A lot of this, I've come across before, but not synthesised into a full theory like this. (Paul Bloom uses a lot of the same ideas, for example. Particularly in his Coursera course on Moralities of Everyday Life). Mostly, it worked for me. Some of Haidt's analogies and examples are a little clunky. The elephant (emotion)/rider (rationality) metaphor gets increasingly ridiculous the more he uses it, despite the aptness of the metaphor in some ways. Likewise the 'taste receptor' analogy for moral issues. I don't know how much he tested this out on people outside his field, but I think he does need to look for feedback on his imagery.I tried to watch myself for knee-jerk reactions while reading this. Reading other reviews made me smile wryly, as other people reacted immediately to what they perceived as the thrust of Haidt's argument without reasoning it through. The fact that Haidt divides morality up into six regions which are more or less relevant to every culture really annoys people right off, particularly when he then shows that research has liberals focusing on three of these areas while conservatives focus on all six. As a matter of fact, Haidt seems to hold fairly liberal views himself. He's not criticising the goals of the liberal movement so much as a short sightedness that's preventing liberal politicians making the gains they could.It's basically a validation of the positive sides of conservative and libertarian ethics. It's mostly an American Democrat writing about American Republicans, and trying to uncover the way they think and the reasonable basis for their beliefs and moral decisions.What I don't think he's doing is saying that liberalism is bad, that conservatism is automatically the answer, or that the core values of liberalism are wrong. He's looking at the positive aspects of both sides, seeing them as a yin and yang system, rather than diametrically opposed systems on their own.I'm gonna confess that my politics probably fall fairly close to Haidt's, so I'm not the best person to pick holes in his argument. To me, some of it felt clumsy due to the imagery he employed, but most of it made sense. I'm now reading Sam Harris, who advocates reason and scientifically proven morality, which doesn't fit into Haidt's system well at all. I'm looking forward to seeing how that goes.I will just note that from this, Haidt is capable of considering other people's views. He makes a good response to Dawkins' atheism, for example, and does a good job of laying out Dawkins' position. Harris, on the other hand... This may be me projecting, but he has a kind of arrogance in the way he writes (and in the way he speaks -- I've watched both of them lecture) that turns me off. I'm having a very hard time not knee-jerking in response."
60,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3440334-fred-forbes,5,"I really feel a need to award 5 stars to a book that makes me think as much as this one did. I am an independent voter who had Republican leanings until 8 years of Bush/Cheney cured me of that. I tend to be a Libertarian on social issues and a fiscal conservative (who, with a background in business knows that cost cutting is only part of the fiscal equation; revenue increases need to be addressed to arrive at a balanced solution.)But, I wondered why folks who scream for less government and more freedom and less regulation are the very same folks who want to impose their religious beliefs (gay marriage, abortion, etc.)and restraints on the rest of us. And why do poor rural whites line up behind those folks who do them more harm than good with regard to their economic interests - kill the unions, don't raise the minimum wage, don't provide medical benefits, etc.? Well, I read ""What's the Matter with Kansas"" for some of the answers - mainly, the less educated, lower middle class tend to get distracted by drummed up social issues. ""Duped"" it the favored term that liberals apply to the phenomenon.Well, according to this book, it isn't that simple! Some of the other reviewers have gone into greater detail on the basic theoretical framework of this book so I won't do that here. But I went in wondering why some of my friends and acquaintances who are intelligent, educated and moral folks have difficulty in appreciating the ""wisdom"" of many of my positions despite the evidence and well reasoned logic. (Ahem.) This book provides some illuminating information and I highly recommend it for those who might want to see some semblance of civility return to our political discourse.I should point out that the book has a strong academic bent which will put some people off. Since I majored in Psych with a minor in Economics then went on for an MBA, I actually enjoy that orientation. I found myself at times wondering how, when a specific position is postulated, were they going to design an experiment to prove it and was often impressed by the creativity that resulted.A worthy read for those with an interest in politics and moral psychology."
61,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4046026-dawna,5,"I am obsessed with this book. Researched based and incredibly well written, Haidt takes you through how we each define morality by placing varying importance on the same six moral foundations. It was fascinating to read about how our moral compasses neatly line up with our political ideologies. It made me want to go run another campaign using all I learned. I have now been viewing every political story (and each side's reaction to it) through the lens of moral foundation theory, and the world is starting to make so much more sense. People have been hailing ""Hillbilly Elegy"" as the book that will help you understand why Trump was elected—and it will—but this book gave me such a deeper understanding of conservative voters. I think it even made me a tiny bit more tolerant of their worldview. ;) I also loved the sections on religion. I gained so much insight into why different aspects of religion appeal to different people and how members of the same faith can assign such different moral applications to the same doctrine. It also helped me to understand my own struggles with faith more clearly based on my primary moral foundation. I have been recommending this book to everyone who will listen. Read it and then let's talk about it!"
62,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/243951-tim-mcintosh,5,"A vision-changing book. Powerful and insightful. As a Georgia (USA) native who spent his 30s in the Pacific NorthWest, I lived in cultures that deeply misunderstood each other. Haidt's book shed light on the moral psychology that shapes both tribes.A minor complaint: Haidt sides with Plato's depiction of Glaucon as the normative account of human moral action. We act based on what we fear others will think of us. While this is largely true, I wish he'd have touched upon the prophetic impulse in both Judaism (Isaiah!) and Athens (Socrates!) as a needful option during times of party-antagonism. But, big picture, I consider Haidt one of the voices of genuine hope and insight in contemporary American culture. I hope his project thrives."
63,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8325737-philipp,3,"Several books for the price of one!DISCLAIMER: I finished reading the book and then had a several day long childcare and work mess, so this text is based more on my notes than on my memory.The book is more or less divided into parts. The first part, my favorite, reminds me strongly of Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow. Instead of Kahneman's two systems to interpret (economic?) reality, Haidt has two systems with which we make morale decisions with. One is the elephant, the auto-pilot, one is the elephant's rider, who can be slowly influenced. That's the most interesting part to me: our moral reactions are often not based on rational thought, but on knee-jerk reactions which we then rationalise post-hoc. We constantly lie to ourselves and we don't even realise that! This has so many implications for anyone doing any science-related outreach. A lot of the 'pro-GM' stuff I see works on a purely rational level, while the 'anti-GM' stuff works on an emotional level. In Haidt's system, the pro-people talk to the rider, the anti-people talk to the elephant. Often the anti-people win because the elephant is the predominant system which works 'automatically'. Working around these two systems is something science outreach should seriously look at!People bind themselves into political teams that share moral narratives. Once they accept a particular narrative, they become blind to alternative moral worlds.When does the elephant listen to reason? The main way that we change our minds on moral issues is by interacting with other people. We are terrible at seeking evidence that challenges our own beliefs, but other people do us this favor, just as we are quite good at finding errors in other people’s beliefs. When discussions are hostile, the odds of change are slight. The elephant leans away from the opponent, and the rider works frantically to rebut the opponent’s charges. But if there is affection, admiration, or a desire to please the other person, then the elephant leans toward that person and the rider tries to find the truth in the other person’s arguments.There's a great critique of new atheists like Dawkins and whatnot their names are, in that they all focus their critiques on the wrong stuff. To Haidt, any religious system is at its core believing into something illogical, but that's not the point of the system at all. The system is there to create and strengthen group ties, what the group actually believes in is secondary. I have to say, I agree with that, and it mirrors a lot of what I find uncomfortable with the lesswrong crowd:I concluded by warning that the worship of reason, which is sometimes found in philosophical and scientific circles, is a delusion. It is an example of faith in something that does not exist. I urged instead a more intuitionist approach to morality and moral education, one that is more humble about the abilities of individuals [...]The rest of the book is not so interesting to me - Haidt goes on to find several moral 'foundations' or 'frameworks' in human societies, and some societies put different levels of values onto those moral systems (a system like 'individualistic rights', or 'sacredness', 'Care', 'Fairness' etc. pp.). That part is OK - but then he finds the need to explain all of this using group selection of all things! Haidt seems to believe that group selection is necessary to explain his foundations (groups that work better, have higher cohesion, etc. out-compete other groups), but honestly, most of that you can 'explain away' using a variant of Fisher's Sexy son hypothesis. People who fit better into their in-group will have children who fit better, so their children will have higher reproductive success within the group. People who fit into the group will have higher reproductive success than people outside of the group, and so on. If you imagine that there's a gene which makes you fit better into the group you can argue entirely on the level of the individual (I believe :) ). No need for group selection!The other part I disliked is due to me not being US-American. There's a large part where Haidt writes about what distinguishes the 'left' from the 'right' - he says that he makes that distinction because that's how most of the research literature describes it, which I guess means I'm sceptical of the research literature itself, I guess? What counts for 'left' in the US is almost 'centre right' in Europe, so I'm unsure how universal the literature truly is.(Can Haidt's system explain the weird support Trump receives within the US? The book came out before the current schlamassel, so Haidt doesn't refer to Trump. Haidt often writes about in-group morality and how that keeps the group stable etc., but so far Trump has broken all of those rules and no bad outcome has materialised!)P.S.: Thinking, Fast and Slow was hit by the reproducibility crisis - many studies use very few participants, which means that by the law of statistics you're bound to see more extreme events. If you want to know whether a coin is fair, you want to flip it often and measure how often heads and tail comes up. If you flip it ten times and it comes up 9 times heads, is it biased? You saw an extreme event happen, but only because you measured so few flips. It gets more even after 100 or even 1000 flips, so you need a larger sample size. In Thinking, Fast and Slow, many studies fail to reproduce, with more participants the same findings do not materialise. Sometimes Haidt mentions the sample size and it's always cause for concern (""Greene brought eighteen subjects into an fMRI scanner and presented each of his stories on the screen""). Some people have looked at the studies cited by Kahneman and found them not to reproduce, I wonder how many of Haidt's cited studies will have the same problem."

Yes, it's that important. I didn't want to share Bob's copy because I wanted to mark my own passages and tab my own quotes. I admitted to my students that I wanted to read this book so I could talk more civilly to my Facebook friends. We talk AT each other, not truly listening as waiting for a moment to begin lecturing others on why we're right and they're wrong. I want to find that common ground -- those pieces of the issues on which we can agree....This didn't quite give me that, but it's already changed the way I think about both my own opinions and those of others. While I have some complaints about the way the book is presented, I learned a lot. Did I learn what I hoped to? Not necessarily.We all care about human moral issues...and our political leanings drive us to care about them differently...Fairness, Care, Liberty, Sanctity, Loyalty, Authority. These are the pillars of moral reasoning. Each of us has a schema that orders these six foundations, and we truly see everything through them. One of his metaphors is the elephant of intuition, and the rider who overlays the intuitions with logical reasoning...after the intuitive elephant has leaned toward the 'natural' stance for each of us.Liberals and Conservatives see the world through these foundations, and this sight may be the source of our inability to understand, respect, and listen.Liberals care deeply about Care and Fairness. We see the world as fair or not, as caring or not. We organize our issues around them. We find those memes to post on Facebook...we argue with friends from these stances. The other foundations are not necessarily important to our thinking. Liberty, Freedom, is something we see through our own lenses as well.Conservatives have balanced all six of the foundations; while they may not care as deeply for any one, they do integrate them all into their lives and their memes.Libertarians base their thinking mostly on the foundation of Liberty and Freedom.I can already use this information as I analyze my intuitive responses to social issues -- and as I read friends' memes and responses. What I haven't done yet is use those insights...can I say to an arguing friends, ""I'm coming to this issue from a stance of caring for others and making sure those who are powerless have a voice. I think maybe you're coming from a stance of Fairness, concerned that others might not be 'earning' their rights to consideration by their own efforts. Where can we find a sliver of this argument we can agree on?"" I was frustrated by his organization..it was classic 5-paragraph-essay: ""I'm going to tell you what I'm going to say. Then I'm going to say it. Then I'm going to say what I said."" Lots of repetition...I know he was trying to make sure we made the connections he needed to make. He takes us through so many twists and turns and metaphors...so many fields of psychology, so many miles around the world, so many years of history. Now comes the hard work -- applying what I've learned.Reflections upon rereading...Still got annoyed by his stiff writing, and I forgot HOW MUCH DETAIL he goes into. But the last pages resonated even more...and helped me think of ways to really live this..now that a horrible election season is upon us.Liberals are actually handicapped, since we work from two of Haidt's six foundations: Care and fairness (but we mean fair for all). The most sacred value is care of victims of oppression. Libertarians value liberty above all...with a proportional fairness next. Their level of care is lower than conservatives. Libertarians value individual freedom. Conservatives seem to value all six equally, with no spike in one foundation like liberals and libertarians. Their sacred value is preservation of traditions that, in their minds, sustain a moral community. So, even when we use these words, we mean different things by them. Doesn't mean we can't reach out, using the other's sacred value, and find commonalities. I've done that with friends, and they've done it with me. We find out early what topics to avoid, and which ones we can agree on..Haidt continues the theme of stories and storytelling...'the human mind is a story processor, not a logic processor.' May need to add that to my presentation. 'Life narratives are saturated with morality.'I'm saddened and embarrassed by the evidence that liberals' attempts to secure freedom for the disenfranchised sometimes destabilizes society...we end up causing harm...the Civil Rights Act is a case in point. Now I need to think about the question, 'was it worth it?' And my answer is HELL YES. But I wonder if there is a way to help without creating that rift...The themes of the book:Intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second (elephant and rider)There is more to morality than harm and fairnessMorality binds and blinds (90% chimp, 10% bee)With that in mind, I need to listen carefully in conversations, especially on social media, and look for that sacredness...His last lines resonate: ""We're all stuck here for awhile, so let's try to work it out."" That can be my new motto."

66,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,5,"I've been a fan of Jonathan Haidt for years based on watching his talks and reading his articles. In those talks and articles, he lays out the basic framework of Moral Foundations Theory clearly and (seemingly to me) comprehensively, and also shows how the theory works in practice (such as this article about What Tea Partiers Really Want).So, although I am a huge fan, I wasn't in too much of a rush to read ""Righteous Mind"" because I thought I already knew what would be in the book, and the rest would be filler. (This is why I don't read more non-fiction, by the way. I find that in most cases popular nonfiction hides 20-70 pages worth of good thinking amid 200+ pages of unnecessary bloat.)I was wrong.""Righteous Mind"" was captivating from beginning to end. It included much, much more material than I had anticipated (mostly about general human cognition as a backdrop for discussions of moral cognition) and the material is all first-rate. I admit to being somewhat biased by Haidt's praise of Hume (I love me some Hume), but I think anyone would be enthralled by his lucid, insightful discussion of what makes humans tick, morally speaking. Add to that his interesting autobiographical journey and his clearly outlined arguments (which I appreciated) and lastly his generous writing tone (he's especially careful to credit colleagues, including grad students, which speaks highly of him as a person) and this easily fits into my top 5 list of all-time great nonfiction. I don't even know if that list has 5 books in it yet, by the way. The only other popular science books I've liked this much are On Killing and The Social Animal: The Hidden Sources of Love, Character, and Achievement. (Honorable mention to The Myth of the Rational Voter: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies).I listened to this book on Audiobook, even though I actually own a hard copy, and I will start re-reading it in the next couple of days in hard copy. Partly because it's just that good, and partly because there are so many passages I want to underline and referenced papers I want to look up.This is going to be one of those books that I highlight and annotate extensively and then keep on my office bookshelf so it's in easy reach. I definitely recommend it!"
67,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2730649-kate,4,"I found Jonathan Haidt's first book an absolute revelation. It was a game changer for me. So I was pretty keen to get my hands on this one, especially as I'm a total political geek. It did not disappoint. There was so many factors to consider, I particularly liked the metaphor of the taste buds on the tongue being compared to his pillars of morality, the hive switch and the fact that religion meets our need to connect and be part of a group. The role group connection plays is a big part of the work I do - so this was of real interest. That said there were times when I mentally nodded off and couldn't take it all in. I found myself having peaks and dips throughout the whole book. So I loved the summary at the end of each chapter.As you would expect from an academic the attention to his evidence and source was excellent. The reference to the rider and the elephant was used in The happiness Hypothesis, however in this book he developed the resistance of the elephant further and gave us deeper insight into why reason alone is not a clear guide to the choices we make. The evolutionary and scientific why for it was fascinating. Currently here in New Zealand we are going through an election - sitting back and applying his learning's has given me a new understanding, which meant I have listened, watched and attempted to not try to make all and sundry think like me! Which I am sure can only be useful. My take home message is to sit with those that nudge my elephant in the direction where it's not keen to go and just hold that space. "
68,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4048044-charlene-mathe,4,"I can't summarize this book -- it's just too vast; or perhaps a better word might be ""green,"" as in sprouting and untamed, new tastes not yet digested -- even though the author actually does an exceptional job of reviewing where he has been, before advancing to new concepts. I think the main benefit of the book is the author's invitation to examine how we process our judgments. He provides us some tools, some better than others, that might help us recognize the guiding narrative of our moral matrix. I doubt that he said this directly, but my take-away impression is to view myself and fellow humans as ""resonators"" first, and rational reactors after that. The instant we receive an impression, we resonate like a violin string; we accept or reject, we experience delight or disgust, agreement or dissonance. In a flash, our rational mind frames these responses to a logical matrix. This makes us vulnerable to manipulation and resistant to argument. Given this as our nature, let us seek out the loyal opposition and ask ourselves -- ""what if he/she is right?"" or ""could there be something to what he/she is saying?"" We can usually learn more from our opponent than from our sidekick. Nevertheless, the instant response of the inner resonator provides important information that we might never be able to match with the logical brain."
69,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34749978-phil,4,"All of humanity should read this book. It should be required reading for all university students, activists, politicians, journalists, and political commentators. A copy of it should be mailed to every citizen with their voter ID cards. On online articles, there should be a box you have to tick indicating whether you’ve read it, and if not, you should be prevented from commenting. People should go door-to-door like Jehovah’s Witnesses handing out free copies and spreading the good word. Jonathan Haidt’s project in The Righteous Mind is highly ambitious. As the subtitle suggests, its aim is to explain, on the basis of contemporary psychological research, why political disagreement and strife comes about. Haidt’s strategy in answering this question is threefold: first, to defend a “social intuitionist” theory of moral discourse; second, to outline a “six-foundation” model of moral psychology; and third, to advance a “Durkheimian utilitarian” theory of political legitimacy. In keeping with this threefold strategy, the book is divided into three large parts, each corresponding to one of the three “major principles of moral psychology”: Intuitions Come First, Strategic Reasoning Second, There’s More to Morality than Harm and Fairness, and Morality Binds and Blinds. The first part of the book, “Intuitions Come First, Strategic Reasoning Second,” takes the form of an attack on what Haidt calls the “rationalist delusion” (p. 34). Under the influence of Lawrence Kohlberg, much of 20th Century moral psychology presumed a model of moral development on which human beings universally progress toward a practice of role-taking concerned only with considerations pertaining to fairness and harm. In Haidt’s view, looking outside the West show this picture to be mistaken: “Non-Western cultures moralize practices that have nothing to do with harm” (p. 15). Nor can those considerations that are unrelated to harm be dismissed as mere conventions. For “the distinction between morals and mere conventions” is not innate, Haidt tells us, but is, rather, “a cultural artifact” peculiar to the West (p. 20). Haidt’s fieldwork outside the West (especially in India) leads him to side with David Hume’s sentimentalist theory of morality against the “rationalist” philosophers descendent from Immanuel Kant. Reasoning, Haidt maintains, is and ought to be a servant of our passions: reasoning, he maintains, is guided by feeling, or, more accurately, by “intuition.” By this term, Haidt designates an act of moral perception, a immediate, more or less visceral, and certainly pre-linguistic instance of “seeing-that” (p. 51; cf. 75). In support of this intuitionist picture, Haidt argues that moral reasoning evolved primarily to pursue “social-strategic goals”: “Our moral thinking is much more like a politician searching for votes than a scientist searching for truth” (p. 89). In the second part of the book, “There’s More to Morality Than Harm and Fairness,” Haidt defends what he calls “moral pluralism,” i.e. the view that there is, descriptively, significant variation in the moral domain across cultures. This variation, he believes, can be explained by a set of “evolved cognitive modules,” i.e. “switches” or “circuits” that have adapted to perceive the threats and opportunities of social life (p. 144). These are innate in the sense that they are “prewired — flexible and subject to change — rather than hardwired, fixed, and immutable (p. 152). In other words, all the various systems of morality have their roots in a shared brain structure that provides a “first draft” that is then revised in light of experience (p. 153). Haidt calls these modules “moral foundations” and identifies six: Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating, Liberty/Oppression, Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, and Sanctity/Degradation. This allows him to bridge moral psychology and politics. Drawing on responses to his Moral Foundations, Haidt identifies three ideal-typical political orientations and tries to define their respective “moral matrices”: Liberals care most keenly about the first three foundations, viz. Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating, and Liberty/Oppression; Libertarians care exclusively about the second and third; and Conservatives care more or less equally about all six. As a result, he believes, Conservative political candidates possess an inherent advantage over their competitors; they have more of an intuitive grasp of moral psychology and are able to “activate” more of the public’s moral intuitions (p. 179). In the final part of the book, “Morality Binds and Blinds,” Haidt argues that humans have a “dual nature” (p. 255). While we are “mostly selfish,” our genetic makeup at the same time contains a “groupish overlay” that programs us to promote our group’s interest in certain special circumstances (p. 222). For this purpose, he tries to revive the long-discredited theory of group selection: natural selection, works simultaneously at multiple levels, exerting its influence both at the level of the individual and at that of the group (p. 254). In this connection, Haidt posits a “hive switch,” a module for “making groups more cohesive, and therefore more successful in competition with other groups.” (p. 259). In certain special experiences, human beings are able to “shut down the self,” becoming “simply a part of a whole” (p. 264). Religion, from this perspective, can be understood as an evolutionary adaptation to reinforce solidarity between members of a group (p. 313). The groupish overlay in our nature, Haidt understands as the source of morality: “Moral systems,” he says, “are interlocking sets of values, virtues, norms, practices, identities, institutions, technologies, and evolved psychological mechanisms that work together to suppress or regulate self-interest and make cooperative societies possible” (p. 314). This provides the foundation of Haidt’s Durkheimian utilitarianism, which he proposes as a theory to orient political decision-making (p. 316). This Durkheimian utilitarianism is, so he thinks, corrects Liberalism’s “blind spot” with regard to “moral capital,” i.e. to the resources required to “sustain a moral community (p. 341-342). For all the praise that I am ready to lavish on Haidt, The Righteous Mind I have several bones to pick with him. I’ll limit myself to just two points. The first is that he seems to me to underestimate the potential inherent to reason. Perhaps it is true that reason evolved to help us save face and pursue our strategic goals. This doesn’t change the fact that it brings with it certain unavoidable presuppositions of argumentation that equip it to “get to the bottom of things.” Indeed, Haidt’s own skepticism about reason brings him dangerously close to performative contradiction at a few points (see p. 57-58, 107, esp. 127). Of course reason is subject to all sorts of distortions; Haidt discusses these at length and expresses skepticism at any individual’s ability to reason (p. 105). But he doesn’t seem to notice that, in emphasizing the need for viewpoint diversity, he is advancing something strikingly similar to Jürgen Habermas’s theory of communicative rationality — which is, ironically, often lambasted as being excessively “rationalistic.”My second, related, objection is that Haidt is much too quick to dismiss Kohlberg’s model of moral development. It seems to me that he attributes excessive weight to the claim that “there is more to morality than harm and fairness” — would anyone, including Kohlberg really need to be convinced of this as a descriptive claim? (p. 114). It is precisely to accommodate this claim that most “rationalist” moral theorists like John Rawls and Jürgen Habermas make a distinction between the good (i.e. culturally specific interests) and the right (i.e. universalizable interests). Now Haidt himself thinks that he has bypassed this question by dismissing the distinction between “morals” and “mere conventions” as a “cultural artifact” peculiar to Western societies (p. 20). This brings me to the crux of my second objection, namely, that Haidt is much too quick to take cultural difference at face value. He does not at all consider the possibility of social learning, even though he himself notes that the effects of social class are much greater than those of culture (p. 25). If Kohlberg’s stages of moral learning are incorrect, then why does it seem that, across cultures, humans given enough resources, education, contact with other cultures seem to converge on moral universalism? And here you get the good/right distinction not as a mere cultural artifact, but as the result of a learning process: as we come to understand more about our place relative to other cultures, we learn to make the difference between what could be agreed to by all in discourse and what is specific to our cultural group. The converse view seems to me to be a bizarre brand of anti-realism that would be equivalent to coming across a culture that believes that spirits, not bacteria, cause diseases, and concluding that belief in bacteria is merely a “cultural artifact.” On that note, it seems to me that Haidt’s books suffers considerably from the fact that he takes no clear stance on the realism/antirealism debate in metaethics. Now admittedly, this is a work of popular science intended for general audiences, but he is engaging (though not very generously) with moral philosophers, which makes his avoidance of the debate a little frustrating — not the least because he appears to vacillate between the two positions. Some passages lean clearly toward a realist view reminiscent of John McDowell (p. 128, 133, 143-144), but then he goes all anti-realist — Simon Blackburn-style — and calls moral matrices “collective hallucinations” (?!?!?) (p. 239). So why all the praise? Haidt’s book is a call to dialogue and mutual understanding. Not in any kind of pie-in-the-sky optimistic kind of way — Haidt, as I have pointed out, has very little faith in reason and is quick to point out the mechanisms by which we divide into opposing ideological groups. But in shedding light on the causes of this disagreement, he at least gives us pause to the indignant righteousness that lead us so quickly to dismiss dissenting views as the result of psychological defect or moral perversion: maybe, just maybe, Conservatism isn’t just a symptom of fascism and misogyny (though of course it sometimes is!), and maybe Liberalism isn’t just the product of fragile snowflakes who are unable to take responsibility for their lives (though again...). Having grown up at the intersection of three different cultures with rather different politics myself (Québécois, English-Canadian, Lebanese), I have never been able to share the moral and political certitude of so many of my peers. I have always had misgivings both about what I see as the excessive individualism of much of Western culture and about what I see as the oppressive groupishness of much of Middle-Eastern culture. The need to resolve the cognitive dissonance between these was likely an important motivation for my studies in philosophy. But what I have found in philosophy departments — those bastions of rational thought — has all too often been the same dogmatic blindness that led me into the quandary in the first place. What Haidt offers is, if not a solution, then at least a framework for dialogue about one. What is most ironic in all this is that, despite Haidt’s irrationalist bent, he ends up a lone voice of reason in these thoroughly unreasonable times."
70,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17339120-corey-wozniak,5,"Jonathan Haidt's _The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion_ is a clarion call in our modern moment, in which both the Left and Right seem to have little desire to understand their political opponents. Some clever person on Twitter recently summarized what he called ""the syllogism of the Left."" It went like this:1. Everything I do & believe is based on love.2. You disagree with me.3. You are a hateful bigot.Another might be written this way:1. Everything I do/believe is based on Reason (/Science).2. You disagree with me.3. You are a moron.Equally absurd tautologies could be formulated for the Right:1. Everything I do & believe is based on love of God & country2. You disagree with me.3. You are a godless traitor.Haidt challenges the smugness of these silly tautologies through insights from moral psychology and Moral Foundations Theory. The insights from moral psychology, he argues, compels us to be much more humble about our own perceived ""righteousness""--and much more patient when we consider the opinions of others.I. Haidt points out that we rarely reason our way to our moral (/political) conclusions. Instead, intuitions come first, and strategic reason second. In Haidt's metaphor, our intuition is an enormous elephant-- our strategic reasoning is a frail rider sitting atop the elephant. The intuition responds to stimuli and only afterward do we make post hoc rationalizations for our intuition. To use another of Haidt's metaphors, our reason acts as Press Secretary for and in behalf of our intuition. (Trump is the elephant, poor ole' Sean Spicer reason.) Reason is always secondary and post hoc-- responding after-the-fact to the knee-jerks, snap judgements, and automatic processes of the Intuition. A final metaphor: Intution is the dog and reason/rationality its tail. He cites studies that show, for example, that people are more conservative when in the mere proximity of a trash can (!). This, of course, means that we rarely arrive at our moral (/political) conclusions after careful, deliberate reasoning. One of the most interesting parts of this analysis is Haidt's work on ""moral dumbfoundedness."" II. According to Moral Foundations Theory, the righteous mind is like a tongue with six taste receptors: Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating, Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, Sanctity/Degredation, Liberty/Oppression. Each individual has a predisposition for different combinations of the receptors, which explains the different political/moral orientations of people. Conservatives and liberals vary because they value different configurations of the six receptors. Here's how YourMorals.org describes Moral Foundations Theory: ""The idea behind the scale is that human morality is the result of biological and cultural evolutionary processes that made human beings very sensitive to many different (and often competing) issues. Some of these issues are about treating other individuals well (the first two foundations - harm and fairness). Other issues are about how to be a good member of a group or supporter of social order and tradition (the last three foundations). Haidt and Graham have found that political liberals generally place a higher value on the first two foundations; they are very concerned about issues of harm and fairness (including issues of inequality and exploitation). Political conservatives care about harm and fairness too, but they generally score slightly lower on those scale items. The big difference between liberals and conservatives seems to be that conservatives score slightly higher on the ingroup/loyalty foundation, and much higher on the authority/respect and purity/sanctity foundations.""This difference seems to explain many of the most contentious issues in the culture war. For example, liberals support legalizing gay marriage (to be fair and compassionate), whereas many conservatives are reluctant to change the nature of marriage and the family, basic building blocks of society. Conservatives are more likely to favor practices that increase order and respect (e.g., spanking, mandatory pledge of allegiance), whereas liberals often oppose these practices as being violent or coercive. ""This means that morality is a matter of taste. (This is not to defend total moral relativism, however.)III. How does someone become a Republican or Democrat? How is it that someone ends up voting for a particular candidate or joining a political process? Haidt argues that the answer is, at least in part, genetic. Conservatives are more genetically prone to respond strongly to (perceived) danger/threats; Liberals are more genetically prone to seek sensation-seeking and openness to experience. These genetic traits then guide children along different paths. He imagines a pair of fraternal twins, a brother and a sister raised together in the same home:""During their nine months together in their mother's womb, the brother's genes were busy constructing a brain that was a bit higher than average in its sensitivity to threats, a bit lower than average in its tendency to feel pleasure when exposed to radically new experiences. The sister's genes were busy making a brain with the opposite settings.""The two siblings grow up in the same house and attend the same schools, but they gradually create different worlds for themselves. Even in nursery school, their behavior causes adults to treat them differently. One study found that women who called themselves liberals as adults had been rated by their nursery school teachers as having traits consistent with threat insensitivity and novelty-seeking. Future liberals were described as being more curious, verbal, and self-reliant, but also more assertive and aggressive, less obedient and neat. So if we could observe our fraternal twins in their first years of schooling, we'd find teachers responding differently to them. Some teachers might be drawn to the creative but rebellious little girl; others would crack down on her as an unruly brat, while praising her brother as a model student.""By the time they reach high school and begin to take an interest in politics, the two siblings have chosen different activities (the sister joins the debate team in part for the opportunity to travel; the brother gets more involved with his family's church) and amassed different friends (the sister joins the goths; the brother joins the jocks). The sister chooses to go to college in NYC, where she majors in Latin American studies and find s her calling as an advocate for the children of illegal immigrants. Because her social circle is entirely composed of liberals, she is enmeshed in a moral matrix based primarily on the Care/harm foundation. In 2008, she is electified by Obama's concern for the poor and his promise of change.""The brother, in contrast, has no interest in moving far away to a big, dirty, and threatening city. He chooses to stay close to friends and family by attending the local branch of the state university. He earns a degree in business and then works for a local bank, gradually rising to a high position. He becoms a pillar of his church and his community... The moral matrices that surround him are based on all six foundations. There is occassional talk in church sermons of helping the victims of oppression, but the most common moral themes in his life are personal responsibility... a nd loyalty to the many groups and teams to which he belongs. He resonates with McCain's campaign slogan, 'Country First.'""Things didn't have to work out this way... But their differnt sets of genes gave them different first drafts of their minds, which led them down different paths, through different life experiences, and into different moral subcultures. by the time they reach adulthood they have become very different people whose one point of political agreement is that they must not talk about politics when the sister comes home for the holidays.""*****Haidt has since become an interesting voice on issues of campus free speech (https://www.theatlantic.com/author/jo...) and political diversity in academia. He is the founder of Heterodox Academy, which I think is a great organization. Big fan of Jonathan Haidt!"

Not labeling groups (culture, religion, political, etc) without understanding what drives the individual and groups motivations is important for civil discourse. The author, Jonathan Haidt, is a Moral Psychologist who presents studies throughout the book that promote gaining an understanding of what drives the morality and thinking of diverse groups. He highlights the importance of steering away from “moral superiority” without seeking commonality and developing trust. Groups are not all bad nor all good and judgement without curiosity will continue to drive and make wider the great divide. I found this book very difficult to get into but so glad I stuck with it. It provided great tools for changing my thinking going forward. Question and digestion before judgement and criticism will help close the divide. “If you think that moral reasoning is something we do to figure out the truth, you’ll be constantly frustrated by how foolish, biased, and illogical people become when they disagree with you.” -Jonathan Haidt, The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion"
72,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1711431-eric-w,5,"One of the Most Important Books of the Last Decade ""This book is about why it’s so hard for us to get along. We are indeed all stuck here for a while, so let’s at least do what we can to understand why we are so easily divided into hostile groups, . . Politics and religion are both expressions of our underlying moral psychology, and an understanding of that psychology can help to bring people together. My goal in this book is to drain some of the heat, anger, and divisiveness out of these topics and replace them with awe, wonder, and curiosity. We are downright lucky that we evolved this complex moral psychology that allowed our species to burst out of the forests and savannas and into the delights, comforts, and extraordinary peacefulness of modern societies in just a few thousand years. . . I want to show you that an obsession with righteousness (leading inevitably to self-righteousness) is the normal human condition. It is a feature of our evolutionary design, not a bug or error that crept into minds that would otherwise be objective and rational.""I hardly feel qualified to make any kind of judgments on this book having little background in philosophy, especially moral philosophy, so I especially appreciate Haidt's lucid summary of the development of moral philosophy through examples and hypotheticals.I remember several years ago having a visit from the local anti-abortion denizens, nice people, very concerned about youth, etc. They steered the conversation to abortion, their favorite topic. Being of a liberal and hopefully rational and reasoned mindset myself, I described a book I had recently read,The Facts of Life: Science and the Abortion Controversy by Harold J. Morowitz, James Trefil, a small, excellent analysis of the abortion debate that contains a plea for looking at the issue rationally. I described their suggestion that we need to decide what constitutes ""human"" and then see when the fetus acquires the capability (cerebral cortex) to be human, etc. etc. To which the response was, ""well, I don't believe that."" All debate and discussions ceases when that statement arrives. Now, I could have said, well, you old biddy, I don't give a fuck what you believe, I'm trying to find some common ground here."" But, my mother having raised me as a good little boy who is always polite to old people, I merely sat there rather stunned. That's the problem. How do you create a discussion of issues when either side can just say, well, I don't believe that.This is not just a conservative or right-wing problem. Try having a rational or reasonable discussion about the merits of circumcision, climate. autism, raw milk or veganism. I guarantee the true believers will immediately assemble with truckloads of vitriol. We all suffer from what Haidt calls ""confirmation bias,"" that is, our gut tells us what to believe first and then we seek out justifications for that belief.Haidt's book reaffirms what has become fairly obvious: we divide ourselves into tribes and those tribes consist of like-minded people which we use to validate our intuitive predispositions. His stated goal is to attempt to find a way to bridge the divide between two different moral world views., and to find a way for each side to at least understand the other's perspective.Both left and right are motivated by the moral foundations of care, fairness, liberty, loyalty, authority and sanctity. But they differ qualitatively: liberals tend to care more about suffering and violence; conservatives care about harm done to others but not as intensely. Conservatives, on the other hand, place more emphasis on fairness, i.e. getting what you deserve. Both sides value liberty but have differing definition as to what constitutes the oppressor. Similarly, with fairness, each side values it but define it differently: liberals view it from the standpoint of equality while conservatives look to proportionality, i.e. fairness is being rewarded for your accomplishments and if you work harder you should be rewarded proportionally. The biggest divisions relate to sanctity, authority and loyalty. You can easily guess where the preferences of conservatives and liberals lie. Haidt suggests that liberals will fail to gain wider acceptance until they come to terms with those three moral values and find someway to create their own vocabulary validating them. I would add that liberals will have to be more accepting of groups, particularly religious ones (as much as I despise them,) which serve an evolutionary need to discount selfishness and promote group adherence and benefits.To some extent that's why I am so puzzled by the right's celebration of Ayn Rand who promoted the antithesis of group-think by celebrating independence and selfishness, i.e. think of yourself first and what benefits accrue to yourself through your actions. She hated coercion both governmental and religious, in particular, yet both encourage group adherence and loyalty.I just wonder how much of what Haidt says come from his intuitive side (the elephant) and how much from the rational or reasoning part (the rider.)Here's a quote that struck me: ""And why do so many Westerners, even secular ones, continue to see choices about food and sex as being heavily loaded with moral significance? Liberals sometimes say that religious conservatives are sexual prudes for whom anything other than missionary-position intercourse within marriage is a sin. But conservatives can just as well make fun of liberal struggles to choose a balanced breakfast—balanced among moral concerns about free-range eggs, fair-trade coffee, naturalness, and a variety of toxins, some of which (such as genetically modified corn and soybeans) pose a greater threat spiritually than biologically."""
73,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4923831-quentin-crisp,0,"I'm on page 76 as I write this. (Still getting used to Goodreads navigation - it looks like this will show up as the actual review rather than an 'in progress' comment, though it is the latter.) This book looks like it's going to take me a long time, if I finish it. I like what seems to be the attitude behind it, that we are all basically human whether we consider ourselves left, right, up, down, etc., and that dialogue is therefore preferable to demonisation. The trouble is, only 76 pages in, I already find the rhetoric of the book insufferably irritating. Irritation is, I think, to some degree an inarticulate feeling, which no doubt fits with Haidt's assertion that our values are instinctive, and that justifications come later. What he hasn't addressed so far is exactly how this relates to his own theories. Presumably he doesn't expect us to believe he's the only person in the world whose reasoning came before his values? There's something else. By saying that values come first and reasoning later, he's implying that individual values are not necessarily useful or in accord with reality. The further implication of this is that a completely reasoned value system would be useful and in accord with reality. BUT, so far, his rhetoric seems to deny the possibility of the very thing he implies is the most desirable. Perhaps he is going to correct all this later, and perhaps I'm just missing the point by a mile, but - to bring in my justification - what irritates me so much is that he is promoting, with what I would call 'sleight of hand' if it were not so stupid, a shallow and dangerous picture of moral values. The chapter I've just begun is called 'Vote for Me (Here's Why)'. It starts with reference to the part in Plato's Republic where Glaucon proposes the thought experiment of the ring of Gyges, which renders its wearer invisible. The question underlying this thought experiment is: would anyone act morally if they knew they would never be found out? Glaucon says they would not, and also ""says he will not be satisfied until Socrates can prove that a just man with a bad reputation is happier than an unjust man who is widely thought to be good"". Socrates says that it would actually be better for the person to act justly, regardless of the consequences for their reputation. Now, here's Haidt:""In this chapter I'll show that reason is not fit to rule; it was designed to seek justification, not truth. I'll show that Glaucon was right: people care a great deal more about appearance and reputation than about reality. In fact, I'll praise Glaucon for the rest of the book [Q's note: hear that - the rest of the book!] as the guy who got it right - the guy who realized that the most important principle for designing an ethical society is to make sure that everyone's reputation is on the line all the time, so that bad behaviour will bring bad consequences.""This passage is so confused and downright stupid, I don't know where to begin. So, let's take it line by line:""In this chapter I'll show that reason is not fit to rule; it was designed to seek justification, not truth.""Then what, Mr Haidt, are you doing with this book? Seeking justification, obviously, not truth. ""I'll show that Glaucon was right""But how can he be right - in fact, how can anyone be right - when there are no means of ascertaining what is right or wrong, because we have discounted reason?""... people care a great deal more about appearance and reputation than about reality.""And this is where the big confusion comes in. That most people care more about reputation than reality DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING. Haidt is massively blurring the 'is/ought' distinction here. This is where the 'sleight of hand' comes in (although it's too clumsy to be called that). If you're making a distinction between appearance and reality in the first place, then you're saying there is a reality - so why not prioritise that instead of going along with the herd? This is no refutation of Socrates at all, because Glaucon was talking about how people ARE (the 'is' of 'is/ought') and Socrates was talking about how they SHOULD BE (obviously the 'ought'). ""In fact, I'll praise Glaucon for the rest of the book...""So, essentially he's going to praise the guy who tells you to only care about your reputation, not about actual morals.""... the guy who realized that the most important principle for designing an ethical society is to make sure that everyone's reputation is on the line all the time, so that bad behaviour will bring bad consequences.""But this is another confusion, because we've already made the distinction between having a good reputation and actually being good, and the question was what is most important. Having one's reputation on the line all the time doesn't mean good behaviour, it just means conformity. Haidt, essentially, has shown himself here to be fundamentally against the development of the individual conscience. The book's title is The Righteous Mind. I suppose I shouldn't take Haidt as entirely representative, but I feel like this book is - inadvertently, I suppose - helping me fill in the picture of everything that is wrong with so-called progressive politics, especially in America. Haidt says early on that we need people to be self-righteous, and this, of course, fits in with his assertion that we need people constantly in fear for their reputations. Sound familiar?Political correctness, omnipresent surveillance, group-think - the current fruits we are seeing from the ideology of 'progressives'. It is a politics of social shame and conformity, not a politics of reason, conscience or moral behaviour."
74,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,3,"Before I talk about content, I've got to say this cover design is not professional-quality. When I downloaded the book I thought it was some sort of placeholder image. If you're going to place a rip on the cover, make it look like a real rip and have some variety in the typeface. Anyway, not to judge a book by it's cover... I digress.The Righteous Mind has a lot of really good insights alternated with some less-convincing ones, but it's goal is noble: to help soldiers in the political wars find ways to see eye to eye.Haidt begins with a metaphor he has introduced in previous works: we are not so much pure, rational agents as much as we are small, rational agents riding atop large, powerful elephants of intuition. I found this generally to be apt and well-supported (though I think Daniel Kahneman contributed more to the topic and with more supporting evidence in Thinking Fast and Slow). Our intuition responds first and powerfully, and our rational selves provide justifications for those gut reactions, or deliver small course corrections. He spends maybe a bit too much time aligning thoughts on intuition and reason with Hume, Glaucon, Jefferson, Kant, etc... and at times it takes a lot of work to follow which perspective he's actually advocating. Regardless, the point was made: we can understand our cultural competitors when we remember they (and we) are riding upon elephants of intuition.Next Haidt introduces an analogy in which morality is likened to taste receptors. There are six vectors of moral consideration that he delineates: care/harm, fairness/cheating, liberty/oppression, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, and sanctity/degradation. Just like we can't expect that everyone the world over will share the same tastes in cuisine, we similarly should expect a variety of moral ""tastes"". Through extensive surveys on his website, yourmorals.org, he has found that liberals are primarily motivated by the care/harm spectrum and fairness, whereas conservatives share a broader mixture that is less focused on care/harm, but is also driven by consideration of liberty, loyalty, authority and sanctity. Libertarians primarily care about liberty/oppression, with a dash of fairness/cheating. By describing these motivations, he hopes to help us understand a bit of where the other guy is coming from. He also warns against attempts to state objectively that any one moral consideration is the only moral litmus test. He calls WEIRD (White, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic) any attempt to focus solely on care/harm as the only moral framework.In case one is skeptical that sanctity, authority, or loyalty to a group should really figure into moral calculations - and I remain skeptical after reading this book - Haidt launches into a long defense of religious morality and honor cultures, pointing out the advantages of, in many cases, advancing the needs of the group rather than the needs of the individual. He points to his time in India as an eye-opening experience that began his conversion from die-hard liberal into something more of a centrist. Continually he states that ""morality binds and blinds us"" (I got really sick of that phrase) to suggest that by nature we form insular groups and are wary of outsiders, so we need to embrace that impulse on some level. He also makes another animal analogy, saying (over and over) that we are 90% chimp and 10% bee, to describe us as having a hivish/groupish nature that has helped us survive in the past millennia. To this end he wastes a lot of time promoting group selection, and in doing so completely loses me. Biological sciences are not Haidt's specialty, and he would have done better to leave them alone. There's a reason group selection has been abandoned for over three decades; because groups aren't replicators. Plain and simple. All the phenomena he describes are perfectly well explained by individual selection, gene pools, and even memetics. I don't know why he feels the need to justify group selection.Haidt's defense of religion ignores the belief content of religions completely, and he spends a lot of time attacking the ""new atheists"" who focus only on the stated beliefs of religious texts and religious believers. It's a defense that I'm sure religious people wouldn't take kindly to - they largely believe their beliefs are objectively true; not just a good evolutionary strategy to be provide community. (And surely there are ways to create communities without requiring belief in the unproven or unprovable.) It reminds me of The Life of Pi (I've seen the movie, not read the book yet), which claims to be able to make its listeners believe in God, simply because God is a better story than believing in cold, hard reality. Similarly, I think it's a justification that believers would not readily embrace.Much of the rest of the book is devoted to showing some good ideas on both the liberal left and the conservative right, explain a bit of how we got into our present situation and the historical trends that set it up.There are good insights to be had here, but I would be reluctant to recommend this book to anyone. Haidt relentlessly tells us what he's about to say, says it, reviews it part-way, says some more, and then summarizes at the end. And then revisits it later. I can see how this works well as a study technique, but it makes for a book twice as large as its actual content, and I have no ability to skim, so I ended up reading the same things repeatedly. At least the benefit of that is that his final conclusion pages made it easy to summarize the book for this review."
75,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12375112-arjun-ravichandran,4,"This is a well-prepared journey through human nature, with many entertaining and ambiguous pit stops along the way. The author, (whose previous book on happiness I had stoically enjoyed) is a psychologist specializing in moral psychology. The topic, as should be obvious to anyone who has spent any modicum of time on social media, is pretty pertinent and the author should be commended for remaining resolutely non-partisan throughout.He divides his thesis into 3 parts (i.e. his answer to the question posed in the book's subtitle). Each part lays out the crux, and then follows a central metaphor with elucidates the point, before a series of chapters highlighting research and tangents serve to back up the point. The first point the author sallies is : our political instincts stem from our gut, our unconscious mind - and it is only after this that our conscious minds begin scrambling for justificatory and strategic rationalizations regarding the same. The central metaphor here is that of the elephant and the rider - with the elephant being the mammoth beast of tribal moralistic vengeance, and the rider pathetically trying to explain to himself and his fellows his animals' misbehaviour. This is, of course, Psychology 101. The second point : morality extends far beyond simply Care/Harm. This point requires some unpacking - the central metaphor for this part of the book is that of the tongue and its taste receptors. The author argues via analogy that the mind has more than one 'moral receptor' i.e the human mind is compartmentalized in a way that allows it to appropriate different moral sensibilities. The author formulates a new paradigm he calls Moral Foundations Theory, i.e. which single receptor, or collection of receptors does an individual's political ideology ultimately rest on. The author persuasively argues that liberals tend to rest on the Care/Harm moral receptors (i.e. a concern with oppression and obvious injustice to the exclusion of all else) - conservatives, on the other hand, while concerned with Care/Harm, have a broader array of moral receptors to build their ideology upon. These other moral receptors include Sanctity (the ineluctable sense of sacredness and taboo), Loyalty (the importance of remaining loyal to the tribe and to your peers), and Authority (the importance of adherence to the leader, especially in times of danger). This is the crux of the tension between liberals and conservatives - they literally occupy different moral realities (moral matrices, as the author uses the term), and have different moral priorities. Neither is superior to the other, but simply different (though, as mentioned, the author does note, in a twist of supreme irony, that conservatives are literally more broad-minded than liberals) This was my favorite portion of the book, and I suspect it must have been for the author as well. The third point : morality binds and blinds. Here, the author takes us on a whirlwind detour through evolutionary theory, and finally arrives at an understanding of the processes of group-level selection. This latter is fundamentally different from the prevailing view of evolution as working on the individual - when we distance ourselves from this view, we see how altruism and general moral behavior makes sense. For what matters is the group, and how this group binds and coheres together, in order to outgroup other groups, and thus, ""turn resources into offspring"" - seen in this light, (and the central metaphor for these chapters is that we are 90% chimp and 10% bees, i.e. we have a certain hivish mentality that can activated at a moments' notice), morality and religion are invaluable aids to the forming of coherent moral communities, and thus allowed human beings to find a solution to the perennial 'free rider' problem. The author notes as an aside, how incredibly hard it actually is to create a moral community with emphasis on ties beyond mere kinship - and concludes that morality/religion were invaluable in this regard. But this also means that we are tribal creatures (morality binds) parochially altruistic to our fellows sharing the same moral matrix, but also simultaneously, capable of vicious cruelty to outgroupers (morality blinds). In conclusion, I found this a well-written, deeply engaging tour of human nature - I can't give it 5 stars, because, at the end of the day, it is a book written by a scientist. There are various scholarly citations, references to other thinkers, all heaped upon each other in a slightly heady mess. It was difficult to perceive the author's original voice other than as a mild interlocutor. This is probably a personal peeve of mine, but I did not feel the book was written at a sufficient depth to warrant a full score, despite its obvious quality. The author manages to conclude with a note of cautious optimism (the sign of a true moderate) - as he has persuasively demonstrated, we are animals who are hardwired for membership in a tribal moralistic community. This makes it difficult to override our elephant when confronted with the outgroup of different moral matrices - it is difficult, but not impossible. It simply requires empathy and understanding. After all, as the author concludes, ""we are only here for a short while. Let's try to work things out."" "
76,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/142980-rachel,5,"This book has changed the way I see my own ""moral"" inclinations. I think it's part of my personality, but I feel distaste for group shows of loyalty and talk of sacred ideals we need to ""protect."" But I've learned that feeling group loyalty and irrational dedication to certain ideals is actually a good way to promote group unity and the survival of our species. I may not feel unity by participating in a 4th of July parade or listening to religious speakers, but I do feel a sense of sacred unity when I appreciate nature, when I dance, and sometimes when I sing in a group. I might not hold religious images or objects sacred (a holdover from my Protestant background?), but I do see photographs of others as having a certain ""sacredness"" (otherwise why would the idea of revenge porn, when a perpetrator alters an innocent photograph to be pornographic, bother me so much?). This book felt like such a revelation to me. It gives me a ""rational"" science-based reason to invest in my religion for reasons other than my own benefit. Organized religion helps us trust other members of our religion more than we would trust people normally (yeah, sometimes a bad thing when people take advantage of that). It helps us feel more connected to people, and helps us be more pro-social. Haidt is one of the primary researchers who came up with the moral foundations questionnaire. A former classmate of mine introduced it to me when I was complaining about some political research. It divides moral questions into six subsets. American liberals tend to care more about harm/care and fairness/cheating than the other four subsections. American conservatives care about all six, but they care more about loyalty and sanctity a lot more than the typical liberal. I highly recommend this book to everyone, but especially to religious liberals who might feel the need to defend why they are religious to other liberals (or to themselves). I feel more comfortable with my own religiousity, now that I see it as a way to motivate me to cooperate with non-kin. I don't know if I'll ever be able to embrace authority and dogma--it's simply not part of my personality--but I can understand why people who do that are useful to society.This was a library book, so I'd like to list some of my favorite quotes, mostly for my own benefit.""[Glaucon realized that] the most important principle for designing an ethical society is to make sure that everyone's reputation is on the line all the time, so that bad behavior will always bring bad consequences."" (ch 4)""if you put individuals together in the right way, such that individuals can use their reasoning powers to disconfirm the claims of others, and all individuals feel some common bond or shared fate that allows them to interact civilly, you can create a group that ends up producing good reasoning as an emergent property of the social system."" (ch 4)""To replace wiring diagrams, Marcus suggests a better analogy: The brain is like a book, the first draft of which is written by the genes during fetal development. No chapters are complete at birth, and some are just rough outlines waiting to be filled in during childhood. But not a single chapter--be it on sexuality, language, food preferences, or morality--consists of blank pages on which a society can inscribe any conceivable set of words."" (ch. 7)""A Durkheimian society at its best would be a stable network composed of many nested and overlapping groups that socialize, reshape, and care for individuals who, if left to their own devices, would pursue shallow, carnal, and selfish pleasures. A Durkheimian society would value self-control over self-expression, duty over rights, and loyalty to one's groups over concerns for out-groups."" (ch. 8)""collective emotions pull humans fully but temporarily into the higher of our two realms, the realm of the sacred, where the self disappears and collective interests predominate."" (ch. 10)[about why sacrifice doesn't strengthen secular communes] ""To invest social conventions with sanctity is to hide their arbitrariness in a cloak of seeming necessity."" -Roy Rappaport ""the very ritual practices that the New Atheists dismiss as costly, inefficient, and irrational turn out to be a solution to one of the hardest problems humans face: cooperation without kinship. Irrational beliefs can sometimes help the group function more rationally, particularly when those beliefs rest upon the Sanctity foundation."" (ch. 11)""The only thing that was powerfully associated with the moral benefits of religion was how enmeshed people were in relationships with their co-coreligionists."" (ch. 11). ""I believe that liberalism--which has done so much to bring about freedom and equal opportunity--is not sufficient as a governing philosophy. It tends to overreach, change too many things too quickly, and reduce the stock of moral capital inadvertently. Conversely, while conservatives do a better job of preserving moral capital, they often fail to notice certain classes of victims, fail to limit the predations of certain powerful interests, and fail to see the need to change or update institutions as times change."" (ch. 12)"
77,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9402537-preston-kutney,5,"Haidt illustrates the mechanics of the conservative/liberal divide drawing from research on social, evolutionary, and moral psychology. The work is all based on the assumption that both parties are sincere in their desire to make the country better, but fundamentally disagreeing on what ""better"" means.Incredibly insightful, and so clearly written (in that ""wow I understood that complex idea immediately"" way). Can't recommend highly enough.Three big insights:1. How do we make decisions on what policies to support?Our conscious rationality is a rider on the back of the elephant of our moral intuitions. We make our decisions by gut feeling, and use our powers of reason to construct post hoc justifications. Consistent with the Kahneman ""System 1 and System 2"" thinking, the unconscious, automatic, emotional, intuitive system makes the decision, and then the conscious, rational, deliberate system comes up with explanations. System 2 is the ""Sean Spicer"" to our intuitive brain's Trump.2. What are the moral values of liberals and conservatives and how do they differ?This is where things get really interesting. Moral Foundations Theory attempts to explain the variation in moral reasoning through a set of values that Liberals and Conservatives interpret and prioritize differently. The 6 moral foundations are all evolutionary adaptations that promote cooperation and successful group behavior:a. Care/Harm - Evolved to care for offspring, which are much more vulnerable than the young of other species. Also a sensitivity to suffering and need. For Liberals, this is a top priority, and the basis of many of the social policies that protect vulnerable groups. Conservatives also value this, but to a much lesser degree.b. Fairness/Cheating - Evolved to ensure equitable division of labor in groups, and punish free-riders. Both political sides value this, but they interpret it differently. To a Liberal, fairness means equal opportunity and outcomes; to a Conservative, it means proportionality - everyone reaps what they sow.c. Liberty/Oppression - A sensitivity to unjust oppression. To a Liberal, the opposition to inequality and hierarchy, and a check the power of corporations and the wealthy. To a Conservative, the freedom from an intrusive government that infringes on their individual liberties.d. Authority/Subversion - Evolved to give humans the ability to navigate hierarchy, which is essential for large groups. Liberals are not responsive to this foundation (and may even see it as negative virtue that maintains ), while Conservatives are sensitive to disrespect for authority and the status quo.e. Loyalty/Betrayal - Evolved to foster trust in groups. Again, Liberals are not very responsive to appeals to loyalty to country or in-group, as they tend to more universalist ideas. Conservatives care very deeply about loyalty to country, and ""America First"" policies.f. Sanctity/Divinity - This foundation has two aspects - a sense of disgust, which evolved to protect us from a world of diseases and pathogens, and a sense of the sacred, which allowed humans to cooperate based on shared ideas. Liberals not very responsive to this foundation, with the exception of environmentalism. Conservatives dominate, with strong values about family, sexuality, life. Almost any political issue can be decomposed into a different interpretation or ranking of these 6 moral foundations, and I find that really powerful and neat.3. How did we get different moral values? How did liberals and conservatives develop these differing moral values? Genetics! Here's how it works:a. Genetic predisposition 1) to respond strongly to threats and fear (which is correlated with conservatism) and 2) to seek new sensations, or be open to new experiences (which is correlated with liberalism) can explain a lot of variation in political beliefs.b. Predisposition guides us to different settings, including surrounding ourselves with people who think similarly. Think about who is more likely to want to live in a city - someone with a high threat sensitivity, or someone who seeks novel experiences.c. The elephant-rider model kicks in, and we seek to rationalize and explain the values of the elephant. Our heels are now rationally dug in."
78,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5555043-the-pirate-ghost-formerly-known-as-the-curmudgeon,4," This is the sequal to The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom. The audiobook narrated by the author, Johnathan Haidt himself who does a good job. He has a clear voice, and, of course, his prose fits his demenaor well.  In this book, Haidt builds on his metaphor of the elephant and Rider developed in the Happiness Hypothesis. Instead of a general lesson about how people get along, Haidt is attempting to tackle gridlock in American Politics (or any politics where there are a clearly discernable ""left"" and ""right"" groups). It is also a warning to the political left, or, Liberals, in this country.  Haidt himself is an unabashed liberal. He is also intelligent and interested in understanding how to fix some of the problems that have lead to gridlock, if they can be fixed. He takes the time to explain how we got where we are today. Generally he is building on the Happiness Hyptothesis. He is making a point that, as he notes many times in the book, was started long ago and discussed from Plato to Darwin and beyond. Humans developed like we have with varrying orientation where morality is considered. The polarization between left and right is not simply ideological, or more correctly, to call it ideological may be accurate to a point but it grossly understates how long and how complicated the forming of modern morality is.  Haidt's research has helped him catagorize morality into 5 traits comon to all. He researched political elections as well as history and philosophy and conducted his own psychological studies to support his conclusions. The warning for liberals is that, liberals sense of morality is usually centered on autonomy, the idea that everyone's freedome of choice in life should be protected and that change is not bad, while the political right, albeit different factions within the political right, has learned or developed communication to work on all five characteristics of morality.  Haidt does not call this good or bad. He simply calls it like he sees it. He also offers other ways for the liberals to look at the political right that are not desparaging of the right and do not start with the right as uncaring corporate greed mongers. He suggests this is why the right can say things that the left sees as complety untrue, yet they stick and stay believed, true or not. It's the ability to communicate on multiple levels of morality compared to only two on the left that enables the Right's message to resonate with independents. Haidt tells us that, for the left to communicate more effectively to a broader range of independent voters, they need to get a handle on communicaiton along moral lines.  Haidt also has another message about gridlock. For Gridlock to end, the right and left need to find a way to step outside of their ideology and take a logical and rational look at thigns. There are ways that right and left can see eye to eye and there are good examples in the book. Haidt also urges people (left and right) to be more aware that what we feel comfortable in political ideology is not completly due to conscious selection. There are developmental reasons we side like we do that may not take all facts into account. ""The Rider serves the Elephant"" he does not steer it, it steers the rider and the rider serves the elephant by working as it's lawyer and autobiographer. It rights the narative that the Elephant wants to hear. We right the narrative that we want to hear.  It's the sermon about Mustard Seeds (Matthew 13, Bible) some fell on good ground, some fell on bad ground.... like Haidt sees it, we all think that we are the ones who fell on the good ground and in that, we all build a narrative that serves what we want to see, rather than what is there to be seen. To break out of political gridloc and ugly partisan politics, we need to till the common ground, then reap what we sew. "
79,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1714947-emily,4,"Jonathan Haidt's look at the psychology of why politics and religion are so divisive - and getting more so - is fascinating.For all of our vaunted reasoning powers as human beings, we actually are more accurately described as creatures of intuition. Dr. Haidt outlines dozens of studies that have shown that our initial ""gut"" reaction comes first and then our reason works to find justifications for our reaction. Linking this to politics, he says that ""part of what it means to be a partisan is that you have acquired the right set of intuitive reactions to hundreds of words and phrases"" such as ""taxes,"" ""welfare,"" or ""pro-life."" In fact, due to the hits of dopamine the brain gets when one feels justified or apparent contradictions are resolved, Dr. Haidt states that ""extreme partisanship may be literally addictive.""Dr. Haidt uses dozens of effective analogies in his book which help the reader to understand how our brains work - the main one compares our intuition to an elephant and our reason to the elephant's rider. I like this one: ""Our moral thinking is much more like a politician searching for votes than a scientist searching for truth.""Confirmation bias - ""the tendency to seek out and interpret new evidence in ways that confirm what you already think"" - figures heavily into this theme. ""People are quite good at challenging statements made by other people, but if it's your belief, then it's your possession--your child, almost-- and you want to protect it, not challenge it and risk losing it.""I'd never heard the term WEIRD - referring to cultures that are ""Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic"" - but I appreciate him pointing out that WEIRD people are statistical outliers. ""They are the least typical, least representative people you could study if you want to make generalizations about human nature."" And, of course, Americans are more extreme outliers than Europeans, and the educated upper middle class in the US is ""the most unusual of all."" He sums up the greatest peculiarity of WEIRD culture in this sentence: ""The WEIRDer you are, the more you see a world full of separate objects, rather than relationships.""The Six Moral Foundations was eye-opening to me as a way to differentiate between those of a ""liberal"" mind-set versus a ""conservative"" mind-set. Whereas ""liberals"" generally put greatest emphasis on Care (lack of harm), Fairness (in the sense of equality rather than proportionality), and Liberty (versus oppression), ""conservatives"" define Fairness differently (in the sense of proportionality more than equality), put less emphasis on Care, and add the moralities of Loyalty, Authority, and Sanctity. My summary here doesn't do it justice, of course. I highly recommend you pick up the book yourself.I appreciate Dr. Haidt's summations of each chapter. It's easy to lose track when so much new information is thrown at you at once, and his concluding section in each chapter is very useful in keeping the most salient points in mind.He ends the book with two valid points he feels liberals have that conservatives should pay more attention to, and two valid counterpoints conservatives have that liberals would do well to heed.* Governments can and should restrain corporate superorganisms* Some problems really can be solved by regulation* Markets are miraculous* You can't help the bees by destroying the hive.In other words, both sides have important contributions to make and neither is all right or all wrong. We need to listen better, recognize when our ""elephant"" is in charge, and determine to seek common ground.For more book reviews, come visit my blog, Build Enough Bookshelves."
80,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7482598-jayesh,4,"The author puts too much weight on evolution and nature than was necessary to make his points. (And this is from someone like me, who thinks people in general put too little weight on nature in the nature vs nurture.) While reading Part 3, I was continuously worried that he's gonna confuse ""is"" vs ""ought"" problem of morality, but I think he's careful in his statements and accepts that his functional description of morality is incomplete without a normative one.Some highlights:For a hundred years, psychologists have written about the need to think well of oneself. But Mark Leary, a leading researcher on self-consciousness, thought that it made no evolutionary sense for there to be a deep need for self-esteem.15 For millions of years, our ancestors’ survival depended upon their ability to get small groups to include them and trust them, so if there is any innate drive here, it should be a drive to get others to think well of us. Based on his review of the research, Leary suggested that self-esteem is more like an internal gauge, a “sociometer” that continuously measures your value as a relationship partner. Whenever the sociometer needle drops, it triggers an alarm and changes our behavior.We do moral reasoning not to reconstruct the actual reasons why we ourselves came to a judgment; we reason to find the best possible reasons why somebody else ought to join us in our judgment.Rather, what I’m saying is that we must be wary of any individual’s ability to reason. We should see each individual as being limited, like a neuron. A neuron is really good at one thing: summing up the stimulation coming into its dendrites to “decide” whether to fire a pulse along its axon. A neuron by itself isn’t very smart. But if you put neurons together in the right way you get a brain; you get an emergent system that is much smarter and more flexible than a single neuron. In the same way, each individual reasoner is really good at one thing: finding evidence to support the position he or she already holds, usually for intuitive reasons. We should not expect individuals to produce good, open-minded, truth-seeking reasoning, particularly when self-interest or reputational concerns are in play. But if you put individuals together in the right way, such that some individuals can use their reasoning powers to disconfirm the claims of others, and all individuals feel some common bond or shared fate that allows them to interact civilly, you can create a group that ends up producing good reasoning as an emergent property of the social system. This is why it’s so important to have intellectual and ideological diversity within any group or institution whose goal is to find truth (such as an intelligence agency or a community of scientists) or to produce good public policy (such as a legislature or advisory board)."

A lifelong public servant with years of experience, well-articulated policies and a few ethical problems, was defeated by a mean-spirited, egotistical, thin-skinned, inexperienced narcissist with no government experience, vague, poorly-informed policy statements and a 15% truthfulness rating by Politifact. How the hell did that happen???!!! This book goes a good way towards explaining how it happened. First, the author shows that most people’s political positions are based on what appeals emotionally to their particular moral sensibility. Rather than using reason to arrive at our positions, we arrive at positions emotionally and then use reason to justify them. Next, he identifies six moral pillars that his research shows are the foundation, in varying degrees, of the human moral sense. Based on research, he associates Liberalism, Conservatism and Libertarianism with placing different degrees of value on each of the pillars. His hypothesis is that Liberalism tends to fail in the U.S. because it over-emphasizes the Care, Liberty and Fairness pillars at the expense of Sanctity, Loyalty and Authority. That doesn’t sell well with Americans, who are by and large loyal, religious people who respect authority. Finally, he explains how research demonstrates that humans are evolved to be loyal to groups, not to abstract ideals or to humanity as a whole. This, he proposes, explains how partisanship becomes so extreme and adds to the explanation of why the Liberal narrative fails to appeal to large groups of Americans. I thought this was an excellent analysis, written in 2012, but implicitly predicting the 2016 election result with eerie accuracy. I think leaders of the Democratic Party and progressive organizations should read it and take it seriously, if they want to avoid another catastrophic electoral defeat. The author also provides the reader with information about the Moral Foundations questionnaire (www.yourmorals.org) that will tell you where you fall in how important the six foundations are to you, and CivilPolitics (www.civilpolitics.org), an organization committed to increasing the level of civility in our political life. I highly recommend both sites. Interestingly, although I self-identify as Slightly Liberal, my scores on the Moral Foundations quiz lined up more with Conservatives. I’m not sure what to make of that. I love a science book that does two things:1.	Provides scientific information in a readable way that a non-scientist can comprehend2.	Provides research-based evidence for its positions, rather than just a string of unsupported assertions.This book fit both of my criteria. Highly recommended. Like my reviews?

82,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/929592-jon,5,"I can't remember the last time I read a book which so substantially changed the way I look at things. I know next to nothing about moral- or evolutionary-psychology, but as presented here, with a wealth of examples and footnotes, I find Haidt's point of view utterly convincing. He has developed a ""Moral Foundations Theory"" based on six intuitive dichotomies: 1) care/harm, 2) liberty/oppression, 3) fairness/cheating, 4) loyalty/betrayal, 5) authority/subversion, and 6) sanctity/degradation. On the basis of many thousands of interviews he has determined that liberals care strongly only about the first and second, somewhat strongly about the third, and hardly at all about the last three. Libertarians care very strongly about the second, less so the third, and hardly at all about the rest. Social conservatives care equally strongly about all six. Of course what is ""fair"" depends on the interviewee--liberals think it means everybody gets what they need; conservatives think it means everybody gets what they deserve. But it clarified my thinking on questions such as the one about an artist sinking a crucifix in his own urine or smearing feces on a painting of the Virgin Mary. Do you think like a liberal (or a libertarian), where 2 is paramount?--the artist can do what he wants, and if you don't like it you are free not to look. Or like a conservative, where 6 weighs heavily--the world is a dirtier place with such objects in it. Haidt convinced me that we arrive at our moral attitudes emotionally and immediately, and that we rationalize them later, not like a philosopher reasoning a way to the truth, but like a lawyer making a case. That's why arguing facts with your opposite number in politics or religion doesn't work: you have to engage at an emotional level. I agree with my Goodreads friends that, written in the middle of the Obama administration, the book doesn't really deal with the level to which we've arrived today. I was also disturbed by one of his final discussions in which he equated buying health care with buying groceries--a false comparison in my view. But over all, I think the book provides at least a preliminary framework for helping us learn to get along together. I hope."
83,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1135225-brian,2,"According to Haidt “we are downright lucky that we evolved this complex moral psychology” and that “the human mind is designed to ‘do’ morality.” But designed by who? He foists that large question off on two evolutionary psychologists with the cryptic note ""evolution is a design process; it's just not an intelligent design process."" These assertions contra arguments pop up occasionally in the text and are maddening to encounter.When he writes that “human nature is not just intrinsically moral, it’s also intrinsically moralistic, critical, and judgmental” he identifies something that Christians can agree with: our fallen human nature. And when he says that “intuitions come first, reasoning second” he, unwittingly, affirms a way that we are, but not how we should be. Ecclesiastes 5:2 cautions us not to be rash with our mouths (thinking before we speak) and James tells us to be quick to listen, but slow to speak and slow to anger (1:19).An interesting aspect of his argument is what he calls the rationalist delusion. “When a group of people make something sacred, the members of the cult lost the ability to think clearly about it.” But guess what? Dr. Haidt does not fall into this category, even as he takes pains to explain a brief history of moral psychology and his own adherence to different paradigms over time. But of course he’s not part of a cult, he’s been able to stand outside of it and think very clearly about it.As a moral absolutist I did not gain much satisfaction from the reading of this book, or gain much insight, as his enterprise is the ""how and what"" of morality and not the ""why."" And with such a fungible starting point even his solid observations seem trite."
84,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/142271-pamela,5,"Fascinating examination of the basic moral categories that preoccupy liberals versus conservatives versus libertarians in this country. To some degree, it's a plea (from a liberal author) not to dismiss conservatives, as so many liberals do, as uncaring or greedy. Conservatives are highly invested in issues touching on sanctity (not necessarily religious sanctity, but at least the view of some objects and institutions as sacred), loyalty, and authority (I hope I have remembered these categories correctly--book had to go back to the library!), while liberals are most invested in issues of care/harm and fairness. (Libertarians tend to have a single concern: liberty.) Haidt has reviewed or himself done a great deal of research relating to these six axes of value. An interesting note: Conservatives are more accurate about liberals' ideas and stances than vice versa. Haidt presents evidence that, wherever we land on the spectrum, we have a strong tendency to fit facts to our preconceptions. Our basic personality/emotional leanings lead us to our political positions, which we then rationalize. We do NOT choose our positions via the route of reason, which could as easily land us in a different political camp. (Haidt gives the Democratic Party this tip: You've been losing ground to the Republicans for decades precisely because you appeal more to reason than to these underlying value commitments. Reason apparently rarely changes a voter's mind.) "

Those who read Jonathan Haidt's book The Happiness Hypothesis will I think find this book even more extraordinary. As I read it in manuscript, I am not really at liberty to give away too much content, but it goes well beyond the model on Jon's Moral Foundations website, where he constructed a research based model of the different moral universes of liberals, conservatives and more recently libertarians. What this book is about is a project for the neuroscience foundations of morality and I find his research utterly convincing, very generative and unfortunately likely to mean I will have to re-write portions of my own book on conflict.:) And I do think it calls for a major re-think of political strategies across the political spectrum.Footnote: I have not met Jon, but as our research interests, his in morale psychology, and mine in conflict are parallel paths in many ways, with many links and connections, I have corresponded with him for some years now."
86,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8686546-feyzan---the-raven-boy,5,"4.5 stars Very occasionally, I read a book that changes the way I view the world. | read quite a bit and am highly influenceable, but there are only a handful of books that have changed the filter through which I see the world. Jonathan Haidt's book The Righteous Mind is one of  books. Each one of us want to protect our families, care about our friends and want to make our country better but we seems to have different ideas on how to reach these goals. Why do some people's solutions seem unkind and oppressive to us? And why do we seem to be talking in different languages or sometimes having completely different conversations? For example: The issue of immigrants. One side see them as a threat to their family, economy and welfare, the other see them as people need to be protected. How is that two groups can have such different opnion? And how can we reach a shared opnion when we are seeing things from two completely different perspectives? The Righteous Mind attempts to  answer this question. It's an amazing and fascinating book that I highly recommend. It's a paradigm shifting book that will transform your perspective and help you understand the other side of the story. It has great examples, and is well argued and structured.The first part of the book postulates a theory that reason is a servent of intuitions which goes on to prove that, when it comes to the matters of right or wrong, we take decisions based on our instincts and then we rationalize those decisions after the fact.  Haidt argues that our entire reasoning process evolved not to find truth, but to convince others that we are right. He uses the metaphor of an rider on an elephant. The elephant is our intuitive reasoning -that is the mostly subconscious automatic processes that drive most of our behavior. The rider is our reasoning and, basically, is just along for the ride. It is like a press secretary whose sole job is to defend the policies of a Prime Minister or a President no matter how bad they are. There are times when we cant even think of any rational explanations, but we still stand by our intuitive choices -this is called moral dumbfounding and is quite common once you start looking for it. Apparently, the higher your IQ, the more arguments you can generate on the side your elephant is already leaning towards. But higher IQ doesn't necessarily mean you get any closer to the truth.  Another point that he makes in the chapter is that, contrary to popular belief, our morality isn't innate. We are born with a first draft version of morality and then our experiences and culture shapes that draft into its final form. In the second part Haidt introduces us to a Model Foundation Theory. The important point here is that humans are predisposed to be either conservative or liberals, based on their personality. And most of our decisions and preferences are shaped by these personality traits. Haidt identified six cross-cultural moral foundations which he referred to as taste buds of a righteous mind. We all have them but we all assign different value to each on of them. For example: some people like sweets others don't. It doesn't mean that their taste buds are incapable of enjoying sweet flavor, it just mean that they give more value to something else. These moral foundations are the basis of our different moral values. Out of six moral foundations, identified by Haidt, liberals only use three of them, while conservative use all six of them. However, Haidt doesn't go in detail as to who is right and who is wrong, he just explains why we have different moral values. Liberals, according to Haidt, are outliers whereas conservatives are more common and constitutes a larger part of the population.  Liberal are more common in WEIRD (western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic) countries where individualism is more common than collectivism. The three values liberals use to make moral decisions include:  care/harm, fairness/cheating and liberty/oppression. Conservatives also use these foundations in addition to three other foundations: loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversivenes and sanctity/degradation. These last three foundations are linked with collective altruism that help create and maintain tight cohesion within a group and help ensure that if a group faces an attack, it's members will be able to fend it off.  In a nutshell, conservatives are more sensitive towards traditions and religion. They believe that loyalty should be rewarded and and disloyal people should be punished. They care less about individuality and focus more on the collective benefits.  Conservative politicians/Republicans understand moral foundation better and are able to trigger all six moral foundation in people. Democrats lack this level of manipulation. In the last chapter Hadit compared humans with bees and chimpanzees. He says that we are 90% chimapnnzees - who are selfish and self-serving, and 10% bees - who work in teams. However, our loyalty lies with only our group. We don't see or understand the opposing groups.This book elevated my understanding regarding morality and helped me understand why and how people think what they think. The good thing about moral foundtion concept is that you can apply it to any issue and it will help you understand how people come to a certain conclusion. However, I think neither conservative or liberal can see the bigger picture. We need to develop cross-group bonding and need to work on understanding each other better. We don't have to be more like bees, we need to be better. There were certain things that were said about religion that I don't completely agree with. I know long battles have been fought in the name of religion (rivalry between Christian sects, forcing of Christian beliefs and so on) but I don't think modern atheism can solve all our issues and  bring peace. Almost all wars have been fought for just one thing - power. And we can't escape this vicious circle until we learn to create more cohesive in and out group bonding."
87,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62691310-gary-guinn,5,"At a time like this, with such rancorous debate between the political and religious left and right, Jonathan Haidt offers an empirical analysis of the development of morality and the genetic and cultural influences that shape it. He doesn't push an agenda, except perhaps the hope that he can insert a little reason into the emotional chaos. As a social scientist specializing in moral development/psychology, he is widely published and widely read in the area, and his basic analysis of how humans develop morality and the fundamental psychological/emotional/cultural building blocks from which we develop it is impressive.There were times, as expected, here and there when I disagreed with one or another of his assertions about morality, but the book as a whole is a convincing argument for patience and understanding from both sides of the political and religious spectrums.I highly recommend the book for anyone who enjoys reading a careful argument, supported by an immense amount of evidence. For anyone seeking a good reason to step back, take a breath, and listen to the other side."
88,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11509692-dave-schey,4,"""The Righteous Mind"" by Jonathan Haidt is certainly a book worth reading. The author, however, started losing my support when he seemed to be stressing that the reasoning mind (the rider) was a slave to support the intuitive mind (the elephant). Haidt suggests that the reasoning mind works only to find evidence to support the intuitive mind. I prefer the path Daniel Kahneman took in ""Thinking, Fast and Slow."" There, Kahneman talks about the dangers of going with just the intuitive mind. The reasoning or analytical mind should be used to test the intuitive mind; like a fact-checker. I agree with Haidt in the sense that most (or at least too many) people go with their intuitive decision without questioning it; especially, if their leader (political or religious) supports it. "

I believe non-fiction can be divided into Big Idea books, and Many Little Ideas books. This one is most decidely a Big Idea book. Haidt intends to do for the study of morality approximately what Noam Chomsky did for the study of language. He postulates that morality isn't just an abstraction about which the human mind can think, but a more specific activity that the human brain is predisposed to do, like language. He asserts, moreover, that he has found more than one type of morality module in the human brain, and they provide an emotional response (""this is bad"" or ""this is good"") in advance of rational thought, which is more like a press secretary, coming along afterwards to provide a cover story for why we feel that way.The great news is that he thinks this provides an explanation for why Right and Left in America disagree so much. The bad news is that if he's right I'm not sure there's much that can be done about it.This last part isn't Haidt's opinion; he appears to think that understanding a problem can result in fixing it. That sounds plausible, but Haidt's own analysis can be used to argue that the current impasse is unresolvable. Regardless, the truth or falsity of a theory should not be judged by looking at its consequences, so let's look at what Haidt is actually asserting.He claims to have experimental evidence that we have, not one moral sense, but half a dozen.1) Care/harm2) Liberty/oppression3) Fairness/cheating4) Loyalty/betrayal5) Authority/subversion6) Sanctity/degradationSpecifically, what he claims is that when we hear about an event or action, one or more of these mental modules may be triggered, sending a gut level emotion of ""hey, that's not right!"" Then, and only then (a fraction of a second after we have already decided that something is wrong), does reason start considering the matter, like a lawyer who has been instructed to find an argument for his client's innocence is using reason, but with the conclusion already determined.In order to develop this list, Haidt and company have developed an extensive list of disgusting stories, mean to trigger one or another of these moral modules. An example is a story about a brother and sister who decide, just once, to commit incest, using birth control and never repeating it, but feeling good about the fact that they had done that thereafter. When subjects in Haidt's lab are told this story, they almost all say some variation of ""ewwww"", but have a difficult time coming up with a reason why. In the end they either resort to saying things like ""even if they used birth control there's some chance of pregnancy and the child could have birth defects"", or ""even if they think they feel good about it afterwards they must suffer some mental harm"", or else they just throw up their hands and don't know what to say. In other words, they are not reasoning to try to determine the answer, they are using reason to try to make their way to the answer that they knew in the first second.But, and here's the interesting thing, the responses to many of these stories varied by political leanings of the subject, even though the stories themselves had no obvious political content. In particular, liberals had a much stronger response to Care/harm, a somewhat weaker response to Liberty/oppression, a weaker yet response to Fairness/cheating, and very little response at all to Loyalty/betrayal, Authority/subversion, or Sanctity/degradation. This is in marked contrast to conservatives, who have a roughly equal response to all six moral modules.Libertarians, though much less common than either other group, were examined, and found to have (obviously) a very strong response to Liberty/oppression, a weaker response to Fairness/cheating, and very little response to any of the others. This just in: libertarians really don't care about Care.Haidt believes that the fundamental mistake of the American Left in trying to communicate with the rest of the nation, is that they speak only the language of Care/harm, Liberty/oppression, and Fairness/cheating, with emphasis on the first, and greet any discussion of Loyalty, Authority, or Sanctity with blank stares or outright hostility. He likens this to a cook who can only taste sweetness and to a lesser extent salt, and is oblivious to bitterness, sourness, or savoriness. Unless their customers have the same ""blind spots"", their food is unlikely to be well received.In some regards, I think Haidt is onto something. Much of the discussion of the Obama healthcare act did seem to reveal a remarkable tin ear on the part of the Democrats for anything other than Care/harm. Their response to issues like flag burning also is revealing in large part because they don't just defend the First Amendment right to burn a flag, they often seem to think that getting upset about it is in poor taste. The different ways the Left and Right in this country regard the virtues of Loyalty, respect for Authority, and Sanctity explains a lot about their attitudes towards the military, the police, unusual sexual practices, welfare for the poor, and so on. In particular, it does a better job of explaining the differences than, say, religion. Many have pointed out that Christianity can as easily be used to justify left-wing policies as right-wing ones, and the tendency of those on the right to use it more is probably more effect (of a greater regard for Authority) than cause.It also suggests, of course, that if these mental modules are ""organized in advance of experience"" in a way similar to our ability to learn language (we aren't born knowing a language but we seem clearly predisposed to learn them), then they may be at least partly genetic. Evidence from twin studies (both identical twins raised apart, and twins vs. sibling comparisons) tends to suggest that this is true.All of which informs my reaction to Haidt's next point, which is that one of the main reasons for the increasingly divisive political discourse in America is due to the fact that there are no longer any southern conservatives in the Democratic party, and no northern liberals in the Republican one. When Democrat and Republican meet in a room in Washington, now, they do so not just as members of different teams but as people with fundamentally different ideas about what is moral, which is a far harder gap to bridge than having different ideas about how to achieve a moral result.Haidt's book is well written and exciting to read, since I do believe that he's uncovered a lens which can allow us to see clearly much that was previously inscrutable. It raises as many questions as it answers, of course; for example, why do we not find a lot of people with outsized regard for Loyalty, Authority, and Sanctity, who have no regard for Care, Liberty, or Fairness? Why do we not find people who value Loyalty, Care, and Sanctity, but little or no regard for Authority, Liberty, or Fairness? There are 2^6=64 different possible moral senses in his scheme, but we see more Conservatives than anything else, and more Liberals than Libertarians. Why?The second question is, does Haidt's analysis help us at all with the current lack of any real communication across the gap? His assertion in the last chapter is that simply being aware of how we differ can help us to understand that we have blind spots, and that understanding can help us to understand where the other side is coming from. I don't doubt that in the case of a researcher who immerses himself in this topic (understanding different people's moral senses), this could be true. I am more doubtful that it will prove possible to use this knowledge to change how the typical American progressive or conservative feels about the other side.But, as mentioned earlier, the practical consequences of an idea should not be used to judge whether it's true or false. I think Haidt is onto something here, and I think we will hear more from him (and other researchers who start to make use of his theoretical framework) in the years to come. Plus, when writing in his own field, Haidt is way easier to read than Chomsky."
92,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4651295-jason-furman,5,"Everyone should read The Righteous Mind. It is among the best works of social science I have read in a long time and also among the most important. It is mostly firmly grounded in social psychology research (I say mostly, see caveats below) but also traverses in an erudite manner across a number of disciplines. It is also really well written, with each part organized around a metaphor that is used really well to explain and persuade about the material. But underlying these metaphors is a serious amount of research.The first part is about the intuitionist model of moral psychology, based on research that our morality is something we feel intuitively and then come up with rationales to explain it. The intuitions are the elephant and the rationales are the rider, also called our inner press secretary or inner lawyer. Haidt's research in this section appears very sound but it is also positive not normative. I don't fully relate to Haidt's critique of reason as a source or morality, in fact he himself seems to come back to reason as a basis for social morality at the end of the book, but he does introduce a number of interesting ideas, including the difference between harm-aversion moralities and moralities more concerned with protecting the sacred.The second part of the book develops the theory that we have six different moral tastes. Haidt argues that liberals experience fewer of these tastes, mostly care, while conservatives have a richer palate that also includes loyalty, authority and the sacred. In the first part of the book Haidt describes himself as a moral relativist but in this part he seems to prefer the conservative approach to morality. Or at least argue that it helps them win elections. A lot of counterexamples come to mind (many of which Haidt himself acknowledges) like liberals treating the environment as sacred and expecting loyalty in opposition to what they consider bad. And some of it reads like something I have experience a lot where one side things it has better policies but is losing because it does not communicate as well, particularly communicate with values. Haidt is stronger when he is doing social science and describing than when he thinks he has an idea that would help tip the balance for a Presidential campaign.The third part of the book strays the furthest from Haidt's research and is a little more speculative. He rejects the rejection of group selection in evolutionary theory, argues we have evolved at the group level over the last several thousand years to be ""groupish"", or at least 10% groupish (bees) and 90% chimps. This sociality, Haidt argues, is what allowed humans to evolve into the most successful mammals. In contrast, he quotes someone pointing out that no one has ever seen two chimps carrying a log together.At the end, Haidt has a plea for everyone to understand each other better. In many ways I think he does a good job and is sympathetic towards many of the ideas in liberalism, conservatism, and libertarianism. At times he is more about policy specifics, but mostly it is grounded in the deeper moral motivations. He himself ends up arguing that we should use utilitarianism to evaluate public policies but not necessarily to motivate our own actions. And most importantly, he teaches us to understand that much of any rational conversation is not taking place on a rational level and how to understand and engage with the non-rational side."
93,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5317831-kerem,5,"As an expert in moral psychology, Haidt dives first into the role intuitions play in our moral evaluations (and how little of a role reasoning plays despite our keenness), and relates this clearly to the evolution. Building slowly his theory on morality based on 6 key principles, he aims to show that different groups of people, even in the same cultures, show differences in these principles and that doesn't really mean they're morally right or wrong. Finally, he moves to discuss how big a tribal role these differences play when it comes to politics and religion.The book is overall a very good read, not only because Haidt engages his readers with interesting (and at times, entertaining, such as the ""chicken"" dilemma!) relevant studies from his domain but also knowledge from key scientists and philosophers, from Darwin and Hume to Durkheim and Mill. He makes his arguments very clearly, trying to build narratives that could help explain things better. Definitely a 4.5 stars in my opinion and recommend."
94,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9096819-simon,4,"""The Righteous Mind"" is one book that I flip-flop over rating 3/5 or 4/5. I find that the author Jonathan Haidt does much important work in social psychology which he presents in an impressively accessible manner here. His conclusions about his own research's political implications, nonetheless, I find leave something to desire. Hence why I find it necessary to finally write a review for the book in question.The general academic consensus is that people who engage in systematic wrongdoing are either ""just following orders"", acting irrationally or amorally in the process. This is the core of Hannah Arendt's idea about ""The banality of evil"". However, in recent years social psychology research has been consistently arriving at conclusions that the vast majority of people who commit violence believe that they are acting rationally and morally, but do not at all enjoy what they are doing. Ergo, if we want to create a less barbaric world we need less moralism not more of it. Haidt has been at the forefront at the research pointing in this direction ever since 2012, when he published his results in this very book.The good and necessary work here is where Haidt sums up the conclusions of his psychological research. He points out that much morality is rooted in psychological instincts that during human evolution were necessary to create functioning tribal communities for humans to survive at all, and much of political and religious ideology to this day serves to ad hoc rationalize these instincts. On the flipside, this means that as irrational as things like nationalism and religion might appear to a modern secularized liberal Westerner, humans do not function psychologically without some type of collective identity to belong with. Ergo, there is almost always some type of rationality to be found in moral norms that seem irrational at first. From this, argues Haidt: Even as conservative moral values might be less practically useful as society evolves past the need for them, societies still need ways of fulfilling the same psychological instincts as they do. For example that left-wing political parties keep losing elections when they abandon national identity and religion wholesale to the right side of the aisle.On the subject of more nuts-and-bolts politics, this is where I think Haidt stumbles. He takes great effort to avoid any clear political prescriptions, but it's obvious his political worldview is basically one of liberal utilitarianism (Haidt would later create a comic book version of J. S. Mill's ""On Liberty"") which he finds to have its culmination in post-Cold War international liberalism. Even though the results of his own social psychology research point towards that entire ideology going against human nature. Then we have the fact that when Haidt start discussing specific ideologies, he mentions traditional conservative critiques of liberalism but not ideologies that consistently oppose liberalism from the left like anarchism and Marxism. I strongly suspect myself that progressive political programs that can actually fulfil the very same collective instincts that nationalistic and religious conservatism alike do, and hence stand a credible chance of defeating them, will probably *not* arrive at policy prescriptions that Haidt himself would approve of!Consider the case of current Labour chairman Jeremy Corbyn's active work in reaching over to Catholic and Muslim voters despite being himself an atheist - or proposing policies that are more nationalistic than many Tory politicians back. Most famously: Corbyn was for Brexit before he was against it, and seems to oppose Brexit less out of support for the EU than just not wanting the Tories to be in charge of the process; he is still open to pulling the UK out of NATO if not dissolving it outright; supporting stricter immigration laws and border control than many Tories do as well as wanting more police officers on the street. The result being that he's better at winning over traditionally right-of-centre voterbases than the same compromise-happy centrists who accuse Corbyn of going too far to the left!We see something similar in the US where those Democratic candidates who actually stand the best chance of winning over Republican voters to the left like Tulsi Gabbard, Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang (despite Gabbard and especially Sanders being nominal hardliners) are treated like irrelevant sideshows by the Democratic Party's establishment, by the way. I am not that familiar with Haidt's subsequent work, but I do wonder if he addresses all this in anything he has written since. (he published a subsequent book in 2018, with a co-author named Greg Lukianoff, which I have yet to read)The point I am making is: The work in social psychology that Haidt presents here is good, important and even necessary. And I have to praise him for presenting it in as accessible a way as he does here, a task that popular science books do not always succeed in. The political analysis I am much less impressed by, though, because Haidt does not consider in much depth any alternatives to his own liberal utilitarian political ideology that do not come from a traditionalist conservative perspective even though they do exist. Even then, it is difficult for me to shake the suspicion that a society actually putting Haidt's conclusions into practice would not be one he himself would want to live in. So I have to recommend ""The Righteous Mind"" but only with the qualifications to take the second half with quite a few grains of salt."
95,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21993418-mahsa-mohammadi,5,"Started this book as someone who didn't know about political terms but was always concerned with why people are divided and can not argue constructively with one another. Through this book you will be on a tour through moral psychology, human evolution and differences between liberal/conservative people. While reading this book the whole world around me shuts down and I was immersed in the book, but after getting back to the world I could find myself better immerse in other peoples moral matrices and stay clam while seeing differences in other moralities. Morality binds and blinds. This is not just something that happens to people on the other side. We all get stuck into tribal moral communities. We circle around sacred values and then share post hoc arguments about why we are so right and they are so wrong. We think the other side blind to truth, reason, science, and common sense, but in fact everyone goes blind when talking about their sacred objects.If you want to understand another group, follow the sacredness. As a first step, think about the six moral foundations, try to figure out which one or two are carrying the most weight in a particular controversy. And if you really want to open your mind, open your heart first. If you can have at least one friendly interaction with a member of the ""other"" group, you'll find it far easier to listen to what they're saying, and maybe even see a controversial issue in a new light.You may not agree, but you'll probably shift from Manichaean disagreement to a more respectful and constructive yin-yang disagreement.[page 364]"
96,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6076891-sergey-shishkin,5,"Wow! That's easily the best book I've read this year.The author very skillfully builds up the narrative of a multi-dimensional moral matrix, showing each dimension's importance in human evolution in the last 50000 years. As a somewhat typical WEIRD (western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic), I didn't expect it to change my moral perspectives, but it did in fact expanded my appreciation for more traditional moral views, which I previously regarded as outdated."
97,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1528659-paul,5,"I loved this book. After the election 2016 US Presidential election, it helped me understand how some people could prefer Trump and still be good people. My take:The Elephant and the Rider: We make our decisions about moral issues using our moral intuitions (from a deeper place in our brain than that of conscious thought and reasoning) and then we use our frontal cortex to explain our moral intuitions as if we reasoned them out and came to conclusions using rational thought. Our moral intuitions are like a powerful elephant and our frontal cortex (logic and reasoning) are like a small human rider sitting on top. The elephant moves in the direction it wants to, and the rider explains to others why that is the direction he has chosen to make the elephant go, but in reality it is the other way around.Funny: It was pointed out that studying morality and ethics does not appear to make people more moral or ethical, citing research done on the behavior of philosophy professors at conferences (do they clean up after themselves, etc) and the fact that the most overdue books at university libraries tend to be about ethics and morality.Most interesting to me, the book discusses how our brains have built in ""modules"" that detect certain patterns without our having to dedicate conscious thought to them. For example, almost all of us have a visual brain module for detecting snakes. We didn't have to learn to recognize a snake in the grass by going to school. Many other animals also have a snake detector ability wired into their brains. We humans appear to also have moral modules. These modules are like snake detectors, but they detect ""moral snakes"" in social situations: * Harm* Cheating* Oppression / Tyranny* Betrayal* Subversion (lack of due respect)* Degradation (disgust/loathing of rotten/dirty things)For more info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_f...These moral modules are like taste buds: some people come to hate the taste of Harm so much that it becomes to them the most important moral module. Likewise with the other moral foundations. Politically it appears that conservatives place a stronger emphasis on certain taste buds than do liberals. The book left me with this problem to ponder:Brain modules that help our chances at survival tend to ""survive"" into future generations. Our moral modules survived because they helped our ancestors survive, and here we are today. Evolution adds ""what works"" until it's ""good enough"" to survive or outcompete, but evolution may work like a keyboard with no backspace button: what worked in the past may outlive its usefulness, and even become maladaptive in a different environment, but such evolutionary baggage will continue to be carried along in our DNA until it does violence to survival chances, at which point the maladaptive trait will find its own way off the stage of life. A snake detector is still great if you're a rabbit. It's also good if you are a human and live in a cobra infested region of India. But if you're a city dweller in America, the life or death of your recent forebears probably hasn't hinged on that snake detector module. But it hasn't hurt you either, so you got a copy of it to carry around in your brain. I have the impression that some of our moral modules are still very well suited for life in pre-historic times but not well suited to the moral questions of today. What if the ""moral snake detectors"" in some heads are detecting ""snakes"" that simply are not there? Consider the moral foundation of ""Loyalty vs Betrayal"". Loyalty helps us stick together in groups. This helps social groups such as religious communities to keep from falling apart. But it also can make us intolerant of other viewpoints, even of fellow group members who don't believe the _exact_ same things we think group members are supposed to believe. Consider the intense emotional reactions of some religious believers toward other systems of belief. Are these adaptive in a pluralistic society? To quote:“Morality binds and blinds. It binds us into ideological teams that fight each other as though the fate of the world depended on our side winning each battle. It blinds us to the fact that each team is composed of good people who have something important to say.”So could we guide this moral foundation of Loyalty into a notion of ""Loyalty to our shared humanity"" or ""Loyalty to our shared principles of acceptance""? It seems that if left untrained, this Loyalty module is prone to abuses by those in power or those who crave power. Left unchallenged, or prodded in the wrong direction, this Loyalty module seems prone to run amok by fueling out-group fears and suspicions into hatreds and violence."
98,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3138280-matt,4,"""The Righteous Mind"" is a collection of Haidt's research into moral psychology, built around the intriguing idea that our moral intuitions are like taste buds, sensitive to different ""flavors"" of moral category, and that this has shaped many features of our modern culture. Nominally a book on moral psychology, this is is another attempt at understanding the oddities of human nature which fits well in my recent reading (particularly cozy with Kahneman's ""Thinking, Fast and Slow""). The book begins with Haidt's rider-elephant metaphor for the human mind. It's here that he dabbles in the same arena of motivated reasoning that composed Kahneman's book, as well as research by Dan Ariely and others who've found that we only reason after the fact. It's emotion, which Haidt carefully clarifies as not so much ""animal passions"" as a type of unconscious cognition, that runs the pair as the unruly elephant. The rider, representing our capacity for reason and rational behavior, serves the elephant. This is Haidt's social intuitionist model of morality, leading to a key premise in the book's argument: strategic reasoning serves our intuitions. The strategic element is important, as there are many instances where we can apply reason ""in the moment"", but our prevailing ideas and beliefs are for the most part subservient to our unconscious selves, which are in turn highly receptive to our social surroundings. Once establishing this foundation, Haidt then describes his own time in India away from what he calls ""WEIRD"" morality -- Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic, all the features we'd expect to find in a first-world nation. He explains how his encounter with the ""more diverse"" moral system of India led him to formulate the idea that moral receptivity might come in different flavors, much the way that our taste buds can identify salt, sweet, and bitter. A series of experiments in Haidt's lab would appear to vindicate his ideas, indicating that people are indeed receptive to more than concerns of harm and fairness (as are of prime concern in WEIRD nations). Among these include a sensitivity to loyalty, authority, and sanctity or purity, which are largely absent in traditionally liberal moral systems yet remain important among more conservative people. Here Haidt makes an argument that rankles some, suggesting that conservatives have an advantage in so much as they understand how to speak to a wider range of moral intuitions than do modern liberals. Liberals, comments Haidt, simply don't get it; since conservatives largely share concern with harm and fairness (albeit in different ways), they understand left-wing thinking. Liberals for the most part don't get the conservative emphasis on loyalty, authority, or sanctity. I anticipated finding problems with this argument; however after reading Haidt's case I find that I'm in large agreement with him. He makes no value judgment, only noting the reality that different people place different weight on the five moral foundations, and those who don't understand this fact are at a disadvantage. Haidt goes on to perhaps the most controversial part of his argument, centering on the idea of group selection first suggested by Darwin but which fell out of prominence in the 1970s. Haidt nevertheless challenges the case and argues that group selection has indeed shaped our culture and, in what will surprise some, our evolution over the last 50,000 years (I found it interesting that humans apparently do evolve on a much smaller time scale than I'd originally thought). The arguments here read as sound but I have no doubt that those well-versed in evolutionary biology will find plenty to debate. The ultimate argument of the book is that partisanship of any stripe is probably the wrong way to do things, as we wind up talking past each other and entering a downward spiral of tribalism that serves to polarize rather than unite. The final chapter outlines Haidt's ideas on how both left and right, more purely liberal and traditionally conservative, can bring ideas worth consideration, and we should come at this sort of problem from a position of charity rather than aggression and condescension. As per my policy, I found plenty to think about here and my review largely focuses on those positives, although as a counterpoint I would like to add these links as elaborating on criticisms I also agree with: http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.co...http://www.tnr.com/article/books-and-..."
99,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4710528-gavin,4,"Haidt, a psychologist by trade, decided to turn his focus to political psychology specifically after John Kerry's loss in the 2004 US Presidential Election, which he found irksome and befuddling. His ""official"" motivating question: Why do people assume that voters who disagree with them must be misinformed, stupid, or downright evil? His thinly-veiled actual question: How are US Republicans so ceaselessly misinformed, stupid, and downright evil?His goal in this book was to present a half decade of empirical answers in a way that would be easy to swallow for Republicans, Democrats, and Libertarians alike. Not an easy task with such fundamentally divisive stuff. And while one woman in my book club refused to read it after skimming the first chapter, I think he did a fantastic job of this: gently coaxing you into his research methods and findings without scaring you off by taking a side. If only we could all be so deft, respectful, and open-minded when debating with each other.My main takeaways:1.) Hume is right. We are not creatures of reason. Our passions rule us, and our large brains are unbelievably adept at constructing post hoc rationale for our decisions and actions.2.) There's more to group morality than making sure that no single individual is harmed, left out, or otherwise offended. In fact, the successful evolution (since, well, here we are) of our community morality over time (fascinating!) speaks strongly against such a narrowly-focused, universalist way of looking at every human problem.3.) There may be great danger in a society that is so individual-based that we cease to remember what community dynamics make us do and feel. We adaptively evolved to be selfish creatures that paradoxically function well in small communities. This personally resonated with me as I reflected on the warm, fuzzy feeling of: being a drummer in a drumline, being an American during 9/11, being a singer of harmonies around a campfire, being a college football fan at a morning tailgate. We may spend most of our waking hours advancing our own interests, but we all have the capacity to transcend self-interest and become simply a part of a whole. It's not just a capacity; it's the portal to many of life's most cherished experiences. This preternatural love of such experiences is a fundamentally human trait (and very beelike or antlike, too), and a fundamentally healthy feeling that is increasingly difficult to invoke (both historically and empirically) as societies increasingly focus on the godlike status of the individual. Productivity falls, unhappiness rises, suicide skyrockets. These, Haidt's citations and explanations of group dynamics, were copious, thorough, and elucidating.I now better understand why I've wrestled with my personal politics for the last six years, and why I've had trouble explaining seemingly irrational viewpoints that I've nevertheless felt so strongly were right. I'm a perfectionist - feeling irrational both saddened and confused me. I can truly see everyone's inner elephant (intuition) being the master of their rider (strategic reasoning), and I feel much more lucid, receptive, and calm as we descend into the 2016 US Presidential Election.It is clear that each party to this dispute - as to all that persist through long periods of time - is partly right and partly wrong. Social cohesion is a necessity, and mankind has never yet succeeded in enforcing cohesion by merely rational arguments. Every community is exposed to two opposite dangers: ossification through too much discipline and reverence for tradition, on the one hand; on the other hand, dissolution, or subjection to foreign conquest, through the growth of an individualism and personal independence that makes cooperation impossible. - Bertrand Russell"
100,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/971451-marshall,5,"It's books like this that is the reason I love to read, and the motivation for persevering through all the books that make me roll my eyes and grunt in disgust. This one is just amazing. It's both fascinating and fun to read, but most of all, it answers questions that so many of us have about morality, politics, religion, human nature, and why we think, feel, and behave the way we do.The premise of this book is that intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second. It uses the analogy of an elephant rider. Our reasoning mind is the rider, and the most it can do is nudge the elephant in one or another direction. Mostly, the rider is just along for the ride. We like to believe our moral intuitions follow from our reasoning, but it's actually the other way around. Our morality is mostly our gut feelings, and our reasoning mind then kicks in to rationalize it all, post hoc. This is vital for understanding or debating any kind of moral issue, like politics or religion.This book also uses an analogy of taste receptors. Like bitter, savory, sweet, etc. This book argues we also have moral taste receptors, of which it identifies six: care/harm, liberty/oppression, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, and sanctity/degradation. How active each of these moral taste receptors are depends mostly on genetics. Liberals tend to emphasize care and liberty, libertarians emphasize liberty and fairness, while Republicans interestingly tend to be somewhat uniform across all six. The author, himself a liberal, believes this gives Republicans an advantage in reaching more voters.Finally, this book makes an analogy that we are 90% chimp and 10% bee. Like chimps, people do tend to have selfish motives, as economists emphasize, but under certain conditions, we can become extremely hivish. He calls this the ""hive switch."" Flip the hive switch, and we cease to be individuals and work as a collective. This evolution allowed us enormous advantages in the natural world. He attributes all those transcendent and mystical feelings of joining with something greater than ourselves as the result of flipping the hive switch, and it's what he argues the purpose religion has evolved for. He makes an impressive case for group selection, one of Darwin's original theories that had gone out of vogue. He refutes the New Atheists' claim that religion is a maladaptation, a virus that has infected us.The upshot of this book is, no matter where you are politically or religiously, you will gain a new respect and tolerance for other points of view, and for science and its ability to help us learn more about ourselves, thereby making the world more peaceful. How desperately we need this, now more than ever, in this era of political divisiveness and bickering.UPDATE: I just re-read this book, and now I wish I could give it 6-stars! The first time I read it, it helped me understand so many things about religion and politics, and the moral psychology behind them, at a time when I was feeling the sting of divisiveness. Re-reading it now, I see how it has transformed my thinking ever since. I remember how I used to think in terms of who was right and who was wrong, which facts support which arguments, etc. Now, largely because of this book, I just see human beings, emotional and flawed, with multifaceted moral intuitions guiding them, with facts serving mostly as a post-hoc justification for these intuitions. This book was one of the major reasons I changed my thinking from far-left liberal to moderate. I can safely say now that this is my favorite political book, and I consider it essential reading for anyone who wants to come to their opinions in a deliberate and balanced way."
101,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1947301-ericka-clouther,4,"This is an excellent biological science and anthropology book about the development and driving force behind ethics, religion, politics, and tribalism. It will help you view your friends and family members of the other political party with increased understanding and respect. It appears to be mostly directed at United States liberals to help them understand the moral framework of United State conservatives, but it also provides an explanation of the liberal and libertarian framework to conservatives. It is based on controlled studies of liberals, conservatives, and libertarians in the US. There was a lot of information that was new to me, such as the effects of ethnic diversity and culture education. It is not condescending to any political party or religion, which is not the same as saying that everyone will like what Haidt says in this book. In fact, I predict people of both parties will find plenty to try to dispute.For me, there were some problems with this book which are mostly outweighed by what it contributes. One is that this was written pre-Trump era and it won't help you contemplate the blatantly racist supporters and members of the administration. (Please don't deny these people exist, they have been very vocal in a number of places.) Two is that I think that Haidt goes too far in numerous places with his own policy analysis both in favor and against liberal or conservative beliefs. As a liberal myself, when he says that some policy provides money and therefore dampens the necessity of marriage, I think of people - mostly women- stuck in abusive marriages because they can't afford to get themselves and their children out. Also, there were comments about diversity and cultural education which, whether they are accurate or not, seem to need more context and balancing particularly now that we are facing so many problems with racism in our country.Also, since a lot of conservatives claim that Christianity is the basis of their moral framework, I'd like to see what Jesus's moral matrix looks like. I think a lot of liberal Christians would think that Jesus's moral matrix would value Care-Harm more than Fairness-Cheating, but that might or might not be a biased view. (See figures 12.2-12.4, http://righteousmind.com/wp-content/u...) I also strongly recommend Haidt's book ""The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom,"" and you might want to read that one first since this book seemed to build on some ideas he fleshed out in there.Bonus for my UVA friends- Haidt wrote this book while he was a professor at UVA and he uses UVA Wahoo fans as examples of the joys of groupish behavior."
102,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/575806-kressel-housman,4,"I first heard about this book the same way many others probably did: from an author interview with Stephen Colbert. It was 2012, before President Obama’s re-election, and the divisiveness in this country was a common theme, at least in the media I prefer. I was more interested in the book featured on “This American Life,” You're Not as Crazy as I Thought You Were, but You’re Still Wrong, which is probably less academic than this book, but perhaps because Stephen Colbert has a bigger audience than Ira Glass, or perhaps for some other reason, this was the book that my library bought and displayed, so this is the book I read.It is most decidedly an academic book. The author draws from anthropological studies, evolution-supporting science, and traditional Western philosophy. Since one of his theses is that religion developed as part of social adaptation, thereby creating communities, which increase group viability, most people in my community would say the book is simply not worth reading, if not actually forbidden. They may be right, but just because the author presents an atheistic point of view doesn’t mean he doesn’t have something to say.What I like best about the book is the author’s breakdown of the foundations of morality. He uses the analogy of taste buds on the tongue; just like the tongue contains different types of taste buds for different types of tastes, people have different ways of sensing morality. Here is how he breaks them down: (1) care v. harm – the value of taking care of the vulnerable; (2) fairness v. injustice; (3) loyalty v. betrayal; (4) authority v. subversion; (5) sanctity v. degradation; and (6) liberty v. oppression. Though himself a liberal, he argues (quite correctly, I think) that the problem with the current American liberal narrative is that it bases itself strongly on the first two values, but much less on the others. The conservative narrative contains all six values, which is why they’ve been gaining support in the last few decades. If this sounds too simplistic to you, read the book because it’s much more complex than that. But it does read like a text for a 21st century philosophy course, and that’s not to everyone’s tastes."
103,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13316740-alex-timberman,5,"Johnathan Haidt is a professor of moral psychology at New York University. His approach from philosophy and psychology makes for an interesting perspective on morality. In his book, he goes into the reasons on why people are divided by religion and politics. His explanation on why liberals and conservatives just can’t agree with each other made a lot of sense. He identifies six foundations of morality: care/harm, liberty/oppression, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, and sanctity degradation. Where a person falls on the political spectrum, depends on how they feel about these moral foundations. Based on how we feel about these foundations, we have different views on various social issues. What was interesting is that how we feel about these 6 moral foundations, may in part be related to our genetics. Because we care about some foundations more than others, it is almost impossible to see things from someone else’s perspective. The reason is, as he quotes David Hume: reason alone is the “slave of the passions.” Most people have their perspective, or passions, and are hardwired to call forth their inner lawyer at every turn and argue for their position. The point is, he says, people are not really all that rational. Rather, they have intuition and reason from their position or armchair.His clever metaphor is that our intuition is an elephant and the driver is our reason. Sometimes, the reason can keep our intuition in line, but mostly, reason just follows our intuition. He backs up his claims with data collected in various cultures and they all point to similar results. His study shows how we are hardwired, and based on our perspectives, how we are divided. From my experience, he is right. There’s no use in arguing with someone who loves their political party, or someone who identifies themselves as strongly liberal or conservative. Reading this book has allowed me to understand why people are divided, and on why it is so difficult for someone to see the other side. I had the feeling that many people who argue about politics or religion are irrational, despite their beliefs. This book gave me a good explanation on why that is. Great book; I totally recommend it. "
104,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4442364-franz,5,"Most of the commentary I've seen on this book focuses on the different moral foundations liberals and conservatives rely on. Considering the chasm separating liberals and conservatives these days, that focus is understandable. Crucial as this discussion is, the book is a really a work about moral psychology and spends relatively few pages discussing this chasm. What this book has done for me is to rethink some of my fundamental assumptions about human nature. At the same time it confirmed others.The book's most valuable contribution is to describe what influences people to choose one course of action over another. Haidt does not depend on armchair philosophy. Rather, he and other social psychologists have conducted numerous experiments and studies measuring people's attitudes along several dimensions. He also looks in detail at what evolutionary biology, neuroscience, anthropology, and other relevant disciplines tell us about human nature. He explicitly states that his project is descriptive rather than normative in the sense that his primary task in this book is to describe the psychology of our moral choices rather than to tell us how to act morally. A philosophy student as an undergraduate, he has a handle on the important philosophical moral theories. Based on the extensive research he presents in the book, he concludes that Plato's and Kant's moral theory fail to match human moral psychology. What comes closest is what he calls Durkheimian utilitarianism. In the end, this research explains how the sharp political and religious divisions arose, and offers tentative suggestions on how the chasm can at least be acknowledged without rancor and with more understanding on both sides.Haidt's style is informal, readable, and rich in detail. As any good scientist, he does not claim that he has written the last word on the topic and that new data could change his interpretation. Highly recommended for anyone interested in human nature, moral philosophy, economics, politics, and religion."
105,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1231090-jud-barry,3,"Yet another book on the two-track mind--like Kahnemann in ""Thinking Fast and Slow,"" Haidt presents a bifurcated model of human brain function. Kahnemann's ""fast"" brain is Haidt's ""elephant,"" ponderous and difficult to direct; while Kahnemann's ""slow"" is Haidt's ""rider,"" the executive function trying to influence the elephant's course. We think, as it were, from the gut, and then use our much-ballyhooed rational function to, well, rationalize. While this is a model supported by psychological research, Haidt also finds a philosophical basis in the thought (unclouded by emotion) of David Hume.Into this model Haidt adds the essential fact that human beings have evolved in groups, and, in a way not dissimilar to ants or bees, have a brain that is attuned to and shaped by the needs of the ""hive."" (I wondered why, if the ur-metaphor was the elephant, the term for the grouping couldn't be ""herd,"" but never mind.)Adding the testimony of anthropology, sociology, and history, Haidt argues that our ""groupness"" is most strongly expressed in religion, the function of which, he holds, is more to consolidate a group than it is to understand the hereafter. Similarly, social institutions necessarily command respect and a ""go-slow"" attitude to change because of an evolved predisposition to respect expressions of the hive-mind (much of Haidt's thinking here is a tip of the rider's prod to Emile Durkheim).This kind of multidisciplinary cross-fertilization thrills my elephant, though I can't say why. The rider on top of me does question the most original aspect of the book, which is Haidt's five-point ""moral foundations of politics"" gauge for analyzing and evaluating political differences. To some extent it all boils down to a dislike for the fuzziness of the terms ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" and whether it is really possible to say, for example, that conservatives care more about loyalty than liberals do.But hey, my elephant's getting frisky, can't you tell! This would be a good book for a group of unlike-minded people to snort, along with peanuts. Boiled, of course."
106,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/108034-tom,3,"I'm tempted to give this 2 stars because I was annoyed at the book at several moments. My biggest beef with Haidt is that he is seriously challenged when it comes to metaphors. For example, one of the central metaphors of the book is the metaphor of the ""Elephant and the rider."" The idea behind this metaphor is that the elephant is more important -- it decides where to go -- and the rider is, well, just along for the ride. Here's the trouble: that's not how riding elephants works. If it worked that way, no one would ever ride elephants. The rider *is* in control. Rather than being helpful, Haidt's metaphor is a constant annoyance -- and since he comes back to it constantly, one constantly has to be reminded that he apparently doesn't know how domesticated animals work. As far as his explanation of psychology, I think he's probably right -- it's just his metaphor that bugs me.The other concept that was a constant thorn in my side was a concept he develops called the ""hive switch."" In this case, I think he just grouped too many concepts together -- he seemed to be mixing how people feel in ritual dancing (say with traditional drumming, or at a rave) with meditative states and Csikszentmihalyian flow. These are not the same thing, and none of these are the same as being part of a bee hive.Why the three stars then?On the plus side, as I read through my news and articles in the immediate wake of reading this book, I find my brain constantly referring back to it. It turns out I've internalized much of the framework Haidt establishes for talking about morality, and it's useful. I don't know if it's really given me a new framework for understanding conservatives -- in spite of the research he presents that liberals misunderstand conservatives more frequently than viceversa, I think I already had a pretty good grip on the key frameworks he described -- but he's at least presented a language for talking about certain kinds of moral intuitions."
107,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5873780-michael,5,"Just as partisan politics seems to have reached new heights of ugliness Jonathan Haidt brings us this brilliant work bringing the field of moral psychology into the 21st century. Haidt walks us through the work he and his colleagues have done confirming how morality is based on emotion based intuitions rather than rationality. He joins a raft of scientists who are overturning the old enlightenment ideas of reason based morality from Kant to Kohlberg. Haidt then explains the six different moral intuitions Care/Harm, Liberty/Oppression, Fairness/Cheating, Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion and Sanctity/Degradation and their emotional underpinnings. Haidt then does us the great favour of understanding the dichotomies of political thought and their underpinnings in the moral intuitions. Liberals he explains rely heavily on the first two or three moral intuitions, while conservatives are more evenly balanced across all the moral intuitions. Conservatives may seem uncaring and oppressive to Liberals, while Liberals are completely lacking in loyalty, respect for authority and sacred institutions, values. Haidt perspectives are refreshing and enlightening. He even takes some time to illuminate the political category of libertarianism (lower care, higher liberty). He explains the power of social groups from group based evolutionary forces to the powerful psychological effects of group bonding which promote greater efficiencies through social cohesion. I agree with Haidt's conclusion that the greatest weakness of the left is that it tends to overreach, change too many things too quickly and inadvertently reduce the stock of moral and social capital. Conservatives on the other hand often fail to notice certain kinds of victims, fail to limit certain powerful interests and fail to see the need for change. Haidt proposes that both of these forces are needed to maintain balance although too often they tend to see themselves as locked in a Manichean struggle of good vs evil."
108,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75856008-jeff,4,"This book has given me much to think about (as I had hoped it would). Haidt uses moral psychology to try to help the reader to understand how those with different moral and political views arrive at genuine moral positions that the reader with different views might find immoral.I don't know that Haidt would expect this book to change anyone's moral perspective. I don't believe that is his goal. Rather, he hopes that someone with one moral/political framework (liberal or progressive, say) can learn how to listen to and understand the deeply felt concerns of those with a seemingly conflicting framework (such as conservatives). I think that he provides some very valuable tools towards that goal. It is going to take me some time engaging with those tools to find out how well they work for me, though I can say that the book has already given me at least a slightly different perspective on sports and religion.The summary refers to our partisan political leaders. Haidt does provide some ideas of how the partisan gridlock in places such as the Congress of the United States might be overcome, but they involve long-range, structural changes. They aren't impossible, but they are not likely to be implemented any time soon. Their implementation might, however, become more likely if enough people were to implement the more personal suggestions in this book.This is a book that I would recommend to anyone who is concerned with trying to overcome, or at least soften, some of the stark divisions that have become more and more prevalent in the past several years in much of the world. I don't know that I would be able to predict who would or wouldn't like the book, but I think that anyone who engages with it honestly can get something out of it (whether or not they agree with everything that Haidt writes)."
109,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7288155-dan,5,"Last year, I read Sam Harris's ""The Moral Landscape,"" which advanced a utilitarian definition of morality and argued that morality could be determined scientifically. Haidt takes a quite different approach, and it is one that makes quite a bit more sense. This is a synthesis of behavioral psychology, philosophy, anthropology, sociology, and political science. I knew I was in for an interesting journey when, in an early chapter, he persuasively rejects my world view as ""rationalist delusion."" No matter the reader's persuasion, liberal, conservative, or libertarian, Haidt will challenge your view and, if he is read carefully and with an open mind, will enable readers of all persuasions to understand that those at the opposite extreme are people of good will. One of this book's great strengths is the clarity of the writing. Every important point is introduced in outline form, detailed in well written and easy to understand subparts, and summarized at the end of each chapter. The main points are introduced in the very beginning and recapped at the very end. And, there are catchy metaphors to assist in understanding and retaining each concept. T his is a very accessible book considering its subject matter, although I think that my appreciation of this was enhanced by my familiarity with many of the referenced works. A lot of this stuff has been ""out there"" in many books and articles that I have previously read, but it was put together very well. This book will cause me to examine and re-examine many of my own beliefs for a long time to come. Not to worry, though. I'll still vote for Obama. But, I'm not going to think poorly of those who don't. And, I hope that many of them will read this book and not think as poorly of me."
110,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17531984-audrey-zhang,4,"I first read about this book in a NY Times article. It was during the 2012 republican primaries and I was getting increasingly annoyed at how unpalatable each candidate was. The article, which was really just a synopsis of this book, restored my inner peace. While it did not help me understand and accept opposing political views, it helped me, for a short while at least, become a more tolerant person.Then came the 2012 presidential election and a series of mass-shootings - debates on fiscal matters, guns, religion and the role of government became the center of everyone's attention. Once again, my inner peace gave way to my emotions. I became so easily irritable by opposing views - especially those from good people that I love and respect - that I feared I was losing friendships that I otherwise cherished. Desperate, I picked up this book, whose subtitle was ""Why good people are divided by politics and religion"", hoping to find some solutions to my social crisis.And it did, to a large extent. Even though, IMO, it dedicated some chapters to a few really silly and unnecessary metaphors, the author laid out some pretty solid theories that rationalized that emotional disturbance I was experiencing. It also provided a framework for understanding why opposing camps tend to ""talk past each other"" which was extremely illuminating to me. For anybody whose mind prefers logic and reason, the book is a manual to understanding and accepting philosophical differences on emotional topics. Nevertheless, while the book helps one understand conflicts, it does not help one resolve them. So if you are seeking solution for a more efficient democracy, this might not be very helpful."
111,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4785783-alice-aley-martin,5,"Professor Haidt explains the divisions between the conservative and liberally minded individual and their reasoning behind their ""teams"" in politics and religion. As a liberally minded person, I found that there were some libertarian ideas that made sense to me and also that my conservative upbringing was tempered by my very own personal narrative and experiences after childhood. Explaining that it is a mixture of genetic predisposition he nailed it when he said that liberals have less of a need for structure, order and authority and also closure. Haidt spent some time on one of my very own beliefs which is that sports serve as group-ish behavior that is much like religious cults. Conservatives come from a more sociocentric mindset that places groups and institutions first whereas liberals find individualism as a center point.Politics is another group venture much like sports teams, military groups, and churches that center on the collective identity and the sacredness of their ""team"".One of my favorite parts of the book is a quote by Garrison Keillor who is a Liberal and I found affinity with his words""I am a liberal and liberalism is the politics of kindness.Liberals stand for tolerance, maganimity, community spirit, the defense of the weak against the powerful, love of learning, freedom of belief, art and poetry, city life, the very things that make America worth dying for.""Read this!"
112,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4572541-sonya-mukherjee,5,"I first read this book three years ago, and it had a profound impact on my thinking about human nature, morality, and the way that we divide ourselves and vilify each other over conflicting viewpoints. This is by no means a rehash of complaints and ideas that are common in the culture; instead, it introduced me to two or three important new concepts (two brand-new, and one that I might have heard before) and made a compelling case for each of them. Any one of these concepts would be well worth reading this book for.After reading this book, I found myself hearing conversations differently, and reacting differently to ideas and viewpoints that I heard around me. I really can't think of any other book that has had such a significant impact on my perspectives.I read this again recently, partly because I wanted a general refresher and wanted to see whether I still found the book as compelling on a second reading -- and partly because the incredibly divisive politics of this year, 2016, had filled me with so many negative emotions that it was becoming harder to hang on to my empathy for those with different viewpoints. After reading again, I do feel much of that empathy restored. I haven't changed my own moral or political viewpoints; I've just expanded my understanding of others'. But that, in my opinion, is a lot. I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever wondered, with Rodney King, why we can't all just get along."
113,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/666282-nick,5,"Haidt has written a reasonable, thoughtful book about how the mind works in relationship to our political and social predilections. He rejects both the rational view of the human mind (that we reason our way to political beliefs) and the emotional view (that we simply go with our gut all the time) in favor of a middle view: we are riders on our own unconscious elephants of predisposed attitude and emotion derived largely from our genetic inheritance. In other words, it's a bit of both, but mostly emotion (the elephant). We are predisposed to be at once selfish -- for Darwinian reasons -- and hive-oriented (occasionally in evolution, creatures get great benefit from acting together). So we switch between the two views. Underneath that, we're mostly thinking about a few powerful emotional triggers that govern our political and humane views: care v harm, fairness v cheating, loyalty v betrayal, authority v subversion, and sanctity v degradation. Liberals respond mostly to care and fairness, conservatives to all five. Haidt's main point is that since political positions stem from these deep-seated emotional constructs (the elephant) as articulated and modified by the conscious mind (the rider) if you try to argue with the political position without coming from the same emotional place as the opposition, you're doomed to failure. Hence, modern partisan, divided politics. "
114,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6783560-regina,1,"I have to admit that I have one more chapter to go and, I promise, I will finish it. But I think I have read enough to form a solid opinion about the book (and the author).It's biased, poorly written, poorly argued pop-psychology. The main premise is that morality has five ""foundations"" that he compares to flavors; Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating, Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, Sanctity/Degradation. His claim is that the political right (not properly defined but seemingly centered on American politics in spite of the fact that he tries to tie everything together within evolutionary time and with other cultural comparatives) have more 'flavors' of morality because they express more of his 'foundations' than do the political left. He and his test (or at least the impression of his test since he only provides a few examples) come off as very biased and discounting of expressions of morality by the left. He also gives all of his foundations equal weight as if ""authority"" were equal to ""care"". He later adds a foundation of Liberty/Oppression but never seems to consider Truth/Falsity. If he's missed one, then how many more has he missed?The entire book reminds me of the pseudo science that is employed to try to sell Intelligent Design. I'm very disappointed, because I was truly interested in the topic."
115,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11868238-amy,5,"This has joined the ranks of the books I think everyone should read. Few books have opened up my mind or got me thinking as much as this one has.Let me start out by saying that no matter what your beliefs now, this book will almost certainly make you mad at some point - and that's not necessarily a bad thing; it's a sign that you're learning things you might not even consider otherwise. Keep going - after you've calmed down those points actually make a lot of sense, and it's not like you're giving up your own views just by considering others. In the end you may not agree with everything he says, and you may not change your political or moral positions, but at least for me, people with different views make a lot more sense and I have a lot more empathy for their views than I did.Beyond having a few central themes, the book is dense with insight into human nature and human societies. Even in parts where I figured I'd heard these arguments before, he presented studies and perspectives that were new to me, and brought together a surprisingly wide array of topics to make coherent points.Also, I greatly enjoyed this as an audiobook - his voice and presentation suit the material very well - it's very soothing, which is good for topics that are bound to get people riled up (and I think he knows it)."

(he defines political authoritarianism as a kind of half-conscious moral opportunism).And here is a more recent post analyzing supporters of major candidates this cycle according to his six-pronged moral foundation (normalized to the ""average"" American): http://righteousmind.com/presidential...That Trump and Clinton are near-opposites supports my theory that subconscious expectations that Clinton would be the nominee are what created Trump's success.If you have read the book, you may notice that Sanders supporters fit the generic liberal profile that Haidt discusses, in emphasizing Liberty and Care. Cruz's and Rubio's supporters' very below-average rating on Care may explain their respective failures to win the nomination.There is another graphic with Clinton and Sanders normalized to the ""average"" Democrat.

I had such hopes, given the title, but I also recalled his Happiness Hypothesis, which despite three stars from me was on the disappointing side of ""liked"".The flaws throughout this are far too numerous to list. I have pages of notes that just aren't worth reproducing here (nor, really, anywhere else...too many problems). Haidt, despite (weird...using that word twice in one post) spending time in another country, has locked his focus on a bizarrely limited and decidedly western...more US American than just ""western"" ... cluster of values. Spoiler alert: ""conservatives"" have a broader moral sense than ""liberals"". Yeah. Munch on that. And let me remind you that he's stuck on American ""conservatives"". Well, cooking the books can do that to even the best researcher...which Haidt is not. He left off so many actual virtues, actually worth pursuing, that I wanted to toss this far too many times to remember. I want SO much to call him an idiot. I guess I just did. Bottom line: he doesn't validate the subtitle, and he's so far off base as to render this to fringe theory. Not happy at the time lost on this."
118,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55489822-tobias-wolf,5,"I'm familiar with Haidts vocal call for more political diversity in social science and listened to some of his talks, which is why I really wanted to read this book for a long time. In the end I wasn't disappointed. Haidt makes a good case for his moral foundations model and made me update on the evolutionary genesis (and usefulness) of religion as he heavily criticises the theories of Dawkins on this topic. Furthermore I was able to gain a better understanding of the discourse on group selection and why everybody hates it, though Haidt prepares a really good defense. Overall I feel much more informed on the nature of human morals and its shaping through the process of evolution than before. Just two minor criticisms: Haidt manages to almost completely evade the topic of kin selection, which is quite sad as I was really curious how he would analyse its importance for our morality. Furthermore I really missed something on differential moral developments based on gene-culture-coevolution for different cultures, but I understand that something like this would have been suicidal to his reputation, career and the general reception of his book. Therefore: Still 5 stars. "

Carefully researched, the book lays out a great framework for understanding how we ignore information that contradicts what we think we know, how much information we require before we'll even entertain that we might be wrong, how we rationalize and lie to justify ourselves, and how our bent toward liberalism or conservatism is to a great degree wired into us--nature is a bigger influence than nurture.Haidt also provides an overview of how in philosophical thinking, reason became the favored way of thinking, discounting emotions, when in fact decisions made without emotion have more in common with psychopaths than with wisdom.Those who use Jungian type concepts, popularized through the MBTI, will find the discussion on systematizers vs empathizers and the influence on both decisions and philosophical frameworks to tie in nicely with the Thinking and Feeling function"
120,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31962705-william-bare,5,"This is an absolutely fantastic book for anyone who wants to try to understand the psychological roots political beliefs - both one's own and those with whom we disagree.I picked this book up in the fall of 2016, which was near the end of a long and contentious presidential election cycle. In the previous months I had been greatly bothered not only by the vitriol of debates on the cable news shows, but even more so by the vicious debates among my friends and coworkers. I couldn't understand how we could all disagree so stridently and argue so vociferously. Haidt is a social psychologist who writes about how we all form our political opinions and the psychological motivations behind them. As a result of reading this book, I found that I not only gained a much better understanding of my friends on the other side of the aisle, but also a better understanding of myself. Anyone who is interested in politics, and particularly those who are interested in trying to understand, influence, or work with one's political opponents absolutely must read this book."

Instead, we generally have intuitive responses which we rationalise subsequently.He then goes on to explain how, through evolution, humans have developed six centres of morality. Much of our political thought depends on which of these centres we use or don’t, and, if we do, which we place most weight on.Finally, he explains that the moral universes we construct based on these moral centres both bind us to those who share ours and blind us to the morality of those with a different moral universe. The result is the rancid polarisation and increasingly tribal nature of politics today, especially in the US, but elsewhere as well. To understand all that, this book is essential. And understanding is the first step in solving."

You must have a mind that is open enough, and be comfortable enough with your own belief structure not to dismiss the arguments made by the author out of hand simply because they may be uncomfortable, challenge your preconceived notions, or add nuance to those you have come to perceive as political ‘enemies.’ (And therein lies much of the problem of where we are today, as of this review, December 23, 2018)."

131,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2699368-gypsy-lady,3,"Very thought provoking. As Bill Moyers wrote about this book ""the ideas are controversial but they make you think"".The Righteous MindIntroductionxvii“Can we all get along?” That appeal was made famous on May 1, 1992, by Rodney King, a black man who had been beaten nearly to death by four Los Angeles police officers a year earlier.Many Americans feel as though the nightly news from Washington [D. C.] is being sent to us from helicopters circling over the city, delivering dispatches from the war zone.xviiiPeople who devote their lives to studying something often come to believe that the object of their fascination is the key to understanding everything.My goal is to drain some of the heat, anger, and divisiveness out of these topics [politics and religion] and replace them with awe, wonder and curiosity.xxiiWe are indeed selfish hypocrites so skilled at putting on a show of virtue that we fool even ourselves.xxiiiPeople bind themselves into political teams that share moral narratives. Once they accept a particular narrative, they become blind to alternative moral worlds.Page 86Glaucon was right: people care a great deal more about appearance and reputation than about reality. I’ll praise Glaucon for the rest of the book as the guy who got it right—the guy who realized that the most important principle for designing an ethical society is to make sure that everyone’s reputation is on the line all the time, so that bad behavior will always bring bad consequences. Page 94Schools don’t teach people to reason thoroughly; they select the applicants with higher IQs, and people with higher IQs are able to generate more reasons.The findings get more disturbing. Perkins found that IQ was by far the biggest predictor of how well people argue, but it predicted only the number of my-side arguments. Smart people make really good lawyers and press secretaries, but they are no better than others at finding reasons on the other side. Perkins concluded that “people invest their IQ in buttressing their own case rather than in exploring the entire issue more fully and evenhandedly.”Page 95This is how the press secretary works on trivial issues where there is no motivation to support one side or the other. If thinking is confirmatory rather than exploratory in these dry and easy cases, then what chance is there that people will think in an open-minded, exploratory way when self-interest, social identity, and strong emotions make them want or even need to reach a preordained conclusion?We lie, cheat, and justify so well that we honestly believe we are honest.Page 99If people can literally see what they want to see—given a bit of ambiguity – is it any wonder that scientific studies often fail to persuade the general public? Scientists are really good at finding flaws in studies that contradict their own views, but it sometimes happens that evidence accumulates across many studies to the point where scientists must changes their minds. I’ve seen this happen in my colleagues (and myself0 many times, and it’s part of the accountability system of science – you’d look foolish clinging to discredited theories. But for nonscientists, there is no such thing as a study you must believe. It’s always possible to question the methods, find an alternative interpretation of the data, or if all else fails, question the honesty or ideology of the researchers.Page 112The authors pointed out that nearly all research in psychology is conducted on a very small subset of human population; people from cultures that are Western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic (forming the acronym WEIRD). They then reviewed dozens of studies showing that WEIRD people are statistically outliers; they are the least typical, least representative people you could study if you want to make generalizations about human nature.Page 124The ethic of divinity lets us give voice to inchoate feeling of elevation and degradation—our sense of ""higher” and “lower.” It gives us a way to condemn crass consumerism and mindless or trivialized sexuality.Page 127It felt good to be released from partisan anger. And once I was no longer angry, I was no longer committed to reaching the conclusion that righteous anger demands: we are right, they are wrong. I was able to explore new moral matrices, each one supported by its own intellectual traditions. It felt like a kind of awakening.Page 134Nowadays, secular people often see the Enlightenment as a battle between two mortal enemies: on one side was science with its principal weapon, reason, and on the other was religion, with its ancient shield of superstition. Reason defeated superstition, light replaced darkness. But when David Hume was alive, he was fighting a three-way battle, Enlightenment thinkers were united in rejecting divine revelation as the source of moral knowledge, but they were divided as to whether morality transcended human nature – that is it emerged from the very nature of rationality and could therefore be deduced by reasoning, as Plato believer—or whether morality was a part of human nature, like language or taste, which had to be studied by observation. Given Hume’s concerns about the limits of reasoning, he believed that philosophers who tried to reason their way to moral truth without looking at human nature were no better than theologians who thought they could find moral truth revealed in sacred texts. Both were transcendentalists.Foundations: Care/Harm, Liberty/Oppression, Fairness/Cheating, Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, Sanctity/DegradationPage 152Violations of Care (hurting a child), Fairness (profiting from someone else’s undeserved loss), Loyalty (criticizing your nation to outsiders), Authority (disrespecting your father), and Sanctity (acting in a degrading or disgusting way). Page 181Republicans don’t just aim to cause fear, as some Democrats charge. They trigger the full range of intuitions described by Moral Foundations Theory. Like Democrats, they can talk about innocent victims (of harmful Democratic policies) and about fairness (particularly the unfairness of taking money (in taxes) from hardworking and prudent people to support cheaters, slackers, and irresponsible fools.) But Republicans since Nixon have had a near-monopoly on appeals to loyalty (particularly patriotism and military virtues) ad authority (including respect for parents, teachers, elders, and the police, as well as for traditions). And after they embraced Christian conservatives during Ronald Reagan’s 1980 campaign and became the party of “family values,” Republicans inherited a powerful network of Christian ideas about sanctity and sexuality that allowed them to portray Democrats as the party of Sodom and Gomorrah.Page 186We all knew how easy it is for people to reach their [own] desired conclusions.Page 203The hatred of oppression is found on both sides of the political spectrum. The difference seems to be that for liberals – who are more universalistic and who rely more heavily upon the Care/Harm foundation – the Liberty/oppression foundation is employed in the service of underdogs, victims and powerless groups everywhere. It leads liberals (but not others) to sacralize equality which is then pursued by fighting for civil rights and human rights.Page 214Conservation morality rests on all six foundations, although conservatives are more willing than liberal to sacrifice Care and let some people get hurt in order to achieve their many other moral objectives.Page 287A college football game is a superb analogy for religion. From a naïve perspective, focusing only on what is most visible (i.e., the game being played on the field), college football is an extravagant, costly, wasteful institution that impairs people’s ability to think rationally while leaving a long trail of victims (including the players themselves, plus the many fans who suffer alcohol-related injuries). But from a sociologically informed perspective, it is a religious rite that does just what it is supposed to do: it pulls people up from Durkheim’s lower level (the profane) to his higher level (the sacred) It flips the hive switch and makes people feel, for a few hours, that they are “simply a part of a while.” Religions are social facts. Religion cannot be studied in lone individuals any more than hivishness can be studied in lone bees. Durkheim’s definition of religion makes its binding function clear:“religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say, things set apart and forbidden – beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them.”Page 299Anthropologist Roy Rapaport: “to invest social conventions with sanctity is to hide their arbitrariness in a cloak of seeming necessity.”Page 319Rationalists might dream of a utopian state where policy is made by panels of unbiased experts, but in the real world there seems to be no alternative to a political process in which parties compete to win votes and money. That competition always involves trickery and demagoguery, as politicians play fast and loose with the truth, using their inner press secretaries to portray themselves in the best possible light and their opponents as fools who would lead the country to ruin.And yet, does it have to be this nasty? A lot of American have noticed things getting worse. The country now seems polarized and embattled to the point of dysfunction. They are right. Up until a few years ago, there were some political scientists who claimed that the so-called culture war was limited to Washington, and, that Americans had not in fact become more polarized in their attitudes toward most policy issues. But in the last twelve years Americans have begun to move further apart. Page 320Things changed in the 1990, beginning with new rules ad new behaviors in Congress. Friendships and social contacts across party lines were discouraged. Once the human connections were weakened, it because easier to treat members of the other party as the permanent enemy rather than as fellow members of an elite club. Candidates began to spend more time and money on opposition research in which staff members or paid consultants dig up dirt on opponents (sometimes illegally) and then shovel it to the media. As one elder congressman recently put it, “This in not a collegial body any more. It is more like gang behavior. Members walk into the chamber full of hatred.”Page 341Moral capital refers to the degree to which a community possesses interlocking sets of values, virtues, norms, practices identities institutions and technologies that mesh well with evolved psychological mechanisms and thereby enable the community to suppress or regulate selfishness and make cooperation possible.Page 342Moral capital is not always an unalloyed good. Moral capital leads automatically to the suppression of free riders, but it does not lead automatically to other forms of fairness such as equality of opportunity. And while high moral capital helps a community to function efficiently, the community can use that efficiency to inflict harm on other communities. High moral capital can be obtained within a cult or a fascist nation, as long as most people truly accept the prevailing moral matrix.Nonetheless, if you are trying to change an organization or a society and you do not consider the effects of your changes on moral capita, you’re asking for trouble. This, I believe, is the fundamental blind spot of the left. It explains why liberal reforms so often backfire, and why communist revolutions usually end up in despotism. It is the reason I believe that liberalism – which has done so much to bring about freedom and equal opportunity – is not sufficient as a governing philosophy. It tends to overreach, change too many things too quickly, and reduces the stock of moral capital inadvertently. Conversely, while conservative do a better job of preserving moral capital, they often fail to notice certain classes of victims, fail to limit the predations of certain powerful interests and fail to see the need to change or update institutions as times change. Page 360Liberals stand up for victims of oppression and exclusion. They fight to break down arbitrary barriers (such as those based on race, and more recently on sexual orientation). But their zeal to help victims combined with their low scores on the Loyalty, Authority and Sanctity foundations, often lead them to push for changes that weaken groups, traditions, institutions, and moral capital. For example, the urge to help the inter-city poor led to welfare programs in the 1960s that reduce the value of marriage, increased out-of-wedlock births, and weakened African American families. The urge to empower students by giving them the right to sue their teachers and schools in the 1970s has eroded authority and moral capital in schools, creating disorderly environment that harm the poor above all. The urge to help Hispanic immigrants in the 1980s led to multicultural educations programs that emphasized the differences among Americans rather than their shared values and identity. Emphasizing differences makes many people more racist, not less. (Note from the reader: For another viewpoint see http://www.brookings.edu/research/pap...).On issue after issue, it’s as though liberals are trying to help a subset of bees (which really does need help) even if doing so damages the hive. Such “reforms” may lower the overall welfare of a society, and sometimes they even hurt the very victims liberals were trying to help.Page 364Morality binds and blinds. This is not just something that happens to people on the other side. We all get sucked into tribal moral communities. We circle around sacred values and then share post hoc argument about why we are so right and they are so wrong. We think the other side is blind to truth, reason, science, and common sense, but in fact everyone goes blind when talking about heir sacred objects. "
132,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2564873-luke,5,"It's the only book I've read this year. Incidentally, it's the best book I've read this year.For those who would like to better understand why we believe what we doFrom the book:ON THE BATTLE BETWEEN THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS- Conscious reasoning is carried out largely for the purpose of persuasion, rather than discovery. We are trying to persuade ourselves. We want to believe the things we are about to say to others. Our moral thinking is much more like a politician searching for votes than a scientist searching for truth-Intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second- Anyone who values truth should stop worshipping reason. We all need to take a cold hard look at the evidence and see reasoning for what it is. The French cognitive scientist Mercier and Sperber concluded reasoning has evolved not to help us find truth but to help us engage in arguments, persuasion, and manipulation in the context of discussions with other people. As they put it, ""skilled arguers...are not after the truth but after arguments supporting their views.""-Julie and Mark, sister and brother, are traveling together in France. They are both on summer vacation from college. One night they are staying alone in a cabin near the beach. They decided that it would be interesting and fun if they tried making love. At the very least it would be a new experience for each of them. Julie is already taking birth control pills, but Mark uses a condom too, just to be safe. They both enjoy it, but they decide not to do it again. They keep that night as a special secret between them, which makes him feel even closer to each other. So what do you think about this? Was it wrong for them to have sex?FOUNDATIONS OF MORALITY-I began to understand why the American culture wars involves so many battles over sacrilege. Is a flag just a piece of cloth, which can be burned as a form of protest? Or does each flag contain within it something nonmaterial such that when protesters burn it, they have done something bad, even if nobody were to see them do it? When an artist submerges a crucifix in a jar of his own urine, or smears elephant dung on an image of the Virgin Mary, do these works belong in art museums? Can the artist simply tell religious Christians, if you don’t want to see it, don’t go to the museum? Or does the mere existence of such works make the world dirtier and more profane?Try reversing the politics. Imagine that a conservative artist had created his works using images of Martin Luther King Junior and Nelson Mandela instead of Jesus and Mary. Imagine that his intent was to mock the quasi-deification by the left of so many black leaders. Could such works be displayed in museums in New York or Paris without triggering angry demonstrations? Might some on the left feel the museum itself have been polluted by racism, even after the art was removed?-I could see beauty in a moral code that emphasized self control, resistance to temptation, cultivation of one’s higher, nobler self, and negation of the selfish desires. I could see the dark side of this ethic too: once you allow visceral feelings of disgust to guide your conception of what God wants, then minorities who trigger even a hint of disgust in the majority (such as homosexuals or obese people) can be ostracized and treated cruelly. The ethic of divinity is sometimes incompatible with compassion, egalitarianism, and basic human rights.- Moral systems are interlocking sets of values, virtues, norms, practices, identities, institutions, technologies, and evolved psychological mechanisms that work together to suppress or regulate self-interest and make cooperative societies possible.GENES AND EXPERIENCE INFLUENCING OUR MORALITY-The brain is like a book, the first draft of which is written by the genes during fetal development. No chapters are complete at birth, and some are just rough outlines waiting to be filled during childhood. But not a single chapter, be it on sexuality, language, food preferences, or morality, consist of blank pages in which a society can inscribe any conceivable set of words. Nature provides a first draft, which experience then revises, but it does not mean unmalleable, it means organized in advance of experience.- The speed at which genetic evolution can occur is best illustrated by an extraordinary study by Dmitri Belyaev, a Soviet scientist. He decided to test his ideas by conducting a simple breeding experiment with foxes. Rather than selecting foxes based on the quality of their pelts he selected them for tameness. Whichever fox pups were least fearful of humans were bred to create the next generation. After just thirty generations the foxes had become so tame that they could be kept as pets. - Human evolution did not stop or slow down 50,000 years ago. It sped up. Gene-culture coevolution reached a fever-pitch during the last 12,000 years. We can’t just examine modern-day hunter-gatherers and assume that they represent universal human nature as it was locked into place 50,000 years ago. Periods of massive environmental change (as occurred between 70,000 and 140,000 years ago) and cultural change (as occurred during the Holocene era) should figure more prominently in our attempts to understand who we are, and how we got our righteous minds.- Whether you end up on the right or the left of the political spectrum turns out to be just as heritable as most other traits: genetics explains between a third and a half of the variability among people on their political attitudes. Being raised in a liberal or conservative household accounts for much less.OUR NEED TO BE IN A TRIBE- A word is not a relationship between a sound and an object. It is an agreement among people who share a joint representation of the things in their world, and who share a set of conventions for communicating with each other about those things. The key to group selection is a shared defensible nest. Bees construct hives out of wax and wood fibers, which they then fight, kill, and die to defend. Humans construct moral communities out of shared norms, institutions, and gods that, even in the twenty-first century, they fight, kill, and die to defend- In a similar way, early humans domesticated themselves when they began to select friends and partners based on their ability to live within the tribe’s moral matrix. In fact, our brains, bodies, and behavior show many of the same signs of domestication that are found in our domestic animals: smaller teeth, smaller body, reduced aggression, and greater playfulness, carried on even into adulthood. The reason is that domestication generally takes traits that disappear at the end of childhood and keeps them turned on for life. Domesticated animals (including humans) are more childlike, sociable, and gentle than their wild ancestors.- Tribal minds and tribal cultures didn't just prepare us for war; it also prepared us for far more peaceful coexistence within our groups, and, in modern times, for cooperation on a vast scale as well.- Group selection pulls for cooperation, for the ability to suppress antisocial behavior and spur individuals to act in ways that benefit their groups. Group-serving behaviors sometimes impose a terrible cost to outsiders (as in warfare). But in general, groupishness is focused on improving the welfare of the in-group, not on harming an out-group.- We humans have a dual-nature - we are selfish primates who long to be a part of something larger and nobler than ourselves. We are 90% chimp and 10% bee.- Studies of veterans found that men risk their lives not so much for their country or their ideals as for their comrades-in-arms. ""Many veterans who are honest with themselves will admit that the experience of communal effort in battle … has been the high point of their lives...individual fate loses its central importance.… it is nothing less than the assurance of immortality that makes self sacrifice at these moments so relatively easy.… I may fall, but I do not die, for that which is real in me goes forward and lives on in the comrades for whom I gave up my life.- People don't just blindly empathize; they don't sync up with everyone they see. We are conditional hive creatures. We are more likely to mirror and then empathize with others when they have conformed to our moral matrix than when they have violated it.- When I began writing The Happiness Hypothesis, I believed that happiness came from within, as Buddha and the Stoic philosophers said thousands of years ago. But by the time I finished writing, I had changed my mind: Happiness comes from between. It comes from getting the right relationships between yourself and others, yourself and your work, and yourself and something larger than yourself. We evolved to live in groups. Our minds were designed not only to help us win the competition within our groups, but also to help us unite with those in our group to win competitions across groups.- Putnam examined the level of social capital in hundreds of American communities and discovered that high levels of immigration and ethnic diversity seem to cause a reduction in social capital. That may not surprise you; people are racist, you might think, and so theydon’t trust people who don’t look like themselves. But that’s not quite right. Putnam’s survey wasable to distinguish two different kinds of social capital: bridging capital refers to trust betweengroups, between people who have different values and identities, while bonding capital refers totrust within groups. Putnam found that diversity reduced both kinds of social capital. Here’s hisconclusion:Diversity seems to trigger not in-group/out-group division, but anomie or social isolation. Incolloquial language, people living in ethnically diverse settings appear to “hunker down”—thatis, to pull in like a turtle.- Morality binds and blinds. This is not just something that happens to people on the other side. We all get sucked into tribal moral communities. We circle around sacred values and then share post hoc arguments about why we are so right and they are so wrong. We think the other side is blind to truth, reason, science, and common sense, but in fact everyone goes blind when talking about their sacred objects.RELIGION- Communes are natural experiments in cooperation without kinship. Communes can survive only to the extent that they can bind a group together, suppress self-interest, and solve the free rider problem. Which kind of commune survived longer? Sosis found that the difference was stark: just 6 percent of the secular communes were still functioning twenty years after their founding, compared to 39 percent of the religious communes.What was the secret ingredient that gave the religious communes a longer shelf life? The number of costly sacrifices that each commune demanded from its members. For religious communes, the effect was perfectly linear: the more sacrifice a commune demanded, the longer it lasted. The very ritual practices that the New Atheists dismiss as costly, inefficient, and irrational turn out to be a solution to one of the hardest problems humans face: cooperation without kinship. Irrational beliefs can sometimes help the group function more rationally, particularly when those beliefs rest upon the Sanctity foundation. Sacredness binds people together, and then blinds them to the arbitrariness of the practice.- By many different measures religiously observant Americans are better neighbors and better citizens than secular Americans—they are more generous with their time and money, especially in helping the needy, and they are more active in community life. Why are religious people better neighbors and citizens? Beliefs and practices turned out to matter very little. It’s the friendships and group activities, carried out within a moral matrix that emphasizes selflessness. That’s what brings out the best in people. “It is religious belongingness that matters for neighborliness, not religious believing.”- Gods were helpful in creating moral matrices within which Glauconian creatures have strong incentives to conform. And gods were an essential part of the evolution of our hivish overlay; sometimes we really do transcend self-interest and devote ourselves to helping others, or our groups. Religions are moral exoskeletons. If you live in a religious community, you are enmeshed in a set of norms, relationships, and institutions that work primarily on the elephant to influence your behavior. But if you are an atheist living in a looser community with a less binding moral matrix, you might have to rely somewhat more on an internal moral compass, read by the rider. That might sound appealing to rationalists, but it is also a recipe for anomie. We evolved to live, trade, and trust within shared moral matrices. When societies lose their grip on individuals, allowing all to do as they please, the result is often a decrease in happiness and an increase in suicide, as Durkheim showed more than a hundred years ago.- If you think about religion as a set of beliefs about supernatural agents, you’re bound to misunderstand it. You’ll see those beliefs as foolish delusions, perhaps even as parasites that exploit our brains for their own benefit. But if you take a Durkheimian approach to religion (focusing on belonging) and a Darwinian approach to morality (involving multilevel selection), you get a very different picture. You see that religious practices have been binding our ancestors into groups for tens of thousands of years. That binding usually involves some blinding—once any person, book, or principle is declared sacred, then devotees can no longer question it or think clearly about it.LIBERALS, CONSERVATIVES, AND LIBERTARIANS - OH MY!- ""Here's a simple definition of ideology: 'A set of beliefs about the proper order of society and how it can be achieved.' And here is the most basic of all ideological questions: Preserve the present order, or change it? At the French Assembly of 1789, the delegates who favored preservation sat on the right side of the chamber, while those who favored change sat on the left. The terms 'right' and 'left' have stood for conservatism and liberalism ever since.""- Liberals are experts in care; they are better able to see the victims of existing social arrangements, and they continually push us to update those arrangements and invent new ones. As Robert F. Kennedy said: “There are those that look at things the way they are, and ask why? I dream of things that never were, and ask why not?” This moral matrix leads liberals to make two points that are profoundly important for the health of a society: (1) governments can and should restrain corporate superorganisms, and (2) some big problems really can be solved by regulation. Libertarians are right that markets are miraculous (at least when their externalities and other failures can be addressed). Social conservatives are right that you don’t usually help the bees by destroying the hive. - In Chinese philosophy, yin and yang refer to any pair of contrasting or seemingly opposed forces that are in fact complementary and interdependent. Night and day are not enemies, nor are hot and cold, summer and winter, male and female. We need both, often in a shifting or alternating balance. John Stuart Mill said that liberals and conservatives are like this: “A party of order or stability, and a party of progress or reform, are both necessary elements of a healthy state of political life.” The philosopher Bertrand Russell saw this same dynamic at work throughout Western intellectual history: “Philosophers have been divided into those who wished to tighten social bonds and those who wished to relax them.” Social cohesion is a necessity, and mankind has never yet succeeded in enforcing cohesion by merely rational arguments. Every community is exposed to two opposite dangers: ossification through too much discipline and reverence for tradition, on the one hand; on the other hand, dissolution, or subjection to foreign conquest, through the growth of an individualism and personal independence that makes cooperation impossible- Liberals stand up for victims of oppression and exclusion. They fight to break down arbitrarybarriers (such as those based on race, and more recently on sexual orientation). But their zeal to help victims, combined with their low scores on the Loyalty, Authority, and Sanctity foundations, often lead them to push for changes that weaken groups, traditions, institutions, and moral capital. For example, the urge to help the inner-city poor led to welfare programs in the 1960s that reduced the value of marriage, increased out-of-wedlock births, and weakened African American families. The urge to empower students by giving them the right to sue their teachers and schools in the 1970s has eroded authority and moral capital in schools, creating disorderly environments that harm the poor above all.The urge to help Hispanic immigrants in the 1980s led to multicultural education programs that emphasized the differences among Americans rather than their shared values and identity. Emphasizing differences makes many people more racist, not less.On issue after issue, it’s as though liberals are trying to help a subset of bees (which really doesneed help) even if doing so damages the hive. Such “reforms” may lower the overall welfare of asociety, and sometimes they even hurt the very victims liberals were trying to help.- If you want to understand another group, follow the sacredness. As a first step, think about the six moral foundations, and try to figure out which one or two are carrying the most weight in a particular controversy. And if you really want to open your mind, open your heart first. If you can have at least one friendly interaction with a member of the “other” group, you’ll find it far easier to listen to what they’re saying, and maybe even see a controversial issue in a new light. - Newt Gingrich, the new speaker of the House of Representatives, encouraged the large group of incoming Republican congressmen to leave their families in their home districts rather than moving their spouses and children to Washington. Before 1995, congressmen from both parties attended many of the same social events on weekends; their spouses became friends; their children played on the same sports teams. But nowadays most congressmen fly to Washington on Monday night, huddle with their teammates and do battle for three days, and then fly home on Thursday night. Cross-party friendships are disappearing; Manichaeism and scorched Earth politics are increasing. Other structural changes that might reduce Manichaeism include changing the ways that primary elections are run, the ways that electoral districts are drawn, and the ways that candidates raise money for their campaigns. The problem is not just limited to politicians. Technology and changing residential patterns have allowed each of us to isolate ourselves within cocoons of like-minded individuals. In 1976, only 27 percent of Americans lived in “landslide counties”—counties that voted either Democratic or Republican by a margin of 20 percent or more. But the number has risen steadily; in 2008, 48 percent of Americans lived in a landslide county. "
133,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"The Righteous Mind examines the research that’s been conducted by social psychologists on the subject of human morality. In particular Haidt argues that moral judgment is an automatic intuitive process and that reasoning and rationality play only a small role (or more sneakily, play a post hoc role) in justifying the original gut response. I suspect there’s quite a bit of truth in this assessment and of course, this explains why people seem so unshakeable in their world view, even when in can be shown without a shadow of doubt that these views are demonstratively wrong. Thus we have: global warming deniers, 9/11 conspiracists, anti-vaxers, evolution deniers and those who believe President Obama is a Kenyan, Muslim, socialist … who’s also the anti-christ out to destroy America. It’s doubly depressing that these wrongheaded views are not just harmful, but that no amount of evidence can cause these individuals to reconsider their stance. As the saying goes “You can’t reason someone out of a position they didn’t reason themselves into in the first place”. To explain these different moral systems Haidt has developed a moral foundations theory that consists of six innate moral characteristics that can be mixed in any person to varying degrees. These are care/harm, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, sanctity/degradation and liberty/oppression. He then goes on to describe how these moral intuitions play out in terms of politics and religion. It should come as little surprise that liberals tend to value care, fairness and freedom from oppression, while conservatives talk more in terms of values relating to loyalty, authority, sanctity and liberty. All of this is interesting and goes a long way to explaining the various value systems at play in political discussions. Haidt’s work may help politicians communicate their policies in ways that resonate with a broader spectrum of the public (particularly democrats, whose dry appeals to evidence and rationality often fail to resonate with voters). The book is informative, well written and interesting. Not having a background in moral psychology, however, it did raise a number of questions that weren’t answered by the text. First, I found myself thinking that some of the items Haidt proposes seem only weakly linked to morality. The most obvious is that of sanctity/degradation, which exhibits itself through disgust. But disgust and morality strike me as two different things. A fragrant cheese might smell disgusting to some people, but I can’t imagine a moral system that would condemn someone for eating it. Disgust is a powerful emotion that has evolved to keep us alive … thus we have natural aversions to bodily fluids, rotting meat, incest, bad smells, cannibalism etc. since these things can cause us or our offspring harm. As an example of the degradation response Haidt describes the disgust someone might feel after being shown an American flag used as a dust rag. But this strikes me as a learned response. I can’t imagine someone from another country unfamiliar with the US flag would care one bit. The other example Haidt uses is that of a brother and sister having sex, which certainly elicits a disgust response, but this same response can be triggered by thoughts of one’s own parents or grandparents having sex (sorry if I just put a picture in your brain that you now can’t erase). Under Haidt’s system the latter should bring feelings of sanctity, not revulsion. So, why is disgust considered a moral response? Conversely, Haidt doesn’t include attributes that appear to be inextricably linked to morality … such as ‘honesty’. Lying is considered morally wrong and telling the truth is instilled in children by parents of most (if not all) cultures. Even our court system (the most obvious and powerful reflection of a society’s morality) considers honesty to be necessary for the system to function correctly. Thus witnesses are sworn to “Tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth”. Why aren’t honesty and truth part of his moral system? In addition to honesty/dishonesty, I would also think generosity/greediness and sincerity/ hypocrisy as key components of a moral system as well. For example – one of the defining problems of our time, income inequality, is viewed as a highly moral issue to many individuals on both sides. Within Haidt’s moral foundations theory he’d explain this as a fairness issue with liberals arguing that such disparity is unfair and conservatives that it’s unfair to reduce a person’s wealth to give to someone who hasn’t earned it. But he’d be missing the grasping, clutching, winner take all, “I’ve got mine so screw you”, selfish greed that some would see as the heart of the issue. Conversely, sharing of food (generosity) is considered to be a cornerstone of many hunter/gatherer cultures. Sharing creates group unity and cohesiveness by acknowledging the interdependence of its members. What about generosity/greediness? Haidt’s experiments (so far as I can determine) are based on attitude surveys. So, it’s also important to understand precisely what these surveys are measuring, which is what people say, not how they actually behave. But in terms of morality, it’s the latter that’s important. What does it matter if people speak about the high value they place on honesty one moment if they are picking your pocket the next? Actual behavior is where the rubber meets the road and while conservatives may value loyalty, authority, liberty and sanctity more than liberals it’s also a fact that red states have higher rates of crime (dishonesty), divorce (betrayal), obesity (degradation), drug abuse (degradation) and more people on welfare (oppression) than blue states. And this, of course, is where hypocrisy comes into play. A moral system isn’t much of a system if it doesn’t account for the differences between what people say and what they do. What about sincerity/ hypocrisy? Why does Haidt treat each of the 6 characteristics of the moral foundations theory as equals? Care and fairness are considered equivalent to loyalty, authority, sanctity and liberty on Haidt’s scale. However, care and fairness would appear far more central to our make-up than the others. First, they evolved far earlier than the other four. How do we know this? Studies with monkeys and apes have shown that they too exhibit care and fairness as part of their proto-moral systems. I’m not aware of any evidence that primates exhibit an interest in liberty. Also, from a purely practical standpoint, it seems self-evident that the care of a parent for their offspring would be considerably more important to human survival than the disgust one feels for the sexual proclivities of a fellow tribal member. Also, I couldn't help wondering whether Haidt’s system promotes a sort of moral equivalency that could serve to justify bad behavior. Moral justification lies at the heart of every human atrocity … individuals involved in slavery, genocide, war and torture believe they were acting righteously. Haidt himself tells of his own coming to terms with sexual inequality in India after seeing that it promoted social stability. But it strikes me that any moral system that subjugates 50% of the population and treats them as inferiors is worse than one that values their contributions. Misogyny would tend to decrease the overall happiness of a population and reduce the human potential in those it relegates to the status of second class citizens. A moral system that values equality between the sexes is superior to one that does not. I wonder if promoting the idea that misogyny is consistent with a highly moral worldview validates the behavior.  Finally, why is the world becoming a safer place if rationality plays such a small role in morality? Haidt theorizes that rationality (the rider) has limited ability to overrule the inclinations of our intuition (the elephant), but history seems to show that we are increasingly able and willing to do just that. We no longer tolerate many behaviors that would have been considered commonplace a few centuries or even decades ago (see Steven Pinkers book The Better Angels of our Nature for many such examples). Haidt’s feedback system provides a mechanism for moral change, but it doesn’t explain why that change has trended in one direction only. We are becoming a better and more moral society with time. The enlightenment, progressive ideals and our growing body of scientific knowledge has played a powerful role in this trend.I was also unconvinced by his argument that group selection played a significant role in the evolution of morality (maybe, but I’ve yet to see compelling evidence) and that the approach of the (so-called) New Atheists has been unsuccessful (it’s been remarkably successful at solidifying group cohesion among non-believers where none existed … surely Haidt recognizes this since group cohesion is his whole ‘thing’, but Haidt is a recipient of the Templeton prize, which could certainly skew his objectivity). Anyway this review is already too long so I’ll leave it at that.  Anyway, the book got me thinking even if it raised as many questions as it answered. That’s the mark of a compelling subject."
134,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70965168-youp,4,"Before reading 'The Righteous Mind', I made the rare mistake of reading several reviews on Goodreads. Interestingly, for a highly-rated book, it had a remarkably high amount of one and two star ratings. I found the criticisms in these reviews a bit discouraging, especially having enjoyed so much 'The Coddling of the American Mind' by the same author. Some points that stuck out for me were the unscientific approach by Haidt and his seemingly partisan approach, some readers even calling Haidt a 'dimwitted charlatan'. After having read 'The Righteous Mind', I am happy to report that even though the book has some flaws (especially in the later chapters), it's still a highly enjoyable scientific approach to moral psychology.The book itself is divided into three main parts. In the first part we learn how many of our decisions and opinions are formed not primarily through reason, but by our intuition and emotion. Haidt uses the analogy of emotion as elephant and reason as its rider, where the rider forms post-hoc justifications for the decisions of the elephant. This is done with numerous references to the scientific literature and several thought experiments. One example is that of two adult siblings having consensual and protected sex once on a vacation trip. My (and hopefully your) intuition is to immediately condemn this behavior, yet it's awfully difficult to point out the harm done in this specific example. Some of these thought experiments are so intriguing that I've been thinking all week about how to feel about them, and why I feel that way. In these earlier chapters we also learn that humans are awfully good at justifying their own emotions, yet we're not very good at looking for evidence for how we might be wrong. The second part of the book presents us the Moral Foundations Theory (MFT): a social psychological theory co-founded by Haidt. This theory is used to show which elephants (moral foundations) are common across cultures and people, and in which ways Liberals and Conservatives differ. Some reviewers accuse Haidt of being biased towards Conservatives, but I found this accusation quite absurd. The author shows that Conservatives have a wider spectrum of moral foundations that they value, but this is backed by the research Haidt has done. Furthermore, the author remains strikingly neutral in his writing, and never suggests that a wider spectrum is a better one. Additionally, some popular reviews point towards the unscientific or even groundless base for the MFT. Without going into the specifics, I find it hard to describe research with thousands of citations and a lengthy description of its origins as 'unscientific' or 'baseless'.The first two parts are really superb. I found them tremendously helpful in understanding my own morals, but they also gave me a better approach and more appreciation for other opinions. Several times since reading this book, when I felt strongly about something, I noticed myself examining my own opinion:""Why do I feel this way?Am I trying to justify my feelings by looking for evidence that supports it? Have I truly looked for ways in which I could be wrong? What moral foundation is important for someone with an opposing opinion?""In this regard, The Righteous Mind is a valuable and useful book for people on both sides of the political spectrum.Where I started to lose interest is the third part of the book, in which Haidt delves into evolutionary psychology and group selection. Even though this is a topic that greatly interests me, it feels oddly out-of-place and disconnected from the first parts. Moreover, Haidt's opinion on group selection is not at all unopposed, and his ensuing conclusions depend heavily on the acceptance of it. So how do I rate a book that is two-thirds amazing and one part meh? Like Haidt's other work, The Rightous Mind is brilliantly written. It's well-argued, perfectly structured and remarkably easy to follow despite the vast amount of information presented. Above all, it's not just interesting but also helpful to understand yourself and others. If the third part were replaced with something else more connected to the rest, this would have been an amazing book. Right now, I think it's occassionally brilliant and overall still great. Or maybe my elephant just decided that, and now my rider tries to justify the four star rating...Who knows?"
135,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1654490-stephen,5,"The full title is: The Righteous Mind - Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and ReligionJonathan Haidt has been studying, for some time, differences between Conservative and Liberal thought. I read an essay from him several years ago touching on some of the points more fully elaborated in the book and quite enjoyed it. The site http://www.yourmorals.org has a test you can take to measure you along his six vectors of morality.He is a Liberal and the book is written to Liberals to help them understand (and be more tolerant of) Conservative values.Spoilers follow:So Major Points:1) Our moral intuition comes first, then we justify it rationally. That is to say, we have our automatic reaction and then we make up a story about it. If you'd like to see this in action take these two sentences:Can I believe it?Must I believe it?These are the questions we ask ourselves. The first is the question for things we've already decided we want to be true. The second is for questions we don't want to be true. Supposing you're not a fan of Sarah Palin, if you were presented with evidence she were intelligent you would activate the ""Must I believe it?"" portion of your psyche and your rational brain would happily provide you with evidence why you don't need to believe the new evidence. So now, deliberately turn the question around and ask ""Can I believe it?"" Slowly at first, but eventually more quickly, your rational brain would come up with at least a couple of reasons why you could believe. And if your brain can't do that on this question, choose one that's a little more simple.The point here, though, really is that we have a giant elephant running our thought and a small rider on the elephant occasionally steering it. Often, the elephant doesn't let the rider direct it. Frequently, the elephant doesn't even ask the rider to direct it (and the rider is the elephant's servant, so it doesn't bother). When the elephant does ask for direction, it is to reach the elephant's goals.Usually, the main reason the elephant asks for the rider's aid is when something surprises it. That was unexpected. So the rider has to either come up with an explanation which soothes the elephant and rejects the new information or come up with an explanation which soothes the elephant and incorporates the new information. But, if we aren't surprised by something, we are not going to make changes in our thought and especially not in our morality.2) Liberals and Conservatives have different morality:Jonathan has identified six measures of morality. Liberal morality highly values three. Libertarian morality highly values two. Conservative morality roughly equivalently values all six, giving perhaps less weight to one of the ones Liberals value. They are:Fairness / Cheating - Did you honestly obtain what you have?Liberty / Oppression - Are people free to make their choices and participate in opportunities?Care / Harm - Do we help people or hurt them?Loyalty / Betrayal - Do I stand by my group?Authority / Subversion - Do I yield to appropriate authority and is that authority doing well?Sanctity / Degradation - Does this lead more toward divinity or more toward baseness?Liberals care about Care (a lot), Liberty (a lot) and Fairness (a little)Libertarians care about Liberty (a lot) and Fairness (a lot)Conservatives care about them all with Care being the least (but still strongly present).However, the reality is that, even though Liberals have been actively rejecting some of these lately (for instance with attacks on churches in opposition to sanctity and the very common anti-authority position of Liberals ever since the sixties), the reality is that these do matter to Liberals. Take, for instance, the figure of Martin Luther King Jr. Liberals certainly hold him with some degree of sanctity (in general), even though many don't think of themselves as being very connected to that virtue.3) We are 90% chimp and 10% beeWe have evolved as groups and we have group adaptations. These adaptations are what make us transcend the other primates. Studies have been done where chimps or orangutans are matched up with toddlers. They are given treats for accomplishing various tasks. The tasks which require cooperation are far less likely to be accomplished by chimps or orangutans than by toddlers (35% of the groups vs 85% of the groups). However, the tasks which are solo tasks are accomplished with equal effectiveness.Part of what caused our groupish adaptation was how we translated ""false positives"". If you don't see a snake that is there, that's a false negative. And it has an evolutionary cost. However, false positives don't have much evolutionary cost. If you ran from a tiger that wasn't there, you still live and reproduce. So we are wired to have false positives in order to avoid more false negatives. As we started having these false positives, we also like having causal stories for what ""happened"" (instead of our own faulty perception). These stories eventually end up being spiritual stories.Groups that have a common spiritual story outperform groups which do not. This eventually gave rise to religions. Religious societies tended to outproduce societies which are not religious. Part of the reason for this is that we have a ""hive mind"". When we are all on the same page about something, we can transcend our individuality and accomplish more. We also are far less likely to betray those in our group. We form teams in lots of ways. Sporting teams, Political teams, Religious teams.4) We are more like Glaucon predicted than like Socrates predicted.When we are unobserved, we are far less likely to do the morally right thing. We tend to do the selfish thing. The main reason we are moral is that we want to look good to our group (whatever it is). This means that religious motivators for morality are more effective than non-religious ones because there are in many faiths the concept of ""constant observance"". You are never acting alone and out of sight.5) Societies which are more moral (and more morally homogenous) tend to be more effective.This is not to say ""better"". Fascism, for instance, was tremendously effective at what it was trying to do. Dictators are as well. But positive societies with common and solid moral foundations are also tremendously effective at reaching their objectives.6) Understanding how we are all acting toward our morals will, hopefully, help us be more tolerant of those we disagree with. And we sorely need to stop bickering and start solving problems.Thoughts I had on the book:By and large, I agree with the author and his conclusions. I have always thought that philosophical charity would help our political discourse immensely. Lately I've also been more mindful of what is and is not a rational response and I have far more irrational responses than I would like. I also found the groupish arguments compelling and can see advantages for people with strong group ties.Problems I had with the book:These are mostly minor. Some of the studies conducted did not have adequate sample sizes for the conclusions drawn. There were several studies, however, which reached similar conclusions. I would have preferred, though, that they all were representative samples. Another book I'm reading now explains how easy it is to be tricked by small samples.The author does not know the full definition of deontology. He was not a fan of deontology, and that is because he primarily equates it with Kantian philosophy (which is entirely rational). As his descriptive claim of morality dismisses rationality (and favors David Hume's account of morality as being based in sensibility), he ends up dismissing deontology in its entirety in favor of consequential (and, in particular Group Utilitarian) morality. However, many of the moralities which he praises throughout the book (such as the sanctity ethic in India), are entirely deontological. They are just not Kantian (nor rational). I found this annoying to read, as it hurt the author's credibility. It is also clear that the reason he doesn't understand deontology is that he doesn't believe philosophy has adequate answers for ethics and that is why he started looking for an evolutionary psychologically and archaeologically satisfactory answer on the origins of morality (and, hence, never adequately studied philosophy).My biggest problem with ending up with a consequential morality is that my current studies in Game Theory are leading me to believe that any consequential ethic can ultimately be reduced to Social or Individual Egoism (which is to say what is good for (my society / my self) is correct). I cannot support egoism as it violates my irrational elephant's morality.All in all, though, it was a good read with lots of interesting things to think about. It is certainly a message that would benefit our country and its politicians."
136,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19164649-james,4,"This book is the reason I don’t regret being a psychology major. This book is indispensable reading for our politically and religiously divided times. Throughout eleven chapters, Jonathan Haidt expertly lays out the case for why religious/political opinions are so entrenched and can often defy logic. He explains clearly and concisely, through the use of rigorous scientific experimentation, the ways in which our moral reasoning is often a post ad hoc justification for our gut reactions, and also how this is not necessarily a bad thing.He tears down the idolatry of reason pushed by the Enlightenment and the New Atheists, showing how pure logic without gut reactions actually lead to worse, not better decision-making and also lays out the evolutionary foundation for morality as a vehicle useful for creating orderly societies.I admire Haidt because he is that rare individual willing to understand both sides. A long-time political progressive who championed reason above all else and had typical liberal stereotypes for conservatives, his research in non-Western societies slowly helped him to realize that these stereotypes were not the truth. It wasn’t that conservative groups lack care for others or can’t see suffering, but rather that they hold care/suffering as just one of several pillars of morality that they hold which those of us in more “enlightened” liberal democracies don’t value.This book is not perfect. As a Christian, I am theologically obligated to disagree with his point that religion was created to foster social order within social groups and to help them compete better against other social groups. There are many commands in the Bible that are quite counterproductive if the goal is fostering social order: the call to love one’s ethnic enemies, the leaving behind of biological family, and the care of foreigners. If Haidt is correct and these are simply embellishments not meant to be taken seriously, then the moral vision of Christianity is a sham and Christians are nothing more than another faction competing against other factions for limited resources. That is the tension that me and other believing readers will always have with this incredible book.I also think that Haidt, in his attempt to uncover his liberal blind spots, has ended up giving too much credit to conservatives. Since the last election, many conservatives seem to be actively rejecting the sanctity and to a lesser extent the liberty, foundation of their morality. I would be curious to hear his thoughts on the current political situation. I also feel that he unfairly holds up libertarianism, which he defines as liberal progressivism + love of free markets, as a sort of happy medium. I can’t agree with this idea, simply because my own interactions had led me to believe that political libertarianism is the morally bankrupt compromise to which many conservatives are flocking, and which leads conservatives to cede over some of their most important issues.Ultimately, this is a good self-reflection piece for many of us, a sort of plank-in-my-eye moment where we can reflect, not on what the other side is doing wrong, but how we may also have blind spots ourselves. Once you understand the concepts, you start to realize that everyone makes self-serving moral justifications, or as Scripture puts it, “no temptation has seized you except that which is common to man.” That is how this book should be read, not as a way to explain the irrationality and evil of the “other side”, which funny enough, is what Haidt proves we are inclined to do. Rather, it should be seen as an opportunity for honest soul-searching, to understand why we make the moral decisions we do, why we hold the opinions we hold, and what pillars of morality we ourselves have neglected."
137,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"In part I of this book, Haidt argues against the Western rationalist tradition that has the mind in control of emotions. This he calls the “rationalist delusion” and writes that there’s a straight line of thinking along this line running from Plato, Kant, Jean Piaget and Lawrence Kohlberg. Haidt flips this model around and says that we are driven by an intuitive substrate that guides our reason. Intuitions are first and strategic reason is second, he writes, echoing Hume’s view that reason services the passions.Haidt digs into this intuition-based model in part II and develops a six dimensional Moral Foundations Theory, which he believes explains a good part of our social and moral behavior. Three of his criteria speak to the Western tradition of individualism--individual freedom, and protection against harm and unfairness. Rights, equality and anti-authoritarianism are the hallmarks of this tradition. Based on his time in India, however, Haidt comes to understand that what drives us socially and morally is much broader than what we think in the West. In the East, the emphasis is more on group values, as then identified by three other criteria from Haidt’s Moral Foundations Theory: loyalty to the group, respect for its authority, and our merger into something larger than the self (the “sanctity” dimension). In part III, Haidt attempts to bring Parts I and II together. However, he has multiple themes going on throughout his book and this makes it a challenge to see how all of these cohere. His primary aim is to explain the difference between the worldviews of conservatives and liberals in U.S. politics. Haidt believes that the conservative worldview is anchored by group identity. Conservative politicians understand this and milk it for all they can, with appeals to loyalty, authority and nation (the terminology, “righteous,” indicates its strongly visceral nature). Haidt believes that liberals are baffled by this group pre-occupation because the liberal worldview reflects the individualist tradition that values rights, welfare, freedom and equality. Liberals are the legacy of Plato and the Enlightenment: It’s about individuals, guided by principles and ideas. This puts liberals at a disadvantage Haidt says because group identity is far more powerful than individualism. Significantly, conservatives and liberals do not understand each other. Conservatives see liberals as not having sufficient respect for the “sanctity” of the nation. Liberals see conservatives as ignorant of facts and as acting from “emotion.” Haidt anchors his belief about the conservative worldview in group selection theory in which the individual is designed by evolution to make the group successful vis-à-vis other groups. He says that individuals are social beings because this makes their group stronger, which gives their group a competitive advantage. This he believes explains the development of our cooperative nature, and counters the selfish gene theorists who are challenged to explain our clearly evident social nature. Haidt takes his point even further when he discusses our immersion within the group in Durkheim’s sense, and with his argument that the function of religion and sport is to strengthen social ties and bind the group together. Clearly, we are tribal just as Darwin said but Haidt’s explanation is not convincing. Why does the individual care about the group? Rather than caring for the group’s welfare per se, it’s more plausible to place the ultimate motive force within the individual. Alone, the individual dies; within a group, the individual lives. And those with cooperative tendencies would survive and propagate, moving forward their cooperative tendencies. This would account for the group behavior such as loyalty, the submission to authority, and the feeling of sanctity that Haidt describes, and it would also keep the individual as the unit of selection, which is the position of most evolutionary theorists today. (1) If I understand him correctly, Haidt’s three individualistic dimensions for his Moral Foundations Theory (caring, fairness, freedom) lie largely outside of the intuition substrate. Yet it seems to me that these too rest on a strong emotional foundation. Caring for those less fortunate is compassion; compassion is an emotion. Fairness – not taking advantage of others – requires some version of equality, and unfairness is experienced viscerally. Freedom, understood as the need to be free to pursue our self-interest against control and imposition, can be seen as an emotion too. Haidt also writes about inherent dispositions that push us toward individualism or toward the group. (2) Haidt’s division between conservative and liberal is based on those who are group oriented at the expense of individualism if need be and those who value personal freedom and oppose group conformity when it is too confining. Taking this one step further, it’s interesting to speculate whether the source of these respective worldviews could be, disposition wise, fear for those who seek security by their dependence on the group, and a need for freedom for those who need to promote their interests in their own way. Rather than pure poles, these might better be seen as predominant tendencies that are molded by situation, experience, education, and cultural practices that emphasize one form or another. The other components of Haidt’s Moral Foundations Theory might then be subsumed by our need for freedom to seek what we need to survive and live well, and by fear that serves to protect what we have and what we need. Haidt seems to limit “group righteousness” to conservatives, but are not liberals also part of the Durkheim notion of “belonging”? And are not liberals immersed in their own tribal view, particularly to those who are thought to be less educated and sophisticated (the Hillbilly Elegy argument)? (3) Given his “rationalist delusion” argument, liberal belief in objective truth leaves room for ample subjectivity. The weakest part of Haidt’s book is about how to resolve these polarizing worldviews. Basically, in this book Haidt says we should talk to the other side of the divide and he leaves it as that. (4) And, given his evolutionary biology orientation, it’s interesting that Haidt does not discuss the significance of self-respect and the role that implicit hierarchies might play in our views about others (liberals versus conservatives; conservatives versus minorities/migrants). Haidt’s endnotes are excellent.(1)	These theorists account for group behavior via kin selection and reciprocal altruism, but their argument falters on why an individual would “care” about others beyond one’s direct progeny. There is also the badly named, “reciprocal altruism,” but Haidt’s point about an individual’s attachment to the group via a deeply unconscious immersion in the Durkheim sense is that our social ties are far more than a reciprocity accounting sheet.(2)	 This part of Haidt’s book is not clear to me. Haidt’s argument about group theory suggests that we, as species members, are all group people. Yet, he also notes that those on the individualist side are much less inclined that way. His discussion about inherent disposition, though, suggests that human nature contains both poles of behavior. An argument can be made that these poles represent different evolutionary strategies for survival. One emphasizes the self vis-à-vis the group, and the other emphasizes the group vis-à-vis the self. Such variations within human nature are consistent with Darwinian theory as long as they contribute to, or at least do not detract from, individual survival. (3)	Haidt quotes Garrison Keillor who “captured the spirit and self-image of the modern American left when he wrote: ‘I am a liberal, and liberalism is the politics of kindness. Liberals stand for tolerance, magnanimity, community spirit, the defense of the weak against the powerful, love of learning, freedom of belief, art and poetry, city life, the very things that make America worth dying for.’” Kindness, magnanimity, community spirit (including, helping those in need) are small town virtues. Art and poetry? How about real work? City life? How about those who don’t live in cities and wouldn’t want to? These may be the “good people” that Haidt references in the subtitle to his book.(4)	In an interview on Charlie Rose, Haidt indicates clearly that he has spent much time on the topic of how to bridge the cultural divides. He has set up the Heterodox Academy within academia to formalize exchanges among those who hold diverse viewpoints. "
138,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3692137-xing-chen,4,"One of the most thought-provoking and 'confrontational' reads I've had in a while. Haidt dives into the psychology behind conservative/liberal thinking: evolutionary trends as well as present-day circumstances that predispose people, via nature and nurture, to view the world with different degrees of suspicion or trust, compassion or criticism, and in-group or out-group solidarity. I spent most of the book flitting between acceptance of his description and explanations (they make extremely good sense when placed within the appropriate context) and clinging to the safety-net expectation that at the end of it, I'd have gained a slightly broader perspective but would still retain most of my prior beliefs. In other words, my original intention was to extract whatever I could, to engage in a largely self-affirming exercise, and to supplement pre-existing biases with additional arsenal.As I read, however, I soon realised that the author had set the bar higher than I'd antipicated, sprinkling the pages with direct challenges to his pious-minded liberal readers. I consider myself fairly empathic towards (for instance) religious believers- the fact that many casual readers interpret my HelpShedtheFaith site as being religious, rather than atheist, is evidence of this- however, The Righteous Mind pushed me to view things yet more carefully from alternative perspectives.The prevailing tendency among left-leaners (myself included) is to attempt to understand what right-wingers are thinking, make a big show of it, and then ostentatiously give up, in defeated and mocking resignation. Haidt carried the discussion courageously forward, basing his arguments on a wealth of studies and observations (which included his original research findings) and stubbornly denied the reader an easy cop-out. Some examples were readily ingested- I could understand the viewpoints on the conservative side, while squinting critically at the liberal arguments. But other examples elicited an instinctive jerk of confusion and disbelief- I felt so strongly aligned with the liberal mindset that it was hard to even dip my toes into a consideration of the alternative. Despite the aversive reaction- or probably because of it- I felt as though an opportunity had been presented, to place some distance between myself and my beliefs. I subscribe to the notion that some kinds of universal truth exist (for an overwhelming majority of human intents and purposes, at least). Thus the evolution of my beliefs should be routed in an optimal direction, for the efficient development of a more accurate, useful understanding of reality. I also believed, by extension, that everyone would theoretically be headed towards the same destination. I'm now less convinced of the singularity of this trajectory, and am beginning to explore the idea that these endpoints might be wildly different across individuals and circumstances.The atmosphere of thought that surrounds us is viscous- ideas take time to diffuse and may be physically unable to cross certain barriers and establish footholds in alien environments. Mentalities that seem obviously essential in one realm may be maladaptive in another. A liberal outlook allows me to thrive in a safe, academic/scientific environment, and I rather believe that given my goals, ideals and experiences, this approach suits me best. But for those who operate in vastly different environments, with different sets of challenges and companions, it would be necessary to adopt philosophies that diverge greatly from mine.Even after finishing the book, I'm a little unsure of what my final take is, but am greatly appreciative of the shake-up, which has revealed a simultaneous blend of pliability and resistance within my own self-righteous mind. Favourite quotes:""...if you want your kids to learn about the social world, let them play with other kids and resolve disputes; don't lecture them about the Ten Commandments. And, for heaven's sake, don't force them to obey God or their teachers or you. That will only freeze them at the conventional level.""""It is religious belongingness that matters for neighborliness, not religious believing."" [from Putnam and Campbell]""...if you are trying to change an organization or a society and you do not consider the effects of your changes on moral capital, you're asking for trouble. This, I believe, is the fundamental blind spot of the left. It explains why liberal reforms so often backfire, and why communist revolutions usually end up in despotism. It is the reason I believe that liberalism- which has done so much to bring about freedom and equal opportunity- is not sufficient as a governing philosophy. It tends to overreach, change too many things too quickly, and reduce the stock of moral capital inadvertently. Conversely, while conservatives do a better ob of preserving moral capital, they often fail to notice certain classes of victims, fail to limit the predations of certain powerful institutions, and fail to see the need to change or update institutions as times change.""""Social cohesion is a necessity, and mankind has never yet succeeded in enforcing cohesion by merely rational arguments. Every community is exposed to two opposite dangers: ossification through too much discipline and reverence for tradition, on the one hand; on the other hand, dissolution, or subjection to foreign conquest, through the growth of an individualism and personal independence that makes cooperation impossible."" [from Bertrand Russell]""...much of the increase in polarization was unavoidable. It was the natural result of the political realignment that took place after President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act in 1964. The conservative southern states, which had been solidly Democratic since the Civil War (because Lincoln was a Republican) then began to leave the Democratic Party, and by the 1990s the South was solidly Republican. Before this realignment there had been liberals and conservatives in both parties, which made it easy to form bipartisan teams who could work together on legislative projects. But after the realignment, there was no longer any overlap, either in the Senate or in the House of Representatives. Nowadays the most liberal Republican is typically more conservative than the most conservative Democrat.""""Newt Gingrich, the new speaker of the House of Representatives, encouraged the large group of incoming Republican congressmen to leave their families in their home districts rather than moving their spouses and children to Washington. Before 1995, congressmen from both parties attended many of the same social events on weekends; their spouses became friends; their children played on the same sports teams. But nowadays most congressmen fly to Washington on Monday night, huddle with their teammates and do battle for three days, and then fly home on Thursday night. Cross-party friendships are disappearing; Manichaeism and scorched Earth politics are increasing."""

While I have some major disagreements with the author (more on that below), I can heartily recommend the book to people of all political persuasions. Reading it is bound to do a lot more good than harm (if you allow an appeal to my ""harm""-foundation ;) ).I also admire the book's pedagogical style. The chapter structure relies on easy-to-digest formulas and fruitful ""take-home"" messages, like any good popular science book should, without diluting the science behind the theory. All the most important ideas are explained very clearly and repeated systematically. I will be surprised if anybody fails to pick up an idea or two from each chapter.As a book of descriptive sociology, anthropology and psychology, the book works marvels. It reveals the genetic and social origins of our moral doctrines in all their kaleidoscopic (but non-random) variety, from the tribal ""parochial altruism"" of religious, authoritarian and egalitarian communities, to the advanced social justice movements of rationalist and utilitarian philosophies.It is clear that the psychological force of our moral intuitions (""the elephant"" in Haidt's terminology) is actually in charge most of the time, while our strategic reasoning (""the rider"") does the dirty work of giving us reasons to follow our gut feelings. The six-foundational model of morality that Haidt presents presents a useful and empirically verifiable way to think about moral questions. It helps to explain the persistent divides in our political landscape - and the seeming impossibility of each side to understand, sympathize with, or be willing to talk to, the other side.Where I disagree with Haidt is in his prescriptive pronouncements. He argues for a kind of pluralism. He borrows the metaphor of the ""yin"" and the ""yang"", and the moral force of Bertrand Russell and John Stuart Mill, to make the quasi-relativistic case that a healthy political system will have to take advantage of the various different moral matrices, dispersed across the voting public. Haidt argues for a hallowed balance of morality, where the conservative impulse to maintain order eternally struggles for power with the liberal impulse to care for the weak and to reform society. I think this metaphor has a lot going for it, and fighting against totalitarianism of all kinds - whether from the left or the right - is always a worthy challenge, but I think he is wrong to rely so heavily on the immutability of the six foundations, and on their supposed genetic origin. I think the question of how much moral sentiments can be affected by upbringing and culture is still unsettled. The divide between urban morality and countryside morality, as witnessed in almost all countries, is certainly partially the result of genetic differentiation: people who are open to experience and otherwise liberal or libertarian will tend to concentrate into big cities. But the massive changes in morality, politics and culture as we have seen in the last 100 years are certainly not primarily the result of one genetic population gaining the upper hand (such as can happen when a totalitarian system of one kind or another temporarily takes over), or of rapid genetic changes in the population (such as can happen over the course of tens of thousands of years). I do believe that moral revolutions can be affected through the spontaneous exchange of ideas.The guiding metaphor that moral matrix should be seen as a ""palate"" with six different taste receptors is probably misleading. The fact that intelligent people generally reject religion, for example, should not be seen as evidence of their diminished capacity for moral sentiments, but of their capacity to bring their emotional life and their intellectual life into a new kind of harmony. And while it is true that appeals to loyalty, transcendence, authority, community spirit and so on are likely to be lasting aspects of our social psychology for a long time to come, there is no reason to give any special moral value to those aspects of our psychology that will prove to be harmful or antisocial in the new kind of cosmopolitan community that is slowly but surely emerging. Haidt's categorization, far from being neutral, is biased in one direction - namely, to be unfair to liberals, libertarians and other ""narrow"" versions of moral reasoning, since it paints them as narrow and ""famished"" versions of moral taste, which is supposed to be more fully articulated in conservative minds (or sentiments). Secondly, Haidt's dismissal of moral realism - the idea that some moral ideas are simply better than others - is a recipe for defeatism. Surely we can try to affect moral change such as we have seen already in our own lifetimes? And surely we should try and transform people's psychological longings - for authority, belongingness, spirituality, egalitarianism - into less destructive ends than political and moral zero-sum battle for dominance? In particular, as a libertarian I think that we should try to reduce the scope of political authority and thus to enlarge the scope of individual and group autonomy, so that ALL psychological types - and all voluntary moral communities - can be allowed to strive and coexist in peaceful pluralism. Most of our troubles come from the capacity of people to impose their views on others - and this is not a moral judgment, but simply a sociological observation. Some systems of governance are better for moral pluralism - and some moral views are so harmful that they need to be thus contained, even if they do spring from the natural and genetic ""foundations"" of the humans who hold them. Haidt's self-professed ""Durkheimian utilitarianism"" cannot be the correct solution as long as the future of mankind depends on our capacity to overcome our prejudices and not to wallow in them. An accurate understanding of the broad nature of our in-born psychological ""moral matrices"" and intuitive judgments does not give us any reason to think that mindless pluralism is the only way forward. There might well be better and worse moral views, and it is the task of moral reasoning to try and change people's views about what matters and on how we should discipline ourselves.So, Haidt's theory has prescriptive shortcomings, but they do not detract from the power of Haidt's descriptive summary of the psychological landscape. Haidt has given us a ""toolkit"" (a word he himself uses) to think about these problems - a toolkit that has great applicability in a range of disciplines and across a range of social problems. We ignore the lessons of this book at our own peril. Even if we believe that there is one and only one moral truth, we should acknowledge that people are likely to resist this notion as long as their bodies and minds are generating intuitive objections. There is no point in trying to pretend that mathematical certainty in morality is easily found."
140,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4449947-romany-arrowsmith,5,"Lately I've been having nightmares about climate change. I've always been fairly obsessed with death (what bookish person isn't?) but why this particular form of impending doom has so completely captured my imagination in 2019 is unclear. I would like, as a tentative primary life goal, to understand what I've lived through before it all ends and I guess I'm afraid I might not have time to gather all the material that can help me do that - then again, a car crash could truncate the time already limited by catastrophic global warming even further, so why am I so specifically worried now?I think the worry comes from the fact that almost everyone I know is quite unhappy, and we are not making the best of what little time we have to inhere and cohere into and within communities that care and defend, that seek adventures and maintain order, and respect/foster the dissonant but crucial moral impulses that exist within every individual. That I will die is...fine, I guess. I'd rather not, but I don't have a choice, so I can accept it with some measure of dignity that is 1 part cultivated stoicism and 3 parts denial. That we may ALL die, as a planet, collectively and imminently, without finding a better way to live together, feels much worse and seems untouchable by my internal stores of stoicism/denial. Rituals and fellowship are important, but my atheist pals could not possibly disdain modern spiritual practice more. Protection of the vulnerable is important, but my military buddies can't see why proposed liberal health care reforms helps them too. I've got my own problems, I'm a trashcan brimming with libertarian moral disorder, but the upshot is that the yins are all yinning and the yangs are elsewhere yanging and, well, it's alright if we all die, but can't we do it gracefully? How many more Disney cartoon CGI remakes will I have to endure while I see all of the people I love either get divorced or kill themselves, and will the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq end before water scarcity and rising sea levels end every war and every instance of peace as well?Not sure what I'm trying to say here. It just seems like a waste of a good time for the last generations who will have a green, good earth. Well, okay. It seems trivial written out. BUT WE COULD ALL BE HAVING A BETTER TIME THAN THIS.

141,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2487388-peter-w,4,"One of the very best social science books I've ever read.Jonathan Haidt explains why it is so difficult for people across the partisan divide and the faith divide to understand and be persuaded by each other.He discusses different moral languages and different moral values that different political and religious groups espouse. For example, educated, industrialized Westerners often think that morality should be based on whether or not actions harm others; but poorer, more rural, and more religious communities care about other factors such as whether the behavior aligns with the community's traditions or God's will. Liberals emphasize the value of care / compassion; libertarians emphasize liberty; conservatives emphasize several different values including sanctity, authority, loyalty and fairness. Haidt self-identifies as an atheist in the book, but he is a persuasive advocate of religion. He looks at religion through the lens of Darwinian evolution, arguing that religion is a group-level adaptation. (This is hilarious because atheists won't like his conclusion that religion is good for society and many of the faithful won't like his justification that evolution is the way religion got to us). He says that religious groups were/are more likely to succeed than nonreligious groups, ceteris paribus, because religion provides the best way to unite people and to make self-sacrifice on behalf of a group of people meaningful. Haidt concludes the book by bringing up a few of the important arguments that liberals (companies need to be regulated), conservatives (helping a few of the bees doesn't always benefit the hive), and libertarians (concerning health care: if you don't pay for something, you will abuse it) make. He hopes that different opinions work together in yin-yang fashion in society, but the fact that we are speaking different moral languages to each other and are increasingly polarized makes this harmony difficult."
142,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12162514-graeme-newell,5,"Intellectually, most of us understand that people with divergent opinions aren’t bad, but have different vantage points. However, these days more people believe that those who disagree are malicious evil doers, hell-bent on tearing down society.In “The Righteous Mind,” social psychologist Jonathan Haidt explores the deep biological origins of our divisions and helps us to understand the survival instincts that molded these feelings over the millennia. This book provides fascinating insight into the powerful motivations that have fanned the flames of partisanship in these contentious times.Like most people, I see my own moral and political beliefs as simple common sense, but Haidt really opened my eyes to how my own myopic thinking bolsters my ego and delegitimizes differing viewpoints. My most beloved satisfying prejudice is to see those who think differently as being ignorant or morally corrupt. This allows me to dismiss their ideas and nestle into my own worldview undisturbed.In recent years I’ve been baffled and horrified by the inexplicable and seemingly reprehensible tactics of the other side. This book pried my eyes open to the worldview of people who feel the exact same way about my beliefs. While I don’t support much of what they believe, at least I now understand them a bit better.Haidt breaks down six key moral foundations that are central to tribal bonding and human identity, then shows the strikingly different ways that liberals and conservatives think about these issues. This really helped me understand that my own sequestered viewpoint has become far too stifled. I’ve gotten lazy and become far too dismissive. This book forced me to compassionately plumb the minds of people with beliefs diametrically opposed to my own.Most importantly, I finally have a more satisfying answer to the question, “what the hell are they thinking?!” It’s just too easy to passively sit on the intellectual sidelines and criticize. This book opened my eyes to just how valuable it can be to find an understanding of the beliefs that disturb me most."
143,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3273779-mirek-kukla,5,"Summary""The Righteous Mind"" is a book that's done more to change my worldview than any other I can think of. I've grown up vaguely assuming the aim of morality is to discover some platonic truth, in theory derivable by reason alone. I've generally believed my own convictions to be a reasonable approximation to said truth. And I've often found myself mystified by how people I regard as intelligent could hold contrary (clearly ""irrational"") beliefs.In the span of a few hundred pages, Haidt has shaken up my moral presumptions and enriched my understanding of human nature. ""The Righteous Mind"" helps you to understand why rational people can so vehemently disagree, realize that most of our beliefs have nothing to do ""rationality,"" and recognize the communal value of believing in shared fictions. This is a landmark book on morality, rationality, and belief. And while it may offer no moral answers, it'll completely changes how you think about moral questions, and you'll almost certainly leave a broader-minded, more empathetic person.Three major thesesThe book is broken up into 3 sections. In the first, Haidt demonstrates that ""reason"" plays almost no role in establishing our moral beliefs; in the second, that moral sentiments occur along 6 different, evolutionary explainable dimensions; and in the third, that the ""shared fictions"" morality engenders (such as religion) allow humans to transcend their selfish genes, which ultimately gives rise to civilization as we know it.This is a descriptive bookBefore digging deeper, let's make sure an important point is clear: this is a descriptive work of non-fiction, not a normative one. Haidt is a psychologist, not a philosopher or theologian. As such, he's concerned purely with how humans actually behave, as opposed to how they ought to. Put differently, this book is an examination of ""morality as an abstraction."" If our sense of morality can be likened to our sense flavor, it's a book about how taste works, not about which cuisines are best.Tasteful analogiesThe ""flavor"" analogy actually works really well, and Haidt uses it at length. For instance, our taste preferences have a biological basis, but they carry a cultural twist; just so with our moral inclinations. Our sense of taste is empirical, insofar as you can't derive ""flavor"" from first principles; just so with our moral leanings. Cooking with just one flavor doesn't quite satisfy us; just so with moral codes and political systems. And so on. Haidt uses many such analogies, and to great effect.Cross-disciplinary empirical evidenceOf course, analogies can only help you understand a thesis. Convincing you to accept it requires empirical evidence - and here Haidt offers hefty, heaping servings. Haidt has spent a lifetime doing research in moral psychology, and many of the studies discussed are his own. It's not, however, a one man show. Haidt is clearly a well-read, and not just in his own field, and he comfortably navigates domains that vary from biology to sociology to economics.Contentious evolutionary claimsBiology in particular is important, as here Haidt makes some contention claims. He first argues that morality has a fundamentally evolutionary explanation, in the traditional selfish-gene sense. He then goes on to suggest that, since morality can suppress free-riding, it gives rise to group-level selection, which results in the genuinely unselfish (""groupish"") behavior exhibited by humans. Group-level selection, mind you, is very controversial in academia, but I never felt like Haidt was overreaching. His ideas might be controversial, but his presentation is intellectually honest, and his tone is unusually humble (*cough* Dawkins *cough*).A writing style that engenders understandingHaidt's writing is across-the-board is terrific. The book is impeccably organized, and it's delightfully apparent Haidt primary goal is not to sound smart, but to maximize comprehension. Every chapter starts with a crisp overview and ends with a well-curated summary. The language is simple without being simplistic. And while nitpicky counterarguments and potentially distracting technicalities addressed, they're wisely relegated to the massive appendix as footnotes. Haidt's obvious care for the reader had me genuinely giddy.Complaint 1: the rhetoric surrounding ""reason""There are only two complaints I can think of making. The first concerns Haidt's rhetoric when it comes to discussing ""reason"" vs. ""intuition."" Haidt convincingly argues that when it comes to ethical judgments (and decision making in general), we often act based on ""intuition."" Only then do turn to ""reason,"" for post-hoc rationalizations. Note that these are descriptive claims. Unfortunately, Haidt's rhetoric gets a little anti-rationalist, and the result is that folks might think he's saying ""reason is bad, you ought to go with your gut"". Which is not what Haidt's claim, even if he does have a bit of a chip on his shoulder.Complaint 2: why not relativism?My second complaint is that, after Haidt is done knocking down our normative assumptions, he fails to establish there's anything left. While he claims his arguments don't lead to relativism (the belief that there's no such thing as absolute truth), he never gets around to explaining why. If morality is nothing but an evolutionary response to survival pressures, it's hard to understand how we can salvage anything resembling an ""ought."" And at this point, what does it mean to say something is ""good""? Haidt often assumes things like unselfishness are objectively good, so giving some indication as to ""why not relativism"" strikes me as pretty important.My suspicion is that Haidt simply doesn't have the answer, and that's OK: silence is better than bullshit. And in a way, Haidt does give us a way out. Even if relativism is true, we're wired to believe it's not, so maybe you can't fall into the pit of normative nihilism even if you ought to.ConclusionIn sum: ""The Righteous Mind"" is a righteous book. It's well-research, empirically founded, and well-written; insightful, impactful, and intelligent. I feel bad to have only scratched the surface when it comes to covering the content, but I hope I've hammered home that this a book you shouldn't miss. Haidt has changed the ways I'll think about morality, judge unfamiliarity, and empathize with convictions I don't understand. And while I'm left questioning the meaning of ""good,"" no doubt exists that this is a damn good book indeed."
144,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38143054-daniel-coimbra,4,"Haidt is a secular progressive author, whose book is half about the origins of political disagreement—discussing mostly cognitive biases, group thinking, and moral psychology—and half a personal exploration of what is valuable in religious social organization and what is true in conservatism. I will write about the last part, conservatism. What follows ain't a summary; it contains insights of my own.Haidt emphasizes how pro-social behavior, emphatetic emotions, and life satisfaction depend on a person's social environment. More specifically, they depend on how integrated one is within a community and, furthermore, on how integrated that community itself is.So significant was his emphasis that he was drawn closer to what we may call post-Enlightenment cultural conservatism: the view that tradition is valuable insofar as it creates communities integrated around *binding* social conventions—no matter how arbitrary—but that, unfortunately, such communities are undermined by some progressive sentiments, resulting in anti-social individualism. (That is cultural conservatism; political conservatism is about public policy, promoting careful reformation in lieu of revolutions.)Secularism, rationalism, and utilitarianism highlight the arbitariness of social conventions, so the latter stop being binding. In addition, prioritizing individual self-determination reduces tolerance for the same social conventions. Furthermore, a universalist sentiment reduces one's commitment to one's parochial in-group. Result: a hard-to-fix existential ennui and less pro-social behavior.The resulting problem is delicate. In some aspects, utilitarianism and univeralism *do* enhance empathy and pro-social behavior. Plus, secularism and rationalism have freed us from oppressive social systems. All in all, we got feminism, vegetarianism, the black movement, the indigenous movement, concern for domestic and international inequality, concern for labor exploitation, anticolonialism, environmentalism, anticorporativism, and so on. Althought we see counter-examples every day, it is generally hard for progressives to be warhawks, imperalists, racist, xenophobic, sexually intolerant, violent, insensitive, obscurantist, punitivist, unilateralist in world affairs, or otherwise uncooperative and oppressive. Progressivism is broadly a great thing. (Disclaimer: but of course progressives, as any other humans including you and me, can be quite intellectually intolerant and impervious to reason.)But it's missing something. Guided by reason and science, our challenge is to reconcile (a) the objectively true and immensely beneficial progressive values with (b) the correct conservative insight that social embededness is highly desirable but requires *some* respect for arbitrary tradition, authority, and hierarchy. Social cohension produces more pro-social behavior and happier humans.Neither me nor Haidt have much of an idea of how this can be done. Still, after recognizing this, it becomes much easier to understand the moral worries motivating non-progressives. (As the reader can see, I am quite enthusiastic about progressivism, so I praise Haidt for the mind-opening analysis.)"
145,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6221947-kerry-cunningham,4,"By and large, I think this is a good and even an important book. In it, Haidt very clearly lays out the research that supports the view that human beings have been endowed by evolution with 6 moral intuitions, or foundations. The moral intuitions are innate, which Haidt clearly explains does not mean fixed and immutable, but, rather, arranged in advance of experience. We don't all have a fixed set of moral intuitions, but there is a limited palate from which experience may paint the picture of how we perceive the world. The most important part of Haidt's research and the argument of this book is that liberal and conservatives share these moral intuitions but tend to emphasize them very differently, and it is the different emphases that cause the divisions among us. In brief, liberals tend to assign moral weight to issues of justice (is it fair - does everyone have an equal chance) and harm/care (does it cause harm to another - bad; or does it help another - good). Conservatives share these intuitions, but their take on justice is different. For a conservative, justice is determined by proportionality. Each according to his/ her contribution, not his/ her need. In addition, everyone, but conservatives to a much greater extent than liberals, also feel that questions of loyalty (to one's group/family/country), authority (obedience), and purity/ sanctity (as in not mixing this with that) are moral issues. A sixth intuition concerns liberty. Here again, however, liberals and conservatives differ in how they think about liberty. Liberals wish to be free of constraints applied by other members of the group, while conservatives think of liberty as freedom from government. As a framework for parsing arguments between liberals and conservatives, I think this is extraordinarily helpful. What Haidt and colleagues argue is that when we disagree with our ideological counterparts, the disagreements arise from differences in the weight we apply to these moral intuitions. For liberals, there really are just two primary moral issues, fairness and harm/care, while conservatives also value authority, loyalty, purity and liberty to a great extent. Importantly, Haidt argues that each of the moral intuitions has been vital to the evolution of human culture. While those among us who are liberals care more about justice and care, without the other intuitions, we would never have achieved the groupishness and hence the culture that separates humans from other animals. It is primarily the conservative intuitions that have been responsible for providing the glue that held groups together over our evolutionary history, and it is as groups that human beings have generated a culture that has distanced us from our primitive ape cousins.Not much to take issue with there.Ultimately, however, Haidt explains that his study of morality produced in him a sort of conversion from liberal to moderately conservative, having discovered the value of groupish moral intuitions. He also cites research showing that conservatives are better able to take the view of a liberal into account that vice versa, and invites liberals to try to broaden their view to include these other intuitions. His suggestion in this book and elsewhere is that more conservative voices should be added to the intellectual debate over the role of moral intuitions in society. So here's my problem with that. 1) I am liberal and have a hard time, as he says, understanding how the groupish intuitions might continue to retain their value as moral intuitions in the modern world. It seems to me that many of our greatest problems today have to do with the oversized role of these moral intuitions in buttressing parochial concerns (issues of importance to my group only), leading to inter-group conflict. 2) I am a member of a group (gays) that has been and still is legally disenfranchised in this country, and that disenfranchisement is largely justified by referral to the moral intuition purity. I can't marry my partner, because too many people in this country believe that to allow me to do so would somehow violate the purity/sanctity of heterosexual marriage. So, I can't get behind it. Of course, that is my parochial concern, but I can point to similar concerns that would affect nearly everyone. Purity/Sanctity, in my view, is a moral intuition that has outlived its useful life. 3) Too much of Haidt's argument has the flavor of a naturalistic fallacy. One is committing the naturalistic fallacy when one deems something to be good on the basis of it being natural. Another way it is expressed is when a person assumes that something ought or should be a certain way solely on the basis that it is that way in nature. Haidt's argument is more subtle than saying that because people are endowed with six moral intuitions, therefore all six ought to be valued equally. But, for may taste, his argument still relies mostly on the argument that because these six moral foundations were all critical for the development of what we consider to be civilized society, that they are all to be consulted in policy- and decision-making now. Much of our civilization consists of norms and rules for curbing natural instincts. The instincts that continually reify parochial groupishness, ie, the conservative moral intuitions, are among the natural instincts that I believe must be curbed. An alternative take is that the moral foundations are fine as is, but the groups to which they are applied must be continually enlarged to include everyone, and then perhaps everything. Clearly, this circle-enlarging has been occurring and will likely continue. That's great. But, shouldn't we also work to limit the sway of the intuitions that, while historically vital, are presently harmful or at best of dubious value for large swathes (i.e., anyone not in the majority) of our society today?"
146,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5649730-taylor,4,"This has been on my to-read shelf for quite some time. So, I listened to it, and I'm going to buy a hard copy and read it again, simply because I want to reprocess all the information and utilize the visual components of the text. I don't feel I am enough of an expert to critique Haidt's thoughts and conclusions, but I do think anyone remotely interested in basic politics and political philosophy would be interested to read his conclusions about why our two-party system has evolved into what it is today. This book also provides interesting insights into why people are so passionate about certain political issues, and how you can talk and listen to someone who disagrees with you in a way that will help you both understand each other--which is, obviously, beyond vital in our current polarized political climate. Would definitely recommend this book."
147,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11174416-michael-rushton,5,"This is the book I have probably thought about most over the past four years, and I’ve recommended it to dozens of people, so I figured it deserved a re-read and a review. TL;DR If you want to understand the psychology of morality (you should in our increasingly morality-obsessed call-out culture and political self-righteousness), this book is a necessity and I cannot recommend it enough.Jonathan Haidt’s thoughts occupied a large amount of my headspace just before the last election when there was the bud of political tribalism that has grown to ripeness in the past year. He broaches a topic that is increasingly difficult for people to speak about. “I hate talking about politics” or “why is everything so political?” are two of the phrases I feel I have heard more frequently than ever before in my life. Additionally, religion has progressively been perceived as an enemy to progress, an idea that Haidt brings up as being championed by the New Atheists (Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris). As a religious person from a religious family living who loves his country and all its potential, I have been increasingly dissatisfied with discussion regarding politics, and occasionally religion. Reading this book turns on all the lights, illuminating every nuanced reason I, and probably you, have experienced some difficulty finding common ground. Without being exhaustive, Haidt covers morality’s origins before diving into the crux of the first half of the book: we are driven by our intuitions and our rational follows afterward. He uses a brilliant metaphor of a man riding an elephant. The elephant is our intuitions; it is large, unwieldy, and largely will go where it wants to. The man (our rational) is the passenger, finding reasons to support our elephant’s choice of passage. This is one of my two favorite parts of the book because every sentence rings painfully true. No matter how rational (reason devoid of emotional dependence) we think we are, our intuitions are intrinsically bound to our rational, and it is incredibly difficult to divorce the two. His work in this area is mind-bendingly good. I thoroughly enjoyed his discussion of morality and its ties to genetics and our environment. Genetics does play an uncomfortably powerful role in our own perceptions of morality (which he breaks down into moral foundations) and consequently our political and religious bends. It is not absolute, though; our environment is formative as well.The six moral foundations are the cornerstone of this book. The metaphor he uses that captures the idea most succinctly is the idea of moral “tastes” being like our actual sensory taste. Just as all humans have the same senses of sweet, sour, salt, bitter, and savory (umami), but not all humans like the same foods, all humans have the same six moral foundations built into their mind, but do not appreciate them all the same. The foundations are:Care/HarmFairness/CheatingLoyalty/BetrayalAuthority/SubversionSanctity/DegradationLiberty/OppressionEven these words alone will trigger an intuitive response. You may feel that “Sanctity/Degradation” means nothing to you, or that anyone who does not value “Fairness/Cheating” is an anarchist. Just like maple bacon donuts are the cat’s meow to others, but utterly revolting to others still. The most politically relevant chapters cover the fact that conservatives value all 6 foundations, while liberals value only 2 of the 6 foundations (Care/Harm, Liberty/Oppression), leaving them at a severe disadvantage in their appeal to the broader public. Haidt is not a conservative, and in fact discovered the care foundations while trying to discover why his Liberal party kept losing. He now identifies as a political centrist, believing that both parties are necessary for a harmonious government. They act as checks and balances to each other. If either gained complete control, the result would be poor for everyone, even if it seemed exciting for the winning party at first. In his final chapter, “Can’t we all disagree more constructively?” he gets to the root of the frustration so many of us feel when we talk about politics or religion and feel things creeping from civility to hostility. The answer, of course, is, yes. I’ll leave you to read to find out why.He has a lengthy discussion about religion and the idea of groups evolving and thriving together through group selection rather than solely on individual selection, and how religion is a functioning force for goodness, productivity, and happiness. He pins a lot of this on the group support we find in religion more than on the religious ideas themselves; it is difficult to divorce the two in some ways as the group is founded on the ideas, which consequently bring the group closer together. It is an interesting segment.This book mixed up my mind grapes (copyright Tracy Morgan) in all sorts of positive ways. It really opened my eyes the first read (listen) through, and the second read (listen) through brought new insights and solidified it as a required textbook in my life-long pursuit of education. I want to physically read the book next time so I can actually highlight specific segments; he is a great writer. It is a must read. Cannot recommend enough. Check out Haidt's interview with Dax Shepard on his “Experts on Experts” podcast where he talks about his newest book which dives into the coddling of the American youth and the rise of call-out culture and our prestige economy. Also fascinating. See if you're picking up what he's putting down."
148,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91092615-jack-sprat,5,"This is a breakthrough book in understanding morality from an evolutionary psychology perspective. I could probably write an essay on a few areas where I disagreed with Haidt; but this is just such an epic work - a goldmine of knowledge, insight and perspective that helps the reader gain a profoundly better understanding of politics, the Culture War, and where it's all derived from. A highly recommended read."
149,0307377903,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56239871-ryan-mccarthy,5,"Truly incredible book with a lot of really important insights into morality and why seemingly reasonable people disagree on so many issues. I think everyone should read this book. I also think Haidt could have used a bit more discretion with what warrants a footnote. My brain won't let me proceed without reading footnotes, but multi-paragraph footnotes every couple pages add up and get very distracting very quickly. I got genuinely frustrated with the length of some of them.The beauty of Goodreads is that I can complain to an ambivalent crowd about the proper use of footnotes. "
