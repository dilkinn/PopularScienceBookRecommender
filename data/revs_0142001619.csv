The publisher receives priority by including a “first refusal” clause on a second book. You merely present your publisher with stunningly unappealing material. If they choose not to publish, then you are free to go elsewhere. A history of salt should work.Mostly, a foodie history with emphasis on the historical importance of salt for food preservation. There is some discussion of industrial uses like embalming in Egypt and other parts of Africa. The sections about cod and Basque fishing were familiar from reading  Cod: A Biography of the Fish that Changed the World and  The Basque History of the World: The Story of a Nation. Until the first invention by a Paris cook, Nicolas Appert, the “Father of Canning,” most food preservation was salt. The Vitamin C in sauerkraut made it possible for early sailors to avoid scurvy. Appert canning jarMore sophisticated canning of fish and vegetables followed. Cold preservation and Clarence Birdseye, founder of the frozen food industry were not far behind. In 1928 Birdseye found a buyer for his company and fast freezing method, it became General Foods. But, until these relatively recent events, salt was a vital part of the economy. There were salt laws, salt taxes, and salt merchants.I learned a lot about the magical properties of salt, well the beliefs and customs in its magic. Salt protects against the evil eye according to both Jews and Muslims. Remember rubbing the newborn infants with salt from the Book of Ezekial 16:4. Sprinkle salt on the stage in traditional Japanese theater to protect against evil. Anglo-Saxon farmers used salt on the plow when invoking the earth goddess for a good harvest. Romans called a man in love salax, in a salted state, the origin of the word salacious. In the Pyrenees, bridal couples went to church with salt in their left pockets to guard against impotence. In some parts of France, only the groom carried salt, in others only the bride. In Germany, the bride’s shoes were sprinkled with salt. An 1157 Paris engraving titled Women Salting Their Husbands demonstrated how to make your man more virile. The last line of an accompanying poem reads, “With salting, front and back, At last strong natures they will not lack.” Bibliothèque NationaleFrom early history the West African silent barter reported by Herodotus and the ancient salt well of Shaanxi and Sichuan to the 1901 salt dome drilling of Spindletop which redefined the terms drill rig and well to mean oil, not salt. It's all here not too briny, just savory sample.A crowd gathers to watch a side gusher on Spindletop hill in Beaumont, Texas which was the site of the first Texas oil gusher, 10 January 1901.

1,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,1,"I read several chapters of this. It was mind-numbingly boring. Lists, lists, lists of everything that has ever been done with salt. What different countries, cultures and times have done with salt. The word salt in many different languages. That old thing about salary being the precious salt that the Romans paid their military in, right. I was praying for a relief from the tedium of this book. But all I got was the odd not-at-all interesting anecdote. I don't know how the rest of the book progressed but I don't care either. This was about as interesting as reading the long list of all the ingredients in a box of Twinkies where you can't pronounce half of them, have never heard of the rest and are only reading it because there isn't anything else to read. (Like you do cereal boxes or the ketchup bottle). That said, the book Twinkie, Deconstructed: My Journey to Discover How the Ingredients Found in Processed Foods Are Grown, Mined (Yes, Mined), and Manipulated Into What America Eats was actually very interesting. If Steve Ettlinger could make that interesting, I don't see why Kurlansky failed so utterly with Salt. But he did, at least for me. A lot of Kurlansky's other books sound very appealing, but I'm wary now..."
2,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt,5,"Let them eat salt! Literally, let everyone do so, as we all need a (moderate) dose of it. Such is one of the early discoveries in Mark Kurlansky’s biography of salt and how it shaped the world. Kurlansky uses his attention to detail and ability to entertain the curious reader in this book that explores much of how salt came to be found on most tables around the world, as well as some of the key customs and traditions that have lasted for centuries, if not millennia. The book places salt’s importance in three distinct categories throughout history, which Kurlansky develops effectively. Salt is most easily seen as a part of food/cooking, but also an important business over time, and finally a key political commodity throughout documented history. By viewing salt through these three lenses, the reader can better understand and respect how powerful and integral those small grains (or large rocks) have been to shaping the world in which we live. Interested and open-minded readers will enjoy this highly educational biography on what might seem a random and somewhat bland topic (pun intended). I challenge anyone who has the time to step outside the box and see if it’s to your taste.It is worth mentioning that, while Kurlansky does make mention of many forms of salt through the narrative, the significant portion of the book relates to sodium chloride (NaCl), common table salt. This product is surely both a quintessential part of human function, but also found in most foods, either in core ingredients or added in preparation. Kurlansky discusses how the Chinese were some of the first to document their use of salt to create new staples in the country, namely soy sauce, which involves a fermentation process that salt helps spark. Salt has the sensational ability to pull moisture from items and create a brine that cures them in new and exciting ways, thinking of such things as picked cucumbers, meats, or even eggs. Salt as a preserving agent proved to be central to the success of permitting foods to be kept for longer periods, be it meats hunted to last throughout the winter or fish caught on the far side of the world to endure the journey back. Kurlansky briefly explores the importance that salt and cod played as teammates to bring the fish from the seaside communities to the islands and across the Atlantic (which is extrapolated in his book about the history of cod, another good read), thereby feeding the masses who could not fish themselves. Salt’s preserving ability also serve the rich well in keeping their wines before the discovery of bottling corks, where a sprinkling in the wine not only kept it fresh, but added an interesting flavour. Kurlansky mentions throughout that salt’s addition to items to keep them edible led to numerous accidental creations that we take for granted now. Sauerkraut, long deemed (by me, at least) to be a Germanic invention has some of its earliest documented findings in China, where packing cabbage in brine within barrels that previously held fermented items led to this delicacy that the likes of Marie Antoinette could not get enough of, up to the day of her death. I also came to learn that corned beef has nothing to do with corn, but embedded salt (a corned substance being one that has bits of another item embedded within it) that seeps in and creates an interesting flavour. That humans need salt is not in question, though Kurlansky does admit that salt intake is much higher now than in times of old and that sodium levels far exceed the recommended amount. I suppose we’re well preserved for years to come, allowing us to work well into old age.While there is no doubt that salt helped feed the masses, it had to come from somewhere to make it onto tables or into the foods that were consumed. Salt was surely a lucrative and profit-rich business, according to Kurlansky, and anyone could do it on a small scale. However, large salt deposits could be handled in various ways by different companies. The first and most profitable type of business was brine ponds, used primarily for medicinal purposes. Those seeking to cure what ails them could turn to a soak in one of these ponds, usual naturally warm, and find much success. Those areas of the world able to procure the development of these ponds and keep them from drying out would see significant profits. There were other areas that used larger bodies of salt water to procure the salt needed for preserving food or making its way to the table. By creating man-made smaller basins and using the sun as a means of evaporating the water, large salt deposits remained, which could then be sold on the market. New England and parts of the Nordic countries were able to profit significantly through this method, which was sometimes paired with their cod stocks to create salted cod to sell on the world market, providing financial stability for the region. As Kurlansky discusses throughout the book, various groups were able to perfect the salt extraction method long before large machines or complex piping entered the scene. He does stress in the latter portion of the book that the lost art of salt retrieval, once passed from generation to generation, is all but lost in an era where massive factories can produce and sell salt at a discounted rate. The selling or trading of salt on the open market promised to be just as lucrative. Supply and demand would surely enter the discussion here, as would regions able to boost their economic situations by exporting salt to those in need. Kurlansky does have an interesting take on this, which I will discuss below, but there is no doubt that profits played a huge part in the salt business. Of note, salt was a significant factor in influencing Joseph Smith and Brigham Young in where they might choose to settle, away from the eyes of the majority of the American population in the mid-19th century. Looking for fertile and self-sustaining land, Young found a spot close to... yep, a ‘salt lake’, where he developed the Mormon Church and eventually helped forge Utah’s Salt Lake City. Food and business (and even religious settlements) help pave the way to a discussion of the politics of salt.As with most things in life, if there is a crack left open (or space between crystals, in this case), politics will seep in. The politics of salt are far-reaching and have significant impact since documented history began. Kurlansky discusses the Chinese in the millennia before the Common Era not only capitalising on salt in the region, but regulating its use and distribution across the empire. Perhaps a sign of things to come, rulers and governments sought to control who could have what, when, and how much, though there was no sense of equality. Far be it from me to inject economic terms here, but regulation most certainly led to a dilution of the free-market economies of these areas, where the capable could profit based on their vested time and interest. Equally interesting, there is a discussion of the British suppressing their Indian subjects prior to the country’s independence. Mahatma Gandhi fought the British ban on local procuring and selling of salt, feeling that the people had a right to work for themselves without being suppressed. It worked, though not until after much struggle and bloodshed. Kurlansky makes an interesting observation throughout the book, that one could always predict that war was on the horizon when militaries began procuring large amounts of salt. Campaigns of any length would require forethought and planning, as it was not always possible to predict the plentifulness of energy-rich foods. Salting products for long-term use was the key way of doing so, which took not only ingenuity, but also access to salt. In one example, Kurlansky uses the US Civil War, where some were sure Jefferson Davis and the Confederate Army was surely doomed, having no known salt reserves from which to pull. Salt as a political weapon, albeit one that cannot make you bleed (but definitely could cause one to squirm if it got into the wound, no?!). The political side of salt also served to create a significant have and have not duality, such that portions of the population or states facing one another were able to elevate prices and quantities to suit their own needs. As with many products, there is no way to completely balance distribution, though one can presume that it is greed that led to as much disparity on the world market, even with something as basic as salt. Put labour into the mix and politics cannot stay away, begging to regulate or comment on working conditions, hours, and rates of pay. Kurlansky stirs the pot throughout by sprinkling commentaries on these and many other political topics throughout the book, sure to keep the reader thinking.This is my third food-related biography by Kurlansky and I have not read one that has not completely floored me. The subject matter might seem bland or even off-putting, but take the time to explore what Kurlansky has to say and few will drift off from boredom. The detail Kurlansky takes in his writing seeks to educate and entertain in equal measure, while not drowning the reader in minutiae. Adding historical references and some anecdotes, the reader is taken on this journey and the points being made are further solidified as being fundamental. Kurlansky also shows an interesting habit that becomes apparent to those who have read many of his biographical pieces, pulling on pieces of research at just enough depth to make his point, but expounding on them in another tome. One can see this with his pieces on salt, cod, and milk, three that I have recently had the pleasure to devour. This interchange of ideas only furthers the hypothesis that everything is interconnected on some level, part of the larger lifeblood of the world in which we live. As with his other pieces, Kurlansky also brings the point home with related recipes embedded in the larger narrative. This personalises the subject matter and, for most, permits the reader to become actively involved in the topic at hand. Kurlansky’s books would not be complete without random pieces of knowledge, what I like to call ‘dinner party fodder’. I had no idea of salt’s presumed trait as a fertility agent or aphrodisiac. I suppose men of a more advanced age in centuries past would turn to a handful of salt rather than their coloured pill to boost their ‘shaker’, though, much like the modern pill, too much can lead to heart issues. Still, there is no end to the funny information I learn when Mark Kurlansky is in the driver’s seat. Take a whirl and spice up your life!Kudos, Mr. Kurlansky, for never ceasing to amaze me. I know so much more now than I ever thought I could have about common table salt. What may seem so simplistic is shown to be so very exciting, with your lighthearted writing. I look forward to reading more of your work in short order.Love/hate the review?

3,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/398928-laura,5,"This book changed my life. I picked it up because fiction novels were all looking the same to me, and because it was thick enough to last the long train ride from Dusseldorf to Maastricht. School textbooks were the only non-fiction I'd ever read, and they had not prepared me for the vibrant and engaging writing found in Salt. Since reading this book I have become a devoted fan of non-fiction writing, which has exposed me to a whole new world of literature."
4,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17719-amos,2,"This was the first so-called ""commodity history"" that I've read, and I'm sorry to say it might have turned me completely off the damn things. I'm not entirely sure why this book is so popular and so widely read, since it strikes me as simply a series of stories by Mark Kurlansky that quickly settle into the same basic mantra, which is: 1) Here is this culture; 2) Like the twenty other cultures I have just introduced to you, salt was also important to this culture; 3) These are the ways they gathered salt; 4) Here is a random sprinkling of recipes involving salt. Done. Move on to next story.The different stories are not even interwoven, so that halfway through the book I still didn't really know what Kurlansky's point is, unless to underscore his initial point that all animals need salt to live. But I already knew this before I cracked open the book, and I don't think Kurlansky's additional 450 pages underscoring the subject really added anything useful to my life. Moreover, how can this guy write one book about how Cod changed the world (aptly titled Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World), and then turn right around and write another about how salt changed the world? One wonders if his gimmick isn't getting a bit old. And in any case, can't you name pretty much anything out there and weave a story about how it ""changed"" the world? Shoelaces, rubber, pencils, ziplock bags . . . The one thing about the book that was interesting was how it printed all these old school recipes involving salt, salting and brining. The recipes are incredible because of the sheer amount of labor and preparation that they describe. It's both fascinating and horrifying. No wonder a woman's place used to be in the kitchen, if cooking and eating took so damn long.Here is one of the simpler recipes, this one for salted cucumbers:SOLENYE OGURTSY (SALTED CUCUMBER)Dry out very clean river sand and pass it through a fine sieve. Spread a layer of this sand, the thickness of your palm, on the bottom of a barrel. Add a layer of clean black currant leaves, dill, and horseradish cut into pieces, followed by a layer of cucumbers. Cover the cucumbers with another layer of leaves, dill, and horseradish, topped with a layer of sand. Continue in this manner until the barrel is full. The last layer over the cucumbers must be currant leaves, with sand on the very top. Prepare the brine as follows: For one pail of water, use one and a half pounds of salt. Bring to a boil, cool, and cover the cucumbers completely with the brine. Replenish the brine as it evaporates. Before any kind of salting, cucumbers must be soaked for 12-15 hours in ice water. --Elena Molokhovets, A Gift to Young Housewives=============ADDENDUM I:Okay, I am about three quarters through the book now (I was probably only about halfway through when I wrote the first portion of this review) and it's getting a lot better. Maybe it was just the very long Part II about salting cadavers and the preservation of fish that got me so down on the book before I'd even finished the damn thing. I was initially tempted to quit and put the book down, but I have done that so rarely with books that I decided to just push on, and thankfully the arc of the story shifted and started getting a lot better.=============ADDENDUM II:Okay, the book got a lot better towards the end. It's still not a book that I would read again with any relish or recommend to anyone who is not already gung-ho about commodity histories, but I don't feel like I am wasting my eyes and mental energy with it anymore. Two stars!"
5,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2876105-marc,1,"What a disappointment this was. Kurlansky clearly has searched complete encyclopaedias on the word 'salt' and has poured it all down in this book, with no connecting narrative or analysis. Facts, myths and stories are mixed almost randomly. And okay, you do get the impression that salt has played a very important role throughout history, and even all around the world, but in the end you're stuck with a dizzying amount of (unreliable) facts. Kurlansky even has the annoying habit of adding all kinds of other non-salt-related information; unfortunately for him, he regularly makes big mistakes and he repeats himself constantly. This is certainly not the way that World History should go."
6,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/796425-jeanette-again,4,"Well, I'll be pickled! We say we'll take something with a grain of salt as if it's nothing, but much of the history of the world is tied up in the quest for salt. It's not nothing. We're fortunate to have it in such abundance that we can take it for granted and worry about getting too much of it in our diets. For most of human existence that was not the case. The material here is thorough and often fascinating, but you must have a strong interest in history if you hope to get through it. Had I tried to read it in print rather than listening to the audio book, I may not have stayed with it. It's quite thoroughly thorough, right down to ancient and modern recipes for salty foods that sound mighty revolting. The quality and style of presentation in the book is similar to Bill Bryson's, but without the humor. It's hard to believe this was written by the same guy that put together that goofy book made up of nothing but questions. "
7,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,4,"I very much enjoyed this book on world history, roled like a ball of yarn around the role salt played in this history. I think that different readers will enjoy different aspects of the book. There is something for everyone. I particularly enjoyed the sections on Chinese ancient history, on French salt production on Noirmoutier and Ile de Ré and also the perspective of how French salt taxes (gabelle) influenced the French revolution. This was interesting becuase other books stress the role of the price of bread rather than these salt taxes. Other people may be interested in the role salt played in the American Revoltion, Morton Salt Company, German and Austrian salt mines, how a lack of Scandinavian salt influenced the Vikings, hydraulic drilling and gas deposits or the numerous old recipes provided (the original ketchup, tomato ketchup, the difference betwwen the Swedish herring surströmming versus sill). I believe there is something here for everyone. The author makes the information so interesting that it fastens in your head! Well hopefully at least for awhile!"
8,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1162892-j,5,"Mark Kurlansky is a historical writer who does what one reviewer referred to as the “little-big” style of writing, that is to say, he takes something little and often overlooked and from it he spins out larger truths about society and the world. To say that he does this well would be an understatement.Salt: A World History, his fascinating history of this overlooked cooking seasoning, makes a couple very good points in its introduction. Because of its current cheapness and easy availability, we nowadays tend to forget that wars were fought, empires rose and fell, and fortunes were made and lost all on the basis of salt. Entire buildings have been constructed of salt, methods of transportation have been begun for moving salt, religious rituals around the world make use of salt, and it is the only rock we eat.Nearly everyone I’ve mentioned the book too gives me the same look. A book about salt? that look says. How could that possibly be interesting?A much drier history could be written that was more cohesive if you wished to focus on one specific element, such as the development of salt procurement technologies, replete with graphs and tables. Instead, Kurlansky has written a lively book that moves about with rapidity and brio, never bogging down in any area.While at times the author seems to suggest a little too freely that salt was the main ingredient in important historical revolutions (the American, the French, Ghandi’s in India), he does at least add this element so lacking in most other stories. If his partisanship as a salt historian has him shaking his salt cellar a little too aggressively over world events, consider it a corrective. Where he might have spent a little more time near the book’s conclusion is the environmental impacts of road salt and the increasing salinization of fresh water sources from this and due to rising sea water levels.Most of the ancient practices for salt collection, such as filling a clay jar with brine, then letting the water evaporate out, then refilling with brine until the accumulated salt filled the jar, then smashing the jar open, persisted for thousands of years. The oldest human remnants in North America are such jar shards. On a large scale, this was done with a series of artificial ponds, brine pumped into one, set to evaporate for several months, then that water pumped into another lake to be replaced with fresh brine and so on. There are also, all over the world, brine springs and large pure veins of salt in the earth.This early form of salt, irregular and large chunky crystals, impurities in the supply leading to discolorations, prone to clumping as well as oozing brine in humidity, was prized nonetheless. It often served as a means of trade and was bartered for other goods.Near Salzburg (“Salt Town”), a collapse of a mountain in the middle ages uncovered a well preserved salt miner dating back to 400 BC, completely preserved even down to his leather pouch and brightly colored fabrics. Three miners were found in total, these were known to the Romans as Gauls (“Salt people”). These celtic types spread out as far as possible, going as far as being found perfectly preserved in Asian salt mines.The Roman Empire (after defeating the Gauls and absorbing all their salt technology, their salted meat recipes, among other things) was the first peoples to declare common salt, that is, salt as a right belonging to all citizens. Most Italian cities were founded along nearby salt works. The first great Roman road, the Via Saleria has a name that might give it a clue as to what was behind its construction.Salt was such an important part of Roman culture that two rather popular words in English still used today date from their original usage. The etymology of the word “salary” comes from the Romans paying their men in salt. To pay the large Roman army on the nearly continual German campaigns, generals would often set up salt evaporation ponds. Roman salt works lasted for centuries, some of them being taken over by the French monarchy and used in the 1300s.Likewise, the origin of the word “salad” is from the Roman habit of salting their green vegetables to moderate the bitter taste, the word meaning “salted.” That one still buys canned green beans among other vegetables with salt already added is a testament to our tastes having long roots.Later Venetian city state power was built on salt. Merchants there realized that selling and trading salt was actually more profitable than salt harvesting, and thus outsourced the salt production to Indians and Chinese and others. All imported salt supplied by Venice had to pass through the government for regulation, taxation, etc. As the money came rolling in, the Venetians had to expand their buying and their navy sailed farther and farther afield. The Venetian navy doubled as a military force and would police the Mediterranean, seizing ships and searching them for illegal salt transportation. Perhaps their most famous traveler would be Marco Polo who traveled along the Silk Road and met Kubla Khan.Fish itself became a Friday food because of the Catholic Church’s expansion of “fast days” on which one was also supposed to abstain from sex. Red meat was seen as a “hot meat” and thus had sexual connotations, while aquatic meat were considered “cool” and thus unlikely to provoke salacious thinking. The legal penalty for eating meat on Friday in England was hanging and this law stood on the books until King Henry VIII broke with the Catholic Church.In the American Revolution, salt would come to play am important role. With the supply of Liverpool salt obviously cut off, the very first patent issued in the United States was for a refinement on salt production. Several battles engaged in by George Washington were to secure and hold the American salt production locales and supplies. Several measures were passed by the Continental Congress advocating salt production in each colony. Pamphlets were published and distributed freely among the colonists for bay salt production. Exemptions were offered to salt works letting their workers out of military service; New Jersey would allow each facility to exempt up to ten men.This importance extended itself in history through the American Civil War as well. Secession exposed the South’s desperate lack of salt works. The Union blockade from England was designed to prevent the importation of Liverpool salt through the port of New Orleans. An army essentially could not subsist without salted meat which prevented spoilage and allowed for long marches. Wherever they marched, Union armies attacked Confederate salt works and when captured, they destroyed them. When the Confederates captured (or retook) a salt works, they celebrated. This shortage of salt is best demonstrated when Lee surrendered to Grant. As part of terms, he asked the conquering general for food, stating that his soldiers hadn’t eaten in two days.Prior to the Civil War and just after the American Revolution, the Erie Canal’s backers and the surveyor who pushed the idea, presenting it first to President Thomas Jefferson then later to New York business interests after Jefferson denied them, were salt manufacturers. It was eventually built and one of its main products shipped was salt. The Trans-Ohio Canal from the Ohio River to Cleveland carried nothing but salt.Nearby a ten-mile stretch of the Kanawha River through what is now West Virginia managed to set up the best salt works in America, giving the earlier established Onedega salt works in New York a run for its money. Cincinnati grew as a city, grew from salt pork due to Ohio grown hogs and Kanawha salt. Eventually, the Kanawha salt makers were crushed by the New York Onedega salt works’ friends in government who passed laws making it harder for the Virginia firm to compete.Back overseas, The British East India Company’s salt policy, featuring the usual bad elements such as high taxes and a brutal enforcement policy, prohibitions on salt production at one point (when the Indian salt works produces cheaper salt than Liverpool), and a deaf ear to poverty, eventually got noticed by a small fellow named Ghandi. His salt campaign was launched through the India National Congress. He marched to the Indian Ocean with 78 followers (the number rising to thousands) and after a ritual purification, he waded to the shore and scooped up a large crystal of salt, thus breaking the British laws. All over India, people began scooping up salt, making salt, mining salt. In that single moment, that single act, the British lost their colony for all time.Salt has always been a part of our history. Without it, health suffers; with too much of it health suffers. How much is good for you and how much is bad for you seems very particular based on where you live, your activity level, and your genetics. Kurlansky addresses this in closing, but it’s just circles. The exact formula can probably never be argued with certainty due to any number of factors playing a role, but what is without question is that salt, that simple little rock, so common today as to be given away freely at restaurants, is still important and will always be important.In the way the world works, circularly, the various colored, irregular salt crystals of the past, which were spurned when whiter, purer salt was regularized and when consistency of shape and size was prized, are now seen as artisanal salts. They have now become the expensive style salt whereas they used to be cheaper salt eaten by the poor. The coloration of the salt is merely an indication of differing kinds of dirt in the product. Pure, regular white salt crystals are now the salt of the poor. What comes around goes around."
9,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/171430-rivka,3,"While certainly an interesting and often entertaining read, with many historic details I had never heard before, this book is seriously flawed in several ways.It has a bibliography, but no footnotes or endnotes. Given that on those subjects that I had detailed pre-knowledge, I found details that were misinterpreted, glossed over, or just plain wrong, I can only assume the same is true for the subjects I didn't know about before reading this book. But without detailed endnotes (which a book of this sort really ought to have), I would have to guess which of the many books in the bibliography is the source of any given fact or factoid. Plus there's every reason to believe some were pieced together by the author from multiple sources -- or pieced together of whole cloth.The book lacks a general organizing principle. Are we traveling through time, era by era? Through the globe, region by region? Or perhaps it's time for a (grossly oversimplified and sometimes flat-out wrong) chemistry lesson? It never quite decides. Nor can it decide what its theme or focus should be. History? Politics? Geography? Certainly not chemistry. Maybe cooking?3 stars means ""I liked it"", and that's about right. Mostly, I did. But that's despite its myriad flaws, certainly not because of them."
10,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2325917-elana,1," AIYIYI... I just couldn't take this book. I was determined to read it after I chose it for a challenge I had entered but my goodness was it a struggle. I don't know if it was because I had just finished a textbook size of a book that was purely about science (A Short History of Nearly Everything) and was in major fiction withdrawal, or the fact that this book was breathtakingly boring, but I could literally not read more than 15 pages before I actually started to drift off into a deep slumber. I had to think about and plan out times where I would be awake enough to read. I had to get multiple nights of decent amounts of sleep before I could continue on my huge undertaking of reading more than 20 pages.  It was as if Kurlansky was intentionally aiming for the reader to not give a rats a** about salt. For the reader to actually not want to learn anything further about something that kinda seemed interesting at the time. The information Kurlansky gave me was so irrelevant and uninteresting I found myself having to reread lines over and over and still not be able to understand what the significance of it being there was.   I was really excited to read Salt: A World History because I thought it would be an unique experience to read about a topic that most people take for granted. To learn some new and interesting things about a topic that is very rarely a point of conversation. But what I found was what I thought the stereotype of books about random specific topics would be like. Completely and totally uninteresting and boring. Just because a book is non-fiction and about salt doesn't mean the writing as to be blander than an instruction manual on how to put together a flash light."

I had an entire dialog in my head about it. How did you organize this book? Does each section have a main concept or idea? Does every chapter and/or paragraph help move towards this idea? Can you find any that don't? Let's read through some of these paragraphs together and you can tell me where you think something might be tangential to the main idea.This book meanders. It shares an interesting perspective on history based on one trading commodity, but sections, paragraphs, and even sentences within paragraphs will go off on a somewhat related topic and then return to the original topic as though it hadn't even left. One memorable example of this: I read a paragraph about the Egyptians making salt that, in the middle, incorporated a sentence about their trade with the Phoenicians, and then the next sentences finished the explanation salt making. Some might like their nonfiction to take the scenic route to every idea; I discovered through this book that I am not one of those people."

I'm settling on ""I liked it"" (3-star) for the overall book.It's a bit scattered in it's formatting. There is salt through the ages, salt through cultures, salt through countries. A lot of the information is overlapping and repeated. It may have been an idea to have a chapter on the similar aspects of salt through the ages before going through the ages and then not repeating information in each age. If that makes sense. Same goes with salting fish. Whether it's cod, anchovies, herring or any other fish, the salting process is the same. We don't need to hear it for every fish variety. That put aside, though, this book is chock full of interesting information on salt, salt mining, recipes (these are quite entertaining), politics, salt usage and salt adages. It's a fascinating subject and I did enjoy the entire book. It's not the story or the information that takes away from this book, it's the way it's put together.Page 339: The Great Hedge of India is mentioned. An interesting, travelogue book on this hedge is The Great Hedge of India: The Search for the Living Barrier that Divided a People. I recommend this book. "
13,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1092824-leila,1,I think this book should have been called Salt: It's Dry.

The book is a curate’s egg—there are dull parts but there are also some very interesting parts. I didn't think it possible to have someone talk about salt for 13 hours and 43 minutes but it was.The book begins with facts about salt and the sharing of some of the salt industry’s 14,000 uses for salt. It was interesting to learn that the salt in the human body is equivalent to what would be found in 3 or 4 salt shakers.The early history of salt was only slightly interesting but as the history moved to Europe, you learn how everyday words had their origin with salt—such as salary and town names in England ending in “wich” have salt-related origins.The best part of the book for me was the role it played in U.S. history (as that is what I like to read about most). I did not realize the strategic importance of salt, especially during the Civil War. My favorite passage from the book was actually a quote from General William Tecumseh Sherman in August 1862. He stated, “Salt is eminently contraband because of its use in curing meats without which armies cannot be subsisted.” In all my readings of U.S. history and the Civil War, I've never come across a discussion of the importance of salt. This was eye-opening.It was a slow, dry book but one that definitely imparts knowledge."

I cannot tell you how many times I picked up and put down this book in stores across the nation.... maybe that should have been my sign.Don't boo me, but this was dry. There were sections that were legitimately interesting, but there were sections that just needed more editing, they needed to be trimmed down. Also, I dont know how I would personally fix this, but the layout of the book seemed to need changed. It was largely geographically based, so then large sections felt very redundant, afterall there is not so much difference between salting anchovies, or cod, or herring. Perhaps if the sections had been: preservation, tax, wars.... then we could have saved some of the parts that seemed to be rehashed.Still, I learned a good deal of fascinating information, but I also often found myself too hungry to be rapt and craving salty, tasty foods."

I mean, it has to be pretty bad for you to actually notice that a book is really poorly written. Chapters would end out of nowhere, there were tons of non-sequiturs, etc. It got progressively worse as I got through the book- and then towards the end it became an advertisement for Mortons Salt.

Whether it's salt (this one), cod (1988), oysters (2005), or the Basques (1991)...well, okay. A history of the Basques sounds like it has some potential.My point is: Kurlansky seems to look around for the driest subjects and then to begin to research the heck out of it. And yes, he really does look like the Dos Equis man. ""Stay thirsty, my friend."" Mark Kurlansky[/caption]And let me tell you, reading 
Salt: A World History
 made me thirsty. And hungry. Between examining the long and storied history of salt over the millennia, Kurlansky peppers the text with recipes in which sodium chloride plays a major, if not crucial, ingredient. Here we see pickling, preservation, and flavoring, and yet, we should not think that Salt: A World History is aimed at the culinary inclined. Kurlansky looks at geography, the rise of civilizations, and the placement of forts. His book is fascinating, including all sorts of salt-related trivia, from the beginnings of Tabasco Sauce to a scheme to introduce camels in the American west's deserts to how salt came to be both common and perfectly granulated. From the location of Roman military depots near salt deposits to the role a shortage in salt played in bringing about the end of the American Civil War, Kurlansky is all over the map.However, if there is a critique to be made, then it is this all-over-the-map-ness that seems to typify Kurlansky's style. Running from ancient to modern times, Kurlansky doesn't seem to follow a single cohesive narrative, with sections starting and stopping without apparent reason or cohesion. It doesn't detract from the value of the information, but Salt: A World History does make for an occasional dry and eclectic read."
18,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/349264-tracey,4,"Previously read Sept 2003 - Checked this out from the library on the recommendation of Carla IreneThe title is pretty self-explanatory: the book discusses how salt was accessed, processed, sold and used from ancient times through today. I was pleased to see non-European cultures were included - especially since China and India have had such a rich history entwined with this essential mineral. However, I would have liked to see more info about North & South America and sub-Saharan Africa, and I don't remember anything about Australia at all. The book itself is very readable - covering both some more technical aspects of collecting and refining salt, as well as giving recipes and discussing the economic aspects. While I'm sure most people know that the word ""salary"" comes from the Latin for salt, I didn't realize that in pre-industrial times, if a nation started buying huge amounts of salt, that was a possible indication that they were going to war, as all the rations for the soldiers would need to be preserved. I learned quite a bit about Italian and Chinese history & culture that I didn't know before - and I never realized that salt was one of the main reasons for India's revolt against England. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in an overview of history (with a twist) and plan to read more books by Mr. Kurlansky. "

The first two thirds were very informative and interesting, but it wasn't until I got to the section about India that I was totally enthralled. The story of how Ghandi used the British imposed salt laws, and his disobedience of them, to gain freedom for his country was truly riveting. I can't help but draw parallels between this story and other moments in history. It's long been a fact that civic rebellion follows punitive costs associated with the fundamental materials of life. The tea tax in the American colonies, poll taxes, whiskey taxes. I'm sure an economics historian or a political scientist could find many more relevant examples than I can. Now we find ourselves entering into a similar scenario with the crippling price of gasoline. The present rise in the cost of gas isn't because of taxes entirely, although they do play a significant role in certain states such as California. Our current predicament with fuel prices can't be laid at the feet of government because the government is not in control, big business is. Which represents a whole different problem. What really rises to the surface in book like this is the same old ancient story: yet another example of those in power screw those who aren't to the wall. "

Sure, human population didn't really take off until we started staying put in one place and domesticating animals and crops, but what do you think preserved those food staples? Salt! Salt didn't just play a role with how we preserve food, but entire wars and civilizations rose and fell due (in part) to their hold on salt. Seriously! Venice became a huge European powerhouse in the middle ages because of their saltworks, and I learned that salt even played a part in the American Civil War (all the good salt production was in the north, so the south had to ship it in). Sure, Mr. Kurlansky might have overly emphasized salt's role on occasion, but that didn't detract from the book one iota. Oh! One more tidbit: Everyone's heard of Ghandi's pacifistic march across India, but did you know Ghandi was marching in protest of severe British salt restrictions? Really!

The writing is OK, Kurlanky has energy, but he attacked this work of non-fiction with no clear agenda. If there's a thesis beyond ""salt is important,"" Kurlansky fails to articulate it. If there's a logic to how this book is organized, that's not clear either. Chapters don't seem to be chronological or geographical, and they don't build to form a broad picture or gradually make an argument. As I was jolted from one fascinating anecdote to another, I gradually grew angry with ""Salt."" How can someone with so much writing ability and so much research put it all between two hard covers and not try to make anything big or important out of the whole deal?"

A friend asked me what I was listening oo while listening to this one and they thought it sounded like an absurd thing to read about. I'm inclined to believe that many people might turn away from this book based on that fact, but I found it to be chalked full of so many interesting facts from some of the earliest history.I found all the information presented in the book a little overwhelming at times and I do believe I would have given it 5 stars had I read it more slowly and allowed the information to settle between reads. I will be sure to read it at a later date for that reason.This is a thoroughly entertaining read!

27,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,4,"This book does exactly what it says: examines salt around the world in historical context. I have learned quite a bit about the taxation of salt invented in imperial China, and abolished as people’s dissatisfaction resulted in revolts; then invariably reinstated by the new regime as they needed money. Venice gained Mediterranian supremacy largely based on controlling the salt trade, and lost it when trade shifted to the Atlantic and cheaper British salt became available. Ghandi in India made the oppressive British salt laws the center of his campaign for freedom. A large part of the book is dedicated to the uses of salt. We are treated to a history of salted condiments, salted fish, pickles, olives, soy sauce, etc. This is accompanied by multiple recipes, a little too many for my liking. It bogged down in the middle when there was way too much about salting fish and how salt fish was used all over Europe in people’s diets. Reminded me a bit of Moby Dick and the interminable whale parts, uses of whale, catching of whale, whale equipment, etc. Thankfully it recovered and there was more history again in the last third of the book, which is where my interest lies.There were numerous interesting tidbits: how Morton became the biggest salt provider of the world, and how salt, once a valued property of the rich, have become the world’s cheapest commodity. The quality of salt has also done a turnaround: while throughout history the purer and more uniform the salt was, the more valuable; now when commercial salt is all uniform and white, “artisan” salts of various crystals and discolorations (mostly due to dirt) fetch a high price as more “natural”. I was listening, and Scott Brick’s narration was good. I am not sure if I have finished it if I was reading, as the mid section felt a bit draggy, but I am glad I did."

Well, it's both. There were parts that I skimmed over and parts that made me share them immediately. I would want to stop reading then would come to a part about either a place I've visited or a know about from some reason or other, and then I'd be drawn back into the book. I learned a lot, that's for sure. The part dealing with chemistry interested me a great deal. I was surprised by that as I'm not a very scientific person. That being said, I'll admit I was very interested in the book Mauve, which was about organic chemistry. Anyway, if you want to learn lots of facts about salt, read about place all around the world, learn about commerce, industry and rebellion, this is the book for you. Just know that there's a lot that you'll probably skim over - like the many recipes from antiquity for food preparations using salt. I'd love to know what you think of this, if you read it."

30,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"Salt is sexy— really! Think about it: it’s in just about every bodily fluid (wink) and it has shaped human history like almost nothing else. This book covers it all—from 100AD (when ancient Chinese lit up natural gas coming out of brine-water wells to pump out the brine through bamboo tubes into boiling houses to boil the water off the salt), to Venice’s saltworks, to the French Revolution (where the salt tax, known as the gabelle, was a major point of contention), to the American Revolution and Civil War, and to the salt-fueled Indian revolution led by Gandhi. It's not the best microhistory I've ever read, but it was pretty interesting to think about the humble salt's impact on human history in a way you don't usually stop to consider.It was pretty interesting to see how Kurlansky’s interests intersect—the topic of his other books Cod and the Basques are closely related to salt, and feature heavily in one chapter of the book. This book also contains the fun fact that “to sail the seven seas” refers not to seven separate seas, but to a place called the Seven Seas, which was between Venice and the Mainland (before the coastline changed). (Further research indicates this is one of several possible origins for the phrase, but interesting nonetheless). And I’ve added the Polish Wieliczka salt mine to my travel list—an entire underground chapel carved from salt, and a band started almost two hundred years ago to take advantage of the mine’s acoustics, still performing today! But the most astonishing thing, for me, is how many words, place names, and even names of entire cultures come from the word for salt. Some examples:—salacious (salt has long been associated with lewdness). —salary (this one is pretty well known already—Roman soldiers were paid in salt)—soldier (the Latin “sal” became the French “solde” meaning “pay” for the same reasons as “salary”—solde became soldier, the one who is paid)—salad (Romans salted their greens to reduce bitterness)—salsa (Spanish word for sauce comes from Latin for salt) —possible “Gauls” (as in, the Celtic group in France and other parts of Europe)—the Germany city of Halle, Austrian Hallein and Hallstatt, and Spanish Galicia —in France, a menstruating woman is said to be “en salaison” (curing in salt) —Alsace (border of France and Germany) means “land of salt” (als, meaning land, and sel, salt)—Selle Valley of Lorraine —the Romance words for cheese (formaggio, fromage) comes from the wooden cheese mold used to shape and age cheese . . . in salt—anything with the ending “wich,” which was Anglo Saxon for “saltworks.” For instance, a town in Cheshire County, England used to be known by its Celtic name, Hellath du (“black pit,” for the dark salt acquired there), which is the most Lord of the Rings name ever. But it was later renamed “Northwich”—northern saltworks. —Because wich = saltworks, “sandwich” ultimately derives from salt."

Of course it's my own fault for imagining a book this long about salt could be engaging. Nonetheless there were some interesting factoids I collected. There were fights centuries ago in England when people's land started caving in when salt brine was extracted from subterranean levels. At the time if I got this right, people actually retained the rights to what was under their land. But the salt exploiters claimed that extracting the brine helped the local economy. So what if huge sinkholes started appearing everywhere. Now I know there had to be geologists and engineers warning oil companies that fracking was problematic.Of course salt led to wars. An excellent example is Gandhi and the Salt Marsh protests in 1930 which led to protests again British rule, but was started over battles over the rights to collect salt.http://www.history.com/topics/salt-marchThis is a book that would appeal to some history buffs as well as those interested in who has the right to exploit natural resources.

The structure is too much of an incohesive infodump to make the book compelling and the author does very little to make the material engaging and relevant to the reader. There are some short parts, mostly in the last third, that are fairly interesting, but this feels more like dumb luck than good writing. It feels like, rather than carefully curating which topics and subtopics would be interesting to his audience, the author simply took all the random facts and information about salt he could possibly find, flung them into one book, and decided to call it a day.

However, more than once I glazed over and found myself thinking about things other than salt. Like how thirsty I was. Or do we have potato chips in the house? Oh, maybe we have tequila and lime! And so on down the rabbit hole. It turns out that salt taxation details, mining methods, and in depth brining and curing techniques throughout history aren't as riveting as one would think.

I fell asleep a countless number of times, so if you're having trouble falling asleep... maybe this is worth a read.It seems Kurlansky is trying to show all the different uses of salt and how it evolved through time. Sure, there are many uses I didn't know of, but all in all, not 400+ pages worth. Also, Kurlansky writes about the importance of salt and its impact on the world we live in today. There is no doubt salt was super important, but the story was repetitive. Most of the chapters described the world region, the process they used to create salt, and the type of food they salted.My favorite part of the book was when Kurlansky wrote about the sinkholes caused by too much brine extraction in England. There are a few other good parts of the book, but I would not recommend reading this unless you are really interested in salt.In conclusion, I learned a lot about salt, but felt like the chapters read the same.

Salt is a necessary component to functioning, makes ice cream freeze, removes rust, makes things taste good, seals cracks, removes spots on coals, preserves food, puts out grease fires, treats sore throats, and ear aches. The average adult human being has about three or four salt shaker in her body! My friend Clare actually actually snacks on sea salt because she finds it satisfies her craving without having to eat heavy junk foods. A substance so valuable, salt served as money, influenced trade routes, inspired wars. Without taking away the power of salt, the same could also be said about different foods, including beer, which I actually enjoyed reading the history of. (See my Fermenting Revolution review)On the other hand, my friend, who can stomach more hardcore history than I, enjoyed me reading to him aloud from Salt. Also, my uncle gives many kudos to the book Cod by the same author--Someday I may get a craving to explore some of these choice jems of chapters, like maybe Nordic salt dreams (which includes recipes), and American salt wars, but for now I am in search of food writing with better narrative flow--"

And I learned many fun facts that I had not previously known: i.e. where the term ""red herring"" comes from, how soy sauce is made, where Tabasco sauce comes from, etc. Also, I did enjoy the author's clever trick of including many old-timey ""salt"" recipes. Not that I'll ever attempt to make any of these recipes, but I bet that the food connoisseurs who read this book will.However, I felt that, around 200 or so pages into this book, it devolved into an awful lot of ""and they made salted fish"" and/or ""and they taxed salt."" Zzzzzzzz. I read a lot of non-fiction. I have a high tolerance for seemingly tedious detail. But seriously, how much detailed explanation of the taxation of salt in 18th century France is one person supposed to endure before falling into a coma?Also, I realize that the author was pushing a very specific agenda here, but if he's to be believed, nearly every major conflict in the history of the world started out as a salt dispute.

48,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45596235-frank-theising,2,"Some interesting material buried within, but overall probably twice as long as it needed to be. I think the casual reader will get bored with this book very quickly. For those with a deeper interest in human history, it is interesting to reflect on how salt played such a crucial role in the development and success (or failure) of various civilizations, business enterprises, and human health over the centuries. Overall, the author really tries to make his subject interesting, but there is only so much you can do with a book centered on a commodity as basic as salt. 2 stars.What follows are a few notes on the content of the book:The book includes a lot of interesting factoids like the incredibly large number of places and things that derive their names from salt (soldier, salad, Salzburg, salary, any English settlement ending in “-wich”, etc.) and lengthy descriptions of the various methods (both ancient and modern) for producing or mass-producing salt in geographically diverse locations around the world. It also includes an excessive number of lists of the items salt makes possible (butter, soy sauce, cheese, gunpowder, caviar, etc etc) and tedious descriptions of ancient recipes that used salt or some derivative (Garum, Brine, etc).Salt is obviously still used a great deal today, but it played a much larger role throughout history prior to widespread use of flash freezing, refrigeration, and canning. Its use in preservation of food and meat (especially salted meats and fish) and later use in the creation of gunpowder, made it an essential commodity, critical to the success and expansion of a number of civilizations from Ancient Egypt and the Chinese Dynasties to the Roman and the British Empires. It was so crucial that many countries feared dependence on “foreign salt” the way America feared dependence on “foreign oil” in the latter half of the 20th Century. Its relative abundance or lack thereof, shaped the outcome of a number of wars and crises including the American and French Revolutions, the U.S. Civil War, and Gandhi’s Indian independence movement. It was often run by state monopoly or heavily taxed to fund government and wars. Salted fish in particular generated a significant amount of global trade and became a prime source of protein for Europe (especially during frequent Holy Days that required abstention from meat).Modern processes have resulted in consistently uniform, white crystals which historically were difficult to produce and prized above less pure salt (which was colored in various shades depending on what impurities from other substances were in it). I did find it odd that the author didn’t even mention iodized salt until nearly the end of the book, and then only in the context of the modern faddish appeal of various colored salts that were historically considered sub-par. He omits any real discussion of Iodine being such an essential element for human health and how adding it to salt was one of the most brilliant and effective public health measures in history (up there with putting fluoride in drinking water). He covers at length the rise of the Morton Salt Company near the end of the book."

If you have ever wondered about the little shaker on your table or wanted to see why salt is the only rock we eat this book will tell you. One of the things I liked best was the inclusion of historical recipes from different cultures and time periods reflecting how the usage of salt has changed through the centuries. It often includes the histories of famous salted things from the Roman garum (the very distant progenitor of ketchup), to kosher lox, to butter. I also enjoyed learning how salt went from necessity to luxury as supply and demand changed. Most of the modern salt production is no longer made for food, and much has been homogenized into uniform salt crystals controlled by two huge companies. This evolution allowed mass consumers to always get an expected product but also created a niche marked for things like my beloved kosher salt, and the various traditional and sea salts you can now buy at the super food-mart.It is a history book but even non-historians like myself with any interest in salt will enjoy this book."

53,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43651738-sabrina-godin,4,"Throughout history, the common household mineral, salt, was obtained for usages from food to religious beliefs to archeological discoveries. Within Mark Kurlansky’s book, Salt: A World of History, he provides specific present and past examples of how salt shaped the course of civilizations. In each chapter, Kurlansky focuses on a certain area where salt was excavated, processed, and how it was used. To specify relatable instances, he writes in recipes from ancient cookbooks and chiefs. Even though salt was mainly used for food, Kurlansky provides examples of how salt influenced religious beliefs and patriarchy in certain societies. To show evidence that salt is still a major factor in present day societies, he also writes about archeological discoveries, which were made possible from the preservation of salt. In addition, he writes about the current state of the Dead Sea and the how the company Morton Salt came to be. Even though Mark Kurlansky supplies the reader with specific and interesting evidence of salt, the book seems as if it would never end. Chapters seemed to continue on and recipes seem to be “cooking up” every five pages. The way that Kurlansky writes, he brings the civilizations alive, and with each chapter they evolve within the book. One example is women. He starts of with the women having a little influence in the preservation of salt, but as the book goes on they are the ones preserving. The same goes with the civilizations obtaining the salt. Each society starts off with workers scraping away the salt, however, by the end of the book, there are salt works with hundreds of workers. By the end of the book, the reader has learned about how salt has become a leading mineral in the world and every way possible it can be retrieved. Kurlansky makes sure that the reader knows the whole history of salt, which the title of the book implies. As a whole, Mark Kurlansky tells a non-fiction story of how salt changed the world, but it could have been done in less than for hundred and forty-nine pages. Even though salt’s importance seems to resemble the size of it’s gains, it has played a major role in the course of man. In Salt: A World of History, Mark Kurlansky tells how salt started as just ingredient to make brines, and later turned into a leading product of the world. Within in his book, Kurlansky tells how salt effect civilization such as the Byzantine Empire, Rome, and Ancient Chinese Dynasties. In each of these civilizations, salt was a key factor that allowed the empires to rise to their potential. Besides the civilizations, it also affected the people within them. Both men and women worked with salt, and it was main element in their daily lives. While Kurlansky mainly focused on past influences of salt, he found a way to tie it together with present day. In daily household, there is usually a container of salt to be found, which is produced by Morton. Kurlansky provides the history about this company, so the reader can relate it to their daily life. While the history of salt, seems long and unimportant, some of it needs to be noticed. The Dead Sea, being one of the most unique bodies of water on Earth, is slowly disappearing. This is because of the constant problem of pollution. By reading Kurlansky’s book, the reader can feel his passion for the mineral. Other writers sometimes have trouble bringing their non-fiction book alive with their emotions, but he didn’t have that problem. After reading his book, the reader may be inspired to read many of his other. Although the information in Mark Kurlansky’s book seems to have a little importance in the reader’s daily life, if he or she looks past it all, it’s a non-fiction book that can change his or her life.

When you first hear the title of this book, one's first reaction is generally to chuckle because, let's be serious, what is there to the history of salt? It's just a mineral!Well, Kurlansky tells us that there is a lot to the history of salt and that our lives and history are intricately tied to the location and usage of salt in society. I learned a great deal in this book, and not just about salt (the chapter on how to make soy sauce and garum is fascinating). The best part of this book is the way Kurlansky tells us about salt - he is clearly very passionate about this topic, and he goes into create detail in the history, chemical, and nature of salt. Sure, sometimes he's a little goofy (he, only somewhat seriously, suggests a link to the Confederates losing to a salt crisis), but little vignettes like that are what make this book. I would highly recommend this book. I found myself talking about its contents at parties, and most people seemed fascinated. For something we use everyday without a second though, there is quite a bit of history behind this tasty mineral. Also for nonfiction, this book is easy to read and fun. I think most people could read this book without too much difficulty and find themselves a little happier and more knowledgeable by the end of it."

On page 4 of the introduction, there is an engraving dating from 1157 of a bunch of women holding down a partially disrobed man titled ""Women Salting Their Husbands"". ""With this salting, front and back, At last strong natures they will not lack."" OK, I was hooked. (Thankfully, I've been able to avoid being salted myself so far.)You can open this book on almost any page and find something interesting. I just opened to page 111...""Fresh whale meat was also for the rich. The great delicacy was the tongue. Salted tongue of any kind was appreciated, but especially whale tongue. For the poor, there was craspois, also called craspoix, or grapois. This was strips of the fattier parts of the whale, salt cured like bacon and sometimes called in French lard de careme, which translates as 'lent blubber'...""All kinds of stuff like that. An easy and entertaining read."

I really appreciate that Kurlansky did not forget about the non-Western world in writing about this book (although there is rather more about American salt practices than most other countries--unsurprising, given Kurlansky's language, previous books, and nationality). My only criticism of this book is that it has a tendency toward anecdotes rather than data, especially toward the end. There are no sum-ups or final conclusions drawn in the last few chapters, just a tossed salad of all the random tidbits the author hadn't managed to fit in elsewhere. Still, incredible stuff! Even reading just a few pages of this book will give you material for days' worth of small talk."
60,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"Salt is sexy— really! Think about it: it’s in just about every bodily fluid (wink) and it has shaped human history like almost nothing else. This book covers it all—from 100AD (when ancient Chinese lit up natural gas coming out of brine-water wells to pump out the brine through bamboo tubes into boiling houses to boil the water off the salt), to Venice’s saltworks, to the French Revolution (where the salt tax, known as the gabelle, was a major point of contention), to the American Revolution and Civil War, and to the salt-fueled Indian revolution led by Gandhi. It's not the best microhistory I've ever read, but it was pretty interesting to think about the humble salt's impact on human history in a way you don't usually stop to consider.It was pretty interesting to see how Kurlansky’s interests intersect—the topic of his other books Cod and the Basques are closely related to salt, and feature heavily in one chapter of the book. This book also contains the fun fact that “to sail the seven seas” refers not to seven separate seas, but to a place called the Seven Seas, which was between Venice and the Mainland (before the coastline changed). (Further research indicates this is one of several possible origins for the phrase, but interesting nonetheless). And I’ve added the Polish Wieliczka salt mine to my travel list—an entire underground chapel carved from salt, and a band started almost two hundred years ago to take advantage of the mine’s acoustics, still performing today! But the most astonishing thing, for me, is how many words, place names, and even names of entire cultures come from the word for salt. Some examples:—salacious (salt has long been associated with lewdness). —salary (this one is pretty well known already—Roman soldiers were paid in salt)—soldier (the Latin “sal” became the French “solde” meaning “pay” for the same reasons as “salary”—solde became soldier, the one who is paid)—salad (Romans salted their greens to reduce bitterness)—salsa (Spanish word for sauce comes from Latin for salt) —possible “Gauls” (as in, the Celtic group in France and other parts of Europe)—the Germany city of Halle, Austrian Hallein and Hallstatt, and Spanish Galicia —in France, a menstruating woman is said to be “en salaison” (curing in salt) —Alsace (border of France and Germany) means “land of salt” (als, meaning land, and sel, salt)—Selle Valley of Lorraine —the Romance words for cheese (formaggio, fromage) comes from the wooden cheese mold used to shape and age cheese . . . in salt—anything with the ending “wich,” which was Anglo Saxon for “saltworks.” For instance, a town in Cheshire County, England used to be known by its Celtic name, Hellath du (“black pit,” for the dark salt acquired there), which is the most Lord of the Rings name ever. But it was later renamed “Northwich”—northern saltworks. —Because wich = saltworks, “sandwich” ultimately derives from salt."
61,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2220787-ram,4,"The book is about the history of salt and salt manufacturing, and actually is the history of the world as seen from the salt perspective.I learned many interesting facts about this commodity that we so take for granted in the modern world.Salt has effected so many famous people: Marco Polo, Gandhi, George Washington.Salt production, salt chemistry and salt mining is the basis for thousands of modern and less modern products we use from Liquid bleach, Tabasco sauce, Parmigiano-Reggiano and many more.The salt tax in India pushed Gandhi to start the passive rebellion that helped lead to independence.Marco Polo discovered sophisticated salt industry in China.The war George Washington led for independence from England was partly incited by salt shortages.All the towns in England that end with ""wich"" produced saltSalzburg is ""salt town"" and Alsace is ""land of salt""So….

Of course it's my own fault for imagining a book this long about salt could be engaging. Nonetheless there were some interesting factoids I collected. There were fights centuries ago in England when people's land started caving in when salt brine was extracted from subterranean levels. At the time if I got this right, people actually retained the rights to what was under their land. But the salt exploiters claimed that extracting the brine helped the local economy. So what if huge sinkholes started appearing everywhere. Now I know there had to be geologists and engineers warning oil companies that fracking was problematic.Of course salt led to wars. An excellent example is Gandhi and the Salt Marsh protests in 1930 which led to protests again British rule, but was started over battles over the rights to collect salt.http://www.history.com/topics/salt-marchThis is a book that would appeal to some history buffs as well as those interested in who has the right to exploit natural resources.

The structure is too much of an incohesive infodump to make the book compelling and the author does very little to make the material engaging and relevant to the reader. There are some short parts, mostly in the last third, that are fairly interesting, but this feels more like dumb luck than good writing. It feels like, rather than carefully curating which topics and subtopics would be interesting to his audience, the author simply took all the random facts and information about salt he could possibly find, flung them into one book, and decided to call it a day.

And so on down the rabbit hole. It turns out that salt taxation details, mining methods, and in depth brining and curing techniques throughout history aren't as riveting as one would think.

I fell asleep a countless number of times, so if you're having trouble falling asleep... maybe this is worth a read.It seems Kurlansky is trying to show all the different uses of salt and how it evolved through time. Sure, there are many uses I didn't know of, but all in all, not 400+ pages worth. Also, Kurlansky writes about the importance of salt and its impact on the world we live in today. There is no doubt salt was super important, but the story was repetitive. Most of the chapters described the world region, the process they used to create salt, and the type of food they salted.My favorite part of the book was when Kurlansky wrote about the sinkholes caused by too much brine extraction in England. There are a few other good parts of the book, but I would not recommend reading this unless you are really interested in salt.In conclusion, I learned a lot about salt, but felt like the chapters read the same.

Salt is a necessary component to functioning, makes ice cream freeze, removes rust, makes things taste good, seals cracks, removes spots on coals, preserves food, puts out grease fires, treats sore throats, and ear aches. The average adult human being has about three or four salt shaker in her body! My friend Clare actually actually snacks on sea salt because she finds it satisfies her craving without having to eat heavy junk foods. A substance so valuable, salt served as money, influenced trade routes, inspired wars. Without taking away the power of salt, the same could also be said about different foods, including beer, which I actually enjoyed reading the history of. (See my Fermenting Revolution review)On the other hand, my friend, who can stomach more hardcore history than I, enjoyed me reading to him aloud from Salt. Also, my uncle gives many kudos to the book Cod by the same author--Someday I may get a craving to explore some of these choice jems of chapters, like maybe Nordic salt dreams (which includes recipes), and American salt wars, but for now I am in search of food writing with better narrative flow--"

And I learned many fun facts that I had not previously known: i.e. where the term ""red herring"" comes from, how soy sauce is made, where Tabasco sauce comes from, etc. Also, I did enjoy the author's clever trick of including many old-timey ""salt"" recipes. Not that I'll ever attempt to make any of these recipes, but I bet that the food connoisseurs who read this book will.However, I felt that, around 200 or so pages into this book, it devolved into an awful lot of ""and they made salted fish"" and/or ""and they taxed salt."" Zzzzzzzz. I read a lot of non-fiction. I have a high tolerance for seemingly tedious detail. But seriously, how much detailed explanation of the taxation of salt in 18th century France is one person supposed to endure before falling into a coma?Also, I realize that the author was pushing a very specific agenda here, but if he's to be believed, nearly every major conflict in the history of the world started out as a salt dispute.

Overall, the author really tries to make his subject interesting, but there is only so much you can do with a book centered on a commodity as basic as salt. 2 stars.What follows are a few notes on the content of the book:The book includes a lot of interesting factoids like the incredibly large number of places and things that derive their names from salt (soldier, salad, Salzburg, salary, any English settlement ending in “-wich”, etc.) and lengthy descriptions of the various methods (both ancient and modern) for producing or mass-producing salt in geographically diverse locations around the world. It also includes an excessive number of lists of the items salt makes possible (butter, soy sauce, cheese, gunpowder, caviar, etc etc) and tedious descriptions of ancient recipes that used salt or some derivative (Garum, Brine, etc).Salt is obviously still used a great deal today, but it played a much larger role throughout history prior to widespread use of flash freezing, refrigeration, and canning. Its use in preservation of food and meat (especially salted meats and fish) and later use in the creation of gunpowder, made it an essential commodity, critical to the success and expansion of a number of civilizations from Ancient Egypt and the Chinese Dynasties to the Roman and the British Empires. It was so crucial that many countries feared dependence on “foreign salt” the way America feared dependence on “foreign oil” in the latter half of the 20th Century. Its relative abundance or lack thereof, shaped the outcome of a number of wars and crises including the American and French Revolutions, the U.S. Civil War, and Gandhi’s Indian independence movement. It was often run by state monopoly or heavily taxed to fund government and wars. Salted fish in particular generated a significant amount of global trade and became a prime source of protein for Europe (especially during frequent Holy Days that required abstention from meat).Modern processes have resulted in consistently uniform, white crystals which historically were difficult to produce and prized above less pure salt (which was colored in various shades depending on what impurities from other substances were in it). I did find it odd that the author didn’t even mention iodized salt until nearly the end of the book, and then only in the context of the modern faddish appeal of various colored salts that were historically considered sub-par. He omits any real discussion of Iodine being such an essential element for human health and how adding it to salt was one of the most brilliant and effective public health measures in history (up there with putting fluoride in drinking water). He covers at length the rise of the Morton Salt Company near the end of the book."

If you have ever wondered about the little shaker on your table or wanted to see why salt is the only rock we eat this book will tell you. One of the things I liked best was the inclusion of historical recipes from different cultures and time periods reflecting how the usage of salt has changed through the centuries. It often includes the histories of famous salted things from the Roman garum (the very distant progenitor of ketchup), to kosher lox, to butter. I also enjoyed learning how salt went from necessity to luxury as supply and demand changed. Most of the modern salt production is no longer made for food, and much has been homogenized into uniform salt crystals controlled by two huge companies. This evolution allowed mass consumers to always get an expected product but also created a niche marked for things like my beloved kosher salt, and the various traditional and sea salts you can now buy at the super food-mart.It is a history book but even non-historians like myself with any interest in salt will enjoy this book."

I had nothing to do and also had no WiFi when on my month long trip to Ethiopia and could not for the life of me get through this book. It is so dry. I got through maybe four chapters and called it quits. Although, I definitely learned from the short chapters that I had read and appreciate how in-depth the author went to find as many examples as he did of the importance of salt and how it affected ancient culture and history.

Within Mark Kurlansky’s book, Salt: A World of History, he provides specific present and past examples of how salt shaped the course of civilizations. In each chapter, Kurlansky focuses on a certain area where salt was excavated, processed, and how it was used. To specify relatable instances, he writes in recipes from ancient cookbooks and chiefs. Even though salt was mainly used for food, Kurlansky provides examples of how salt influenced religious beliefs and patriarchy in certain societies. To show evidence that salt is still a major factor in present day societies, he also writes about archeological discoveries, which were made possible from the preservation of salt. In addition, he writes about the current state of the Dead Sea and the how the company Morton Salt came to be. Even though Mark Kurlansky supplies the reader with specific and interesting evidence of salt, the book seems as if it would never end. Chapters seemed to continue on and recipes seem to be “cooking up” every five pages. The way that Kurlansky writes, he brings the civilizations alive, and with each chapter they evolve within the book. One example is women. He starts of with the women having a little influence in the preservation of salt, but as the book goes on they are the ones preserving. The same goes with the civilizations obtaining the salt. Each society starts off with workers scraping away the salt, however, by the end of the book, there are salt works with hundreds of workers. By the end of the book, the reader has learned about how salt has become a leading mineral in the world and every way possible it can be retrieved. Kurlansky makes sure that the reader knows the whole history of salt, which the title of the book implies. As a whole, Mark Kurlansky tells a non-fiction story of how salt changed the world, but it could have been done in less than for hundred and forty-nine pages. Even though salt’s importance seems to resemble the size of it’s gains, it has played a major role in the course of man. In Salt: A World of History, Mark Kurlansky tells how salt started as just ingredient to make brines, and later turned into a leading product of the world. Within in his book, Kurlansky tells how salt effect civilization such as the Byzantine Empire, Rome, and Ancient Chinese Dynasties. In each of these civilizations, salt was a key factor that allowed the empires to rise to their potential. Besides the civilizations, it also affected the people within them. Both men and women worked with salt, and it was main element in their daily lives. While Kurlansky mainly focused on past influences of salt, he found a way to tie it together with present day. In daily household, there is usually a container of salt to be found, which is produced by Morton. Kurlansky provides the history about this company, so the reader can relate it to their daily life. While the history of salt, seems long and unimportant, some of it needs to be noticed. The Dead Sea, being one of the most unique bodies of water on Earth, is slowly disappearing. This is because of the constant problem of pollution. By reading Kurlansky’s book, the reader can feel his passion for the mineral. Other writers sometimes have trouble bringing their non-fiction book alive with their emotions, but he didn’t have that problem. After reading his book, the reader may be inspired to read many of his other. Although the information in Mark Kurlansky’s book seems to have a little importance in the reader’s daily life, if he or she looks past it all, it’s a non-fiction book that can change his or her life.

When you first hear the title of this book, one's first reaction is generally to chuckle because, let's be serious, what is there to the history of salt? It's just a mineral!Well, Kurlansky tells us that there is a lot to the history of salt and that our lives and history are intricately tied to the location and usage of salt in society. I learned a great deal in this book, and not just about salt (the chapter on how to make soy sauce and garum is fascinating). The best part of this book is the way Kurlansky tells us about salt - he is clearly very passionate about this topic, and he goes into create detail in the history, chemical, and nature of salt. Sure, sometimes he's a little goofy (he, only somewhat seriously, suggests a link to the Confederates losing to a salt crisis), but little vignettes like that are what make this book. I would highly recommend this book. I found myself talking about its contents at parties, and most people seemed fascinated. For something we use everyday without a second though, there is quite a bit of history behind this tasty mineral. Also for nonfiction, this book is easy to read and fun. I think most people could read this book without too much difficulty and find themselves a little happier and more knowledgeable by the end of it."

On page 4 of the introduction, there is an engraving dating from 1157 of a bunch of women holding down a partially disrobed man titled ""Women Salting Their Husbands"". ""With this salting, front and back, At last strong natures they will not lack."" OK, I was hooked. (Thankfully, I've been able to avoid being salted myself so far.)You can open this book on almost any page and find something interesting. I just opened to page 111...""Fresh whale meat was also for the rich. The great delicacy was the tongue. Salted tongue of any kind was appreciated, but especially whale tongue. For the poor, there was craspois, also called craspoix, or grapois. This was strips of the fattier parts of the whale, salt cured like bacon and sometimes called in French lard de careme, which translates as 'lent blubber'...""All kinds of stuff like that. An easy and entertaining read."

I really appreciate that Kurlansky did not forget about the non-Western world in writing about this book (although there is rather more about American salt practices than most other countries--unsurprising, given Kurlansky's language, previous books, and nationality). My only criticism of this book is that it has a tendency toward anecdotes rather than data, especially toward the end. There are no sum-ups or final conclusions drawn in the last few chapters, just a tossed salad of all the random tidbits the author hadn't managed to fit in elsewhere. Still, incredible stuff! Even reading just a few pages of this book will give you material for days' worth of small talk."
90,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"Salt is sexy— really! Think about it: it’s in just about every bodily fluid (wink) and it has shaped human history like almost nothing else. This book covers it all—from 100AD (when ancient Chinese lit up natural gas coming out of brine-water wells to pump out the brine through bamboo tubes into boiling houses to boil the water off the salt), to Venice’s saltworks, to the French Revolution (where the salt tax, known as the gabelle, was a major point of contention), to the American Revolution and Civil War, and to the salt-fueled Indian revolution led by Gandhi. It's not the best microhistory I've ever read, but it was pretty interesting to think about the humble salt's impact on human history in a way you don't usually stop to consider.It was pretty interesting to see how Kurlansky’s interests intersect—the topic of his other books Cod and the Basques are closely related to salt, and feature heavily in one chapter of the book. This book also contains the fun fact that “to sail the seven seas” refers not to seven separate seas, but to a place called the Seven Seas, which was between Venice and the Mainland (before the coastline changed). (Further research indicates this is one of several possible origins for the phrase, but interesting nonetheless). And I’ve added the Polish Wieliczka salt mine to my travel list—an entire underground chapel carved from salt, and a band started almost two hundred years ago to take advantage of the mine’s acoustics, still performing today! But the most astonishing thing, for me, is how many words, place names, and even names of entire cultures come from the word for salt. Some examples:—salacious (salt has long been associated with lewdness). —salary (this one is pretty well known already—Roman soldiers were paid in salt)—soldier (the Latin “sal” became the French “solde” meaning “pay” for the same reasons as “salary”—solde became soldier, the one who is paid)—salad (Romans salted their greens to reduce bitterness)—salsa (Spanish word for sauce comes from Latin for salt) —possible “Gauls” (as in, the Celtic group in France and other parts of Europe)—the Germany city of Halle, Austrian Hallein and Hallstatt, and Spanish Galicia —in France, a menstruating woman is said to be “en salaison” (curing in salt) —Alsace (border of France and Germany) means “land of salt” (als, meaning land, and sel, salt)—Selle Valley of Lorraine —the Romance words for cheese (formaggio, fromage) comes from the wooden cheese mold used to shape and age cheese . . . in salt—anything with the ending “wich,” which was Anglo Saxon for “saltworks.” For instance, a town in Cheshire County, England used to be known by its Celtic name, Hellath du (“black pit,” for the dark salt acquired there), which is the most Lord of the Rings name ever. But it was later renamed “Northwich”—northern saltworks. —Because wich = saltworks, “sandwich” ultimately derives from salt."

Of course it's my own fault for imagining a book this long about salt could be engaging. Nonetheless there were some interesting factoids I collected. There were fights centuries ago in England when people's land started caving in when salt brine was extracted from subterranean levels. At the time if I got this right, people actually retained the rights to what was under their land. But the salt exploiters claimed that extracting the brine helped the local economy. So what if huge sinkholes started appearing everywhere. Now I know there had to be geologists and engineers warning oil companies that fracking was problematic.Of course salt led to wars. An excellent example is Gandhi and the Salt Marsh protests in 1930 which led to protests again British rule, but was started over battles over the rights to collect salt.http://www.history.com/topics/salt-marchThis is a book that would appeal to some history buffs as well as those interested in who has the right to exploit natural resources.

The structure is too much of an incohesive infodump to make the book compelling and the author does very little to make the material engaging and relevant to the reader. There are some short parts, mostly in the last third, that are fairly interesting, but this feels more like dumb luck than good writing. It feels like, rather than carefully curating which topics and subtopics would be interesting to his audience, the author simply took all the random facts and information about salt he could possibly find, flung them into one book, and decided to call it a day.

However, more than once I glazed over and found myself thinking about things other than salt. Like how thirsty I was. Or do we have potato chips in the house? Oh, maybe we have tequila and lime! And so on down the rabbit hole. It turns out that salt taxation details, mining methods, and in depth brining and curing techniques throughout history aren't as riveting as one would think. I do wish there was more of a narrative or something tying the salty bits together. It read more like a list of unconnected facts in a text book to this ADHD girl."

I fell asleep a countless number of times, so if you're having trouble falling asleep... maybe this is worth a read.It seems Kurlansky is trying to show all the different uses of salt and how it evolved through time. Sure, there are many uses I didn't know of, but all in all, not 400+ pages worth. Also, Kurlansky writes about the importance of salt and its impact on the world we live in today. There is no doubt salt was super important, but the story was repetitive. Most of the chapters described the world region, the process they used to create salt, and the type of food they salted.My favorite part of the book was when Kurlansky wrote about the sinkholes caused by too much brine extraction in England. There are a few other good parts of the book, but I would not recommend reading this unless you are really interested in salt.In conclusion, I learned a lot about salt, but felt like the chapters read the same.

If you like history, this book is for you. Don't be dissuaded by the title.

Salt is a necessary component to functioning, makes ice cream freeze, removes rust, makes things taste good, seals cracks, removes spots on coals, preserves food, puts out grease fires, treats sore throats, and ear aches. The average adult human being has about three or four salt shaker in her body! My friend Clare actually actually snacks on sea salt because she finds it satisfies her craving without having to eat heavy junk foods. A substance so valuable, salt served as money, influenced trade routes, inspired wars. Without taking away the power of salt, the same could also be said about different foods, including beer, which I actually enjoyed reading the history of. (See my Fermenting Revolution review)On the other hand, my friend, who can stomach more hardcore history than I, enjoyed me reading to him aloud from Salt. Also, my uncle gives many kudos to the book Cod by the same author--Someday I may get a craving to explore some of these choice jems of chapters, like maybe Nordic salt dreams (which includes recipes), and American salt wars, but for now I am in search of food writing with better narrative flow--"

And I learned many fun facts that I had not previously known: i.e. where the term ""red herring"" comes from, how soy sauce is made, where Tabasco sauce comes from, etc. Also, I did enjoy the author's clever trick of including many old-timey ""salt"" recipes. Not that I'll ever attempt to make any of these recipes, but I bet that the food connoisseurs who read this book will.However, I felt that, around 200 or so pages into this book, it devolved into an awful lot of ""and they made salted fish"" and/or ""and they taxed salt."" Zzzzzzzz. I read a lot of non-fiction. I have a high tolerance for seemingly tedious detail. But seriously, how much detailed explanation of the taxation of salt in 18th century France is one person supposed to endure before falling into a coma?Also, I realize that the author was pushing a very specific agenda here, but if he's to be believed, nearly every major conflict in the history of the world started out as a salt dispute. I find that very hard to swallow. No pun intended.I guess I'll go back to reading my more obscure non-fiction books and leave the bestsellers for the masses."

One of the chapters of this book basically runs, ‘Salt is THE turning point to the US Civil War,’ which seems fine when you’re reading, but when you think about it, you’re like – slavery, states’ rights, railroads, etc. etc. etc., all of which also seem like they could be touted as ‘THE turning point’ of this conflict as well.I wonder if there are nonfiction books that run instead, ‘well, it’s interesting what people were doing in relation to IMPORTANT BOOK SUBJECT in Important Event, but kind of besides the point.’"

I think the casual reader will get bored with this book very quickly. For those with a deeper interest in human history, it is interesting to reflect on how salt played such a crucial role in the development and success (or failure) of various civilizations, business enterprises, and human health over the centuries. Overall, the author really tries to make his subject interesting, but there is only so much you can do with a book centered on a commodity as basic as salt. 2 stars.What follows are a few notes on the content of the book:The book includes a lot of interesting factoids like the incredibly large number of places and things that derive their names from salt (soldier, salad, Salzburg, salary, any English settlement ending in “-wich”, etc.) and lengthy descriptions of the various methods (both ancient and modern) for producing or mass-producing salt in geographically diverse locations around the world. It also includes an excessive number of lists of the items salt makes possible (butter, soy sauce, cheese, gunpowder, caviar, etc etc) and tedious descriptions of ancient recipes that used salt or some derivative (Garum, Brine, etc).Salt is obviously still used a great deal today, but it played a much larger role throughout history prior to widespread use of flash freezing, refrigeration, and canning. Its use in preservation of food and meat (especially salted meats and fish) and later use in the creation of gunpowder, made it an essential commodity, critical to the success and expansion of a number of civilizations from Ancient Egypt and the Chinese Dynasties to the Roman and the British Empires. It was so crucial that many countries feared dependence on “foreign salt” the way America feared dependence on “foreign oil” in the latter half of the 20th Century. Its relative abundance or lack thereof, shaped the outcome of a number of wars and crises including the American and French Revolutions, the U.S. Civil War, and Gandhi’s Indian independence movement. It was often run by state monopoly or heavily taxed to fund government and wars. Salted fish in particular generated a significant amount of global trade and became a prime source of protein for Europe (especially during frequent Holy Days that required abstention from meat).Modern processes have resulted in consistently uniform, white crystals which historically were difficult to produce and prized above less pure salt (which was colored in various shades depending on what impurities from other substances were in it). I did find it odd that the author didn’t even mention iodized salt until nearly the end of the book, and then only in the context of the modern faddish appeal of various colored salts that were historically considered sub-par. He omits any real discussion of Iodine being such an essential element for human health and how adding it to salt was one of the most brilliant and effective public health measures in history (up there with putting fluoride in drinking water). He covers at length the rise of the Morton Salt Company near the end of the book."

This evolution allowed mass consumers to always get an expected product but also created a niche marked for things like my beloved kosher salt, and the various traditional and sea salts you can now buy at the super food-mart.It is a history book but even non-historians like myself with any interest in salt will enjoy this book."

113,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43651738-sabrina-godin,4,"Throughout history, the common household mineral, salt, was obtained for usages from food to religious beliefs to archeological discoveries. Within Mark Kurlansky’s book, Salt: A World of History, he provides specific present and past examples of how salt shaped the course of civilizations. In each chapter, Kurlansky focuses on a certain area where salt was excavated, processed, and how it was used. To specify relatable instances, he writes in recipes from ancient cookbooks and chiefs. Even though salt was mainly used for food, Kurlansky provides examples of how salt influenced religious beliefs and patriarchy in certain societies. To show evidence that salt is still a major factor in present day societies, he also writes about archeological discoveries, which were made possible from the preservation of salt. In addition, he writes about the current state of the Dead Sea and the how the company Morton Salt came to be. Even though Mark Kurlansky supplies the reader with specific and interesting evidence of salt, the book seems as if it would never end. Chapters seemed to continue on and recipes seem to be “cooking up” every five pages. The way that Kurlansky writes, he brings the civilizations alive, and with each chapter they evolve within the book. One example is women. He starts of with the women having a little influence in the preservation of salt, but as the book goes on they are the ones preserving. The same goes with the civilizations obtaining the salt. Each society starts off with workers scraping away the salt, however, by the end of the book, there are salt works with hundreds of workers. By the end of the book, the reader has learned about how salt has become a leading mineral in the world and every way possible it can be retrieved. Kurlansky makes sure that the reader knows the whole history of salt, which the title of the book implies. As a whole, Mark Kurlansky tells a non-fiction story of how salt changed the world, but it could have been done in less than for hundred and forty-nine pages. Even though salt’s importance seems to resemble the size of it’s gains, it has played a major role in the course of man. In Salt: A World of History, Mark Kurlansky tells how salt started as just ingredient to make brines, and later turned into a leading product of the world. Within in his book, Kurlansky tells how salt effect civilization such as the Byzantine Empire, Rome, and Ancient Chinese Dynasties. In each of these civilizations, salt was a key factor that allowed the empires to rise to their potential. Besides the civilizations, it also affected the people within them. Both men and women worked with salt, and it was main element in their daily lives. While Kurlansky mainly focused on past influences of salt, he found a way to tie it together with present day. In daily household, there is usually a container of salt to be found, which is produced by Morton. Kurlansky provides the history about this company, so the reader can relate it to their daily life. While the history of salt, seems long and unimportant, some of it needs to be noticed. The Dead Sea, being one of the most unique bodies of water on Earth, is slowly disappearing. This is because of the constant problem of pollution. By reading Kurlansky’s book, the reader can feel his passion for the mineral. Other writers sometimes have trouble bringing their non-fiction book alive with their emotions, but he didn’t have that problem. After reading his book, the reader may be inspired to read many of his other. Although the information in Mark Kurlansky’s book seems to have a little importance in the reader’s daily life, if he or she looks past it all, it’s a non-fiction book that can change his or her life.

When you first hear the title of this book, one's first reaction is generally to chuckle because, let's be serious, what is there to the history of salt? It's just a mineral!Well, Kurlansky tells us that there is a lot to the history of salt and that our lives and history are intricately tied to the location and usage of salt in society. I learned a great deal in this book, and not just about salt (the chapter on how to make soy sauce and garum is fascinating). The best part of this book is the way Kurlansky tells us about salt - he is clearly very passionate about this topic, and he goes into create detail in the history, chemical, and nature of salt. Sure, sometimes he's a little goofy (he, only somewhat seriously, suggests a link to the Confederates losing to a salt crisis), but little vignettes like that are what make this book. I would highly recommend this book. I found myself talking about its contents at parties, and most people seemed fascinated. For something we use everyday without a second though, there is quite a bit of history behind this tasty mineral. Also for nonfiction, this book is easy to read and fun. I think most people could read this book without too much difficulty and find themselves a little happier and more knowledgeable by the end of it."

On page 4 of the introduction, there is an engraving dating from 1157 of a bunch of women holding down a partially disrobed man titled ""Women Salting Their Husbands"". ""With this salting, front and back, At last strong natures they will not lack."" OK, I was hooked. (Thankfully, I've been able to avoid being salted myself so far.)You can open this book on almost any page and find something interesting. I just opened to page 111...""Fresh whale meat was also for the rich. The great delicacy was the tongue. Salted tongue of any kind was appreciated, but especially whale tongue. For the poor, there was craspois, also called craspoix, or grapois. This was strips of the fattier parts of the whale, salt cured like bacon and sometimes called in French lard de careme, which translates as 'lent blubber'...""All kinds of stuff like that. An easy and entertaining read."
119,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76129-wealhtheow,3,"A fascinating study of salt throughout human history. I really appreciate that Kurlansky did not forget about the non-Western world in writing about this book (although there is rather more about American salt practices than most other countries--unsurprising, given Kurlansky's language, previous books, and nationality). My only criticism of this book is that it has a tendency toward anecdotes rather than data, especially toward the end. There are no sum-ups or final conclusions drawn in the last few chapters, just a tossed salad of all the random tidbits the author hadn't managed to fit in elsewhere. Still, incredible stuff! Even reading just a few pages of this book will give you material for days' worth of small talk."
120,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"Salt is sexy— really! Think about it: it’s in just about every bodily fluid (wink) and it has shaped human history like almost nothing else. This book covers it all—from 100AD (when ancient Chinese lit up natural gas coming out of brine-water wells to pump out the brine through bamboo tubes into boiling houses to boil the water off the salt), to Venice’s saltworks, to the French Revolution (where the salt tax, known as the gabelle, was a major point of contention), to the American Revolution and Civil War, and to the salt-fueled Indian revolution led by Gandhi. It's not the best microhistory I've ever read, but it was pretty interesting to think about the humble salt's impact on human history in a way you don't usually stop to consider.It was pretty interesting to see how Kurlansky’s interests intersect—the topic of his other books Cod and the Basques are closely related to salt, and feature heavily in one chapter of the book. This book also contains the fun fact that “to sail the seven seas” refers not to seven separate seas, but to a place called the Seven Seas, which was between Venice and the Mainland (before the coastline changed). (Further research indicates this is one of several possible origins for the phrase, but interesting nonetheless). And I’ve added the Polish Wieliczka salt mine to my travel list—an entire underground chapel carved from salt, and a band started almost two hundred years ago to take advantage of the mine’s acoustics, still performing today! But the most astonishing thing, for me, is how many words, place names, and even names of entire cultures come from the word for salt. Some examples:—salacious (salt has long been associated with lewdness). —salary (this one is pretty well known already—Roman soldiers were paid in salt)—soldier (the Latin “sal” became the French “solde” meaning “pay” for the same reasons as “salary”—solde became soldier, the one who is paid)—salad (Romans salted their greens to reduce bitterness)—salsa (Spanish word for sauce comes from Latin for salt) —possible “Gauls” (as in, the Celtic group in France and other parts of Europe)—the Germany city of Halle, Austrian Hallein and Hallstatt, and Spanish Galicia —in France, a menstruating woman is said to be “en salaison” (curing in salt) —Alsace (border of France and Germany) means “land of salt” (als, meaning land, and sel, salt)—Selle Valley of Lorraine —the Romance words for cheese (formaggio, fromage) comes from the wooden cheese mold used to shape and age cheese . . . in salt—anything with the ending “wich,” which was Anglo Saxon for “saltworks.” For instance, a town in Cheshire County, England used to be known by its Celtic name, Hellath du (“black pit,” for the dark salt acquired there), which is the most Lord of the Rings name ever. But it was later renamed “Northwich”—northern saltworks. —Because wich = saltworks, “sandwich” ultimately derives from salt."
121,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2220787-ram,4,"The book is about the history of salt and salt manufacturing, and actually is the history of the world as seen from the salt perspective.I learned many interesting facts about this commodity that we so take for granted in the modern world.Salt has effected so many famous people: Marco Polo, Gandhi, George Washington.Salt production, salt chemistry and salt mining is the basis for thousands of modern and less modern products we use from Liquid bleach, Tabasco sauce, Parmigiano-Reggiano and many more.The salt tax in India pushed Gandhi to start the passive rebellion that helped lead to independence.Marco Polo discovered sophisticated salt industry in China.The war George Washington led for independence from England was partly incited by salt shortages.All the towns in England that end with ""wich"" produced saltSalzburg is ""salt town"" and Alsace is ""land of salt""So….

Of course it's my own fault for imagining a book this long about salt could be engaging. Nonetheless there were some interesting factoids I collected. There were fights centuries ago in England when people's land started caving in when salt brine was extracted from subterranean levels. At the time if I got this right, people actually retained the rights to what was under their land. But the salt exploiters claimed that extracting the brine helped the local economy. So what if huge sinkholes started appearing everywhere. Now I know there had to be geologists and engineers warning oil companies that fracking was problematic.Of course salt led to wars. An excellent example is Gandhi and the Salt Marsh protests in 1930 which led to protests again British rule, but was started over battles over the rights to collect salt.http://www.history.com/topics/salt-marchThis is a book that would appeal to some history buffs as well as those interested in who has the right to exploit natural resources. Lots of interesting history in this book but just too much of it."

The structure is too much of an incohesive infodump to make the book compelling and the author does very little to make the material engaging and relevant to the reader. There are some short parts, mostly in the last third, that are fairly interesting, but this feels more like dumb luck than good writing. It feels like, rather than carefully curating which topics and subtopics would be interesting to his audience, the author simply took all the random facts and information about salt he could possibly find, flung them into one book, and decided to call it a day. I guess you could say I'm a bit.........salty about reading this book ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"

However, more than once I glazed over and found myself thinking about things other than salt. Like how thirsty I was. Or do we have potato chips in the house? Oh, maybe we have tequila and lime! And so on down the rabbit hole. It turns out that salt taxation details, mining methods, and in depth brining and curing techniques throughout history aren't as riveting as one would think. I do wish there was more of a narrative or something tying the salty bits together. It read more like a list of unconnected facts in a text book to this ADHD girl."

I enjoy reading about history, but I learned reading about just salt was incredibly boring. I fell asleep a countless number of times, so if you're having trouble falling asleep... maybe this is worth a read.It seems Kurlansky is trying to show all the different uses of salt and how it evolved through time. Sure, there are many uses I didn't know of, but all in all, not 400+ pages worth. Also, Kurlansky writes about the importance of salt and its impact on the world we live in today. There is no doubt salt was super important, but the story was repetitive. Most of the chapters described the world region, the process they used to create salt, and the type of food they salted.My favorite part of the book was when Kurlansky wrote about the sinkholes caused by too much brine extraction in England. There are a few other good parts of the book, but I would not recommend reading this unless you are really interested in salt.In conclusion, I learned a lot about salt, but felt like the chapters read the same. I will most likely never reread this book."

If you like history, this book is for you. Don't be dissuaded by the title. It's not a book about salt, but rather a history of the world and how salt was a protagonist through serendipity, greed, necessity and the forward momentum of advancing technology."

Salt is a necessary component to functioning, makes ice cream freeze, removes rust, makes things taste good, seals cracks, removes spots on coals, preserves food, puts out grease fires, treats sore throats, and ear aches. The average adult human being has about three or four salt shaker in her body! My friend Clare actually actually snacks on sea salt because she finds it satisfies her craving without having to eat heavy junk foods. A substance so valuable, salt served as money, influenced trade routes, inspired wars. Without taking away the power of salt, the same could also be said about different foods, including beer, which I actually enjoyed reading the history of. (See my Fermenting Revolution review)On the other hand, my friend, who can stomach more hardcore history than I, enjoyed me reading to him aloud from Salt. Also, my uncle gives many kudos to the book Cod by the same author--Someday I may get a craving to explore some of these choice jems of chapters, like maybe Nordic salt dreams (which includes recipes), and American salt wars, but for now I am in search of food writing with better narrative flow--"

And of course, it turns out to be one of those books that everyone else in the world seems to like but me.I will admit that there were a lot of chapters of this book that I did enjoy. And I learned many fun facts that I had not previously known: i.e. where the term ""red herring"" comes from, how soy sauce is made, where Tabasco sauce comes from, etc. Also, I did enjoy the author's clever trick of including many old-timey ""salt"" recipes. Not that I'll ever attempt to make any of these recipes, but I bet that the food connoisseurs who read this book will.However, I felt that, around 200 or so pages into this book, it devolved into an awful lot of ""and they made salted fish"" and/or ""and they taxed salt."" Zzzzzzzz. I read a lot of non-fiction. I have a high tolerance for seemingly tedious detail. But seriously, how much detailed explanation of the taxation of salt in 18th century France is one person supposed to endure before falling into a coma?Also, I realize that the author was pushing a very specific agenda here, but if he's to be believed, nearly every major conflict in the history of the world started out as a salt dispute. I find that very hard to swallow. No pun intended.I guess I'll go back to reading my more obscure non-fiction books and leave the bestsellers for the masses."

Also I know no more things about salting fish than is reasonable for any human to know, much less a vegetarian-type human.One of the things this book makes me wonder is, are the subjects of books always so central? One of the chapters of this book basically runs, ‘Salt is THE turning point to the US Civil War,’ which seems fine when you’re reading, but when you think about it, you’re like – slavery, states’ rights, railroads, etc. etc. etc., all of which also seem like they could be touted as ‘THE turning point’ of this conflict as well.I wonder if there are nonfiction books that run instead, ‘well, it’s interesting what people were doing in relation to IMPORTANT BOOK SUBJECT in Important Event, but kind of besides the point.’"

Kurlansky has stuffed a stunning amount of knowledge about this commodity in this book. But he has forgotten to tell a narrative, to look for the bigger picture, to analyse basic economic or cultural trends. And on top of that he has left his critical gaze at home. In the end all he offers is this mumbo jumbo of facts, titbits of knowledge, myths and nice stories, all about salt. I hope one day someone will do a better job. "

138,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45596235-frank-theising,2,"Some interesting material buried within, but overall probably twice as long as it needed to be. I think the casual reader will get bored with this book very quickly. For those with a deeper interest in human history, it is interesting to reflect on how salt played such a crucial role in the development and success (or failure) of various civilizations, business enterprises, and human health over the centuries. Overall, the author really tries to make his subject interesting, but there is only so much you can do with a book centered on a commodity as basic as salt. 2 stars.What follows are a few notes on the content of the book:The book includes a lot of interesting factoids like the incredibly large number of places and things that derive their names from salt (soldier, salad, Salzburg, salary, any English settlement ending in “-wich”, etc.) and lengthy descriptions of the various methods (both ancient and modern) for producing or mass-producing salt in geographically diverse locations around the world. It also includes an excessive number of lists of the items salt makes possible (butter, soy sauce, cheese, gunpowder, caviar, etc etc) and tedious descriptions of ancient recipes that used salt or some derivative (Garum, Brine, etc).Salt is obviously still used a great deal today, but it played a much larger role throughout history prior to widespread use of flash freezing, refrigeration, and canning. Its use in preservation of food and meat (especially salted meats and fish) and later use in the creation of gunpowder, made it an essential commodity, critical to the success and expansion of a number of civilizations from Ancient Egypt and the Chinese Dynasties to the Roman and the British Empires. It was so crucial that many countries feared dependence on “foreign salt” the way America feared dependence on “foreign oil” in the latter half of the 20th Century. Its relative abundance or lack thereof, shaped the outcome of a number of wars and crises including the American and French Revolutions, the U.S. Civil War, and Gandhi’s Indian independence movement. It was often run by state monopoly or heavily taxed to fund government and wars. Salted fish in particular generated a significant amount of global trade and became a prime source of protein for Europe (especially during frequent Holy Days that required abstention from meat).Modern processes have resulted in consistently uniform, white crystals which historically were difficult to produce and prized above less pure salt (which was colored in various shades depending on what impurities from other substances were in it). I did find it odd that the author didn’t even mention iodized salt until nearly the end of the book, and then only in the context of the modern faddish appeal of various colored salts that were historically considered sub-par. He omits any real discussion of Iodine being such an essential element for human health and how adding it to salt was one of the most brilliant and effective public health measures in history (up there with putting fluoride in drinking water). He covers at length the rise of the Morton Salt Company near the end of the book."

If you have ever wondered about the little shaker on your table or wanted to see why salt is the only rock we eat this book will tell you. One of the things I liked best was the inclusion of historical recipes from different cultures and time periods reflecting how the usage of salt has changed through the centuries. It often includes the histories of famous salted things from the Roman garum (the very distant progenitor of ketchup), to kosher lox, to butter. I also enjoyed learning how salt went from necessity to luxury as supply and demand changed. Most of the modern salt production is no longer made for food, and much has been homogenized into uniform salt crystals controlled by two huge companies. This evolution allowed mass consumers to always get an expected product but also created a niche marked for things like my beloved kosher salt, and the various traditional and sea salts you can now buy at the super food-mart.It is a history book but even non-historians like myself with any interest in salt will enjoy this book."

Within Mark Kurlansky’s book, Salt: A World of History, he provides specific present and past examples of how salt shaped the course of civilizations. In each chapter, Kurlansky focuses on a certain area where salt was excavated, processed, and how it was used. To specify relatable instances, he writes in recipes from ancient cookbooks and chiefs. Even though salt was mainly used for food, Kurlansky provides examples of how salt influenced religious beliefs and patriarchy in certain societies. To show evidence that salt is still a major factor in present day societies, he also writes about archeological discoveries, which were made possible from the preservation of salt. In addition, he writes about the current state of the Dead Sea and the how the company Morton Salt came to be. Even though Mark Kurlansky supplies the reader with specific and interesting evidence of salt, the book seems as if it would never end. Chapters seemed to continue on and recipes seem to be “cooking up” every five pages. The way that Kurlansky writes, he brings the civilizations alive, and with each chapter they evolve within the book. One example is women. He starts of with the women having a little influence in the preservation of salt, but as the book goes on they are the ones preserving. The same goes with the civilizations obtaining the salt. Each society starts off with workers scraping away the salt, however, by the end of the book, there are salt works with hundreds of workers. By the end of the book, the reader has learned about how salt has become a leading mineral in the world and every way possible it can be retrieved. Kurlansky makes sure that the reader knows the whole history of salt, which the title of the book implies. As a whole, Mark Kurlansky tells a non-fiction story of how salt changed the world, but it could have been done in less than for hundred and forty-nine pages. Even though salt’s importance seems to resemble the size of it’s gains, it has played a major role in the course of man. In Salt: A World of History, Mark Kurlansky tells how salt started as just ingredient to make brines, and later turned into a leading product of the world. Within in his book, Kurlansky tells how salt effect civilization such as the Byzantine Empire, Rome, and Ancient Chinese Dynasties. In each of these civilizations, salt was a key factor that allowed the empires to rise to their potential. Besides the civilizations, it also affected the people within them. Both men and women worked with salt, and it was main element in their daily lives. While Kurlansky mainly focused on past influences of salt, he found a way to tie it together with present day. In daily household, there is usually a container of salt to be found, which is produced by Morton. Kurlansky provides the history about this company, so the reader can relate it to their daily life. While the history of salt, seems long and unimportant, some of it needs to be noticed. The Dead Sea, being one of the most unique bodies of water on Earth, is slowly disappearing. This is because of the constant problem of pollution. By reading Kurlansky’s book, the reader can feel his passion for the mineral. Other writers sometimes have trouble bringing their non-fiction book alive with their emotions, but he didn’t have that problem. After reading his book, the reader may be inspired to read many of his other. Although the information in Mark Kurlansky’s book seems to have a little importance in the reader’s daily life, if he or she looks past it all, it’s a non-fiction book that can change his or her life.

When you first hear the title of this book, one's first reaction is generally to chuckle because, let's be serious, what is there to the history of salt? It's just a mineral!Well, Kurlansky tells us that there is a lot to the history of salt and that our lives and history are intricately tied to the location and usage of salt in society. I learned a great deal in this book, and not just about salt (the chapter on how to make soy sauce and garum is fascinating). The best part of this book is the way Kurlansky tells us about salt - he is clearly very passionate about this topic, and he goes into create detail in the history, chemical, and nature of salt. Sure, sometimes he's a little goofy (he, only somewhat seriously, suggests a link to the Confederates losing to a salt crisis), but little vignettes like that are what make this book. I would highly recommend this book. I found myself talking about its contents at parties, and most people seemed fascinated. For something we use everyday without a second though, there is quite a bit of history behind this tasty mineral. Also for nonfiction, this book is easy to read and fun. I think most people could read this book without too much difficulty and find themselves a little happier and more knowledgeable by the end of it."

On page 4 of the introduction, there is an engraving dating from 1157 of a bunch of women holding down a partially disrobed man titled ""Women Salting Their Husbands"". ""With this salting, front and back, At last strong natures they will not lack."" OK, I was hooked. (Thankfully, I've been able to avoid being salted myself so far.)You can open this book on almost any page and find something interesting. I just opened to page 111...""Fresh whale meat was also for the rich. The great delicacy was the tongue. Salted tongue of any kind was appreciated, but especially whale tongue. For the poor, there was craspois, also called craspoix, or grapois. This was strips of the fattier parts of the whale, salt cured like bacon and sometimes called in French lard de careme, which translates as 'lent blubber'...""All kinds of stuff like that. An easy and entertaining read."

I really appreciate that Kurlansky did not forget about the non-Western world in writing about this book (although there is rather more about American salt practices than most other countries--unsurprising, given Kurlansky's language, previous books, and nationality). My only criticism of this book is that it has a tendency toward anecdotes rather than data, especially toward the end. There are no sum-ups or final conclusions drawn in the last few chapters, just a tossed salad of all the random tidbits the author hadn't managed to fit in elsewhere. Still, incredible stuff! Even reading just a few pages of this book will give you material for days' worth of small talk."
150,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"Salt is sexy— really! Think about it: it’s in just about every bodily fluid (wink) and it has shaped human history like almost nothing else. This book covers it all—from 100AD (when ancient Chinese lit up natural gas coming out of brine-water wells to pump out the brine through bamboo tubes into boiling houses to boil the water off the salt), to Venice’s saltworks, to the French Revolution (where the salt tax, known as the gabelle, was a major point of contention), to the American Revolution and Civil War, and to the salt-fueled Indian revolution led by Gandhi. It's not the best microhistory I've ever read, but it was pretty interesting to think about the humble salt's impact on human history in a way you don't usually stop to consider.It was pretty interesting to see how Kurlansky’s interests intersect—the topic of his other books Cod and the Basques are closely related to salt, and feature heavily in one chapter of the book. This book also contains the fun fact that “to sail the seven seas” refers not to seven separate seas, but to a place called the Seven Seas, which was between Venice and the Mainland (before the coastline changed). (Further research indicates this is one of several possible origins for the phrase, but interesting nonetheless). And I’ve added the Polish Wieliczka salt mine to my travel list—an entire underground chapel carved from salt, and a band started almost two hundred years ago to take advantage of the mine’s acoustics, still performing today! But the most astonishing thing, for me, is how many words, place names, and even names of entire cultures come from the word for salt. Some examples:—salacious (salt has long been associated with lewdness). —salary (this one is pretty well known already—Roman soldiers were paid in salt)—soldier (the Latin “sal” became the French “solde” meaning “pay” for the same reasons as “salary”—solde became soldier, the one who is paid)—salad (Romans salted their greens to reduce bitterness)—salsa (Spanish word for sauce comes from Latin for salt) —possible “Gauls” (as in, the Celtic group in France and other parts of Europe)—the Germany city of Halle, Austrian Hallein and Hallstatt, and Spanish Galicia —in France, a menstruating woman is said to be “en salaison” (curing in salt) —Alsace (border of France and Germany) means “land of salt” (als, meaning land, and sel, salt)—Selle Valley of Lorraine —the Romance words for cheese (formaggio, fromage) comes from the wooden cheese mold used to shape and age cheese . . . in salt—anything with the ending “wich,” which was Anglo Saxon for “saltworks.” For instance, a town in Cheshire County, England used to be known by its Celtic name, Hellath du (“black pit,” for the dark salt acquired there), which is the most Lord of the Rings name ever. But it was later renamed “Northwich”—northern saltworks. —Because wich = saltworks, “sandwich” ultimately derives from salt."

Of course it's my own fault for imagining a book this long about salt could be engaging. Nonetheless there were some interesting factoids I collected. There were fights centuries ago in England when people's land started caving in when salt brine was extracted from subterranean levels. At the time if I got this right, people actually retained the rights to what was under their land. But the salt exploiters claimed that extracting the brine helped the local economy. So what if huge sinkholes started appearing everywhere. Now I know there had to be geologists and engineers warning oil companies that fracking was problematic.Of course salt led to wars. An excellent example is Gandhi and the Salt Marsh protests in 1930 which led to protests again British rule, but was started over battles over the rights to collect salt.http://www.history.com/topics/salt-marchThis is a book that would appeal to some history buffs as well as those interested in who has the right to exploit natural resources. Lots of interesting history in this book but just too much of it."

The structure is too much of an incohesive infodump to make the book compelling and the author does very little to make the material engaging and relevant to the reader. There are some short parts, mostly in the last third, that are fairly interesting, but this feels more like dumb luck than good writing. It feels like, rather than carefully curating which topics and subtopics would be interesting to his audience, the author simply took all the random facts and information about salt he could possibly find, flung them into one book, and decided to call it a day. I guess you could say I'm a bit.........salty about reading this book ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"

However, more than once I glazed over and found myself thinking about things other than salt. Like how thirsty I was. Or do we have potato chips in the house? Oh, maybe we have tequila and lime! And so on down the rabbit hole. It turns out that salt taxation details, mining methods, and in depth brining and curing techniques throughout history aren't as riveting as one would think.

I enjoy reading about history, but I learned reading about just salt was incredibly boring. I fell asleep a countless number of times, so if you're having trouble falling asleep... maybe this is worth a read.It seems Kurlansky is trying to show all the different uses of salt and how it evolved through time. Sure, there are many uses I didn't know of, but all in all, not 400+ pages worth. Also, Kurlansky writes about the importance of salt and its impact on the world we live in today. There is no doubt salt was super important, but the story was repetitive. Most of the chapters described the world region, the process they used to create salt, and the type of food they salted.My favorite part of the book was when Kurlansky wrote about the sinkholes caused by too much brine extraction in England. There are a few other good parts of the book, but I would not recommend reading this unless you are really interested in salt.In conclusion, I learned a lot about salt, but felt like the chapters read the same.

If you like history, this book is for you. Don't be dissuaded by the title.

Salt is a necessary component to functioning, makes ice cream freeze, removes rust, makes things taste good, seals cracks, removes spots on coals, preserves food, puts out grease fires, treats sore throats, and ear aches. The average adult human being has about three or four salt shaker in her body! My friend Clare actually actually snacks on sea salt because she finds it satisfies her craving without having to eat heavy junk foods. A substance so valuable, salt served as money, influenced trade routes, inspired wars. Without taking away the power of salt, the same could also be said about different foods, including beer, which I actually enjoyed reading the history of. (See my Fermenting Revolution review)On the other hand, my friend, who can stomach more hardcore history than I, enjoyed me reading to him aloud from Salt. Also, my uncle gives many kudos to the book Cod by the same author--Someday I may get a craving to explore some of these choice jems of chapters, like maybe Nordic salt dreams (which includes recipes), and American salt wars, but for now I am in search of food writing with better narrative flow--"

And of course, it turns out to be one of those books that everyone else in the world seems to like but me.I will admit that there were a lot of chapters of this book that I did enjoy. And I learned many fun facts that I had not previously known: i.e. where the term ""red herring"" comes from, how soy sauce is made, where Tabasco sauce comes from, etc. Also, I did enjoy the author's clever trick of including many old-timey ""salt"" recipes. Not that I'll ever attempt to make any of these recipes, but I bet that the food connoisseurs who read this book will.However, I felt that, around 200 or so pages into this book, it devolved into an awful lot of ""and they made salted fish"" and/or ""and they taxed salt."" Zzzzzzzz. I read a lot of non-fiction. I have a high tolerance for seemingly tedious detail. But seriously, how much detailed explanation of the taxation of salt in 18th century France is one person supposed to endure before falling into a coma?Also, I realize that the author was pushing a very specific agenda here, but if he's to be believed, nearly every major conflict in the history of the world started out as a salt dispute. I find that very hard to swallow. No pun intended.I guess I'll go back to reading my more obscure non-fiction books and leave the bestsellers for the masses."

Also I know no more things about salting fish than is reasonable for any human to know, much less a vegetarian-type human.One of the things this book makes me wonder is, are the subjects of books always so central? One of the chapters of this book basically runs, ‘Salt is THE turning point to the US Civil War,’ which seems fine when you’re reading, but when you think about it, you’re like – slavery, states’ rights, railroads, etc. etc. etc., all of which also seem like they could be touted as ‘THE turning point’ of this conflict as well.I wonder if there are nonfiction books that run instead, ‘well, it’s interesting what people were doing in relation to IMPORTANT BOOK SUBJECT in Important Event, but kind of besides the point.’"

But he has forgotten to tell a narrative, to look for the bigger picture, to analyse basic economic or cultural trends. And on top of that he has left his critical gaze at home. In the end all he offers is this mumbo jumbo of facts, titbits of knowledge, myths and nice stories, all about salt. I hope one day someone will do a better job. "

168,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45596235-frank-theising,2,"Some interesting material buried within, but overall probably twice as long as it needed to be. I think the casual reader will get bored with this book very quickly. For those with a deeper interest in human history, it is interesting to reflect on how salt played such a crucial role in the development and success (or failure) of various civilizations, business enterprises, and human health over the centuries. Overall, the author really tries to make his subject interesting, but there is only so much you can do with a book centered on a commodity as basic as salt. 2 stars.What follows are a few notes on the content of the book:The book includes a lot of interesting factoids like the incredibly large number of places and things that derive their names from salt (soldier, salad, Salzburg, salary, any English settlement ending in “-wich”, etc.) and lengthy descriptions of the various methods (both ancient and modern) for producing or mass-producing salt in geographically diverse locations around the world. It also includes an excessive number of lists of the items salt makes possible (butter, soy sauce, cheese, gunpowder, caviar, etc etc) and tedious descriptions of ancient recipes that used salt or some derivative (Garum, Brine, etc).Salt is obviously still used a great deal today, but it played a much larger role throughout history prior to widespread use of flash freezing, refrigeration, and canning. Its use in preservation of food and meat (especially salted meats and fish) and later use in the creation of gunpowder, made it an essential commodity, critical to the success and expansion of a number of civilizations from Ancient Egypt and the Chinese Dynasties to the Roman and the British Empires. It was so crucial that many countries feared dependence on “foreign salt” the way America feared dependence on “foreign oil” in the latter half of the 20th Century. Its relative abundance or lack thereof, shaped the outcome of a number of wars and crises including the American and French Revolutions, the U.S. Civil War, and Gandhi’s Indian independence movement. It was often run by state monopoly or heavily taxed to fund government and wars. Salted fish in particular generated a significant amount of global trade and became a prime source of protein for Europe (especially during frequent Holy Days that required abstention from meat).Modern processes have resulted in consistently uniform, white crystals which historically were difficult to produce and prized above less pure salt (which was colored in various shades depending on what impurities from other substances were in it). I did find it odd that the author didn’t even mention iodized salt until nearly the end of the book, and then only in the context of the modern faddish appeal of various colored salts that were historically considered sub-par. He omits any real discussion of Iodine being such an essential element for human health and how adding it to salt was one of the most brilliant and effective public health measures in history (up there with putting fluoride in drinking water). He covers at length the rise of the Morton Salt Company near the end of the book."
169,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17539226-bryan-brown,4,"Fascinating story starting with the prehistory of the earliest recorded salt producing sites to about the year 2000 and the mass production of salt (most of which is no longer used for food). If you have ever wondered about the little shaker on your table or wanted to see why salt is the only rock we eat this book will tell you. One of the things I liked best was the inclusion of historical recipes from different cultures and time periods reflecting how the usage of salt has changed through the centuries. It often includes the histories of famous salted things from the Roman garum (the very distant progenitor of ketchup), to kosher lox, to butter. I also enjoyed learning how salt went from necessity to luxury as supply and demand changed. Most of the modern salt production is no longer made for food, and much has been homogenized into uniform salt crystals controlled by two huge companies. This evolution allowed mass consumers to always get an expected product but also created a niche marked for things like my beloved kosher salt, and the various traditional and sea salts you can now buy at the super food-mart.It is a history book but even non-historians like myself with any interest in salt will enjoy this book."

Within Mark Kurlansky’s book, Salt: A World of History, he provides specific present and past examples of how salt shaped the course of civilizations. In each chapter, Kurlansky focuses on a certain area where salt was excavated, processed, and how it was used. To specify relatable instances, he writes in recipes from ancient cookbooks and chiefs. Even though salt was mainly used for food, Kurlansky provides examples of how salt influenced religious beliefs and patriarchy in certain societies. To show evidence that salt is still a major factor in present day societies, he also writes about archeological discoveries, which were made possible from the preservation of salt. In addition, he writes about the current state of the Dead Sea and the how the company Morton Salt came to be. Even though Mark Kurlansky supplies the reader with specific and interesting evidence of salt, the book seems as if it would never end. Chapters seemed to continue on and recipes seem to be “cooking up” every five pages. The way that Kurlansky writes, he brings the civilizations alive, and with each chapter they evolve within the book. One example is women. He starts of with the women having a little influence in the preservation of salt, but as the book goes on they are the ones preserving. The same goes with the civilizations obtaining the salt. Each society starts off with workers scraping away the salt, however, by the end of the book, there are salt works with hundreds of workers. By the end of the book, the reader has learned about how salt has become a leading mineral in the world and every way possible it can be retrieved. Kurlansky makes sure that the reader knows the whole history of salt, which the title of the book implies. As a whole, Mark Kurlansky tells a non-fiction story of how salt changed the world, but it could have been done in less than for hundred and forty-nine pages. Even though salt’s importance seems to resemble the size of it’s gains, it has played a major role in the course of man. In Salt: A World of History, Mark Kurlansky tells how salt started as just ingredient to make brines, and later turned into a leading product of the world. Within in his book, Kurlansky tells how salt effect civilization such as the Byzantine Empire, Rome, and Ancient Chinese Dynasties. In each of these civilizations, salt was a key factor that allowed the empires to rise to their potential. Besides the civilizations, it also affected the people within them. Both men and women worked with salt, and it was main element in their daily lives. While Kurlansky mainly focused on past influences of salt, he found a way to tie it together with present day. In daily household, there is usually a container of salt to be found, which is produced by Morton. Kurlansky provides the history about this company, so the reader can relate it to their daily life. While the history of salt, seems long and unimportant, some of it needs to be noticed. The Dead Sea, being one of the most unique bodies of water on Earth, is slowly disappearing. This is because of the constant problem of pollution. By reading Kurlansky’s book, the reader can feel his passion for the mineral. Other writers sometimes have trouble bringing their non-fiction book alive with their emotions, but he didn’t have that problem. After reading his book, the reader may be inspired to read many of his other. Although the information in Mark Kurlansky’s book seems to have a little importance in the reader’s daily life, if he or she looks past it all, it’s a non-fiction book that can change his or her life.

It's just a mineral!Well, Kurlansky tells us that there is a lot to the history of salt and that our lives and history are intricately tied to the location and usage of salt in society. I learned a great deal in this book, and not just about salt (the chapter on how to make soy sauce and garum is fascinating). The best part of this book is the way Kurlansky tells us about salt - he is clearly very passionate about this topic, and he goes into create detail in the history, chemical, and nature of salt. Sure, sometimes he's a little goofy (he, only somewhat seriously, suggests a link to the Confederates losing to a salt crisis), but little vignettes like that are what make this book. I would highly recommend this book. I found myself talking about its contents at parties, and most people seemed fascinated. For something we use everyday without a second though, there is quite a bit of history behind this tasty mineral. Also for nonfiction, this book is easy to read and fun.

On page 4 of the introduction, there is an engraving dating from 1157 of a bunch of women holding down a partially disrobed man titled ""Women Salting Their Husbands"". ""With this salting, front and back, At last strong natures they will not lack."" OK, I was hooked. (Thankfully, I've been able to avoid being salted myself so far.)You can open this book on almost any page and find something interesting. I just opened to page 111...""Fresh whale meat was also for the rich. The great delicacy was the tongue. Salted tongue of any kind was appreciated, but especially whale tongue. For the poor, there was craspois, also called craspoix, or grapois. This was strips of the fattier parts of the whale, salt cured like bacon and sometimes called in French lard de careme, which translates as 'lent blubber'...""All kinds of stuff like that.

I really appreciate that Kurlansky did not forget about the non-Western world in writing about this book (although there is rather more about American salt practices than most other countries--unsurprising, given Kurlansky's language, previous books, and nationality). My only criticism of this book is that it has a tendency toward anecdotes rather than data, especially toward the end. There are no sum-ups or final conclusions drawn in the last few chapters, just a tossed salad of all the random tidbits the author hadn't managed to fit in elsewhere. Still, incredible stuff! Even reading just a few pages of this book will give you material for days' worth of small talk."
180,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"Salt is sexy— really! Think about it: it’s in just about every bodily fluid (wink) and it has shaped human history like almost nothing else. This book covers it all—from 100AD (when ancient Chinese lit up natural gas coming out of brine-water wells to pump out the brine through bamboo tubes into boiling houses to boil the water off the salt), to Venice’s saltworks, to the French Revolution (where the salt tax, known as the gabelle, was a major point of contention), to the American Revolution and Civil War, and to the salt-fueled Indian revolution led by Gandhi. It's not the best microhistory I've ever read, but it was pretty interesting to think about the humble salt's impact on human history in a way you don't usually stop to consider.It was pretty interesting to see how Kurlansky’s interests intersect—the topic of his other books Cod and the Basques are closely related to salt, and feature heavily in one chapter of the book. This book also contains the fun fact that “to sail the seven seas” refers not to seven separate seas, but to a place called the Seven Seas, which was between Venice and the Mainland (before the coastline changed). (Further research indicates this is one of several possible origins for the phrase, but interesting nonetheless). And I’ve added the Polish Wieliczka salt mine to my travel list—an entire underground chapel carved from salt, and a band started almost two hundred years ago to take advantage of the mine’s acoustics, still performing today! But the most astonishing thing, for me, is how many words, place names, and even names of entire cultures come from the word for salt. Some examples:—salacious (salt has long been associated with lewdness). —salary (this one is pretty well known already—Roman soldiers were paid in salt)—soldier (the Latin “sal” became the French “solde” meaning “pay” for the same reasons as “salary”—solde became soldier, the one who is paid)—salad (Romans salted their greens to reduce bitterness)—salsa (Spanish word for sauce comes from Latin for salt) —possible “Gauls” (as in, the Celtic group in France and other parts of Europe)—the Germany city of Halle, Austrian Hallein and Hallstatt, and Spanish Galicia —in France, a menstruating woman is said to be “en salaison” (curing in salt) —Alsace (border of France and Germany) means “land of salt” (als, meaning land, and sel, salt)—Selle Valley of Lorraine —the Romance words for cheese (formaggio, fromage) comes from the wooden cheese mold used to shape and age cheese . . . in salt—anything with the ending “wich,” which was Anglo Saxon for “saltworks.” For instance, a town in Cheshire County, England used to be known by its Celtic name, Hellath du (“black pit,” for the dark salt acquired there), which is the most Lord of the Rings name ever. But it was later renamed “Northwich”—northern saltworks. —Because wich = saltworks, “sandwich” ultimately derives from salt."
181,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2220787-ram,4,"The book is about the history of salt and salt manufacturing, and actually is the history of the world as seen from the salt perspective.I learned many interesting facts about this commodity that we so take for granted in the modern world.Salt has effected so many famous people: Marco Polo, Gandhi, George Washington.Salt production, salt chemistry and salt mining is the basis for thousands of modern and less modern products we use from Liquid bleach, Tabasco sauce, Parmigiano-Reggiano and many more.The salt tax in India pushed Gandhi to start the passive rebellion that helped lead to independence.Marco Polo discovered sophisticated salt industry in China.The war George Washington led for independence from England was partly incited by salt shortages.All the towns in England that end with ""wich"" produced saltSalzburg is ""salt town"" and Alsace is ""land of salt""So….

Of course it's my own fault for imagining a book this long about salt could be engaging. Nonetheless there were some interesting factoids I collected. There were fights centuries ago in England when people's land started caving in when salt brine was extracted from subterranean levels. At the time if I got this right, people actually retained the rights to what was under their land. But the salt exploiters claimed that extracting the brine helped the local economy. So what if huge sinkholes started appearing everywhere. Now I know there had to be geologists and engineers warning oil companies that fracking was problematic.Of course salt led to wars. An excellent example is Gandhi and the Salt Marsh protests in 1930 which led to protests again British rule, but was started over battles over the rights to collect salt.http://www.history.com/topics/salt-marchThis is a book that would appeal to some history buffs as well as those interested in who has the right to exploit natural resources.

The structure is too much of an incohesive infodump to make the book compelling and the author does very little to make the material engaging and relevant to the reader. There are some short parts, mostly in the last third, that are fairly interesting, but this feels more like dumb luck than good writing. It feels like, rather than carefully curating which topics and subtopics would be interesting to his audience, the author simply took all the random facts and information about salt he could possibly find, flung them into one book, and decided to call it a day. I guess you could say I'm a bit.........salty about reading this book ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"

However, more than once I glazed over and found myself thinking about things other than salt. Like how thirsty I was. Or do we have potato chips in the house? Oh, maybe we have tequila and lime! And so on down the rabbit hole. It turns out that salt taxation details, mining methods, and in depth brining and curing techniques throughout history aren't as riveting as one would think.

I enjoy reading about history, but I learned reading about just salt was incredibly boring. I fell asleep a countless number of times, so if you're having trouble falling asleep... maybe this is worth a read.It seems Kurlansky is trying to show all the different uses of salt and how it evolved through time. Sure, there are many uses I didn't know of, but all in all, not 400+ pages worth. Also, Kurlansky writes about the importance of salt and its impact on the world we live in today. There is no doubt salt was super important, but the story was repetitive. Most of the chapters described the world region, the process they used to create salt, and the type of food they salted.My favorite part of the book was when Kurlansky wrote about the sinkholes caused by too much brine extraction in England. There are a few other good parts of the book, but I would not recommend reading this unless you are really interested in salt.In conclusion, I learned a lot about salt, but felt like the chapters read the same.

If you like history, this book is for you. Don't be dissuaded by the title.

Salt is a necessary component to functioning, makes ice cream freeze, removes rust, makes things taste good, seals cracks, removes spots on coals, preserves food, puts out grease fires, treats sore throats, and ear aches. The average adult human being has about three or four salt shaker in her body! My friend Clare actually actually snacks on sea salt because she finds it satisfies her craving without having to eat heavy junk foods. A substance so valuable, salt served as money, influenced trade routes, inspired wars. Without taking away the power of salt, the same could also be said about different foods, including beer, which I actually enjoyed reading the history of. (See my Fermenting Revolution review)On the other hand, my friend, who can stomach more hardcore history than I, enjoyed me reading to him aloud from Salt. Also, my uncle gives many kudos to the book Cod by the same author--Someday I may get a craving to explore some of these choice jems of chapters, like maybe Nordic salt dreams (which includes recipes), and American salt wars, but for now I am in search of food writing with better narrative flow--"

And of course, it turns out to be one of those books that everyone else in the world seems to like but me.I will admit that there were a lot of chapters of this book that I did enjoy. And I learned many fun facts that I had not previously known: i.e. where the term ""red herring"" comes from, how soy sauce is made, where Tabasco sauce comes from, etc. Also, I did enjoy the author's clever trick of including many old-timey ""salt"" recipes. Not that I'll ever attempt to make any of these recipes, but I bet that the food connoisseurs who read this book will.However, I felt that, around 200 or so pages into this book, it devolved into an awful lot of ""and they made salted fish"" and/or ""and they taxed salt."" Zzzzzzzz. I read a lot of non-fiction. I have a high tolerance for seemingly tedious detail. But seriously, how much detailed explanation of the taxation of salt in 18th century France is one person supposed to endure before falling into a coma?Also, I realize that the author was pushing a very specific agenda here, but if he's to be believed, nearly every major conflict in the history of the world started out as a salt dispute. I find that very hard to swallow. No pun intended.I guess I'll go back to reading my more obscure non-fiction books and leave the bestsellers for the masses."

Also I know no more things about salting fish than is reasonable for any human to know, much less a vegetarian-type human.One of the things this book makes me wonder is, are the subjects of books always so central? One of the chapters of this book basically runs, ‘Salt is THE turning point to the US Civil War,’ which seems fine when you’re reading, but when you think about it, you’re like – slavery, states’ rights, railroads, etc. etc. etc., all of which also seem like they could be touted as ‘THE turning point’ of this conflict as well.I wonder if there are nonfiction books that run instead, ‘well, it’s interesting what people were doing in relation to IMPORTANT BOOK SUBJECT in Important Event, but kind of besides the point.’"

Kurlansky has stuffed a stunning amount of knowledge about this commodity in this book. But he has forgotten to tell a narrative, to look for the bigger picture, to analyse basic economic or cultural trends. And on top of that he has left his critical gaze at home. In the end all he offers is this mumbo jumbo of facts, titbits of knowledge, myths and nice stories, all about salt. I hope one day someone will do a better job. "

198,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45596235-frank-theising,2,"Some interesting material buried within, but overall probably twice as long as it needed to be. I think the casual reader will get bored with this book very quickly. For those with a deeper interest in human history, it is interesting to reflect on how salt played such a crucial role in the development and success (or failure) of various civilizations, business enterprises, and human health over the centuries. Overall, the author really tries to make his subject interesting, but there is only so much you can do with a book centered on a commodity as basic as salt. 2 stars.What follows are a few notes on the content of the book:The book includes a lot of interesting factoids like the incredibly large number of places and things that derive their names from salt (soldier, salad, Salzburg, salary, any English settlement ending in “-wich”, etc.) and lengthy descriptions of the various methods (both ancient and modern) for producing or mass-producing salt in geographically diverse locations around the world. It also includes an excessive number of lists of the items salt makes possible (butter, soy sauce, cheese, gunpowder, caviar, etc etc) and tedious descriptions of ancient recipes that used salt or some derivative (Garum, Brine, etc).Salt is obviously still used a great deal today, but it played a much larger role throughout history prior to widespread use of flash freezing, refrigeration, and canning. Its use in preservation of food and meat (especially salted meats and fish) and later use in the creation of gunpowder, made it an essential commodity, critical to the success and expansion of a number of civilizations from Ancient Egypt and the Chinese Dynasties to the Roman and the British Empires. It was so crucial that many countries feared dependence on “foreign salt” the way America feared dependence on “foreign oil” in the latter half of the 20th Century. Its relative abundance or lack thereof, shaped the outcome of a number of wars and crises including the American and French Revolutions, the U.S. Civil War, and Gandhi’s Indian independence movement. It was often run by state monopoly or heavily taxed to fund government and wars. Salted fish in particular generated a significant amount of global trade and became a prime source of protein for Europe (especially during frequent Holy Days that required abstention from meat).Modern processes have resulted in consistently uniform, white crystals which historically were difficult to produce and prized above less pure salt (which was colored in various shades depending on what impurities from other substances were in it). I did find it odd that the author didn’t even mention iodized salt until nearly the end of the book, and then only in the context of the modern faddish appeal of various colored salts that were historically considered sub-par. He omits any real discussion of Iodine being such an essential element for human health and how adding it to salt was one of the most brilliant and effective public health measures in history (up there with putting fluoride in drinking water). He covers at length the rise of the Morton Salt Company near the end of the book."
199,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17539226-bryan-brown,4,"Fascinating story starting with the prehistory of the earliest recorded salt producing sites to about the year 2000 and the mass production of salt (most of which is no longer used for food). If you have ever wondered about the little shaker on your table or wanted to see why salt is the only rock we eat this book will tell you. One of the things I liked best was the inclusion of historical recipes from different cultures and time periods reflecting how the usage of salt has changed through the centuries. It often includes the histories of famous salted things from the Roman garum (the very distant progenitor of ketchup), to kosher lox, to butter. I also enjoyed learning how salt went from necessity to luxury as supply and demand changed. Most of the modern salt production is no longer made for food, and much has been homogenized into uniform salt crystals controlled by two huge companies. This evolution allowed mass consumers to always get an expected product but also created a niche marked for things like my beloved kosher salt, and the various traditional and sea salts you can now buy at the super food-mart.It is a history book but even non-historians like myself with any interest in salt will enjoy this book."

Within Mark Kurlansky’s book, Salt: A World of History, he provides specific present and past examples of how salt shaped the course of civilizations. In each chapter, Kurlansky focuses on a certain area where salt was excavated, processed, and how it was used. To specify relatable instances, he writes in recipes from ancient cookbooks and chiefs. Even though salt was mainly used for food, Kurlansky provides examples of how salt influenced religious beliefs and patriarchy in certain societies. To show evidence that salt is still a major factor in present day societies, he also writes about archeological discoveries, which were made possible from the preservation of salt. In addition, he writes about the current state of the Dead Sea and the how the company Morton Salt came to be. Even though Mark Kurlansky supplies the reader with specific and interesting evidence of salt, the book seems as if it would never end. Chapters seemed to continue on and recipes seem to be “cooking up” every five pages. The way that Kurlansky writes, he brings the civilizations alive, and with each chapter they evolve within the book. One example is women. He starts of with the women having a little influence in the preservation of salt, but as the book goes on they are the ones preserving. The same goes with the civilizations obtaining the salt. Each society starts off with workers scraping away the salt, however, by the end of the book, there are salt works with hundreds of workers. By the end of the book, the reader has learned about how salt has become a leading mineral in the world and every way possible it can be retrieved. Kurlansky makes sure that the reader knows the whole history of salt, which the title of the book implies. As a whole, Mark Kurlansky tells a non-fiction story of how salt changed the world, but it could have been done in less than for hundred and forty-nine pages. Even though salt’s importance seems to resemble the size of it’s gains, it has played a major role in the course of man. In Salt: A World of History, Mark Kurlansky tells how salt started as just ingredient to make brines, and later turned into a leading product of the world. Within in his book, Kurlansky tells how salt effect civilization such as the Byzantine Empire, Rome, and Ancient Chinese Dynasties. In each of these civilizations, salt was a key factor that allowed the empires to rise to their potential. Besides the civilizations, it also affected the people within them. Both men and women worked with salt, and it was main element in their daily lives. While Kurlansky mainly focused on past influences of salt, he found a way to tie it together with present day. In daily household, there is usually a container of salt to be found, which is produced by Morton. Kurlansky provides the history about this company, so the reader can relate it to their daily life. While the history of salt, seems long and unimportant, some of it needs to be noticed. The Dead Sea, being one of the most unique bodies of water on Earth, is slowly disappearing. This is because of the constant problem of pollution. By reading Kurlansky’s book, the reader can feel his passion for the mineral. Other writers sometimes have trouble bringing their non-fiction book alive with their emotions, but he didn’t have that problem. After reading his book, the reader may be inspired to read many of his other. Although the information in Mark Kurlansky’s book seems to have a little importance in the reader’s daily life, if he or she looks past it all, it’s a non-fiction book that can change his or her life.

I really appreciate that Kurlansky did not forget about the non-Western world in writing about this book (although there is rather more about American salt practices than most other countries--unsurprising, given Kurlansky's language, previous books, and nationality). My only criticism of this book is that it has a tendency toward anecdotes rather than data, especially toward the end. There are no sum-ups or final conclusions drawn in the last few chapters, just a tossed salad of all the random tidbits the author hadn't managed to fit in elsewhere. Still, incredible stuff! Even reading just a few pages of this book will give you material for days' worth of small talk."
210,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"Salt is sexy— really! Think about it: it’s in just about every bodily fluid (wink) and it has shaped human history like almost nothing else. This book covers it all—from 100AD (when ancient Chinese lit up natural gas coming out of brine-water wells to pump out the brine through bamboo tubes into boiling houses to boil the water off the salt), to Venice’s saltworks, to the French Revolution (where the salt tax, known as the gabelle, was a major point of contention), to the American Revolution and Civil War, and to the salt-fueled Indian revolution led by Gandhi. It's not the best microhistory I've ever read, but it was pretty interesting to think about the humble salt's impact on human history in a way you don't usually stop to consider.It was pretty interesting to see how Kurlansky’s interests intersect—the topic of his other books Cod and the Basques are closely related to salt, and feature heavily in one chapter of the book. This book also contains the fun fact that “to sail the seven seas” refers not to seven separate seas, but to a place called the Seven Seas, which was between Venice and the Mainland (before the coastline changed). (Further research indicates this is one of several possible origins for the phrase, but interesting nonetheless). And I’ve added the Polish Wieliczka salt mine to my travel list—an entire underground chapel carved from salt, and a band started almost two hundred years ago to take advantage of the mine’s acoustics, still performing today! But the most astonishing thing, for me, is how many words, place names, and even names of entire cultures come from the word for salt. Some examples:—salacious (salt has long been associated with lewdness). —salary (this one is pretty well known already—Roman soldiers were paid in salt)—soldier (the Latin “sal” became the French “solde” meaning “pay” for the same reasons as “salary”—solde became soldier, the one who is paid)—salad (Romans salted their greens to reduce bitterness)—salsa (Spanish word for sauce comes from Latin for salt) —possible “Gauls” (as in, the Celtic group in France and other parts of Europe)—the Germany city of Halle, Austrian Hallein and Hallstatt, and Spanish Galicia —in France, a menstruating woman is said to be “en salaison” (curing in salt) —Alsace (border of France and Germany) means “land of salt” (als, meaning land, and sel, salt)—Selle Valley of Lorraine —the Romance words for cheese (formaggio, fromage) comes from the wooden cheese mold used to shape and age cheese . . . in salt—anything with the ending “wich,” which was Anglo Saxon for “saltworks.” For instance, a town in Cheshire County, England used to be known by its Celtic name, Hellath du (“black pit,” for the dark salt acquired there), which is the most Lord of the Rings name ever. But it was later renamed “Northwich”—northern saltworks. —Because wich = saltworks, “sandwich” ultimately derives from salt."
211,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2220787-ram,4,"The book is about the history of salt and salt manufacturing, and actually is the history of the world as seen from the salt perspective.I learned many interesting facts about this commodity that we so take for granted in the modern world.Salt has effected so many famous people: Marco Polo, Gandhi, George Washington.Salt production, salt chemistry and salt mining is the basis for thousands of modern and less modern products we use from Liquid bleach, Tabasco sauce, Parmigiano-Reggiano and many more.The salt tax in India pushed Gandhi to start the passive rebellion that helped lead to independence.Marco Polo discovered sophisticated salt industry in China.The war George Washington led for independence from England was partly incited by salt shortages.All the towns in England that end with ""wich"" produced saltSalzburg is ""salt town"" and Alsace is ""land of salt""So…. If you are interested in a new, unexpected and original viewpoint of our history, read this book."
212,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/798978-barbara,3,"This audiobook was a real slog. At almost 14 hours long, I had to speed it up to 1.5 speed to get through it. Of course it's my own fault for imagining a book this long about salt could be engaging. Nonetheless there were some interesting factoids I collected. There were fights centuries ago in England when people's land started caving in when salt brine was extracted from subterranean levels. At the time if I got this right, people actually retained the rights to what was under their land. But the salt exploiters claimed that extracting the brine helped the local economy. So what if huge sinkholes started appearing everywhere. Now I know there had to be geologists and engineers warning oil companies that fracking was problematic.Of course salt led to wars. An excellent example is Gandhi and the Salt Marsh protests in 1930 which led to protests again British rule, but was started over battles over the rights to collect salt.http://www.history.com/topics/salt-marchThis is a book that would appeal to some history buffs as well as those interested in who has the right to exploit natural resources. Lots of interesting history in this book but just too much of it."
213,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60470245-amber,1,"This book is very informative and exhaustive but honestly it is also very boring. The structure is too much of an incohesive infodump to make the book compelling and the author does very little to make the material engaging and relevant to the reader. There are some short parts, mostly in the last third, that are fairly interesting, but this feels more like dumb luck than good writing. It feels like, rather than carefully curating which topics and subtopics would be interesting to his audience, the author simply took all the random facts and information about salt he could possibly find, flung them into one book, and decided to call it a day. I guess you could say I'm a bit.........salty about reading this book ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
214,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16915904-cindy,3,"Whew! Salt. Almost 500 pages of salt. This one took me a bit to get through. I did learn a lot. However, more than once I glazed over and found myself thinking about things other than salt. Like how thirsty I was. Or do we have potato chips in the house? Oh, maybe we have tequila and lime! And so on down the rabbit hole. It turns out that salt taxation details, mining methods, and in depth brining and curing techniques throughout history aren't as riveting as one would think. I do wish there was more of a narrative or something tying the salty bits together. It read more like a list of unconnected facts in a text book to this ADHD girl."
215,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2644090-erica,5,This is my most-favorite non-fiction book. I find it fascinating and enjoy something new every time I read or listen to it.

I enjoy reading about history, but I learned reading about just salt was incredibly boring. I fell asleep a countless number of times, so if you're having trouble falling asleep... maybe this is worth a read.It seems Kurlansky is trying to show all the different uses of salt and how it evolved through time. Sure, there are many uses I didn't know of, but all in all, not 400+ pages worth. Also, Kurlansky writes about the importance of salt and its impact on the world we live in today. There is no doubt salt was super important, but the story was repetitive. Most of the chapters described the world region, the process they used to create salt, and the type of food they salted.My favorite part of the book was when Kurlansky wrote about the sinkholes caused by too much brine extraction in England. There are a few other good parts of the book, but I would not recommend reading this unless you are really interested in salt.In conclusion, I learned a lot about salt, but felt like the chapters read the same. I will most likely never reread this book."
217,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27408667-dragana,5,"It is a long book with a lot of facts but it brings vast knowledge to the reader. It brings comprehension of the huge impact salt had to World history, trade, politics and influence on so many other nations, foods, places.I have learnt now everything from how ketchup was made to how Early China economy depended on salt tax."
218,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28781546-ana,3,"While I do think that the stories could've been better tied together, the book presented salt in a new way for me. Plus, the old-school recipes were really interesting, if a little gross."

This is a remarkable book; for all the territory that's covered, I didn't feel like there was any skimping on the details or blathering on and on. It's all interesting, from all the innovation to all the injustice involved in extracting salt. Plus, weird recipes. Recommend."
220,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85516939-loukios-nousios,5,"What an incredible book. I expected a boring account of salt being used to feed armies, salt roads etc. What I got instead is a fantastic, really well written and humorous account of how a simple commodity like salt affected everything from food and preservation of goods, to countries economies, fueled wars and led to revolutions. If you like history, this book is for you. Don't be dissuaded by the title. It's not a book about salt, but rather a history of the world and how salt was a protagonist through serendipity, greed, necessity and the forward momentum of advancing technology."
221,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/719804-olivia,0,"I have tried to digest this book called Salt, especially as a food reviewer, and a history buff in training, but I think I will throw it over my left shoulder as I can't get past the taste of the endless first chapter on ancient Asian governments.The book is pretty well written and full of great pictures and interesting salty tid-bits, but maybe its a bit too ambitious to try to tell the history of the world through a pure salt perspective?!The value of the mineral, and the elaborate way it was mined in ancient times, is truly fascinating, but Kurlansky can go four-plus bland pages of minutia of Asian emperor names, follies, and dates of reign, without even a dash of the word SALT!!!Some treats for you: Salt is the only rock we eat! Salt is a necessary component to functioning, makes ice cream freeze, removes rust, makes things taste good, seals cracks, removes spots on coals, preserves food, puts out grease fires, treats sore throats, and ear aches. The average adult human being has about three or four salt shaker in her body! My friend Clare actually actually snacks on sea salt because she finds it satisfies her craving without having to eat heavy junk foods. A substance so valuable, salt served as money, influenced trade routes, inspired wars. Without taking away the power of salt, the same could also be said about different foods, including beer, which I actually enjoyed reading the history of. (See my Fermenting Revolution review)On the other hand, my friend, who can stomach more hardcore history than I, enjoyed me reading to him aloud from Salt. Also, my uncle gives many kudos to the book Cod by the same author--Someday I may get a craving to explore some of these choice jems of chapters, like maybe Nordic salt dreams (which includes recipes), and American salt wars, but for now I am in search of food writing with better narrative flow--"
222,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2073876-jan,2,"For years, I kept hearing about how awesome this book was. Everyone has praised it up and down. So when I finally got around to picking up a copy of it, I was feeling pretty excited. And of course, it turns out to be one of those books that everyone else in the world seems to like but me.I will admit that there were a lot of chapters of this book that I did enjoy. And I learned many fun facts that I had not previously known: i.e. where the term ""red herring"" comes from, how soy sauce is made, where Tabasco sauce comes from, etc. Also, I did enjoy the author's clever trick of including many old-timey ""salt"" recipes. Not that I'll ever attempt to make any of these recipes, but I bet that the food connoisseurs who read this book will.However, I felt that, around 200 or so pages into this book, it devolved into an awful lot of ""and they made salted fish"" and/or ""and they taxed salt."" Zzzzzzzz. I read a lot of non-fiction. I have a high tolerance for seemingly tedious detail. But seriously, how much detailed explanation of the taxation of salt in 18th century France is one person supposed to endure before falling into a coma?Also, I realize that the author was pushing a very specific agenda here, but if he's to be believed, nearly every major conflict in the history of the world started out as a salt dispute. I find that very hard to swallow. No pun intended.I guess I'll go back to reading my more obscure non-fiction books and leave the bestsellers for the masses."

Also I know no more things about salting fish than is reasonable for any human to know, much less a vegetarian-type human.One of the things this book makes me wonder is, are the subjects of books always so central? One of the chapters of this book basically runs, ‘Salt is THE turning point to the US Civil War,’ which seems fine when you’re reading, but when you think about it, you’re like – slavery, states’ rights, railroads, etc. etc. etc., all of which also seem like they could be touted as ‘THE turning point’ of this conflict as well.I wonder if there are nonfiction books that run instead, ‘well, it’s interesting what people were doing in relation to IMPORTANT BOOK SUBJECT in Important Event, but kind of besides the point.’"
224,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26055396-sense-of-history,1,"No, this is certainly not a World History of Salt. Oh yes, I concede: there's a lot of salt in it. Kurlansky has stuffed a stunning amount of knowledge about this commodity in this book. But he has forgotten to tell a narrative, to look for the bigger picture, to analyse basic economic or cultural trends. And on top of that he has left his critical gaze at home. In the end all he offers is this mumbo jumbo of facts, titbits of knowledge, myths and nice stories, all about salt. I hope one day someone will do a better job. "

227,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10716214-margaret,0,Did not finish.Got just over half way through when the author started repeating himself. It started to feel like 'Groundhog Day' in hardback.
228,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45596235-frank-theising,2,"Some interesting material buried within, but overall probably twice as long as it needed to be. I think the casual reader will get bored with this book very quickly. For those with a deeper interest in human history, it is interesting to reflect on how salt played such a crucial role in the development and success (or failure) of various civilizations, business enterprises, and human health over the centuries. Overall, the author really tries to make his subject interesting, but there is only so much you can do with a book centered on a commodity as basic as salt. 2 stars.What follows are a few notes on the content of the book:The book includes a lot of interesting factoids like the incredibly large number of places and things that derive their names from salt (soldier, salad, Salzburg, salary, any English settlement ending in “-wich”, etc.) and lengthy descriptions of the various methods (both ancient and modern) for producing or mass-producing salt in geographically diverse locations around the world. It also includes an excessive number of lists of the items salt makes possible (butter, soy sauce, cheese, gunpowder, caviar, etc etc) and tedious descriptions of ancient recipes that used salt or some derivative (Garum, Brine, etc).Salt is obviously still used a great deal today, but it played a much larger role throughout history prior to widespread use of flash freezing, refrigeration, and canning. Its use in preservation of food and meat (especially salted meats and fish) and later use in the creation of gunpowder, made it an essential commodity, critical to the success and expansion of a number of civilizations from Ancient Egypt and the Chinese Dynasties to the Roman and the British Empires. It was so crucial that many countries feared dependence on “foreign salt” the way America feared dependence on “foreign oil” in the latter half of the 20th Century. Its relative abundance or lack thereof, shaped the outcome of a number of wars and crises including the American and French Revolutions, the U.S. Civil War, and Gandhi’s Indian independence movement. It was often run by state monopoly or heavily taxed to fund government and wars. Salted fish in particular generated a significant amount of global trade and became a prime source of protein for Europe (especially during frequent Holy Days that required abstention from meat).Modern processes have resulted in consistently uniform, white crystals which historically were difficult to produce and prized above less pure salt (which was colored in various shades depending on what impurities from other substances were in it). I did find it odd that the author didn’t even mention iodized salt until nearly the end of the book, and then only in the context of the modern faddish appeal of various colored salts that were historically considered sub-par. He omits any real discussion of Iodine being such an essential element for human health and how adding it to salt was one of the most brilliant and effective public health measures in history (up there with putting fluoride in drinking water). He covers at length the rise of the Morton Salt Company near the end of the book."
229,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17539226-bryan-brown,4,"Fascinating story starting with the prehistory of the earliest recorded salt producing sites to about the year 2000 and the mass production of salt (most of which is no longer used for food). If you have ever wondered about the little shaker on your table or wanted to see why salt is the only rock we eat this book will tell you. One of the things I liked best was the inclusion of historical recipes from different cultures and time periods reflecting how the usage of salt has changed through the centuries. It often includes the histories of famous salted things from the Roman garum (the very distant progenitor of ketchup), to kosher lox, to butter. I also enjoyed learning how salt went from necessity to luxury as supply and demand changed. Most of the modern salt production is no longer made for food, and much has been homogenized into uniform salt crystals controlled by two huge companies. This evolution allowed mass consumers to always get an expected product but also created a niche marked for things like my beloved kosher salt, and the various traditional and sea salts you can now buy at the super food-mart.It is a history book but even non-historians like myself with any interest in salt will enjoy this book."

I had nothing to do and also had no WiFi when on my month long trip to Ethiopia and could not for the life of me get through this book. It is so dry. I got through maybe four chapters and called it quits.

233,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43651738-sabrina-godin,4,"Throughout history, the common household mineral, salt, was obtained for usages from food to religious beliefs to archeological discoveries. Within Mark Kurlansky’s book, Salt: A World of History, he provides specific present and past examples of how salt shaped the course of civilizations. In each chapter, Kurlansky focuses on a certain area where salt was excavated, processed, and how it was used. To specify relatable instances, he writes in recipes from ancient cookbooks and chiefs. Even though salt was mainly used for food, Kurlansky provides examples of how salt influenced religious beliefs and patriarchy in certain societies. To show evidence that salt is still a major factor in present day societies, he also writes about archeological discoveries, which were made possible from the preservation of salt. In addition, he writes about the current state of the Dead Sea and the how the company Morton Salt came to be. Even though Mark Kurlansky supplies the reader with specific and interesting evidence of salt, the book seems as if it would never end. Chapters seemed to continue on and recipes seem to be “cooking up” every five pages. The way that Kurlansky writes, he brings the civilizations alive, and with each chapter they evolve within the book. One example is women. He starts of with the women having a little influence in the preservation of salt, but as the book goes on they are the ones preserving. The same goes with the civilizations obtaining the salt. Each society starts off with workers scraping away the salt, however, by the end of the book, there are salt works with hundreds of workers. By the end of the book, the reader has learned about how salt has become a leading mineral in the world and every way possible it can be retrieved. Kurlansky makes sure that the reader knows the whole history of salt, which the title of the book implies. As a whole, Mark Kurlansky tells a non-fiction story of how salt changed the world, but it could have been done in less than for hundred and forty-nine pages. Even though salt’s importance seems to resemble the size of it’s gains, it has played a major role in the course of man. In Salt: A World of History, Mark Kurlansky tells how salt started as just ingredient to make brines, and later turned into a leading product of the world. Within in his book, Kurlansky tells how salt effect civilization such as the Byzantine Empire, Rome, and Ancient Chinese Dynasties. In each of these civilizations, salt was a key factor that allowed the empires to rise to their potential. Besides the civilizations, it also affected the people within them. Both men and women worked with salt, and it was main element in their daily lives. While Kurlansky mainly focused on past influences of salt, he found a way to tie it together with present day. In daily household, there is usually a container of salt to be found, which is produced by Morton. Kurlansky provides the history about this company, so the reader can relate it to their daily life. While the history of salt, seems long and unimportant, some of it needs to be noticed. The Dead Sea, being one of the most unique bodies of water on Earth, is slowly disappearing. This is because of the constant problem of pollution. By reading Kurlansky’s book, the reader can feel his passion for the mineral. Other writers sometimes have trouble bringing their non-fiction book alive with their emotions, but he didn’t have that problem. After reading his book, the reader may be inspired to read many of his other. Although the information in Mark Kurlansky’s book seems to have a little importance in the reader’s daily life, if he or she looks past it all, it’s a non-fiction book that can change his or her life.

When you first hear the title of this book, one's first reaction is generally to chuckle because, let's be serious, what is there to the history of salt? It's just a mineral!Well, Kurlansky tells us that there is a lot to the history of salt and that our lives and history are intricately tied to the location and usage of salt in society. I learned a great deal in this book, and not just about salt (the chapter on how to make soy sauce and garum is fascinating). The best part of this book is the way Kurlansky tells us about salt - he is clearly very passionate about this topic, and he goes into create detail in the history, chemical, and nature of salt. Sure, sometimes he's a little goofy (he, only somewhat seriously, suggests a link to the Confederates losing to a salt crisis), but little vignettes like that are what make this book. I would highly recommend this book. I found myself talking about its contents at parties, and most people seemed fascinated. For something we use everyday without a second though, there is quite a bit of history behind this tasty mineral. Also for nonfiction, this book is easy to read and fun. I think most people could read this book without too much difficulty and find themselves a little happier and more knowledgeable by the end of it."

On page 4 of the introduction, there is an engraving dating from 1157 of a bunch of women holding down a partially disrobed man titled ""Women Salting Their Husbands"". ""With this salting, front and back, At last strong natures they will not lack."" OK, I was hooked. (Thankfully, I've been able to avoid being salted myself so far.)You can open this book on almost any page and find something interesting. I just opened to page 111...""Fresh whale meat was also for the rich. The great delicacy was the tongue. Salted tongue of any kind was appreciated, but especially whale tongue. For the poor, there was craspois, also called craspoix, or grapois.

My only criticism of this book is that it has a tendency toward anecdotes rather than data, especially toward the end. There are no sum-ups or final conclusions drawn in the last few chapters, just a tossed salad of all the random tidbits the author hadn't managed to fit in elsewhere. Still, incredible stuff!

Think about it: it’s in just about every bodily fluid (wink) and it has shaped human history like almost nothing else. This book covers it all—from 100AD (when ancient Chinese lit up natural gas coming out of brine-water wells to pump out the brine through bamboo tubes into boiling houses to boil the water off the salt), to Venice’s saltworks, to the French Revolution (where the salt tax, known as the gabelle, was a major point of contention), to the American Revolution and Civil War, and to the salt-fueled Indian revolution led by Gandhi. It's not the best microhistory I've ever read, but it was pretty interesting to think about the humble salt's impact on human history in a way you don't usually stop to consider.It was pretty interesting to see how Kurlansky’s interests intersect—the topic of his other books Cod and the Basques are closely related to salt, and feature heavily in one chapter of the book. This book also contains the fun fact that “to sail the seven seas” refers not to seven separate seas, but to a place called the Seven Seas, which was between Venice and the Mainland (before the coastline changed). (Further research indicates this is one of several possible origins for the phrase, but interesting nonetheless). And I’ve added the Polish Wieliczka salt mine to my travel list—an entire underground chapel carved from salt, and a band started almost two hundred years ago to take advantage of the mine’s acoustics, still performing today! But the most astonishing thing, for me, is how many words, place names, and even names of entire cultures come from the word for salt. Some examples:—salacious (salt has long been associated with lewdness). —salary (this one is pretty well known already—Roman soldiers were paid in salt)—soldier (the Latin “sal” became the French “solde” meaning “pay” for the same reasons as “salary”—solde became soldier, the one who is paid)—salad (Romans salted their greens to reduce bitterness)—salsa (Spanish word for sauce comes from Latin for salt) —possible “Gauls” (as in, the Celtic group in France and other parts of Europe)—the Germany city of Halle, Austrian Hallein and Hallstatt, and Spanish Galicia —in France, a menstruating woman is said to be “en salaison” (curing in salt) —Alsace (border of France and Germany) means “land of salt” (als, meaning land, and sel, salt)—Selle Valley of Lorraine —the Romance words for cheese (formaggio, fromage) comes from the wooden cheese mold used to shape and age cheese . . . in salt—anything with the ending “wich,” which was Anglo Saxon for “saltworks.” For instance, a town in Cheshire County, England used to be known by its Celtic name, Hellath du (“black pit,” for the dark salt acquired there), which is the most Lord of the Rings name ever. But it was later renamed “Northwich”—northern saltworks. —Because wich = saltworks, “sandwich” ultimately derives from salt."

Of course it's my own fault for imagining a book this long about salt could be engaging. Nonetheless there were some interesting factoids I collected. There were fights centuries ago in England when people's land started caving in when salt brine was extracted from subterranean levels. At the time if I got this right, people actually retained the rights to what was under their land. But the salt exploiters claimed that extracting the brine helped the local economy. So what if huge sinkholes started appearing everywhere. Now I know there had to be geologists and engineers warning oil companies that fracking was problematic.Of course salt led to wars. An excellent example is Gandhi and the Salt Marsh protests in 1930 which led to protests again British rule, but was started over battles over the rights to collect salt.http://www.history.com/topics/salt-marchThis is a book that would appeal to some history buffs as well as those interested in who has the right to exploit natural resources.

The structure is too much of an incohesive infodump to make the book compelling and the author does very little to make the material engaging and relevant to the reader. There are some short parts, mostly in the last third, that are fairly interesting, but this feels more like dumb luck than good writing. It feels like, rather than carefully curating which topics and subtopics would be interesting to his audience, the author simply took all the random facts and information about salt he could possibly find, flung them into one book, and decided to call it a day. I guess you could say I'm a bit.........salty about reading this book ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"

However, more than once I glazed over and found myself thinking about things other than salt. Like how thirsty I was. Or do we have potato chips in the house? Oh, maybe we have tequila and lime! And so on down the rabbit hole. It turns out that salt taxation details, mining methods, and in depth brining and curing techniques throughout history aren't as riveting as one would think. I do wish there was more of a narrative or something tying the salty bits together. It read more like a list of unconnected facts in a text book to this ADHD girl."

I enjoy reading about history, but I learned reading about just salt was incredibly boring. I fell asleep a countless number of times, so if you're having trouble falling asleep... maybe this is worth a read.It seems Kurlansky is trying to show all the different uses of salt and how it evolved through time. Sure, there are many uses I didn't know of, but all in all, not 400+ pages worth. Also, Kurlansky writes about the importance of salt and its impact on the world we live in today. There is no doubt salt was super important, but the story was repetitive. Most of the chapters described the world region, the process they used to create salt, and the type of food they salted.My favorite part of the book was when Kurlansky wrote about the sinkholes caused by too much brine extraction in England. There are a few other good parts of the book, but I would not recommend reading this unless you are really interested in salt.In conclusion, I learned a lot about salt, but felt like the chapters read the same. I will most likely never reread this book."

I expected a boring account of salt being used to feed armies, salt roads etc. What I got instead is a fantastic, really well written and humorous account of how a simple commodity like salt affected everything from food and preservation of goods, to countries economies, fueled wars and led to revolutions. If you like history, this book is for you. Don't be dissuaded by the title. It's not a book about salt, but rather a history of the world and how salt was a protagonist through serendipity, greed, necessity and the forward momentum of advancing technology."
251,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/719804-olivia,0,"I have tried to digest this book called Salt, especially as a food reviewer, and a history buff in training, but I think I will throw it over my left shoulder as I can't get past the taste of the endless first chapter on ancient Asian governments.The book is pretty well written and full of great pictures and interesting salty tid-bits, but maybe its a bit too ambitious to try to tell the history of the world through a pure salt perspective?!The value of the mineral, and the elaborate way it was mined in ancient times, is truly fascinating, but Kurlansky can go four-plus bland pages of minutia of Asian emperor names, follies, and dates of reign, without even a dash of the word SALT!!!Some treats for you: Salt is the only rock we eat! Salt is a necessary component to functioning, makes ice cream freeze, removes rust, makes things taste good, seals cracks, removes spots on coals, preserves food, puts out grease fires, treats sore throats, and ear aches. The average adult human being has about three or four salt shaker in her body! My friend Clare actually actually snacks on sea salt because she finds it satisfies her craving without having to eat heavy junk foods. A substance so valuable, salt served as money, influenced trade routes, inspired wars. Without taking away the power of salt, the same could also be said about different foods, including beer, which I actually enjoyed reading the history of. (See my Fermenting Revolution review)On the other hand, my friend, who can stomach more hardcore history than I, enjoyed me reading to him aloud from Salt. Also, my uncle gives many kudos to the book Cod by the same author--Someday I may get a craving to explore some of these choice jems of chapters, like maybe Nordic salt dreams (which includes recipes), and American salt wars, but for now I am in search of food writing with better narrative flow--"

So when I finally got around to picking up a copy of it, I was feeling pretty excited. And of course, it turns out to be one of those books that everyone else in the world seems to like but me.I will admit that there were a lot of chapters of this book that I did enjoy. And I learned many fun facts that I had not previously known: i.e. where the term ""red herring"" comes from, how soy sauce is made, where Tabasco sauce comes from, etc. Also, I did enjoy the author's clever trick of including many old-timey ""salt"" recipes. Not that I'll ever attempt to make any of these recipes, but I bet that the food connoisseurs who read this book will.However, I felt that, around 200 or so pages into this book, it devolved into an awful lot of ""and they made salted fish"" and/or ""and they taxed salt."" Zzzzzzzz. I read a lot of non-fiction. I have a high tolerance for seemingly tedious detail. But seriously, how much detailed explanation of the taxation of salt in 18th century France is one person supposed to endure before falling into a coma?Also, I realize that the author was pushing a very specific agenda here, but if he's to be believed, nearly every major conflict in the history of the world started out as a salt dispute. I find that very hard to swallow. No pun intended.I guess I'll go back to reading my more obscure non-fiction books and leave the bestsellers for the masses."

Also I know no more things about salting fish than is reasonable for any human to know, much less a vegetarian-type human.One of the things this book makes me wonder is, are the subjects of books always so central? One of the chapters of this book basically runs, ‘Salt is THE turning point to the US Civil War,’ which seems fine when you’re reading, but when you think about it, you’re like – slavery, states’ rights, railroads, etc. etc. etc., all of which also seem like they could be touted as ‘THE turning point’ of this conflict as well.I wonder if there are nonfiction books that run instead, ‘well, it’s interesting what people were doing in relation to IMPORTANT BOOK SUBJECT in Important Event, but kind of besides the point.’"

Kurlansky has stuffed a stunning amount of knowledge about this commodity in this book. But he has forgotten to tell a narrative, to look for the bigger picture, to analyse basic economic or cultural trends. And on top of that he has left his critical gaze at home. In the end all he offers is this mumbo jumbo of facts, titbits of knowledge, myths and nice stories, all about salt. I hope one day someone will do a better job. "

258,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45596235-frank-theising,2,"Some interesting material buried within, but overall probably twice as long as it needed to be. I think the casual reader will get bored with this book very quickly. For those with a deeper interest in human history, it is interesting to reflect on how salt played such a crucial role in the development and success (or failure) of various civilizations, business enterprises, and human health over the centuries. Overall, the author really tries to make his subject interesting, but there is only so much you can do with a book centered on a commodity as basic as salt. 2 stars.What follows are a few notes on the content of the book:The book includes a lot of interesting factoids like the incredibly large number of places and things that derive their names from salt (soldier, salad, Salzburg, salary, any English settlement ending in “-wich”, etc.) and lengthy descriptions of the various methods (both ancient and modern) for producing or mass-producing salt in geographically diverse locations around the world. It also includes an excessive number of lists of the items salt makes possible (butter, soy sauce, cheese, gunpowder, caviar, etc etc) and tedious descriptions of ancient recipes that used salt or some derivative (Garum, Brine, etc).Salt is obviously still used a great deal today, but it played a much larger role throughout history prior to widespread use of flash freezing, refrigeration, and canning. Its use in preservation of food and meat (especially salted meats and fish) and later use in the creation of gunpowder, made it an essential commodity, critical to the success and expansion of a number of civilizations from Ancient Egypt and the Chinese Dynasties to the Roman and the British Empires. It was so crucial that many countries feared dependence on “foreign salt” the way America feared dependence on “foreign oil” in the latter half of the 20th Century. Its relative abundance or lack thereof, shaped the outcome of a number of wars and crises including the American and French Revolutions, the U.S. Civil War, and Gandhi’s Indian independence movement. It was often run by state monopoly or heavily taxed to fund government and wars. Salted fish in particular generated a significant amount of global trade and became a prime source of protein for Europe (especially during frequent Holy Days that required abstention from meat).Modern processes have resulted in consistently uniform, white crystals which historically were difficult to produce and prized above less pure salt (which was colored in various shades depending on what impurities from other substances were in it). I did find it odd that the author didn’t even mention iodized salt until nearly the end of the book, and then only in the context of the modern faddish appeal of various colored salts that were historically considered sub-par. He omits any real discussion of Iodine being such an essential element for human health and how adding it to salt was one of the most brilliant and effective public health measures in history (up there with putting fluoride in drinking water). He covers at length the rise of the Morton Salt Company near the end of the book."
259,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17539226-bryan-brown,4,"Fascinating story starting with the prehistory of the earliest recorded salt producing sites to about the year 2000 and the mass production of salt (most of which is no longer used for food). If you have ever wondered about the little shaker on your table or wanted to see why salt is the only rock we eat this book will tell you. One of the things I liked best was the inclusion of historical recipes from different cultures and time periods reflecting how the usage of salt has changed through the centuries. It often includes the histories of famous salted things from the Roman garum (the very distant progenitor of ketchup), to kosher lox, to butter. I also enjoyed learning how salt went from necessity to luxury as supply and demand changed. Most of the modern salt production is no longer made for food, and much has been homogenized into uniform salt crystals controlled by two huge companies. This evolution allowed mass consumers to always get an expected product but also created a niche marked for things like my beloved kosher salt, and the various traditional and sea salts you can now buy at the super food-mart.It is a history book but even non-historians like myself with any interest in salt will enjoy this book."

263,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43651738-sabrina-godin,4,"Throughout history, the common household mineral, salt, was obtained for usages from food to religious beliefs to archeological discoveries. Within Mark Kurlansky’s book, Salt: A World of History, he provides specific present and past examples of how salt shaped the course of civilizations. In each chapter, Kurlansky focuses on a certain area where salt was excavated, processed, and how it was used. To specify relatable instances, he writes in recipes from ancient cookbooks and chiefs. Even though salt was mainly used for food, Kurlansky provides examples of how salt influenced religious beliefs and patriarchy in certain societies. To show evidence that salt is still a major factor in present day societies, he also writes about archeological discoveries, which were made possible from the preservation of salt. In addition, he writes about the current state of the Dead Sea and the how the company Morton Salt came to be. Even though Mark Kurlansky supplies the reader with specific and interesting evidence of salt, the book seems as if it would never end. Chapters seemed to continue on and recipes seem to be “cooking up” every five pages. The way that Kurlansky writes, he brings the civilizations alive, and with each chapter they evolve within the book. One example is women. He starts of with the women having a little influence in the preservation of salt, but as the book goes on they are the ones preserving. The same goes with the civilizations obtaining the salt. Each society starts off with workers scraping away the salt, however, by the end of the book, there are salt works with hundreds of workers. By the end of the book, the reader has learned about how salt has become a leading mineral in the world and every way possible it can be retrieved. Kurlansky makes sure that the reader knows the whole history of salt, which the title of the book implies. As a whole, Mark Kurlansky tells a non-fiction story of how salt changed the world, but it could have been done in less than for hundred and forty-nine pages. Even though salt’s importance seems to resemble the size of it’s gains, it has played a major role in the course of man. In Salt: A World of History, Mark Kurlansky tells how salt started as just ingredient to make brines, and later turned into a leading product of the world. Within in his book, Kurlansky tells how salt effect civilization such as the Byzantine Empire, Rome, and Ancient Chinese Dynasties. In each of these civilizations, salt was a key factor that allowed the empires to rise to their potential. Besides the civilizations, it also affected the people within them. Both men and women worked with salt, and it was main element in their daily lives. While Kurlansky mainly focused on past influences of salt, he found a way to tie it together with present day. In daily household, there is usually a container of salt to be found, which is produced by Morton. Kurlansky provides the history about this company, so the reader can relate it to their daily life. While the history of salt, seems long and unimportant, some of it needs to be noticed. The Dead Sea, being one of the most unique bodies of water on Earth, is slowly disappearing. This is because of the constant problem of pollution. By reading Kurlansky’s book, the reader can feel his passion for the mineral. Other writers sometimes have trouble bringing their non-fiction book alive with their emotions, but he didn’t have that problem. After reading his book, the reader may be inspired to read many of his other. Although the information in Mark Kurlansky’s book seems to have a little importance in the reader’s daily life, if he or she looks past it all, it’s a non-fiction book that can change his or her life.

When you first hear the title of this book, one's first reaction is generally to chuckle because, let's be serious, what is there to the history of salt? It's just a mineral!Well, Kurlansky tells us that there is a lot to the history of salt and that our lives and history are intricately tied to the location and usage of salt in society. I learned a great deal in this book, and not just about salt (the chapter on how to make soy sauce and garum is fascinating). The best part of this book is the way Kurlansky tells us about salt - he is clearly very passionate about this topic, and he goes into create detail in the history, chemical, and nature of salt. Sure, sometimes he's a little goofy (he, only somewhat seriously, suggests a link to the Confederates losing to a salt crisis), but little vignettes like that are what make this book. I would highly recommend this book. I found myself talking about its contents at parties, and most people seemed fascinated. For something we use everyday without a second though, there is quite a bit of history behind this tasty mineral. Also for nonfiction, this book is easy to read and fun. I think most people could read this book without too much difficulty and find themselves a little happier and more knowledgeable by the end of it."

On page 4 of the introduction, there is an engraving dating from 1157 of a bunch of women holding down a partially disrobed man titled ""Women Salting Their Husbands"". ""With this salting, front and back, At last strong natures they will not lack."" OK, I was hooked. (Thankfully, I've been able to avoid being salted myself so far.)You can open this book on almost any page and find something interesting. I just opened to page 111...""Fresh whale meat was also for the rich. The great delicacy was the tongue. Salted tongue of any kind was appreciated, but especially whale tongue. For the poor, there was craspois, also called craspoix, or grapois. This was strips of the fattier parts of the whale, salt cured like bacon and sometimes called in French lard de careme, which translates as 'lent blubber'...""All kinds of stuff like that.

I really appreciate that Kurlansky did not forget about the non-Western world in writing about this book (although there is rather more about American salt practices than most other countries--unsurprising, given Kurlansky's language, previous books, and nationality). My only criticism of this book is that it has a tendency toward anecdotes rather than data, especially toward the end. There are no sum-ups or final conclusions drawn in the last few chapters, just a tossed salad of all the random tidbits the author hadn't managed to fit in elsewhere. Still, incredible stuff! Even reading just a few pages of this book will give you material for days' worth of small talk."
270,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"Salt is sexy— really! Think about it: it’s in just about every bodily fluid (wink) and it has shaped human history like almost nothing else. This book covers it all—from 100AD (when ancient Chinese lit up natural gas coming out of brine-water wells to pump out the brine through bamboo tubes into boiling houses to boil the water off the salt), to Venice’s saltworks, to the French Revolution (where the salt tax, known as the gabelle, was a major point of contention), to the American Revolution and Civil War, and to the salt-fueled Indian revolution led by Gandhi. It's not the best microhistory I've ever read, but it was pretty interesting to think about the humble salt's impact on human history in a way you don't usually stop to consider.It was pretty interesting to see how Kurlansky’s interests intersect—the topic of his other books Cod and the Basques are closely related to salt, and feature heavily in one chapter of the book. This book also contains the fun fact that “to sail the seven seas” refers not to seven separate seas, but to a place called the Seven Seas, which was between Venice and the Mainland (before the coastline changed). (Further research indicates this is one of several possible origins for the phrase, but interesting nonetheless). And I’ve added the Polish Wieliczka salt mine to my travel list—an entire underground chapel carved from salt, and a band started almost two hundred years ago to take advantage of the mine’s acoustics, still performing today! But the most astonishing thing, for me, is how many words, place names, and even names of entire cultures come from the word for salt. Some examples:—salacious (salt has long been associated with lewdness). —salary (this one is pretty well known already—Roman soldiers were paid in salt)—soldier (the Latin “sal” became the French “solde” meaning “pay” for the same reasons as “salary”—solde became soldier, the one who is paid)—salad (Romans salted their greens to reduce bitterness)—salsa (Spanish word for sauce comes from Latin for salt) —possible “Gauls” (as in, the Celtic group in France and other parts of Europe)—the Germany city of Halle, Austrian Hallein and Hallstatt, and Spanish Galicia —in France, a menstruating woman is said to be “en salaison” (curing in salt) —Alsace (border of France and Germany) means “land of salt” (als, meaning land, and sel, salt)—Selle Valley of Lorraine —the Romance words for cheese (formaggio, fromage) comes from the wooden cheese mold used to shape and age cheese . . . in salt—anything with the ending “wich,” which was Anglo Saxon for “saltworks.” For instance, a town in Cheshire County, England used to be known by its Celtic name, Hellath du (“black pit,” for the dark salt acquired there), which is the most Lord of the Rings name ever. But it was later renamed “Northwich”—northern saltworks. —Because wich = saltworks, “sandwich” ultimately derives from salt."

Of course it's my own fault for imagining a book this long about salt could be engaging. Nonetheless there were some interesting factoids I collected. There were fights centuries ago in England when people's land started caving in when salt brine was extracted from subterranean levels. At the time if I got this right, people actually retained the rights to what was under their land. But the salt exploiters claimed that extracting the brine helped the local economy. So what if huge sinkholes started appearing everywhere. Now I know there had to be geologists and engineers warning oil companies that fracking was problematic.Of course salt led to wars. An excellent example is Gandhi and the Salt Marsh protests in 1930 which led to protests again British rule, but was started over battles over the rights to collect salt.http://www.history.com/topics/salt-marchThis is a book that would appeal to some history buffs as well as those interested in who has the right to exploit natural resources. Lots of interesting history in this book but just too much of it."

The structure is too much of an incohesive infodump to make the book compelling and the author does very little to make the material engaging and relevant to the reader. There are some short parts, mostly in the last third, that are fairly interesting, but this feels more like dumb luck than good writing. It feels like, rather than carefully curating which topics and subtopics would be interesting to his audience, the author simply took all the random facts and information about salt he could possibly find, flung them into one book, and decided to call it a day. I guess you could say I'm a bit.........salty about reading this book ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
274,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16915904-cindy,3,"Whew! Salt. Almost 500 pages of salt. This one took me a bit to get through. I did learn a lot. However, more than once I glazed over and found myself thinking about things other than salt. Like how thirsty I was. Or do we have potato chips in the house? Oh, maybe we have tequila and lime! And so on down the rabbit hole. It turns out that salt taxation details, mining methods, and in depth brining and curing techniques throughout history aren't as riveting as one would think. I do wish there was more of a narrative or something tying the salty bits together. It read more like a list of unconnected facts in a text book to this ADHD girl."
275,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2644090-erica,5,This is my most-favorite non-fiction book. I find it fascinating and enjoy something new every time I read or listen to it.

I enjoy reading about history, but I learned reading about just salt was incredibly boring. I fell asleep a countless number of times, so if you're having trouble falling asleep... maybe this is worth a read.It seems Kurlansky is trying to show all the different uses of salt and how it evolved through time. Sure, there are many uses I didn't know of, but all in all, not 400+ pages worth. Also, Kurlansky writes about the importance of salt and its impact on the world we live in today. There is no doubt salt was super important, but the story was repetitive. Most of the chapters described the world region, the process they used to create salt, and the type of food they salted.My favorite part of the book was when Kurlansky wrote about the sinkholes caused by too much brine extraction in England. There are a few other good parts of the book, but I would not recommend reading this unless you are really interested in salt.In conclusion, I learned a lot about salt, but felt like the chapters read the same. I will most likely never reread this book."
277,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27408667-dragana,5,"It is a long book with a lot of facts but it brings vast knowledge to the reader. It brings comprehension of the huge impact salt had to World history, trade, politics and influence on so many other nations, foods, places.I have learnt now everything from how ketchup was made to how Early China economy depended on salt tax."

This is a remarkable book; for all the territory that's covered, I didn't feel like there was any skimping on the details or blathering on and on. It's all interesting, from all the innovation to all the injustice involved in extracting salt. Plus, weird recipes. Recommend."

I expected a boring account of salt being used to feed armies, salt roads etc. What I got instead is a fantastic, really well written and humorous account of how a simple commodity like salt affected everything from food and preservation of goods, to countries economies, fueled wars and led to revolutions. If you like history, this book is for you. Don't be dissuaded by the title. It's not a book about salt, but rather a history of the world and how salt was a protagonist through serendipity, greed, necessity and the forward momentum of advancing technology."
281,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/719804-olivia,0,"I have tried to digest this book called Salt, especially as a food reviewer, and a history buff in training, but I think I will throw it over my left shoulder as I can't get past the taste of the endless first chapter on ancient Asian governments.The book is pretty well written and full of great pictures and interesting salty tid-bits, but maybe its a bit too ambitious to try to tell the history of the world through a pure salt perspective?!The value of the mineral, and the elaborate way it was mined in ancient times, is truly fascinating, but Kurlansky can go four-plus bland pages of minutia of Asian emperor names, follies, and dates of reign, without even a dash of the word SALT!!!Some treats for you: Salt is the only rock we eat! Salt is a necessary component to functioning, makes ice cream freeze, removes rust, makes things taste good, seals cracks, removes spots on coals, preserves food, puts out grease fires, treats sore throats, and ear aches. The average adult human being has about three or four salt shaker in her body! My friend Clare actually actually snacks on sea salt because she finds it satisfies her craving without having to eat heavy junk foods. A substance so valuable, salt served as money, influenced trade routes, inspired wars. Without taking away the power of salt, the same could also be said about different foods, including beer, which I actually enjoyed reading the history of. (See my Fermenting Revolution review)On the other hand, my friend, who can stomach more hardcore history than I, enjoyed me reading to him aloud from Salt. Also, my uncle gives many kudos to the book Cod by the same author--Someday I may get a craving to explore some of these choice jems of chapters, like maybe Nordic salt dreams (which includes recipes), and American salt wars, but for now I am in search of food writing with better narrative flow--"
282,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2073876-jan,2,"For years, I kept hearing about how awesome this book was. Everyone has praised it up and down. So when I finally got around to picking up a copy of it, I was feeling pretty excited. And of course, it turns out to be one of those books that everyone else in the world seems to like but me.I will admit that there were a lot of chapters of this book that I did enjoy. And I learned many fun facts that I had not previously known: i.e. where the term ""red herring"" comes from, how soy sauce is made, where Tabasco sauce comes from, etc. Also, I did enjoy the author's clever trick of including many old-timey ""salt"" recipes. Not that I'll ever attempt to make any of these recipes, but I bet that the food connoisseurs who read this book will.However, I felt that, around 200 or so pages into this book, it devolved into an awful lot of ""and they made salted fish"" and/or ""and they taxed salt."" Zzzzzzzz. I read a lot of non-fiction. I have a high tolerance for seemingly tedious detail. But seriously, how much detailed explanation of the taxation of salt in 18th century France is one person supposed to endure before falling into a coma?Also, I realize that the author was pushing a very specific agenda here, but if he's to be believed, nearly every major conflict in the history of the world started out as a salt dispute. I find that very hard to swallow. No pun intended.I guess I'll go back to reading my more obscure non-fiction books and leave the bestsellers for the masses."

Also I know no more things about salting fish than is reasonable for any human to know, much less a vegetarian-type human.One of the things this book makes me wonder is, are the subjects of books always so central? One of the chapters of this book basically runs, ‘Salt is THE turning point to the US Civil War,’ which seems fine when you’re reading, but when you think about it, you’re like – slavery, states’ rights, railroads, etc. etc. etc., all of which also seem like they could be touted as ‘THE turning point’ of this conflict as well.I wonder if there are nonfiction books that run instead, ‘well, it’s interesting what people were doing in relation to IMPORTANT BOOK SUBJECT in Important Event, but kind of besides the point.’"
284,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26055396-sense-of-history,1,"No, this is certainly not a World History of Salt. Oh yes, I concede: there's a lot of salt in it. Kurlansky has stuffed a stunning amount of knowledge about this commodity in this book. But he has forgotten to tell a narrative, to look for the bigger picture, to analyse basic economic or cultural trends. And on top of that he has left his critical gaze at home. In the end all he offers is this mumbo jumbo of facts, titbits of knowledge, myths and nice stories, all about salt. I hope one day someone will do a better job. "

I love fish eggs of any kind so I kind of enjoyed that (very short) part in particular. If the apocalypse hits this book would probably be handy since we'll have to figure out how to obtain salt and keep food fresh all on our own. ;)"

287,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10716214-margaret,0,Did not finish.Got just over half way through when the author started repeating himself. It started to feel like 'Groundhog Day' in hardback.
288,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45596235-frank-theising,2,"Some interesting material buried within, but overall probably twice as long as it needed to be. I think the casual reader will get bored with this book very quickly. For those with a deeper interest in human history, it is interesting to reflect on how salt played such a crucial role in the development and success (or failure) of various civilizations, business enterprises, and human health over the centuries. Overall, the author really tries to make his subject interesting, but there is only so much you can do with a book centered on a commodity as basic as salt. 2 stars.What follows are a few notes on the content of the book:The book includes a lot of interesting factoids like the incredibly large number of places and things that derive their names from salt (soldier, salad, Salzburg, salary, any English settlement ending in “-wich”, etc.) and lengthy descriptions of the various methods (both ancient and modern) for producing or mass-producing salt in geographically diverse locations around the world. It also includes an excessive number of lists of the items salt makes possible (butter, soy sauce, cheese, gunpowder, caviar, etc etc) and tedious descriptions of ancient recipes that used salt or some derivative (Garum, Brine, etc).Salt is obviously still used a great deal today, but it played a much larger role throughout history prior to widespread use of flash freezing, refrigeration, and canning. Its use in preservation of food and meat (especially salted meats and fish) and later use in the creation of gunpowder, made it an essential commodity, critical to the success and expansion of a number of civilizations from Ancient Egypt and the Chinese Dynasties to the Roman and the British Empires. It was so crucial that many countries feared dependence on “foreign salt” the way America feared dependence on “foreign oil” in the latter half of the 20th Century. Its relative abundance or lack thereof, shaped the outcome of a number of wars and crises including the American and French Revolutions, the U.S. Civil War, and Gandhi’s Indian independence movement. It was often run by state monopoly or heavily taxed to fund government and wars. Salted fish in particular generated a significant amount of global trade and became a prime source of protein for Europe (especially during frequent Holy Days that required abstention from meat).Modern processes have resulted in consistently uniform, white crystals which historically were difficult to produce and prized above less pure salt (which was colored in various shades depending on what impurities from other substances were in it). I did find it odd that the author didn’t even mention iodized salt until nearly the end of the book, and then only in the context of the modern faddish appeal of various colored salts that were historically considered sub-par. He omits any real discussion of Iodine being such an essential element for human health and how adding it to salt was one of the most brilliant and effective public health measures in history (up there with putting fluoride in drinking water). He covers at length the rise of the Morton Salt Company near the end of the book."
289,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17539226-bryan-brown,4,"Fascinating story starting with the prehistory of the earliest recorded salt producing sites to about the year 2000 and the mass production of salt (most of which is no longer used for food). If you have ever wondered about the little shaker on your table or wanted to see why salt is the only rock we eat this book will tell you. One of the things I liked best was the inclusion of historical recipes from different cultures and time periods reflecting how the usage of salt has changed through the centuries. It often includes the histories of famous salted things from the Roman garum (the very distant progenitor of ketchup), to kosher lox, to butter. I also enjoyed learning how salt went from necessity to luxury as supply and demand changed. Most of the modern salt production is no longer made for food, and much has been homogenized into uniform salt crystals controlled by two huge companies. This evolution allowed mass consumers to always get an expected product but also created a niche marked for things like my beloved kosher salt, and the various traditional and sea salts you can now buy at the super food-mart.It is a history book but even non-historians like myself with any interest in salt will enjoy this book."

I had nothing to do and also had no WiFi when on my month long trip to Ethiopia and could not for the life of me get through this book. It is so dry. I got through maybe four chapters and called it quits. Although, I definitely learned from the short chapters that I had read and appreciate how in-depth the author went to find as many examples as he did of the importance of salt and how it affected ancient culture and history.

293,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43651738-sabrina-godin,4,"Throughout history, the common household mineral, salt, was obtained for usages from food to religious beliefs to archeological discoveries. Within Mark Kurlansky’s book, Salt: A World of History, he provides specific present and past examples of how salt shaped the course of civilizations. In each chapter, Kurlansky focuses on a certain area where salt was excavated, processed, and how it was used. To specify relatable instances, he writes in recipes from ancient cookbooks and chiefs. Even though salt was mainly used for food, Kurlansky provides examples of how salt influenced religious beliefs and patriarchy in certain societies. To show evidence that salt is still a major factor in present day societies, he also writes about archeological discoveries, which were made possible from the preservation of salt. In addition, he writes about the current state of the Dead Sea and the how the company Morton Salt came to be. Even though Mark Kurlansky supplies the reader with specific and interesting evidence of salt, the book seems as if it would never end. Chapters seemed to continue on and recipes seem to be “cooking up” every five pages. The way that Kurlansky writes, he brings the civilizations alive, and with each chapter they evolve within the book. One example is women. He starts of with the women having a little influence in the preservation of salt, but as the book goes on they are the ones preserving. The same goes with the civilizations obtaining the salt. Each society starts off with workers scraping away the salt, however, by the end of the book, there are salt works with hundreds of workers. By the end of the book, the reader has learned about how salt has become a leading mineral in the world and every way possible it can be retrieved. Kurlansky makes sure that the reader knows the whole history of salt, which the title of the book implies. As a whole, Mark Kurlansky tells a non-fiction story of how salt changed the world, but it could have been done in less than for hundred and forty-nine pages. Even though salt’s importance seems to resemble the size of it’s gains, it has played a major role in the course of man. In Salt: A World of History, Mark Kurlansky tells how salt started as just ingredient to make brines, and later turned into a leading product of the world. Within in his book, Kurlansky tells how salt effect civilization such as the Byzantine Empire, Rome, and Ancient Chinese Dynasties. In each of these civilizations, salt was a key factor that allowed the empires to rise to their potential. Besides the civilizations, it also affected the people within them. Both men and women worked with salt, and it was main element in their daily lives. While Kurlansky mainly focused on past influences of salt, he found a way to tie it together with present day. In daily household, there is usually a container of salt to be found, which is produced by Morton. Kurlansky provides the history about this company, so the reader can relate it to their daily life. While the history of salt, seems long and unimportant, some of it needs to be noticed. The Dead Sea, being one of the most unique bodies of water on Earth, is slowly disappearing. This is because of the constant problem of pollution. By reading Kurlansky’s book, the reader can feel his passion for the mineral. Other writers sometimes have trouble bringing their non-fiction book alive with their emotions, but he didn’t have that problem. After reading his book, the reader may be inspired to read many of his other. Although the information in Mark Kurlansky’s book seems to have a little importance in the reader’s daily life, if he or she looks past it all, it’s a non-fiction book that can change his or her life.

When you first hear the title of this book, one's first reaction is generally to chuckle because, let's be serious, what is there to the history of salt? It's just a mineral!Well, Kurlansky tells us that there is a lot to the history of salt and that our lives and history are intricately tied to the location and usage of salt in society. I learned a great deal in this book, and not just about salt (the chapter on how to make soy sauce and garum is fascinating). The best part of this book is the way Kurlansky tells us about salt - he is clearly very passionate about this topic, and he goes into create detail in the history, chemical, and nature of salt. Sure, sometimes he's a little goofy (he, only somewhat seriously, suggests a link to the Confederates losing to a salt crisis), but little vignettes like that are what make this book. I would highly recommend this book. I found myself talking about its contents at parties, and most people seemed fascinated. For something we use everyday without a second though, there is quite a bit of history behind this tasty mineral. Also for nonfiction, this book is easy to read and fun. I think most people could read this book without too much difficulty and find themselves a little happier and more knowledgeable by the end of it."

On page 4 of the introduction, there is an engraving dating from 1157 of a bunch of women holding down a partially disrobed man titled ""Women Salting Their Husbands"". ""With this salting, front and back, At last strong natures they will not lack."" OK, I was hooked. (Thankfully, I've been able to avoid being salted myself so far.)You can open this book on almost any page and find something interesting. I just opened to page 111...""Fresh whale meat was also for the rich. The great delicacy was the tongue. Salted tongue of any kind was appreciated, but especially whale tongue. For the poor, there was craspois, also called craspoix, or grapois. This was strips of the fattier parts of the whale, salt cured like bacon and sometimes called in French lard de careme, which translates as 'lent blubber'...""All kinds of stuff like that. An easy and entertaining read."
299,0142001619,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76129-wealhtheow,3,"A fascinating study of salt throughout human history. I really appreciate that Kurlansky did not forget about the non-Western world in writing about this book (although there is rather more about American salt practices than most other countries--unsurprising, given Kurlansky's language, previous books, and nationality). My only criticism of this book is that it has a tendency toward anecdotes rather than data, especially toward the end. There are no sum-ups or final conclusions drawn in the last few chapters, just a tossed salad of all the random tidbits the author hadn't managed to fit in elsewhere. Still, incredible stuff! Even reading just a few pages of this book will give you material for days' worth of small talk."
