0,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/193310-brian,3,"all this quantum mechanics and relativity stuff being so incredibly counter-intuitive, language seems even more of a barrier than usual; it's tough to properly tease out if much of what's written is meant to be metaphorical, epistemological, or just plain hard-up muthafuckin' (relative... of course) truth. or maybe some kind of hybrid? so, while kaku does an admirable job of simplifying some of einstein's more abstruse mindfucks, there're other aspects that send a bug straight up my ass. i.e. regarding heisenberg's uncertainty principle: 'This was not just a by-product of the crudeness of our instruments; it was a fundamental law of nature. Even God could not know both the precise position and momentum of an electron.'re: that final line... say what? now that just seems some kinda unnecessary & obfuscatin' booshit. maybe kaku is pandering to who he thinks must be the typical reader of a book of this nature (pop-science series called 'great discoveries', etc) but whhhhyyyy include that line? why bring a god who 'knows' things into the discussion? when you're dealing with all this existenzy shit you really can't use the expression 'god only knows' because, y'know, that might very well be the case.

1,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102484307-muhammad-abdullah,5,"This is one of the most informative book about Einstein, his life and work which I have ever read. This book tells us how a genius like Einstein is formed during war hysteria period, a time when people and nations were destroying each other. At this time, Einstein was busy in building up his theories, which would soon revolutionarize the world. Michio Kaku, author of the EINSTEIN'S COSMOS is a well-known theoretical physicist, futuristic, string theorist, co-founder of string field theory and professor of theoretical physics at City College of New York. This book explains the Einstein's personal life, student life, marriages, difficulties he faces during Holocaust, his professional life, work, theories, the most renowned period of his life and the his last moments. This read is superb and tells a lot about Einstein. I like this book very much. I highly recommend this book to the fans of Einstein who wants to know a lot about the world's greatest scientist of the 20th century."
2,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,4,"Ever wondered why Albert Einstein remains as a legend in the field of physics well over a century after he discovered the general theory of relativity? The quote below from the author sums it up:
All physical knowledge at the fundamental level is contained in two pillars of physics, general relativity and the quantum theory. Einstein was the founder of the first, the godfather of the second and paved the way for the possible unification of both.
 I chose Einstein's Cosmos as my first Michio Kaku's book to somewhat ease myself into this renowned theoretical physicist's writing, and safe to say, it won't be my last. In spite of the subject matter, the narrative was concise and fairly easy to comprehend; that is until the superstring theory was discussed, albeit very briefly. If you find quantum mechanics mind-boggling, superstring theory might just fry your brain. I simply cannot fathom or imagine the existence of ten dimensions (one dimension of space and nine dimensions of space). However, this well-written book was not just about the science as it also provided a sufficient glimpse of the person behind the genius, who was so far ahead of his time."
3,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"On the cover is a quote from Popular Science,”Kaku enables the reader to see and think as Einstein did.” I wish! That would be an accomplishment greater than Einstein’s. As Kaku recounts Einstein’s major discoveries, two things stand out to me. The first is the incredible magnitude of his lifetime achievement. The second is Einstein’s unique intuitive approach beginning with mental pictures of his theories then finding the supporting mathematics. One can only marvel at a mind that could pull such revolutionary ideas out of, well, the cosmos.1905, Einstein’s annus mirabilis, four game changing discoveries are published. First, he explained Brownian motion providing important evidence supporting atomic theory. Second, he explained the photoelectric effect which was critical to the development of quantum theory. Third, he developed the theory of special relativity giving time a whole new meaning and invalidating the idea of the ether which had been a mainstay of physics for decades. Fourth, he produced what is 100 years later still the best known equation in the world e=mc2 revealing the incredible power of the atom. 1915, Einstein develops the theory of general relativity, one of the two most profound concepts of twentieth century physics, the other being quantum mechanics. 1924, based on work with Satyendra Bose he predicts the existence of a new state of matter, the Bose Einstein Condensate, finally produced 70 years later. Kaku clearly loves his subject and gives him every possible credit even in his later years when his chase after a unified theory was fruitless. Kaku attributes this to an inability to employ his modus operandi of beginning with a mental picture. Perhaps the problem he was trying to tackle simply was not yet ready for his intuitive approach. Think what Einstein in his prime could do with all the information and resources we have today. Kaku believes Einstein would have liked string theory. Valid or not, we can all picture vibrating strings floating around, but what might Einstein have added to that picture?Kaku makes the science as accessible as possible. The theories are interspersed in the story of Einstein’s personal life which provides respite from the mind bending physics. The quick run through the major discoveries helps one view them as a body of work. It becomes easy to understand why Einstein’s name is synonymous with genius."
4,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1257629-karl-o,4,"Kaku emphasizes a point throughout this book that really makes you think in a new light about physics. He says that Einstein always believed that the theories he's been working on (and obviously the ones he is famous for their discovery, namely special and general relativity) can always be understood in terms of simple thought experiments or pictures. It is not difficult to see where this led Einstein, who spent the last years of his life trying to achieve unification between relativity and quantum mechanics The question that nagged me throughout was whether reality is really beautiful i.e simple and if yes, why it should be so.At heart I'm convinced that there is no necessity for this to be the case, but then, this is Einstein and it is evident that his belief that reality is simple led him to think-up relativity, a theory that I still cannot understand in many ways.Kaku tries to hint that superstring theory is just what Einstein would've liked to think about as a candidate for unification, and even claims that the picture of strings vibrating with different frequencies akin to ""musical notes"" may have been the simple picture that would've helped Einstein to realize his dream of unification.Apart from the question of simplicity, there are some interesting parts about the quantum theory and the many worlds interpretation which solves the famous cat paradox by positing that the universe bifurcates with each observation of the cat into two universes with each having a separate cat dead or alive. This also leads one into the alleyway of ""why is it that a single universe makes more sense than multiple universes""? These questions are totally fascinating and Kaku really does a good job in illuminating the tricky concepts not just behind the theories Einstein agreed with or pioneered but those he opposed and criticized, which gives the reader a context: a thing indispensable in a biography. I found the book immensely enjoyable on many fronts though arguably biased towards string theory, a field Kaku famously works in. "
5,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21610643-anastasia,5,"Highly interesting book about the greatest mind of the twentieth century. I suppose everyone has an image about Einstein in their heads. That he's a bit of a mad scientist with that wild, white hair...but that image is not the whole truth.I love how this book describes Einstein's personal life, relationships, politics and of course his work. I'm not a mathematician or physicist so I liked how Kaku manages to keep astrophysics and quantum mechanics both interesting and simple enough for everyone to understand."
6,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2201886-mike,4,"Although I’ve read many other accounts of Einstein’s life and his contributions to physics, I wanted to see how physicist Michio Kaku wrote about him. This book is not an exhaustive biography; instead it is a “popular” book that attempts to give the casual reader a glimpse into the man who stood as tall as Isaac Newton. (For an excellent example of the other style, I recommend “Einstein: His Life and Universe” by Walter Isaacson.)While not ignoring his early life or his marriages, the author uses them to balance out a book that ultimately is more about Einstein’s theories and legacy than his personal life. I have to say that the writing and balancing was very well done. At only 232 pages, Dr. Kaku has written enough about each of the concepts for the layman to get a sense (or image) of what each is.Brownian Motion and the existence of atoms. The Photoelectric Effect and the quantization of light (i.e. photons). The Special Theory of Relativity (special because it is a limited theory). All three of these papers were published within the same year. In one “Miracle Year”.Then, he followed this up with one of the two fundamental theories that has guided physics for the past 100 years.The Theory of General Relativity (which adds acceleration and gravity to the earlier, more limited work.) These are the things that most laymen might know him for. (Who’s kidding who – they know about he “invented” Relativity and that’s about it.)But there was more, much more. This book explains how the notion of General Relativity and its theory of a curved space-time in turn spawned testable concepts and theories that even in the 21st century are still being proven. So much was so far ahead of man’s ability to verify that even now people are still mining the riches of General Relativity.What this books does better than most of the other Biographies is talk about how his final 30 years were not “wasted” nor spent fighting “progress”. While I know the details from other books, this author takes the ideas (rather than the gory details of his later GUTs) that Einstein was pursuing and shows how decades later, they are resurfacing in string (i.e. superstring) theory, branes, and even Quantum Mechanics. For this aspect alone, I liked this book.If I had to recommend one book about Albert Einstein and his importance to science it would be this clear, well-written account. A strong “4”."
7,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4904708-gary-baker,4,"Yes, it's taken me this long to get round to reading it. I bought it as cheap, damaged stock around 2005. Yesterday I slid it off the shelf, blew off the dust and started reading. I finished it a few minutes ago.The blurb on the back says, ""You don't have to be Einstein to understand Einstein."" And that is spot on. A wonderful read giving easy access to Einstein's science. We start with him trying to understand a light beam by imagining himself running along side it, and end with his unfinished attempts to unify all the universe's forces by describing them as arising from different geometries of space time.Michio Kaku does a great job. It's very easy to read, no elaborate fomulae to contend with and flows along giving an excellent insight into Einstein's contributions. I particularly like the way Einstein's work is rooted in context: other physicists and mathematicians and their contributions are discussed. Kaku also does a great job in helping the reader visualise some of the principles discovered: the Bose-Einstein Condensate suddenly became easy for me to visualise, for example.An excellent read for anyone slightly interested in Physics, the great man or the history of technologies."
8,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54266751-jennifer,4,"Modern physics is based on two theories: the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. Albert Einstein is the founder of the first and the grandfather of second. He was so ahead of his time that some of his theories have only just recently being proven. In Einstein’s Cosmos, Michio Kaku explores Einstein’s contributions to science and briefly discusses the physicists of the early twentieth century. Kaku provides a high-level overview of Einstein’s life, but it’s by no means a biography. Kaku’s passion for the subject comes through in his writing, and his everyday examples make for a quick and enjoyable read. If you are not familiar with Einstein’s work, this book would be a good place to start."
9,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14012525-martti,4,"I'm happy that Kaku doesn't strictly speak of only Einstein, but also about the other great minds before, during and after to give a fantastically interwoven picture of the theoretical physics world. Also updating it with contemporary experimental results. Well, somewhat contemporary. By 2020 one could update it with Higgs boson, LIGO gravity wave experments, and probably couple of more interesting factoids, but that would be nitpicking. It's a fascinating example of a pop-sci done right."
10,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6232165-thomas-dodds,5,"Second biography I ever read and By far the best most informative book I ever read.You have Isaac Newton of the late 1600’s is well known as one of the greatest scientists who ever lived who discovered gravity. Less well known is his deep belief in God and his conviction that scientific investigation leads to a greater knowledge of God the Creator of the universe. He developed his theory of universal gravitation, which used what is known as the inverse square law. He developed his three laws of motionAlso James Clerk Maxwell, of the 1800’s a Scottish physicist and mathematician, is generally regarded as one of the world's greatest physicists. Maxwell's researches combined the fields of electricity and magnetism and introduced the concept of the electro-magnetic field. Following James Clerk Maxwell's research, we now call a space modified by the presence of magnetic field lines a magnetic fieldThese two people were referred to as the two standing pillars of sciences at that time Then came albert Einstein of the early 1900’s who change science in so many was that it’s astounding. He also replaced one of the two standing pillars of sciences, it was Sir Isaac newton.This big was great I would recommend this book to anyone who has a love for sciences Or whose just want to know more about Albert Einstein. "
11,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1166255-banner,4,"Ok yea I know the pop icon, crazy scientist, Einstein, but I have never gotten a glimpse of the man himself until now. This can only be called an introduction at best, but it is quite good. It seems most great men are not born that way, but must rise above societies norms and dare to look at the world differently. It also seems, this is not without cost.In addition to learning about the man I developed a greater understanding and appreciation of the science he produced. Truly revolutionary. An enjoyable and thought provoking read."
12,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9024615-tammam-aloudat,5,"I like Michio Kaku's writing, I was particularly amused by his book Physics of the Future: How Science Will Shape Human Destiny and Our Daily Lives by the Year 2100 which told us which of our sci-fi desires, from time travel to teleportation, would be possible to achieve while disappointing us by stating that none of the two dozen explored impossibilities, even the likely ones, would be achievable anywhere near our lifetimes. This is a different kind of book, a straight forward biography of Einstein that is a little more emotionally engaged than regular biographies and more scientifically knowledgeable having been written by a physicist. I like it a lot, for despite having read of Einstein's life before in books like Young Einstein: And the story of E=mc², I find this one much more engaging and more useful in the fact that it explains the physics of Einstein's theories and work as well as in other physics disciplines like a good dive into Quantum mechanics and super string theory written for the non mathematician among us.The crux of the matter is that Einstein was profoundly human in his strengths and humility as well as in his flaws. Kaku goes out to counter the statement that the great man has wasted away the last three decades of his life doing very little and shows how much modern physics is still indebted to him in things we are finding and using today.The weakness of the book is one of lack of space for much depth and analysis which I suppose cannot be asked from a small volume as this. For that, I might have to go to the master of biography and his nearly seven-hundred page book Einstein: His Life and Universe.The bottom line, in my mind, and other than the beauty of Einsteins theories and images, is one of what makes humans important. Einstein, unlike saints and politicians and revolutionary leaders, is a real benevolent human being who transcends the mental boundaries of humans and shows us how one of our intrinsic gifts, our minds, can do miracles. He is a promise to the future of humanity that, while having all the weaknesses and defects of being human, shows what can be when that pound of flesh inside our skulls functions better."
13,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35447635-vasco,5,"The bad: nothing special.The good: a ""kind of biography"" written from a point of view not of an historian but an expert in the subject matter of the person is interesting as it's a complement to the ""official"" biographies which revolve around life details and minutiae. In this sense, Kaku's book is a very interesting tie-in to other books I've previously read on Wheeler, Feynman and others, complementing them with not only the publicly known content of Einstein's theories, but also the background behind them, the different hypotheses, criticism, and relationships (good and bad) with other experts and theories.It's a great book not as a main biography of Einstein, but as an advanced complementary material to fill in what blanks you might have."
14,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16406002-mohamed-salah-suliman,4,"Excellent overview of the political and social impacts on the evolution of physics and on Einstein as well as his impact on the world during the stages of his life. A solid professional biography of Einstein. A good intro, if you're trying to learn more about his work. A pleasant and quick read if you already know something about it."
15,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63181417-michael-davenport,5,"Such a great book. Beautiful written for all to understand.

17,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1086087-mike-lewis,3,"Just finished the book Einstein’s Cosmos, which is a good look into the life of the genius physicist Albert Einstein.The book has lots of interesting facts about Einstein such as:  - He was born in Germany but he had such a bad experience in his youth, he renounced his citizenship when he was 17 - He was always brilliant. There’s a myth that he wasn’t that smart when he was young (and a whole Kaplan advertising campaign). This is 100% wrong. He read a Geometry book when he was 12 and LOVED it. After that he devoured any physics and mathematics he could get his hand on. He hated classes where they wouldn’t teach the “interesting topics of the day” and occassionally got poor grades. But he was always smart. - One little tidbit i loved hearing about is that he was a total ladies man. In High School ALL the girls wanted to talk to him b/c he had such a funny personality. He was a witty guy - always cracking jokes and having fun. Bottom line: Albert was a stud and had his pick of chicks when he was in college.Another little interesting piece of gossip - he got his main college girlfriend pregnant but she had moved away and the baby died when it was 3. He eventually had another child with her and paid alimony with his Nobel Prize money. But, as he became more famous and busier, they drifted apart and he moved to Germany. She stayed in Switzerland - leading to eventual divorce. He then became very close to his cousin Elsa, who he later married. From the book it seems that they were a great couple - He the absent-minded disheveled thinker and she the pretty put-together socialite. His tours around the world would have been impossible without her.The book follows his behavior during the wars, his refusal to support Germany during WWI and his endangerment as a prominent Jew - eventually moving to the states and living at Princeton.The physics is all easy to understand. All the cosmic questions that stem from relativity - including the puzzling worm-hole questions are all lined up. I found it a great to read before bedtime book due to the mind benders.If you’re looking to know more about Albert - this is definitely a quick and interesting book."
18,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3726509-lis-carey,4,"Einstein was probably the greatest mind of the twentieth century, revolutionized physics, and his work is still producing new breakthroughs today. Michio Kaku recounts both his scientific contributions and something of his personal life in a completely engaging, entertaining way.While Einstein was late in starting to talk, it's not true that he was a poor student in school. What he was, was a stubborn student. He had no interest in rote learning, which was the accepted pedagogic technique in Germany at the time. He would read, and think, and ask questions--and that mainly in the subjects he cared about.Einstein's work on special relativity and general relativity changed our understanding of the universe and how it works. His struggles with quantum mechanics and his unsuccessful effort to create a unified field theory, a ""theory of everything,"" have led some to say it would have been better for his reputation if he had not practiced physics for his last thirty years. Yet now, in the first decades of the twenty-first century, with advances in the technology available to study and test ideas, Einstein's work in the hands of a new generation of physicists and mathematicians is bearing new scientific fruit.This is a fun, enjoyable read or listen, as well as educational.Recommended.I received a free copy of this audiobook from Audible in exchange for an honest review."
19,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,3,"Let me be honest. I wanted to hate this book. I hate Michio Kaku. He's a shameless attention-seeker. His other books were garbage not fit for toilet paper.Somehow, he managed not to disgrace Einstein's good name, all that much. His prose is still full of self-aggrandizement. He emphasizes the mystery of the scientific details instead of doing his job and EXPLAINING THEM! But only a little. Much less than in his other books.Pompous ass that he is, he claims that, aside from String Theory, ""all other unification attempts have failed"". This bit of petty fiction ignores Loop Quantum Gravity, and he knows it.He also claims that String theory has ""no adjustable parameters"" which is a huge lie! The compactified dimensions make for a parameter space equal to 10 raised to the power of 500.Still, if you want a short biography of Einstein and summary description of his contributions to science, you could do worse than this book."
20,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15623524-sophie,5,"Just finished reading. Loved it. Very well written, as always.. then again, I have not picked up any of Michio's books and NOT liked them. Wish List: to meet & perhaps have lunch with Michio Kaku.(Providing it was okay with his wife :-). Seriously, When I was in school, I did not do well in higher maths, although that could reflect on the teachers. When I watch Michio on TV, he is engaging and entertaining and thought provoking. When you read Michio, it is the same. He has an appeal that reaches to many people, and across MANY walks of life.Recom. without any reservations !"
21,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1196125-frank,4,"Wow! Never before have I really began to comprehend the impact that the life of Albert Einstein had on our world. Dr Kaku does this in a way that brings Einstein's complex theories and formulas to a level I could ALMOST grasp. Dr Kaku paints an amazing picture of not only Einstein but also the world of mathematics and physics, not to mention politics, that he both shaped and was shaped by. I'm nothing less than in awe of the impact Einstein made then and still makes today. Amazing and inspiring. Well done Dr Kaku! "
22,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1551334-christy,3,"This is a book that I never would have chosen on my own, but my friend insisted that I read it. She is a lot smarter than me so it was easy for her to understand, but I have to admit that it was kind of interesting to read not only about Einstein's theories but also about his personal life. I actually struggled to get through some of it but I am glad that I read it. It has made me want to learn about physic's."
23,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1343829-simon,5,"What a great book! If you've ever asked yourself: ""what exactly did Einstein DO?"" This book nails it. Four things:1. Light is a constant (not time)- special relativity2. E=MC2 - energey from any object3. Gravity isn't really gravity but space-time. Gravity doesn't pull us. Space-time pushes us. 4. Unified Field Theory - which he never really solved. But superstring theory might do this.Awesome book. Well written. "
24,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25032671-kris,3,"A fairly quick read, despite the content. Kaku has the tendency of being a little over dramatic, talking about the face of God and whatnot, but it's still a good read about Einstein's work. I picked this up randomly in the library one day because it looked short and interesting. It's full of names and physics vocab that I can only just barely grasp, but Kaku offers enough simple picture-like explanations to get you through it."

32,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19071374-sammy,5,"Seriously good. Must read for everyone.The big challenges of the 21st century: fascism, populism, inaction on climate change, religious fanaticism, all result from the scientific illiteracy of the larger public and their adult educators, the media. It’s 2020 and most journalists and people still don’t understand that climate change and global warming is caused by human activity. Within the scientific community, there’s a 99.5% consensus on this fact, yet people still don’t ‘believe’ this to be true.We’re in the post-truth disinformation age because opinions are a dime a dozen. People acquire and discard them at will. However, what people lack is the strength in their convictions. How sure are you of something you believe in? Did you arrive at those conclusions by yourself or did someone tell you those things that you believe? Science is this abstract thing that no one really understands. We don’t usually understand the conclusions scientists come up with, just like when Einstein came out with general relativity, no one understood that. Yet, the scientific community’s attempt to give a metaphysical picture of the universe and its origins is more than sound than any philosophical or religious discourse. This is because the community values using methods that make arriving at conclusions checkable. It brings to mind the recent publication of a paper in the lancet journal that linked hydroxychloroquine with problems in patients suffering from the novel coronavirus. The scientists doing the study and the company that provided them with the date were soon found to have errors in their data and its analysis, and the paper was subsequently retracted from the lancet journal and an apology was issued. Now think, how many politicians or religious leaders have ever retracted any statements they make upon encountering their errors? Literally zero.We all need to have ‘beliefs’ to go about our days. What we do or not do in any given situation depends on what we think about things. People seem content to get their ‘beliefs’ by and large from the media and/or politicians. However those sources themselves are scientifically illiterate. It’s the blind leading the blind for the most part. No wonder the world seems to be collapsing into itself, running from apocalypse to apocalypse, with the thinking among us waiting for the inevitable rise in sea levels which will render most of our coastal cities that we spent 1000 years developing unlivable. A billion climate refugees on the horizon and the unseeing world gyrates to tiktoks, fueled by disinformation that we constantly receive on our pocket supercomputers.If there is to be any hope, it’s science. Respect science. Educate yourself and others. Otherwise there’s very little chance of a natural death for any of us!"
33,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11618077-bruce-cline,4,"Einstein’s Cosmos, How Albert Einstein’s Vision Transformed Our Understanding of Space and Time, by Micho Kaku (pp 233). Professor Einstein once wrote “All physical theories, their mathematical expression notwithstanding, ought to lend themselves to so simple a description that even a child could understand.” While I’m no longer a child, I’d like to think I can understand much that children understand, but apparently I can’t. In reading about Einstein’s theories in this and other books, the various word pictures he used to describe his instructions gets did give me insight into some of his theories, but try as I might, any glimpses I gained as a result never got me past the most rudimentary elements of his thinking. This book, despite the author’s valiant attempt to make this subject matter comprehensible, was part wonderful biography and story telling, and part scientific mumbo jumbo (to me). Obviously, my understanding of science is at its most basic level: water is wet if it’s not a solid or a gas, air is what we breathe and is made up of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide (mostly), fire is often hot, and other basics. What I think I know of physics, notwithstanding a class in high school, comes from episodes of The Big Bang Theory television show. In imminently readable prose, the author walks readers through Einstein’s life, and the extraordinary breakthroughs in theoretical physics he made while working as an unheralded patent clerk. His breathtakingly new theories, then and in later years, overturned much of the world’s understanding of physics and spawned new fields of study and direct and indirect collaborators throughout his life and to the present day. Given my extreme ignorance, I will not feign understanding of his breakthroughs by quoting from the book, but even with my pitiable lack of knowledge, even I could grasp at least a tiny bit of the magnitude of his achievements, at least in the abstract. Micho Kaku walks the reader through Einstein’s work, compares it to his predecessors include Newton and Maxwell, and throws in fellow physicists whose names many of your will know: Planck, Schrodinger (of cat fame), Heisenberg (uncertainty principle), Fermi, Oppenheimer, Bohr, Hubble, Higgs, and more. Despite the many passages that defied my brain cells’ ability to comprehend, this was a fascinating book and was well worth my time. "

It's a great introduction to modern physics, including relativity theory, which Einstein formulated, quantum mechanics, which Einstein influenced, and the unified field theory and super strings, which Einstein laid the foundation for. I am not a physicist, and i don't pretend to understand any of these concepts, but after reading this book, i feel like i'e come closer to understanding. One of the things i especially liked about this presentation is that unlike other books about physics, this one does not rely on mathematics. Of course the author does not ignore math--he can't. Too much of physics relies on higher math. He simply mentions that the calculations took a long time. In one place he mentions that Einstein lacked the tools to formulate the theory, so he spent the whole summer studying Riemann geometry, and once he had mastered it, was able to complete the necessary computations. That was enough to convey the idea that when Einstein didn't know something, he knew what he needed to learn first, and went and learned it.The other ting he conveyed was the scientist's humility and humanity. In 1932, a book was published in Germany, entitled ""100 Arguments Against Einstein."" Einstein was unfazed by the book. ""If the Theory of Relativity is wrong, "" he said, ""they would not need a hundred arguments against it. One small fact could destroy it."" To this day, no one has found even one small fact to disprove relativity. In fact, as more advanced studies of the universe are conducted, more and more evidence has accumulated supporting Einstein and his conception of the cosmos."

I honestly do not know where to start, Albert Einstein was an exceptionally intelligent person with exceptional skills, he was a special genius. He revolutionised modern physics and was one of the founders of “Quantum Physics”. He discovered that light wasn’t waves (as scientists assumed), and proved that light travels in very discrete particles. He named them photons.Although, I suppose, you could say the thing that made Einstein really extraordinary was his ability to fully concentrate for months on his work, isolating himself from the outside world. Einstein was not the best mathematician and ergo, he liked to use very simple thought experiments to discover and explain highly complex & heterogeneous scientific concerns. In 1905, Einstein published his “Special Theory of Relativity” which contained what is considered the most famous equation of all time, E=mc°2. This equation means that energy and mass are interchangeable; they are different forms of the same thing. Under the right conditions, energy can become mass, and vice versa. This equation was used to invent atomic power.He developed “The General Theory of Relativity”, which in itself is one of the pillars of modern physics (alongside Quantum Mechanics). He amended Newton’s laws (Nobody else dared to do so), and made them consistent with electrodynamics via Special Relativity, which he then developed further into General Relativity.Oh, and, he was a super funny dude as well.

Must read for everyone.The big challenges of the 21st century: fascism, populism, inaction on climate change, religious fanaticism, all result from the scientific illiteracy of the larger public and their adult educators, the media. It’s 2020 and most journalists and people still don’t understand that climate change and global warming is caused by human activity. Within the scientific community, there’s a 99.5% consensus on this fact, yet people still don’t ‘believe’ this to be true.We’re in the post-truth disinformation age because opinions are a dime a dozen. People acquire and discard them at will. However, what people lack is the strength in their convictions. How sure are you of something you believe in? Did you arrive at those conclusions by yourself or did someone tell you those things that you believe? Science is this abstract thing that no one really understands. We don’t usually understand the conclusions scientists come up with, just like when Einstein came out with general relativity, no one understood that. Yet, the scientific community’s attempt to give a metaphysical picture of the universe and its origins is more than sound than any philosophical or religious discourse. This is because the community values using methods that make arriving at conclusions checkable. It brings to mind the recent publication of a paper in the lancet journal that linked hydroxychloroquine with problems in patients suffering from the novel coronavirus. The scientists doing the study and the company that provided them with the date were soon found to have errors in their data and its analysis, and the paper was subsequently retracted from the lancet journal and an apology was issued. Now think, how many politicians or religious leaders have ever retracted any statements they make upon encountering their errors? Literally zero.We all need to have ‘beliefs’ to go about our days. What we do or not do in any given situation depends on what we think about things. People seem content to get their ‘beliefs’ by and large from the media and/or politicians. However those sources themselves are scientifically illiterate. It’s the blind leading the blind for the most part. No wonder the world seems to be collapsing into itself, running from apocalypse to apocalypse, with the thinking among us waiting for the inevitable rise in sea levels which will render most of our coastal cities that we spent 1000 years developing unlivable. A billion climate refugees on the horizon and the unseeing world gyrates to tiktoks, fueled by disinformation that we constantly receive on our pocket supercomputers.If there is to be any hope, it’s science. Respect science. Educate yourself and others. Otherwise there’s very little chance of a natural death for any of us!"

Must read for everyone.The big challenges of the 21st century: fascism, populism, inaction on climate change, religious fanaticism, all result from the scientific illiteracy of the larger public and their adult educators, the media. It’s 2020 and most journalists and people still don’t understand that climate change and global warming is caused by human activity. Within the scientific community, there’s a 99.5% consensus on this fact, yet people still don’t ‘believe’ this to be true.We’re in the post-truth disinformation age because opinions are a dime a dozen. People acquire and discard them at will. However, what people lack is the strength in their convictions. How sure are you of something you believe in? Did you arrive at those conclusions by yourself or did someone tell you those things that you believe? Science is this abstract thing that no one really understands. We don’t usually understand the conclusions scientists come up with, just like when Einstein came out with general relativity, no one understood that. Yet, the scientific community’s attempt to give a metaphysical picture of the universe and its origins is more than sound than any philosophical or religious discourse. This is because the community values using methods that make arriving at conclusions checkable. It brings to mind the recent publication of a paper in the lancet journal that linked hydroxychloroquine with problems in patients suffering from the novel coronavirus. The scientists doing the study and the company that provided them with the date were soon found to have errors in their data and its analysis, and the paper was subsequently retracted from the lancet journal and an apology was issued. Now think, how many politicians or religious leaders have ever retracted any statements they make upon encountering their errors? Literally zero.We all need to have ‘beliefs’ to go about our days. What we do or not do in any given situation depends on what we think about things. People seem content to get their ‘beliefs’ by and large from the media and/or politicians. However those sources themselves are scientifically illiterate. It’s the blind leading the blind for the most part. No wonder the world seems to be collapsing into itself, running from apocalypse to apocalypse, with the thinking among us waiting for the inevitable rise in sea levels which will render most of our coastal cities that we spent 1000 years developing unlivable. A billion climate refugees on the horizon and the unseeing world gyrates to tiktoks, fueled by disinformation that we constantly receive on our pocket supercomputers.If there is to be any hope, it’s science. Respect science. Educate yourself and others. Otherwise there’s very little chance of a natural death for any of us!"
93,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11618077-bruce-cline,4,"Einstein’s Cosmos, How Albert Einstein’s Vision Transformed Our Understanding of Space and Time, by Micho Kaku (pp 233). Professor Einstein once wrote “All physical theories, their mathematical expression notwithstanding, ought to lend themselves to so simple a description that even a child could understand.” While I’m no longer a child, I’d like to think I can understand much that children understand, but apparently I can’t. In reading about Einstein’s theories in this and other books, the various word pictures he used to describe his instructions gets did give me insight into some of his theories, but try as I might, any glimpses I gained as a result never got me past the most rudimentary elements of his thinking. This book, despite the author’s valiant attempt to make this subject matter comprehensible, was part wonderful biography and story telling, and part scientific mumbo jumbo (to me). Obviously, my understanding of science is at its most basic level: water is wet if it’s not a solid or a gas, air is what we breathe and is made up of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide (mostly), fire is often hot, and other basics. What I think I know of physics, notwithstanding a class in high school, comes from episodes of The Big Bang Theory television show. In imminently readable prose, the author walks readers through Einstein’s life, and the extraordinary breakthroughs in theoretical physics he made while working as an unheralded patent clerk. His breathtakingly new theories, then and in later years, overturned much of the world’s understanding of physics and spawned new fields of study and direct and indirect collaborators throughout his life and to the present day. Given my extreme ignorance, I will not feign understanding of his breakthroughs by quoting from the book, but even with my pitiable lack of knowledge, even I could grasp at least a tiny bit of the magnitude of his achievements, at least in the abstract. Micho Kaku walks the reader through Einstein’s work, compares it to his predecessors include Newton and Maxwell, and throws in fellow physicists whose names many of your will know: Planck, Schrodinger (of cat fame), Heisenberg (uncertainty principle), Fermi, Oppenheimer, Bohr, Hubble, Higgs, and more. Despite the many passages that defied my brain cells’ ability to comprehend, this was a fascinating book and was well worth my time. "
94,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52515493-yehudit-reishtein,5,"Michio Kaku weaves a biography of Albert Einstein with the history of physics in a way that makes perfect sense. It's a great introduction to modern physics, including relativity theory, which Einstein formulated, quantum mechanics, which Einstein influenced, and the unified field theory and super strings, which Einstein laid the foundation for. I am not a physicist, and i don't pretend to understand any of these concepts, but after reading this book, i feel like i'e come closer to understanding. One of the things i especially liked about this presentation is that unlike other books about physics, this one does not rely on mathematics. Of course the author does not ignore math--he can't. Too much of physics relies on higher math. He simply mentions that the calculations took a long time. In one place he mentions that Einstein lacked the tools to formulate the theory, so he spent the whole summer studying Riemann geometry, and once he had mastered it, was able to complete the necessary computations. That was enough to convey the idea that when Einstein didn't know something, he knew what he needed to learn first, and went and learned it.The other ting he conveyed was the scientist's humility and humanity. In 1932, a book was published in Germany, entitled ""100 Arguments Against Einstein."" Einstein was unfazed by the book. ""If the Theory of Relativity is wrong, "" he said, ""they would not need a hundred arguments against it. One small fact could destroy it."" To this day, no one has found even one small fact to disprove relativity. In fact, as more advanced studies of the universe are conducted, more and more evidence has accumulated supporting Einstein and his conception of the cosmos."
95,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72049690-moe,4,"“Einstein’s Cosmos” by Michio Kaku is all you need to get to know Einstein, his theories, his personal life, his tremendous thought experiments and a lot more about his life. I honestly do not know where to start, Albert Einstein was an exceptionally intelligent person with exceptional skills, he was a special genius. He revolutionised modern physics and was one of the founders of “Quantum Physics”. He discovered that light wasn’t waves (as scientists assumed), and proved that light travels in very discrete particles. He named them photons.Although, I suppose, you could say the thing that made Einstein really extraordinary was his ability to fully concentrate for months on his work, isolating himself from the outside world. Einstein was not the best mathematician and ergo, he liked to use very simple thought experiments to discover and explain highly complex & heterogeneous scientific concerns. In 1905, Einstein published his “Special Theory of Relativity” which contained what is considered the most famous equation of all time, E=mc°2. This equation means that energy and mass are interchangeable; they are different forms of the same thing. Under the right conditions, energy can become mass, and vice versa. This equation was used to invent atomic power.He developed “The General Theory of Relativity”, which in itself is one of the pillars of modern physics (alongside Quantum Mechanics). He amended Newton’s laws (Nobody else dared to do so), and made them consistent with electrodynamics via Special Relativity, which he then developed further into General Relativity.Oh, and, he was a super funny dude as well. The book is absolutely recommended! - Moe xx..."
96,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2221071-michael-wallach,4,"The experience of reading about Einstein's theories is a fun challenge. Most theories I can understand the basics by just reading a longer explanation, but Einsteins theories are so non-intuitive, trying to understand them feels like jumping through a hoola hoop the size of your head. After reading this book I understand a few more things than I did before, mostly about how time works differently at higher speeds, and about how the speed of light interacts with mass and energy. These type of understandings drive my inner mystery and theory about the nature of the universe, and I was happy to possess a better picture of what relativity means in my head.This book could really be called an autobiography, since what took up more than half of this book was the fascinating story of Einstein himself. What train he was riding when his theories came to him, how he was perceived by the public at the time, and how he perceived his own successes and failures. He had remarkably humble demeanor, as well as a rebellious one. I do like to takeaway from these types of autobiographies the failures more so than the successes, because we always hear about the successes: the noble prizes, emc^2. But what about the struggles? Such stories always become more inspiring when they get more personal, and i think the failures are part of what drives the personal feeling of these books. And its no different in this book, Michio Kaku did a great job here."
97,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1507845-kc,4,"I read one of Kaku’s book way back in high school when I was doing a research paper on higher-dimensional space.I remember liking his style, and thought I’d get a little more exposure. This book about Einstein’s Cosmos seemed like a good place to start.Unexpectedly, this turns out to be an Einstein biography, focusing on his papers, his theories, and the development of scientific understanding about matter, energy, light, space, and the forces of nature. His contributions of relativity came surprisingly early, and his later quests were about finding the unifying theory that would explain all natural phenomena using consistent models, a quest that Stephen Hawking would continue later.This book was enjoyable, interesting, and informative. The historical context, especially surrounding the Manhattan project and atomic energy were especially interesting from the scientific perspective.When it came to the philosophical big questions, I really liked this quote, not from Einstein, but from Max Plank, champion of the quantum theory:""Science cannot solve the ultimate mystery of nature. And that is because, in the last analysis, we ourselves are a part of the mystery that we are trying to solve.""Isn’t that the truth."

But if you ca persevere over the scientific language and jargon (even though Kaku is one of my favorite physicists to read because he has a way of putting things in layman terms - it' still physics, there's only so far you can dumb it down), it is such an interesting and informative book about the work of a man truly ahead of his time."
99,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33175699-jo-o-ritto,5,"Einstein's popular story is full of myths and it is not hard to find cliché guru-like inspirational quotes misattributed to him. For example, a lot of people think that Einstein was bad in school but then turned out to be a genius mathematician... Michio Kaku tells the story of Einstein, focusing a lot on his scientific discoveries, and explains what was really Einstein's power. Einstein was not a brilliant mathematician (compared to true mathematicians), in fact if you understand the special relativity concept you see that the math that it involves is nothing out of the ordinary. Instead, Einstein's power lies on his ability to think of thought-experiments and pursue its answer persistently. Einstein's great journey of scientific discovery starts with the question of how one would see the world if one were travelling at the speed of light. Einstein ended up understanding that even if you're going very fast you still see the light running away from you at the same speed as before, and that is because time slows down. Then Einstein tackled general relativity, a more concept abstraction and it took him 3 years to be able to develop the math for the theory. Einstein did not know non-Euclidean geometry and had to study it in order to develop the theory, which only goes to show his persistence and the importance he attributed to understanding fully the mechanics of the universe.Einstein's character and discoveries are fascinating and that helps Michio Kaku a lot. But on the whole, I think that he does a very good job explaining Einstein's theories and the way he visualized them at the early stages of its development. A fascinating book for anyone interested in physics."

In reading about Einstein’s theories in this and other books, the various word pictures he used to describe his instructions gets did give me insight into some of his theories, but try as I might, any glimpses I gained as a result never got me past the most rudimentary elements of his thinking. This book, despite the author’s valiant attempt to make this subject matter comprehensible, was part wonderful biography and story telling, and part scientific mumbo jumbo (to me). Obviously, my understanding of science is at its most basic level: water is wet if it’s not a solid or a gas, air is what we breathe and is made up of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide (mostly), fire is often hot, and other basics. What I think I know of physics, notwithstanding a class in high school, comes from episodes of The Big Bang Theory television show. In imminently readable prose, the author walks readers through Einstein’s life, and the extraordinary breakthroughs in theoretical physics he made while working as an unheralded patent clerk. His breathtakingly new theories, then and in later years, overturned much of the world’s understanding of physics and spawned new fields of study and direct and indirect collaborators throughout his life and to the present day. Given my extreme ignorance, I will not feign understanding of his breakthroughs by quoting from the book, but even with my pitiable lack of knowledge, even I could grasp at least a tiny bit of the magnitude of his achievements, at least in the abstract.

For example, a lot of people think that Einstein was bad in school but then turned out to be a genius mathematician... Michio Kaku tells the story of Einstein, focusing a lot on his scientific discoveries, and explains what was really Einstein's power. Einstein was not a brilliant mathematician (compared to true mathematicians), in fact if you understand the special relativity concept you see that the math that it involves is nothing out of the ordinary. Instead, Einstein's power lies on his ability to think of thought-experiments and pursue its answer persistently. Einstein's great journey of scientific discovery starts with the question of how one would see the world if one were travelling at the speed of light. Einstein ended up understanding that even if you're going very fast you still see the light running away from you at the same speed as before, and that is because time slows down. Then Einstein tackled general relativity, a more concept abstraction and it took him 3 years to be able to develop the math for the theory. Einstein did not know non-Euclidean geometry and had to study it in order to develop the theory, which only goes to show his persistence and the importance he attributed to understanding fully the mechanics of the universe.Einstein's character and discoveries are fascinating and that helps Michio Kaku a lot. But on the whole, I think that he does a very good job explaining Einstein's theories and the way he visualized them at the early stages of its development. A fascinating book for anyone interested in physics."

Sometimes the books I read go a little beyond what I fully understand. Kaku makes physics accessible to everyone. I love that this book has a nice biographical element. He traces Einstein's history with his discoveries. I enjoyed his background of Schroedinger, Bohrs, and many other names you hear about when you study science. It got a little dense in the one of the middle sections but overall it was great stuff. "

People acquire and discard them at will. However, what people lack is the strength in their convictions. How sure are you of something you believe in? Did you arrive at those conclusions by yourself or did someone tell you those things that you believe? Science is this abstract thing that no one really understands.

Michio Kaku tells the story of Einstein, focusing a lot on his scientific discoveries, and explains what was really Einstein's power. Einstein was not a brilliant mathematician (compared to true mathematicians), in fact if you understand the special relativity concept you see that the math that it involves is nothing out of the ordinary. Instead, Einstein's power lies on his ability to think of thought-experiments and pursue its answer persistently. Einstein's great journey of scientific discovery starts with the question of how one would see the world if one were travelling at the speed of light. Einstein ended up understanding that even if you're going very fast you still see the light running away from you at the same speed as before, and that is because time slows down. Then Einstein tackled general relativity, a more concept abstraction and it took him 3 years to be able to develop the math for the theory. Einstein did not know non-Euclidean geometry and had to study it in order to develop the theory, which only goes to show his persistence and the importance he attributed to understanding fully the mechanics of the universe.Einstein's character and discoveries are fascinating and that helps Michio Kaku a lot.

182,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19071374-sammy,5,"Seriously good. Must read for everyone.The big challenges of the 21st century: fascism, populism, inaction on climate change, religious fanaticism, all result from the scientific illiteracy of the larger public and their adult educators, the media. It’s 2020 and most journalists and people still don’t understand that climate change and global warming is caused by human activity. Within the scientific community, there’s a 99.5% consensus on this fact, yet people still don’t ‘believe’ this to be true.We’re in the post-truth disinformation age because opinions are a dime a dozen. People acquire and discard them at will. However, what people lack is the strength in their convictions. How sure are you of something you believe in? Did you arrive at those conclusions by yourself or did someone tell you those things that you believe? Science is this abstract thing that no one really understands. We don’t usually understand the conclusions scientists come up with, just like when Einstein came out with general relativity, no one understood that. Yet, the scientific community’s attempt to give a metaphysical picture of the universe and its origins is more than sound than any philosophical or religious discourse. This is because the community values using methods that make arriving at conclusions checkable. It brings to mind the recent publication of a paper in the lancet journal that linked hydroxychloroquine with problems in patients suffering from the novel coronavirus. The scientists doing the study and the company that provided them with the date were soon found to have errors in their data and its analysis, and the paper was subsequently retracted from the lancet journal and an apology was issued. Now think, how many politicians or religious leaders have ever retracted any statements they make upon encountering their errors? Literally zero.We all need to have ‘beliefs’ to go about our days. What we do or not do in any given situation depends on what we think about things. People seem content to get their ‘beliefs’ by and large from the media and/or politicians. However those sources themselves are scientifically illiterate. It’s the blind leading the blind for the most part. No wonder the world seems to be collapsing into itself, running from apocalypse to apocalypse, with the thinking among us waiting for the inevitable rise in sea levels which will render most of our coastal cities that we spent 1000 years developing unlivable. A billion climate refugees on the horizon and the unseeing world gyrates to tiktoks, fueled by disinformation that we constantly receive on our pocket supercomputers.If there is to be any hope, it’s science. Respect science. Educate yourself and others. Otherwise there’s very little chance of a natural death for any of us!"
183,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11618077-bruce-cline,4,"Einstein’s Cosmos, How Albert Einstein’s Vision Transformed Our Understanding of Space and Time, by Micho Kaku (pp 233). Professor Einstein once wrote “All physical theories, their mathematical expression notwithstanding, ought to lend themselves to so simple a description that even a child could understand.” While I’m no longer a child, I’d like to think I can understand much that children understand, but apparently I can’t. In reading about Einstein’s theories in this and other books, the various word pictures he used to describe his instructions gets did give me insight into some of his theories, but try as I might, any glimpses I gained as a result never got me past the most rudimentary elements of his thinking. This book, despite the author’s valiant attempt to make this subject matter comprehensible, was part wonderful biography and story telling, and part scientific mumbo jumbo (to me). Obviously, my understanding of science is at its most basic level: water is wet if it’s not a solid or a gas, air is what we breathe and is made up of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide (mostly), fire is often hot, and other basics. What I think I know of physics, notwithstanding a class in high school, comes from episodes of The Big Bang Theory television show. In imminently readable prose, the author walks readers through Einstein’s life, and the extraordinary breakthroughs in theoretical physics he made while working as an unheralded patent clerk. His breathtakingly new theories, then and in later years, overturned much of the world’s understanding of physics and spawned new fields of study and direct and indirect collaborators throughout his life and to the present day. Given my extreme ignorance, I will not feign understanding of his breakthroughs by quoting from the book, but even with my pitiable lack of knowledge, even I could grasp at least a tiny bit of the magnitude of his achievements, at least in the abstract. Micho Kaku walks the reader through Einstein’s work, compares it to his predecessors include Newton and Maxwell, and throws in fellow physicists whose names many of your will know: Planck, Schrodinger (of cat fame), Heisenberg (uncertainty principle), Fermi, Oppenheimer, Bohr, Hubble, Higgs, and more. Despite the many passages that defied my brain cells’ ability to comprehend, this was a fascinating book and was well worth my time. "
184,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52515493-yehudit-reishtein,5,"Michio Kaku weaves a biography of Albert Einstein with the history of physics in a way that makes perfect sense. It's a great introduction to modern physics, including relativity theory, which Einstein formulated, quantum mechanics, which Einstein influenced, and the unified field theory and super strings, which Einstein laid the foundation for. I am not a physicist, and i don't pretend to understand any of these concepts, but after reading this book, i feel like i'e come closer to understanding. One of the things i especially liked about this presentation is that unlike other books about physics, this one does not rely on mathematics. Of course the author does not ignore math--he can't. Too much of physics relies on higher math. He simply mentions that the calculations took a long time. In one place he mentions that Einstein lacked the tools to formulate the theory, so he spent the whole summer studying Riemann geometry, and once he had mastered it, was able to complete the necessary computations. That was enough to convey the idea that when Einstein didn't know something, he knew what he needed to learn first, and went and learned it.The other ting he conveyed was the scientist's humility and humanity. In 1932, a book was published in Germany, entitled ""100 Arguments Against Einstein."" Einstein was unfazed by the book. ""If the Theory of Relativity is wrong, "" he said, ""they would not need a hundred arguments against it. One small fact could destroy it."" To this day, no one has found even one small fact to disprove relativity. In fact, as more advanced studies of the universe are conducted, more and more evidence has accumulated supporting Einstein and his conception of the cosmos."
185,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72049690-moe,4,"“Einstein’s Cosmos” by Michio Kaku is all you need to get to know Einstein, his theories, his personal life, his tremendous thought experiments and a lot more about his life. I honestly do not know where to start, Albert Einstein was an exceptionally intelligent person with exceptional skills, he was a special genius. He revolutionised modern physics and was one of the founders of “Quantum Physics”. He discovered that light wasn’t waves (as scientists assumed), and proved that light travels in very discrete particles. He named them photons.Although, I suppose, you could say the thing that made Einstein really extraordinary was his ability to fully concentrate for months on his work, isolating himself from the outside world. Einstein was not the best mathematician and ergo, he liked to use very simple thought experiments to discover and explain highly complex & heterogeneous scientific concerns. In 1905, Einstein published his “Special Theory of Relativity” which contained what is considered the most famous equation of all time, E=mc°2. This equation means that energy and mass are interchangeable; they are different forms of the same thing. Under the right conditions, energy can become mass, and vice versa. This equation was used to invent atomic power.He developed “The General Theory of Relativity”, which in itself is one of the pillars of modern physics (alongside Quantum Mechanics). He amended Newton’s laws (Nobody else dared to do so), and made them consistent with electrodynamics via Special Relativity, which he then developed further into General Relativity.Oh, and, he was a super funny dude as well. The book is absolutely recommended! - Moe xx..."
186,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2221071-michael-wallach,4,"The experience of reading about Einstein's theories is a fun challenge. Most theories I can understand the basics by just reading a longer explanation, but Einsteins theories are so non-intuitive, trying to understand them feels like jumping through a hoola hoop the size of your head. After reading this book I understand a few more things than I did before, mostly about how time works differently at higher speeds, and about how the speed of light interacts with mass and energy. These type of understandings drive my inner mystery and theory about the nature of the universe, and I was happy to possess a better picture of what relativity means in my head.This book could really be called an autobiography, since what took up more than half of this book was the fascinating story of Einstein himself. What train he was riding when his theories came to him, how he was perceived by the public at the time, and how he perceived his own successes and failures. He had remarkably humble demeanor, as well as a rebellious one. I do like to takeaway from these types of autobiographies the failures more so than the successes, because we always hear about the successes: the noble prizes, emc^2. But what about the struggles? Such stories always become more inspiring when they get more personal, and i think the failures are part of what drives the personal feeling of these books. And its no different in this book, Michio Kaku did a great job here."

This book about Einstein’s Cosmos seemed like a good place to start.Unexpectedly, this turns out to be an Einstein biography, focusing on his papers, his theories, and the development of scientific understanding about matter, energy, light, space, and the forces of nature. His contributions of relativity came surprisingly early, and his later quests were about finding the unifying theory that would explain all natural phenomena using consistent models, a quest that Stephen Hawking would continue later.This book was enjoyable, interesting, and informative. The historical context, especially surrounding the Manhattan project and atomic energy were especially interesting from the scientific perspective.When it came to the philosophical big questions, I really liked this quote, not from Einstein, but from Max Plank, champion of the quantum theory:""Science cannot solve the ultimate mystery of nature. And that is because, in the last analysis, we ourselves are a part of the mystery that we are trying to solve.""Isn’t that the truth."

In reading about Einstein’s theories in this and other books, the various word pictures he used to describe his instructions gets did give me insight into some of his theories, but try as I might, any glimpses I gained as a result never got me past the most rudimentary elements of his thinking. This book, despite the author’s valiant attempt to make this subject matter comprehensible, was part wonderful biography and story telling, and part scientific mumbo jumbo (to me). Obviously, my understanding of science is at its most basic level: water is wet if it’s not a solid or a gas, air is what we breathe and is made up of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide (mostly), fire is often hot, and other basics. What I think I know of physics, notwithstanding a class in high school, comes from episodes of The Big Bang Theory television show. In imminently readable prose, the author walks readers through Einstein’s life, and the extraordinary breakthroughs in theoretical physics he made while working as an unheralded patent clerk. His breathtakingly new theories, then and in later years, overturned much of the world’s understanding of physics and spawned new fields of study and direct and indirect collaborators throughout his life and to the present day. Given my extreme ignorance, I will not feign understanding of his breakthroughs by quoting from the book, but even with my pitiable lack of knowledge, even I could grasp at least a tiny bit of the magnitude of his achievements, at least in the abstract.

And its no different in this book, Michio Kaku did a great job here."
217,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1507845-kc,4,"I read one of Kaku’s book way back in high school when I was doing a research paper on higher-dimensional space.I remember liking his style, and thought I’d get a little more exposure. This book about Einstein’s Cosmos seemed like a good place to start.Unexpectedly, this turns out to be an Einstein biography, focusing on his papers, his theories, and the development of scientific understanding about matter, energy, light, space, and the forces of nature. His contributions of relativity came surprisingly early, and his later quests were about finding the unifying theory that would explain all natural phenomena using consistent models, a quest that Stephen Hawking would continue later.This book was enjoyable, interesting, and informative. The historical context, especially surrounding the Manhattan project and atomic energy were especially interesting from the scientific perspective.When it came to the philosophical big questions, I really liked this quote, not from Einstein, but from Max Plank, champion of the quantum theory:""Science cannot solve the ultimate mystery of nature. And that is because, in the last analysis, we ourselves are a part of the mystery that we are trying to solve.""Isn’t that the truth."

But if you ca persevere over the scientific language and jargon (even though Kaku is one of my favorite physicists to read because he has a way of putting things in layman terms - it' still physics, there's only so far you can dumb it down), it is such an interesting and informative book about the work of a man truly ahead of his time."
219,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33175699-jo-o-ritto,5,"Einstein's popular story is full of myths and it is not hard to find cliché guru-like inspirational quotes misattributed to him. For example, a lot of people think that Einstein was bad in school but then turned out to be a genius mathematician... Michio Kaku tells the story of Einstein, focusing a lot on his scientific discoveries, and explains what was really Einstein's power. Einstein was not a brilliant mathematician (compared to true mathematicians), in fact if you understand the special relativity concept you see that the math that it involves is nothing out of the ordinary. Instead, Einstein's power lies on his ability to think of thought-experiments and pursue its answer persistently. Einstein's great journey of scientific discovery starts with the question of how one would see the world if one were travelling at the speed of light. Einstein ended up understanding that even if you're going very fast you still see the light running away from you at the same speed as before, and that is because time slows down. Then Einstein tackled general relativity, a more concept abstraction and it took him 3 years to be able to develop the math for the theory. Einstein did not know non-Euclidean geometry and had to study it in order to develop the theory, which only goes to show his persistence and the importance he attributed to understanding fully the mechanics of the universe.Einstein's character and discoveries are fascinating and that helps Michio Kaku a lot. But on the whole, I think that he does a very good job explaining Einstein's theories and the way he visualized them at the early stages of its development. A fascinating book for anyone interested in physics."
220,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114531066-michael-rostom,5,"The book was awesome, and a must-read for anyone who doesn't understand what Einstein did in the physics world, or why was he so famous.The book does not dive into any equation, which makes it a good read for anyone that doesn't know physics(like me) but wants to know more without being bombarded with symbols and equations.That said I think Mr.Kaku had some things that were not explained and were thought of as common knowledge, especially in the last couple of pages, supersymmetry, and the other stuff, it didn't make sense to me.Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the book, 10/10 would recommend to everyone."
221,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10917960-joshua,4,"This is a fantastic book. I don't consider myself to anything but someone interested in physics. Sometimes the books I read go a little beyond what I fully understand. Kaku makes physics accessible to everyone. I love that this book has a nice biographical element. He traces Einstein's history with his discoveries. I enjoyed his background of Schroedinger, Bohrs, and many other names you hear about when you study science. It got a little dense in the one of the middle sections but overall it was great stuff. "
222,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55064342-j-keith,4,"A Fascinating read even if challenging.For me the book was difficult. I'm unlearned at Physics, Math, and Astronomy. So many parts of the book were difficult to understand. However it induced in me a desire to learn. Einstein was much more fascinating than I knew and now I want to know more. I'd recommend it but I think you'll get more out of it if you have a basic understanding of underlying principles."

One of the more accessible introductions I've read, and the personal touches were interesting. It's also an attempt to redeem Einstein's legacy against perceived slurs from the quantum theoretical crowd, with an epilogue discussing how experimental results are still validating his predictions."

272,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19071374-sammy,5,"Seriously good. Must read for everyone.The big challenges of the 21st century: fascism, populism, inaction on climate change, religious fanaticism, all result from the scientific illiteracy of the larger public and their adult educators, the media. It’s 2020 and most journalists and people still don’t understand that climate change and global warming is caused by human activity. Within the scientific community, there’s a 99.5% consensus on this fact, yet people still don’t ‘believe’ this to be true.We’re in the post-truth disinformation age because opinions are a dime a dozen. People acquire and discard them at will. However, what people lack is the strength in their convictions. How sure are you of something you believe in? Did you arrive at those conclusions by yourself or did someone tell you those things that you believe? Science is this abstract thing that no one really understands. We don’t usually understand the conclusions scientists come up with, just like when Einstein came out with general relativity, no one understood that. Yet, the scientific community’s attempt to give a metaphysical picture of the universe and its origins is more than sound than any philosophical or religious discourse. This is because the community values using methods that make arriving at conclusions checkable. It brings to mind the recent publication of a paper in the lancet journal that linked hydroxychloroquine with problems in patients suffering from the novel coronavirus. The scientists doing the study and the company that provided them with the date were soon found to have errors in their data and its analysis, and the paper was subsequently retracted from the lancet journal and an apology was issued. Now think, how many politicians or religious leaders have ever retracted any statements they make upon encountering their errors? Literally zero.We all need to have ‘beliefs’ to go about our days. What we do or not do in any given situation depends on what we think about things. People seem content to get their ‘beliefs’ by and large from the media and/or politicians. However those sources themselves are scientifically illiterate. It’s the blind leading the blind for the most part. No wonder the world seems to be collapsing into itself, running from apocalypse to apocalypse, with the thinking among us waiting for the inevitable rise in sea levels which will render most of our coastal cities that we spent 1000 years developing unlivable. A billion climate refugees on the horizon and the unseeing world gyrates to tiktoks, fueled by disinformation that we constantly receive on our pocket supercomputers.If there is to be any hope, it’s science. Respect science. Educate yourself and others. Otherwise there’s very little chance of a natural death for any of us!"
273,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11618077-bruce-cline,4,"Einstein’s Cosmos, How Albert Einstein’s Vision Transformed Our Understanding of Space and Time, by Micho Kaku (pp 233). Professor Einstein once wrote “All physical theories, their mathematical expression notwithstanding, ought to lend themselves to so simple a description that even a child could understand.” While I’m no longer a child, I’d like to think I can understand much that children understand, but apparently I can’t. In reading about Einstein’s theories in this and other books, the various word pictures he used to describe his instructions gets did give me insight into some of his theories, but try as I might, any glimpses I gained as a result never got me past the most rudimentary elements of his thinking. This book, despite the author’s valiant attempt to make this subject matter comprehensible, was part wonderful biography and story telling, and part scientific mumbo jumbo (to me). Obviously, my understanding of science is at its most basic level: water is wet if it’s not a solid or a gas, air is what we breathe and is made up of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide (mostly), fire is often hot, and other basics. What I think I know of physics, notwithstanding a class in high school, comes from episodes of The Big Bang Theory television show. In imminently readable prose, the author walks readers through Einstein’s life, and the extraordinary breakthroughs in theoretical physics he made while working as an unheralded patent clerk. His breathtakingly new theories, then and in later years, overturned much of the world’s understanding of physics and spawned new fields of study and direct and indirect collaborators throughout his life and to the present day. Given my extreme ignorance, I will not feign understanding of his breakthroughs by quoting from the book, but even with my pitiable lack of knowledge, even I could grasp at least a tiny bit of the magnitude of his achievements, at least in the abstract. Micho Kaku walks the reader through Einstein’s work, compares it to his predecessors include Newton and Maxwell, and throws in fellow physicists whose names many of your will know: Planck, Schrodinger (of cat fame), Heisenberg (uncertainty principle), Fermi, Oppenheimer, Bohr, Hubble, Higgs, and more. Despite the many passages that defied my brain cells’ ability to comprehend, this was a fascinating book and was well worth my time. "
274,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52515493-yehudit-reishtein,5,"Michio Kaku weaves a biography of Albert Einstein with the history of physics in a way that makes perfect sense. It's a great introduction to modern physics, including relativity theory, which Einstein formulated, quantum mechanics, which Einstein influenced, and the unified field theory and super strings, which Einstein laid the foundation for. I am not a physicist, and i don't pretend to understand any of these concepts, but after reading this book, i feel like i'e come closer to understanding. One of the things i especially liked about this presentation is that unlike other books about physics, this one does not rely on mathematics. Of course the author does not ignore math--he can't. Too much of physics relies on higher math. He simply mentions that the calculations took a long time. In one place he mentions that Einstein lacked the tools to formulate the theory, so he spent the whole summer studying Riemann geometry, and once he had mastered it, was able to complete the necessary computations. That was enough to convey the idea that when Einstein didn't know something, he knew what he needed to learn first, and went and learned it.The other ting he conveyed was the scientist's humility and humanity. In 1932, a book was published in Germany, entitled ""100 Arguments Against Einstein."" Einstein was unfazed by the book. ""If the Theory of Relativity is wrong, "" he said, ""they would not need a hundred arguments against it. One small fact could destroy it."" To this day, no one has found even one small fact to disprove relativity. In fact, as more advanced studies of the universe are conducted, more and more evidence has accumulated supporting Einstein and his conception of the cosmos."
275,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72049690-moe,4,"“Einstein’s Cosmos” by Michio Kaku is all you need to get to know Einstein, his theories, his personal life, his tremendous thought experiments and a lot more about his life. I honestly do not know where to start, Albert Einstein was an exceptionally intelligent person with exceptional skills, he was a special genius. He revolutionised modern physics and was one of the founders of “Quantum Physics”. He discovered that light wasn’t waves (as scientists assumed), and proved that light travels in very discrete particles. He named them photons.Although, I suppose, you could say the thing that made Einstein really extraordinary was his ability to fully concentrate for months on his work, isolating himself from the outside world. Einstein was not the best mathematician and ergo, he liked to use very simple thought experiments to discover and explain highly complex & heterogeneous scientific concerns. In 1905, Einstein published his “Special Theory of Relativity” which contained what is considered the most famous equation of all time, E=mc°2. This equation means that energy and mass are interchangeable; they are different forms of the same thing. Under the right conditions, energy can become mass, and vice versa. This equation was used to invent atomic power.He developed “The General Theory of Relativity”, which in itself is one of the pillars of modern physics (alongside Quantum Mechanics). He amended Newton’s laws (Nobody else dared to do so), and made them consistent with electrodynamics via Special Relativity, which he then developed further into General Relativity.Oh, and, he was a super funny dude as well. The book is absolutely recommended! - Moe xx..."

Most theories I can understand the basics by just reading a longer explanation, but Einsteins theories are so non-intuitive, trying to understand them feels like jumping through a hoola hoop the size of your head. After reading this book I understand a few more things than I did before, mostly about how time works differently at higher speeds, and about how the speed of light interacts with mass and energy. These type of understandings drive my inner mystery and theory about the nature of the universe, and I was happy to possess a better picture of what relativity means in my head.This book could really be called an autobiography, since what took up more than half of this book was the fascinating story of Einstein himself. What train he was riding when his theories came to him, how he was perceived by the public at the time, and how he perceived his own successes and failures. He had remarkably humble demeanor, as well as a rebellious one.

292,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12788229-christopher,4," As far as the biography portion on Einstein, I would say it is somewhat rose-tinted. Kaku seems annoyed by other biographers of Einstein quite a bit. However, his explanation of Einstein's contributions to physics is first rate. "
293,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43010515-paolo-calabr,3,"Kaku mixes biography with hardcore theoretical physics too freely in this book. I wasn’t ready to be exposed to ten dimensions, time travel via black hole, and parallel universes. Definitely not an easy read, although compelling."
294,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92847905,4,"A great book about a great person not just a great scientist. It is a biography book more than a physics book and it focused at einistien the human more than the great scientist einistien , but still a very useful book though."
295,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2850127-purcell,3,"I certainly don't understand relativity or modern physics, but I understand more than I did before this book :)"
296,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3558868-michael-flick,3,"Light on theory, made up by generous on historical context. As advertised..."
297,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37678060-gary,4,"Kaku deftly discusses modern physics and, in a well-rounded manner, with humor, emotion, and sometimes a little sarcasm, tells Einstein’s wonderful story once more. "

299,0393327000,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56390031-fred-herlihy,5,Excellent layman's take on the scientific juggernaut. Want to reread over and over.
