0,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24035606-ryan-boissonneault,3,"Skin in the Game is at the same time thought-provoking and original but also contradictory and sometimes absurd. Let’s start with the cons:1. I certainly won’t be the first to notice that Taleb can be mean-spirited. But why does he insist on presenting his views in this way? The communication of his ideas, often profound, does not require a mean-spirited or condescending tone. For however brilliant Taleb thinks he is, his skills in persuasion are severely lacking; he’s alienating a significant readership that may have otherwise been more receptive to his ideas.Not very far into the book we see Taleb take cheap shots at Steven Pinker, out of nowhere, discussing a topic that has nothing to do with any of Pinker’s actual ideas or positions. One wonders why Taleb cannot just present his ideas without the incessant personal attacks and condescension. 2. His overall philosophy appears to be self-refuting. He reviles “intellectuals,” professors, and thinkers while praising “doers” and men of practice. He’s particularly distrustful of those who give advice for a living. Here’s Taleb:“Avoid taking advice from someone who gives advice for a living, unless there is a penalty for their advice.”So should we then ignore this advice? As far as I can tell, Skin in the Game is a work of philosophy, an intellectual exercise that argues against the value of intellectual exercise. This is the same self-refuting logic of relativism—in that the statement “everything is relative” is self-refuting because the statement itself needs to be absolute. If Taleb is wrong in any part of his philosophy it doesn’t appear that he would incur any penalty (no skin in the game). The upside for him is book sales with little to no downside risk, so by using his own logic we should conclude to not trust him. Also, to the extent that you believe ideas have power you might find yourself disagreeing with Taleb’s extreme position that no good ideas could possibly come from someone in an academic position (particularly from the reviled economists). Except that Taleb uses economic theories to frame his thinking. The Tragedy of the Commons, something Taleb discusses in his book, was developed by the economist William Forster Lloyd in his armchair. Even Taleb’s Black Swan concept is a reformulation of the Peso problem developed by...economists. I’m sure anyone can think up examples, rather easily, of useful ideas that were discovered by intellectuals or from university research. How about Einstein's theory of relativity, which preceded GPS technology, which wouldn't exist without it.3. Taleb obsesses about the superiority of practice over academics and theory. This is a questionable proposition.As just one example, a recent study in the American Journal of Medicine concluded that “patients whose doctors had practiced for at least 20 years stayed longer in the hospital and were more likely to die compared to those whose doctors got their medical license in the past five years.”My own personal experience corroborates this, as a medical student was able to correctly diagnose what the attending physician had missed on a trip to the ER. Very experienced, practical individuals sometimes perpetuate bad habits and fail to keep informed of the theories and academics that lead to better practice. This point is completely lost on Taleb. 4. Taleb’s definition of rationality as any action that promotes survival is patently false, as a simple thought experiment can show. Imagine a hypothetical survival machine is available for your use. By plugging yourself in, it will guarantee and maximize your life span and, on a social scale, maximizes reproduction. The price is that the machine also inflicts a high degree of pain and cuts you off from contact with other people. According to the logic of Taleb, the rational thing to do would be to plug into this machine. Of course, no one would volunteer to do this because survival is not what motivates rational behavior. Any rational agent would choose one year of pleasant life over 100 years in the survival machine, because actions have value according to how they promote or are perceived to promote well-being or pleasure. Taleb, using this more believable definition of rationality, could have used it to argue the same points, namely how religious belief cannot be called irrational if it promotes well-being, which includes psychological well-being and survival but not survival alone. The pros:That Taleb is antagonistic and holds some questionable views does not mean that he’s wrong about everything. When not being demeaning or taking extreme positions, Taleb writes about some of the most original, thought-provoking, and profound ideas. And even when you find yourself disagreeing with him, he makes you think. For this reason alone, the book is worth checking out. The idea that the extent of people’s stakes in particular outcomes is a critical yet underrated determinant of events is a profound idea with several implications, which Taleb skillfully explores throughout the book. And his idea that you should have to pay some kind of penalty for decisions that negatively impact others—risk sharing vs. risk transfer—is a solid framework for thinking about a host of issues. Of course, these ideas would be easier to swallow if presented with a little more humility, but I suppose we should know what to expect from Taleb by now."
1,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4903281-philippe,5,"Taleb’s ‘Skin in the Game’ has been put together in a somewhat disorderly way, but the reasoning goes as follows:1. The world in which we live is complex and eludes our sense-making faculties.2. Our society has cultivated a privileged class of Intellectuals Yet Idiots (IYIs). These people monopolize positions of authority and routinely take decisions to intervene in that complex world, without however doing the effort to think through the cascading impacts of these decisions and being conveniently isolated from any tangible repercussions on themselves. In other words, these people have nothing at stake. They have no skin the game. 3. The absence of skin in the game comes with undesirable epistemological consequences. Because people who are isolated from the impacts of their decisions do not learn. They remain captive to their erroneous ideas about how the world works. As a result our systems ‘rot’, i.e. they become ever more fragile. 4. Sooner or later this is going to cause a lot of trouble. The geopolitical and military deadlocks in the Middle East are just one example of severe and long-term implications of misguided efforts to engage in ‘nation building’. As our technological powers grow and our systems mushroom and interconnect, the likelihood of catastrophic downside consequences ratchets up too. 5. Absence of skin in the game also leads to objectionable ethical consequences. It leads to an inequitable distribution of risks and resources in society. 6. To mitigate adverse effects of incautious and irresponsible courses of action, authorities are wont to create an ever more granular web of rules and regulations. Getting rid of these regulations is much harder than to create them. But opportunistic operators with deep pockets always find loopholes in this tangle. That’s the problem situation that is sketched out by the author. Now, what can we do about this? 1. We need to compartmentalize risks by focusing on our immediate environment. We need to decentralize and reduce the scale of the systems we meddle with. 2. We need to honor the precautionary principle: ""if we don’t understand something and it has a systemic effect, just avoid it."" 3. Rather than masterplans and fixed strategies we need practical ethical and operational rules to guide local experimentation and problem solving. One way to unearth these rules is by deep knowledge of probability theory (Taleb’s speciality). 4. From probability theory follows that uncertainty can be beneficial, if we engage in ‘convex tinkering’, i.e. engage in small bets where gains and harm are asymmetric. So we need to find or construct settings that exhibit this ‘convexity bias’ (this material was discussed more extensively in Taleb’s Antifragile).5. Insisting that as many people in the community should have skin in the game is ethically sound. The principle emerges at the intersection of three main ethical systems: Kantian, consequentialism, and classical virtue. 6. Also, we need as many decision makers as possible to have skin in the game for the ‘intelligence of time’ to filter out what harms and select what contributes to our survival.7. Taleb puts great store in the property of ergodicity. I understand it to work at different logical levels. Not having skin in the game leads to a non-ergodic system, i.e. a system that shows some absorptive capacity that lowers risks for a minority to the detriment for the majority. So, in a non-ergodic system a person who gets rich will stay rich. Perfect ergodicity would imply that each person, should (s)he live forever, would spend a proportion of the time in the economic conditions of the entire cross-section. At the higher logical level, ergodicity links my personal fate to the fate of the community and larger ecosystem from which I am part. Loss of my personal life is a necessity to lower the risk for the collective as shorter shelf life for humans allows genetic changes across generations to be in sync with the variability of the environment. 8. We need to leverage the minority rule, ""mother of all a asymmetries”, to strategically exercise influence. A small, intransigent group in society is able to impose its preferences on a much larger flexible group because of the asymmetry in choices that defines their relationship (at least as long as the minority group is not spatially ghettoized and the cost structure associated with their preferences is more or less comparable to the original societal norm). So, given asymmetry somewhere (“and asymmetry is present is about everything”) it is possible to build scale in influencing the dynamics of large, complex socio-technical systems.9. Vice versa, we need to mindful about the fact that the minority rule can also be used to advance extremist agendas. Hence democracy has to be uncompromising vis-à-vis the intolerant minority that wants to destroy it.10. In general: good (market) structures neutralize the stupidity of those participating in them. Whatever one may think of Taleb’s confrontational style, I find his ideas are extremely valuable. He is a genuine systems thinker, informed by a deep knowledge of probability theory and what that means for how we (ought to) deal with risk and uncertainty. Much of what today passes for 'systems thinking’ has a high cuddle factor. It flourishes on a nebulous jargon of ‘interconnection’, ‘wholes’ and ‘emergence’. Taleb’s systems talk is hard-edged and unsentimental, and it reflects an attractive ethos of classical virtue that meshes courage and prudence. Now the challenge is not only to read the book, but also to absorb it and reflect it in the conduct of one's life."
2,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,1,"SITG is an angry rant. It lacks structure. The core message - mainly because of the author’s often misplaced and wrong arguments against his self-created adversaries - is never examined beyond the title’s most known or intuitive conventional meaning. The basic concept is at least as old as the adage itself. The author does little to bolster the claim while spending all efforts on slamming real or imagined opponents. The book’s frequent diversions along with internal contradictions amid a rather inchoate verbiage cause some of the good points to vanish in the flames of the next rant before they make any lasting impressions. Mr Taleb is a very smart author, but not necessarily a right one. He uses a plethora of subterfuge and polemic to diss potential criticism. Yet, he fails to realise that this does not make many of his arguments any more right or less incomplete than they are. The following is his usual modus operandi, and it is in the most jarring display all through the latest book:- He would begin by loudly and repeatedly claiming some massively important and amazing “discovery” which is a part controversial, a lot fully known for centuries, and presented as if discovered indisputably by the author.- Rather than providing any meaningful proofs behind his outlandish, over-generalising, without shades of grey statements, he would boast his own mathematical prowess and keep claiming how he has already shown substantial proofs. Effectively, the proofs are never presented but claims of them are everywhere. It is likely that wherever those proofs exist, they are on sketchy data and little analysis but his loud claims would hint as if they are as indisputable as two and two make four. He will repeat this so many times assuming that if he repeats enough number of times he has shown the proof, he has!- He would spend all the energy belittling the potential critics. Without addressing the likely counterarguments, he would begin by castigating the present or future contradicting voices as people without even basic knowledge, integrity, brains, reputational or financial interests. Mr Taleb would keep advertising his own mathematical mastery (likely rudimentary based on the scant pieces of evidence) while first accusing others of not knowing anything and if cornered, dismissing them for knowing too much/being pedantic/being too mathematical/academic etc. Even if one is to fully disagree with a Picketty, a Pinkell, a Thaler or a Dawkins, the likely path is not by simply smashing their intelligence or theoretical knowledge. Mr Taleb genuinely believes that such thinkers would not know the basics of theories like probability. According to the author, these quantum physics quoting personalities otherwise know nothing but words. Of course, the inequality loving author sees himself as the better champion of the oppressed!- Effectively, the shouting down will alternate between two forms: “the others do not know anything” and “pseudo-intellectuals just know too much and as a result cannot see the woods for the trees”. Mr. Taleb has fixed views. Some of his views are archaic, some self-serving, some sensible and some downright abhorrent - with most under more than one categories. There is little consistency in his thesis and most of what he writes is to prove that he has figured it all out and the life he leads is the ideal. His all-pervasive braggadocio in the book is only trumped by the justification for arrogance - a new trend which was not so visible in his earlier works. As before, he takes an extreme position to bash many of his pet hates not only without recognising those adversaries’ positions but also turning a blind eye to the many weaknesses of his own arguments. Let’s start with the basic message of the book that fails to recognise that a reasonable man would try to minimise his SITG where possible even if a society may want to be at the opposite end.- As the author himself would like to do in his own financial world, at the individual or micro level, every being will try to minimise risks for maximum possible returns. Without the author’s despised theoretical constructs to argue this in a structured way, one would expect a rational man to take only the risk needed and no more. If there is an opportunity, for whatever reason, whereby a woman can, say, mine all the remaining bitcoins in the next ten minutes without risk, the author himself would suggest the woman take the chance and make merry.- To make this fair, a system or society - however defined - might attempt to remove situations where some have asymmetric risk-return. This would be a worthy goal for a society to reduce the role played by chance of any kind. However, given the way the practical life is, any system will always be playing a catch-up against individuals perpetually on the hunt for easy opportunities. The smartest in the society will be continuously unearthing low personal risk, high personal gain situations while quietly transferring some of the hidden risks affecting their own bodies to the rest. This is how most individuals would behave - a basic human tendency that cannot be wished away. The author has no clear suggestions on how a system could get ahead of the return-seeking, Adam Smith’s rational individuals except the clarion call for this to somehow be done.Another broad point that the author misses is what the skin in the game is and for what types of causes it should exist:- A typical human being pursues many goals. And a majority of them are where failures do not need to cause any personal hurt. If I am trying to cause a child to smile, feed a sick, run a mile under five, learn quantum mechanics for self-fulfilment, a failure does not have to come with pain. This is true in commercial aspects of life too: an entrepreneur may want to spend efforts tutoring a person she cares about, a programmer is writing an app just to see it being used, a financial investor decides not to invest in sin companies are some examples.- What causes hurt is highly personal and situation specific. A rich person, like the author himself perhaps, feels no hurt shedding a few million on a risk if his wealth is in billions. For someone sensitive, a word of disapproval could spark suicidal thoughts. The author describes SITG as absolute in physical and financial forms - nothing could be more wrong than such absolute claims.- Externalities: So many risk-takers never understand or care about far higher risks they could be taking for many others who do not know or do not have a say. Entrepreneurs who go bust often hurt others in the society/family around through their failures apart from bankers and investors. The same is true for generals who love to be on the war front, putting themselves at risk, and countless others on the battlefield and outside. - A complex society like today needs far many who are non-entrepreneurs, advisers, academics and likes along with its entrepreneurs. The author - who hates to even have assistants - cannot live this life without a bevvy of legal advisers, infrastructure designers, financial planners, cleaners, accountants etc, most of whom cannot be entrepreneurs. One cannot create an iPhone, a road, an army or even an investment firm where no one works for anyone else. A functioning society needs many risk takers, as it needs people of many other types who do not need to take risks. May be, what the author wanted to write was how as a society, there is not enough risk-taking. However, the main purpose of the book is effectively to pound those the author has strongest dislikes for. These people - from diverse groups of life - are bureaucrats, academicians, company executives, journalists, book reviewers (!), and even those who study, believe in theoretical pursuits of any kind, philosophers, and of course, the politicians. The author despises them because they do not take “physical” or “financial” risks. An academic who espouses a wrong theory and as a result suffers through a sub-par career, or a bureaucrat who is perpetually sidelined for making an incorrect critical decision, or an executive who loses the entire career (along with reputation) for a misplaced decision are not losing anything as per the author. For the author, risk means if you have some chance of losing something financially or physically. Before I go on, I must admit that in saner moments at various points in the book, the author would go against his own over-generalised, grandiose statements and make sensible points. He would quote academicians he finds agreeable with love (Hagel, Kant, Nietzsche). He would use theories to make a case for employment contracts. He would talk about repetitional and other types of SITG - but, only where it suits his preformed specific conclusions.This is one of the things that makes the book full of internal contradictions:- “Whatever works cannot be stupid” - this is Talebian definition of rationality. Rationality, according to the author, is not in beliefs or words but in revealed preferences and actions. Rational, it seems, is anything that helps you survive over a period despite the tail risks that exist for existence. This is the logic behind which the author would debunk behavioural finance and advocate heeding to granny’s advise. By this logic, combined with the Lindy, slavery and misogyny need undergo no modification. The author does not attempt to apply this principle too rigidly for sciences, but he occasionally flirts there too in dismissing whatever technological or scientific achievements he disapproves under scientism. The author never realises how his definition of rationality - even if right - would only cause my granny versus your granny type of arguments (best case) without any progress towards universal truths or technological advancement.- If a person’s starting point in life, like most in the real world, is with near zero savings, she cannot have the financial skin that the author likes for so many walks of life. So, perhaps the only option as per the author is for her to put the body at risk?- Forecasting, as per the author is stupid although most activities of entrepreneurs, investors or even army generals involve implicit and explicit forecasting. In a way, the author hates those who “forecast” without much to lose but many professional forecasters have a lot of skin in the game through reputation and financial rewards/not. Many may far likely have problems with the kind the author likes that benefit from few lucky calls initially through disproportionate gains by simply placing right bets with little efforts before they get anything wrong. From this viewpoint, the author’s own business is full of incidents where the money manager has agency issues, and not sufficient SITG the moment she admits external money. - Some of the book’s biased contradictions are hilarious because of the way they come about. One begins to pity the author - supposedly smart - who cannot notice even the most obvious of errors. Take this example: at one point in the book, the author goes from slanted wedges in NY metro to slapping academicians one more time, this time for “always” writing academic papers in a complicated way simply because “they do not have skin in the game”. Within five statements, he goes on to define “non-boring”, like footnotes in corporate reports, from the viewpoint of those with the skin in the game (aka investors). By this definition, who is the author to pass value-judgment on the boringness of academic reports?- The author hates straw men analysis but performs many of his own all the time - imputing senseless ideas to others he hates. The worst one is at the end when the author seems that over 250 years, no theoretician figured out the time value of probabilistic patterns - example, taking one bet where you may lose everything with probability of 1% might keep you alive with 99% certainty at the end of the first bet but eventually you always end up losing all. This is such a hogwash that anyone who breathes knows this from time immemorial- the chances of one breathing the next breath is very high but eventually all die! In academic theories too, joint probability is as old as the probability science. Take another example: he indirectly bashes Mr Pinkel, perhaps his top pet hate, for not recognising that violence is down because the vigilance is up. The author shouts that the violence going down is perhaps the reason to step up the vigilance, rather than what the others seem to claim as per the author. Surprisingly, this is exactly the point Mr. Pinkel makes. Such contradictions are supplemented by contortions to prove that only the way he does things is right: for example, the right level of transparency is what the author employs in his investment methods and not more or less. The right amount of armchair criticising is what he does, like in this book. Same about the skin in the game - where his risk-taking is great but not of many others who take far higher risks that he will not understand. The bashing of academics is plain ridiculous without acknowledgement of the benefits the classroom theories have created from the days of Galileo to the machine learning classes today, but even the roles of large corporate executives, employees everywhere (as against entrepreneurs), consultants, advisors etc are laughably undermined compared to whoever happens to be in the author’s good books.The author does make many good points in between. There is an admirable section on scale-dependent political ideology - why he is a libertarian at the federal level, a republican at the state level, at a municipal level a democrat and a socialist with friends and family. The discussion on dynamic inequality through the concept of ergodicity, was exceptionally good if one removed the vitriol towards others and too perfunctory a dismissal of inequality conclusions without sufficient proof. The author shines when talking about Lindy effect, although this topic was better covered in the previous book on anti-fragility. Those who survive have a stronger chance of surviving longer is a good concept. In the author’s hands, its extreme application is what leads to some completely misplaced conclusions.Given the simple and singular nature of the main theme , the book has many unrelated diversions through contradictions, contortions, critiquing where the author makes more interesting points: apart from the one on politics above, there is a good section on how a minority stringent choice impact could have on overall impact on the broad population choice. Another unrelated topic is the differential spread of different religions due to differences in laws (a non-Muslim marrying a Muslim has to convert while in cases under Judaism or Zoroastrianism, the follower might be ostracised). Overall, the author could have used his fame and popularity better to make more constructive points, even if obvious, rather than waste so much energy bashing some other highly relevant and important analysis."
3,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"From the back cover of the book jacket: The problem with Taleb is not that he's an asshole. He is an asshole. The problem with Taleb is that he is right. This is the third book I've read by Nassim Taleb (The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable and Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder: Here is my review of Antifragile.) And this book, Skin in the Game is more quirky than either of his previous books--if that is at all possible. This book is poorly written. It jumps around from one topic to another, almost stream of consciousness.I am sure that Taleb makes new enemies with each book he writes. If, by the end of the book, you have not been offended by something he has written, then you haven't been paying attention. Taleb is blunt, sometimes obtuse, and often right. But it really irks me that his very strong opinions are not always backed up by reasoning. Like a mathematics professor, he will often ""let the reader fill in the lines of his proof.""The basic premise of the book, is that one should not believe opinions or forecasts of others, unless they have some ""skin in the game."" Results are all that count--opinions and talk are worthless. It is so easy for people to spout utter nonsense, so unless they could potentially suffer consequences of being wrong, you should ignore them. This goes especially for intellectuals in academia. However, ""hard"" science seem to be immune to this problem, because of the redeeming nature of falsification, while ""scientism"" -- the excessive belief in science is worthless.The broad sweep of his aphorisms are overwhelming. Here are some examples that actually are given some logical reasoning:Genes follow majority rule. Languages follow minority rule. Islam is widespread because of its rules of conversion and parentage.""Someone with a high public presence who is controversial and takes risks for his opinion is less likely to be a bullxxxt vendor.""""Employees are slaves.""And then there are aphorisms that may very well be true, but do not seem to have much back-up reasoning:""Courage (risk taking) is the highest virtue. We need entrepreneurs.""""Anything that smacks of competition destroys knowledge.""""Academia has a tendency, when unchecked (from lack of skin in the game), to evolve into a ritualistic self-referential publishing game.""Among the people Taleb dislikes: Steven Pinker, Hillary Clinton, journalists, intellectuals who are idiots, the Saudi regime, Monsanto, ... the list goes on and on. Taleb goes into some detail about how psychologists totally misunderstand ""loss aversion"", due to the concept of ergodicity. Taleb introduces so many quirky words and expressions, that he devotes a glossary in the back of the book to explain the terms. And, the end of the book is filled with a technical appendix with some very technical mathematical proofs about probability theory.With so many issues that I have with this book, why do I recommend it with five stars? Because the book is so thought-provoking. It jabs me everywhere, and gets me to think about a lot of things, basic assumptions about life. Take a risk--read this book."
4,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6603759-misericordia-the-serendipity-aegis,5,"I’m improperly awed and professionally depressed by this guy. While I’ve been in love with the concept of asymmetry since, like, forever, he puts on it such an excruciating spin that… a lot of professions suddenly attain the unmistakable bullshit (or maybe swanshit!) flavor.Anyway, this book lost a bit of its charm due to aggressive and seemingly random things aggregated together. I'm sure it's another case of 'it's not you, it's me', still, I felt the previous volumes were better grounded and more founded in reality. Anyway, the eruditic approach to even the most disjointed things: Assassins, politics, Knights Templar.... etc, you name it, made this an irresistible read.Q:DATA, SHMATAAnother lesson from Piketty’s ambitious volume: it was loaded with charts and tables. There is a lesson here: what we learn from professionals in the real world is that data is not necessarily rigor. One reason I—as a probability professional—left data out of The Black Swan (except for illustrative purposes) is that it seems to me that people flood their stories with numbers and graphs in the absence of solid or logical arguments. Further, people mistake empiricism for a flood of data. Just a little bit of significant data is needed when one is right, particularly when it is disconfirmatory empiricism, or counterexamples: only one data point (a single extreme deviation) is sufficient to show that Black Swans exist.Traders, when they make profits, have short communications; when they lose they drown you in details, theories, and charts.Probability, statistics, and data science are principally logic fed by observations—and absence of observations. For many environments, the relevant data points are those in the extremes; these are rare by definition, and it suffices to focus on those few but big to get an idea of the story. If you want to show that a person has more than, say $10 million, all you need is to show the $50 million in his brokerage account, not, in addition, list every piece of furniture in his house, including the $500 painting in his study and the silver spoons in the pantry. So I’ve discovered, with experience, that when you buy a thick book with tons of graphs and tables used to prove a point, you should be suspicious. It means something didn’t distill right! But for the general public and those untrained in statistics, such tables appear convincing—another way to substitute the true with the complicated. (c)Q:There is a vicious domain-dependence of expertise: the electrician, dentist, scholar of Portuguese irregular verbs, assistant colonoscopist, London cabby, and algebraic geometer are experts (plus or minus some local variations), while the journalist, State Department bureaucrat, clinical psychologist, management theorist, publishing executive, and macroeconomist are not. This allows us to answer the questions: Who is the real expert? Who decides who is and who is not an expert? Where is the meta-expert?Time is the expert. (c)Q:Currently, most civil servants tend to stay in civil service—except for those in delicate areas that industry controls: the agro-alimentary segment, finance, aerospace, anything related to Saudi Arabia …A civil servant can make rules that are friendly to an industry such as banking—and then go off to J.P. Morgan and recoup a multiple of the difference between his or her current salary and the market rate. (Regulators, you may recall, have an incentive to make rules as complex as possible so their expertise can later be hired at a higher price.)So there is an implicit bribe in civil service: you act as a servant to an industry, say, Monsanto, and they take care of you later on. They do not do it out of a sense of honor: simply, it is necessary to keep the system going and encourage the next guy to play by these rules. The IYI-cum-cronyist former Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner—with whom I share the Calabrese barber of the Prologue—was overtly rewarded by the industry he helped bail out. He helped bankers get bailouts, let them pay themselves from the largest bonus pool in history after the crisis, in 2010 (that is, using taxpayer money), and then got a multimillion-dollar job at a financial institution as his reward for good behavior. (c)Q:As I mentioned earlier in Prologue 3, I have held for most of my (sort of) academic career no more than a quarter position. A quarter is enough to have somewhere to go, particularly when it rains in New York, without being emotionally socialized and losing intellectual independence for fear of missing a party or having to eat alone. (c)Q:And recall that, a free person does not need to win arguments—just win. (c)Q:Hard science might be robust to the pathologies—even then. So let us take a look at social science. Given that the sole judges of a contributor are his “peers,” there is a citation ring in place that can lead to all manner of rotting. Macroeconomics, for instance, can be nonsense since it is easier to macrobull***t than microbull***t—nobody can tell if a theory really works.If you say something crazy you will be deemed crazy. But if you create a collection of, say, twenty people who set up an academy and say crazy things accepted by the collective, you now have “peer-reviewing” and can start a department in a university. (c)Q:Knowing “economics” doesn’t mean knowing anything about economics in the sense of the real activity, but rather the theories, most of which are bull***t, produced by economists. (c)Q:The deprostitutionalization of research will eventually be done as follows. Force people who want to do “research” to do it on their own time, that is, to derive their income from other sources. Sacrifice is necessary. It may seem absurd to brainwashed contemporaries, but Antifragile documents the outsized historical contributions of the nonprofessional, or, rather, the non-meretricious. For their research to be genuine, they should first have a real-world day job, or at least spend ten years as: lens maker, patent clerk, Mafia operator, professional gambler, postman, prison guard, medical doctor, limo driver, militia member, social security agent, trial lawyer, farmer, restaurant chef, high-volume waiter, firefighter (my favorite), lighthouse keeper, etc., while they are building their original ideas. It is a filtering, nonsense-expurgating mechanism. I have no sympathy for moaning professional researchers. I for my part spent twenty-three years in a full-time, highly demanding, extremely stressful profession while studying, researching, and writing my first three books at night; it lowered (in fact, eliminated) my tolerance for career-building research. (c)Q:he first group are terrorists for about everyone, that is, for every person equipped with the ability to discern and isn’t a resident of Saudi Arabia and doesn’t work for a think tank funded by sheikhs; the second are militia groups largely called terrorists by their enemies, and “resistance” or “freedom fighters” by those who don’t dislike them.The first includes nonsoldiers who indiscriminately kill civilians for effect and don’t bother with military targets, as their aim isn’t to make military gains, just to make a statement, harm some living humans, produce some noise, and, for some, find a low-error way to go to paradise. Most Sunni jihadis, of the type who take incommensurable pleasure in blowing up civilians, such as Al Qaeda, ISIS, and the “moderate rebels” in Syria sponsored by former U.S. president Obama, are in that category.

My problem is with the ideas in this book, not its author, although I do question the intelligence of its author when his prose lapses into pseudoscientific drivel.Most of the ideas in Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s ‘Skin in the Game’ are characterized by a shameless lack of nuance, are supported only by dishonest misrepresentation and overgeneralization of samples, and will probably make the world much worse if implemented. The only other book I can think of which more strongly exemplifies confirmation bias, and which is more blind towards overwhelming contradictory evidence, is Rhonda Byrne’s ‘The Secret’, and parallels between these two books run deep—deep enough to call this ‘Taleb’s The Secret’. (Even Byrne’s book draws heavily upon ancient mythologies to make one absurd point after another).Taleb all but begs the reader to take note of his SITG chivalry. Yes, good Sir Knight, your chivalry is noted.SITG isn’t just a reward-punishment model; punishment is what a centralized justice system does AFTER screwing up. Rather, it’s a decentralized, reward-or-punishment-through-risk-exposure model where your exposure to the consequences is ensured BEFORE the implementation, so that screwing up automatically punishes on its own. It’s (supposedly) a self-corrective model.Now, there are not two but four combinations of idea-consequence scenarios that can be neatly represented as below.The premise: You present an idea to the world, which is then implemented. In all four scenarios listed below, other people are respectively affected as a result of the implementation, but the ramifications for you are different in each.1) Symmetry: You gain something valuable (to you) if it works, and you lose something valuable if it doesn’t.2) Positive asymmetry: You gain something valuable if it works, but you lose nothing if it doesn’t.3) Negative asymmetry: You gain nothing if it works, but you lose something valuable if it doesn’t.4) Neutral: You gain nothing if it works, and you lose nothing if it doesn’t.(1 and 3 are SITG scenarios; 2 and 4, not)The book is rather disingenuous in its front-cover illustration and subtitle, which make it seem that this book is somehow a crusade against positive asymmetries—the “heads I win, tails you lose” bets. I would have showered this book with so much praise as to exhaust the nation’s supply of accolades if this book REALLY were about replacing only asymmetries with symmetries.But since nuance isn’t Taleb’s forte, he goes all the way to the other extreme and says that EVERY idea-consequence situation must be symmetrical. (Along with numerous instances throughout the book, he ends the book by suggesting “[do] nothing without skin in the game.”) In a nutshell, Taleb argues that SITG eliminates bad ideas by disfiguring both the reputation and the bank accounts of those who concocted the ideas. An investment advisor who is investing your money with his ideas should have a significant personal stake in the same fund. If the idea fails, he almost drowns in bankruptcy and nobody will ever take his investment advice seriously again. Over time, many similar events will eliminate other bad ideas and the people who parented those ideas. As a result, the system overall is better off, and it is precisely SITG that allowed these self-corrections to happen. In a non-SITG environment, such people can persist.Sounds great, and symmetries are indeed well suited to some situations. But the problem is that this solution is not at all generalizable and is very restricted in its applicability. Recall that there are two kinds of non-SITG scenarios, and if applied to the wrong one, Taleb’s model harms the system more than it rehabilitates it.Many decades ago, Stanley Kubrick, the acclaimed filmmaker, pronounced his verdict on human nature in this eloquent quote: “We are capable of the greatest good and the greatest evil, but the problem is that we often can't distinguish between them when it suits our purpose.”Paraphrased to befit the context of this review, the above quote simply says that if a man has his SITG, he will do just about ANYTHING to save his skin. He will lie, cheat, deceive, exaggerate, lobby, wield power, or do a million other wicked things just to save his skin.Here are some ways in which SITG, by incapacitating the ability of the skin-owners to tell the difference between good and evil, can harm the system:1. Taleb maintains that SITG and conflict of interest should not be conflated, but he fails to grasp that if, as he demands, politicians were to have their SITG, it would INEVITABLY lead to conflict of interest as a nasty side-effect. The reason why the powers-that-be, economic advisers to the president, and top-level bureaucrats are required NOT to have any SITG is because it’s a textbook example of conflict of interest—they could use the power of their office to recommend or implement only those policies which save their own skin, while the benefits for others might not be as, or at all, profitable. Carl Icahn, who is currently under federal investigation, briefly served as Adviser to the President and attempted to use the power of his office to save himself $200 million in taxes through a biofuel company that he owned. (He was allowed to have SITG because of bureaucratic loopholes; normally, this is rightly prohibited). If a man has SITG AND the government-given power to save his skin, he will do ANYTHING to save his own skin. [Additional checks, which currently do not exist, must be in place to ensure that even a conflict-of-interest-free public servant doesn’t directly profit from the policies they implemented, AFTER they leave the office]. However, someone who has the official power but who has nothing to gain or lose (as in the case of pure neutrals), either in the present or in the future, is more likely to do good to others rather than serve himself like Icahn did.2. Financial SITG is the reason why tobacco companies, despite their own research showing that smoking tobacco is strongly correlated with lung cancer, suppressed those findings, lied to the public for decades that there is no evidence, let millions die of preventable cancer, got caught lying, and were sued for billions—all in a misguided attempt to save their invested skin. And unsurprisingly, owing to SITG, something very similar is happening with oil companies now. (Read Oreskes and Conway’s ‘Merchants of Doubt’ for more on this). Along with the rest of mankind, these people and their descendants will also be exposed to the downside risk of carbon emission—so there’s both financial AND literal SITG, but that doesn’t stop them from defrauding the public. All these companies lose a lot of money should things not go in their favor, and make a lot of money otherwise, so they are never honest about their data or their true intentions—a typical trait of those with SITG. Taleb himself stood to make a lot more money in 2007 had all the Big Banks been allowed to fail; he had placed bets that they would fail. Only the truly gullible can fail to see why he (fruitlessly) demanded that the Fed let those banks fail.3. NOT having any SITG game lets you think objectively about a situation in a way that having your skin at stake hardly can. The slave-holding states of the American antebellum South wanted to secede from the Union primarily, though not solely (I am not nuance-averse), because of the issue of slavery. The abolitionists of the North had no skin in the cotton production game; only the southern cotton plantation/industry owners did, and cotton was the prime mover of the Southern economy. Slavery was crucial to the cotton business, and the slave-holding states of the South would have taken a huge economic hit if slavery were abolished. Small wonder, then, that the South wanted to keep slavery alive by seceding from the Union, thus initiating the Civil War. There was nothing inherently evil or stupid about the Southerners; they were driven by an inability to tell the difference between good and evil because their own interests were involved. Slavery did not resolve itself at the hands of those with skin in the cotton game. It took the intelligence and objectivity of non-slaveholders—the abolitionists of the North who, if the logic of this book were applied, would be labeled “virtue signalers”—to rid the US of slavery and better the system. It was Lincoln and his cohorts, not slaveholders or Southerners, who ratified the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, the one abolishing slavery.Coming to the second recurring theme in the book, the Lindy effect: Here, Taleb’s loose grasp of reality takes on a life of its own. This idea is mathematically beautiful but ultimately stands on the quick soil. (Taleb generally likes to point out that you cannot question the mathematics of his published papers without having your own sanity questioned, but the problem isn’t with the mathematics; it’s with the assumptions that get you started. Kurt Gödel once “proved” that God exists using mathematical logic; see Gödel's ontological proof. What’s not above criticism, though, are his assumptions—nor anybody else’s!) In essence, it states that the projected lifespan of non-perishable cultural entities is in direct correlation with its current age. If a book has survived for 100 years in print, it will likely survive another 100.If you are familiar with ‘the Wisdom of the Crowds,’ it only takes a small leap of imagination to arrive at the Lindy effect: Lindy is nothing but the Wisdom of the Crowds applied across time. At its foundation, both ideas require people—lots of common, hardworking people—who make collective decisions about accepting or rejecting an idea through small decisions that accrue. In the Wisdom, the decisions accrue across space; in Lindy, across time. But in both, it is the hoi polloi—and not the academics, the bureaucrats, or some other group of chosen experts—who truly put the ideas to the test.Studying the Wisdom sheds light on the nature of Lindy, and to that end I’ll quote an insightful excerpt from an essay by Warren Buffett that decries the Efficient Market Hypothesis, an absurd, absolutistic theory built on the Wisdom of the Crowds: “EMH was embraced not only by academics, but by many investment professionals and corporate managers as well. Observing correctly that the market was FREQUENTLY efficient, they went on to conclude incorrectly that it was ALWAYS efficient. The difference between these propositions is night and day.”Lindy is indeed good at eliminating some bad cultural objects from the past. But since Taleb is fond of saying “Lindy and Lindy alone is the real expert,” I think Lindy’s consistency is worth examining. Is Lindy only FREQUENTLY or ALWAYS effective? The difference matters. A lot.My first brush with the core assumption underlying this idea—though not the idea itself—was in Taleb’s ‘Fooled by Randomness,’ which I read back when I was an admirer of his. In that book, he is careful to distinguish between survival through chance and survival through competence. A stockbroker can have a long career making successful bets, despite being clueless about stocks. The laws of stochastic probability make room for such anomalies. However, a dentist or a doctor can have a long career if and only if they are competent, and no law of probability will rescue them otherwise. It’s not really malpractice lawsuits or losing medical license that removes them from the profession, although that contributes, too; rather, it’s public verdict that nails their metaphorical coffin: You cannot fool people for long stretches of time in a profession where luck plays no role.Or so I thought...I learned this many unfortunate years later: The case he makes for non-stochastic professions turns out not to be true at all and illuminates a rot in the assumptions that Lindy stands on. Not only CAN incompetent doctors have decades-long career, but there actually IS a precedent for it.The noise caused by the placebo effect can sometimes deafen people to the fraudulence of most alternative medicines which generally treat non-life-threatening conditions. But there is one particular case of a “doctor” in South Asia whose “cure” for the most intractable of human miseries—cancer—essentially makes it impossible to fail to tell the difference between success and failure of the medicine for long periods. If any alternative medicine fraud claims to have a cure for cancer, the claim can be put to the test as easily by the public as by scientists. People should, given a decade or more of hearsay, arrive at a verdict about the efficacy of the treatment—if Taleb is to be believed.This “doctor” goes by the name of Vaidya Narayana Murthy who, along with his ancestors for centuries, has been “curing” all forms of cancer and other incurable ailments by making people ingest pieces of tree barks grown in his native village. He boasts of a success rate of 60%, clearly fabricated, since he would be awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine if he could cure ANY cancer, let alone ALL forms of cancer, with that level of success. Every week, an exodus of benighted, gullible, illiterate, and even semi-literate people from all across the country arrive at his doorstep and stand in miles-long queue for hours to get a 10-second appointment with him. If Lindy were to be an “expert,” such oddities would necessarily have to be eliminated over time as people realize this man’s fraud and stop seeking his appointments, regardless of how much he charges for the appointments—but quite the opposite is happening, as his patient numbers rise every year. Even his online ratings are consistently high. Nothing about their behavior even remotely suggests that you can’t fool them for long, even at something so basic as the efficacy of a cure for cancer.Vox populi? Vox humbug!Many more such examples abound. When Lindy cannot even eliminate fraud in simple systems like detecting the success of a miraculous cure for cancer, to expect it to arrive at reliable heuristics in complex systems in the form of time-tested aphorisms is naïve wishful thinking. Aphorisms survive because of their rhetorical effect, not necessarily because they are agents of truth. Only by woefully cherry-picking them can you present them in a positive light. Superstitions survive for thousands of years, and horrible myths that are demonstrably untrue are inherited through generations of descendants, completely unfiltered by Lindy. (Conversely, many great books of science and math from the antiquity, including five books by Euclid, have been irretrievably lost, unprotected by Lindy.) In India, a practice called “sati”—in which a widowed wife would be cremated alive with her husband’s corpse—prevailed for more than 1500 years before it was forcefully abolished in 1821 through government intervention. Lindy tolerated it for 1500 years; bureaucrats and reformers ended it in just 15. If you wish to make hard life choices based on one-liners handed down from the social “wisdom” of the ancients, the Romans, or any other people who owned human slaves and committed atrocities for recreation, be my guest.Page after page of this book is filled with vignettes from classical literature, to give it the feel of Lindyness. It never ceases to amuse me how Taleb combs through historical mythologies to find stories that vaguely metaphorically resemble an agenda he has already made up his mind about. (Even the typeface of this book is given a historical context for, geez!) Taleb likes to chastise psychologists, but psychologists have also committed the same error that Taleb is committing in abundance here: Drawing a little too much inspiration from ancient vignettes. Freud was inspired by the vignette of Oedipus when he came up with his ridiculous hypothesis of Oedipus complex. Jung produced an equally ridiculous variant called the Electra complex after the Greek mythological character. Another perverse complex, also inspired by classical Greek stories, goes by Jocasta complex.Romanticizing the genius of the “elders” can produce idiotic filth, not always profundity. Even evolution by natural selection, which Taleb claims is a sophisticated form of SITG, is only a crude method of problem-solving that doesn’t eliminate all errors, no matter how much time passes. Cancer genes can survive in a species for millions of years.However, none of this is to say that Lindy is totally useless. In the philosophy of science, consilience is a method of converging on the truth through multiple, independent sources of evidence that are themselves imperfect and prone to errors. We know that the theory of evolution is true not just because fossils hint at it, but because seven independent sources of evidence converge at the same conclusion. A theory which is supported only by one form of evidence is a lot weaker than a theory that is vindicated by multiple sources that do not depend on each other. In the event of a disagreement between sources—which is bound to happen given that each source is imperfect—all it means is that further investigation is needed, not that one source is necessarily better than the other, or that the other source must be discarded altogether. In consilience, Lindy can act as ONE of these independent sources, rather than replacing other sources. But by clownishly interjecting that “Lindy alone is the real expert,” Taleb only makes the cavernous depths of his ignorance official.—There are no more characters left to write more here!Alx fr totally lynched it.If intellectuals can be idiots, Taleb is its most shining example. He is better suited for trolling on Twitter and peddling conspiracy theories about GMOs than for sermonizing on how societies should function. "
6,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49042540-magnus-ahmad,1,"Pop-science in it's lowest form. Book reads like a poorly researched, hastily written college essay. Strings together a few nuggets of common sense wisdom with sizeable amounts of unreferenced BS. Taleb is a shark, living off a reputation and using his own fanbase like an ATM."
7,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,5,"Update September 4, 2020. I changed my mind. I decided to rate this book after all. Any book that has passages that are better on the third reading deserves five stars. On my third reading, there were parts of the book I skipped, but most of the book was still remarkable, and I would argue even better on the third reading. Ergo, 5 stars are necessary. And anything less would be dishonest. I will leave the original review as it was written around this time last year, but keep in mind that all my remarks about the book being unrateable have now been overturned. 1. I can't rate this book. This seems an absurd thing to say, but it's hard to rate a book that often comes off as a pre-pubescent twitter rant. I think the problem is that Taleb's classical (and anti-modern) sense of honor screeches against my modern ears. Also, his classical sense of honor often devolves into the aesthetics of blue-collar water cooler bullshit sessions (I've been around too many of these), twitter rants, and toxic masculinity.1a. At one point Taleb addresses a letter from someone who said something similar to which he replied ""f*** you."" I find myself above replying with a corresponding f*** y**, but I suppose since the book in encouraging me to say, f*** y** back to Taleb, I should say f*** y**? Since the book is about ethics (and his past books have been about power), what should someone who is capable of saying f*** y** do in a situation like this? Does not saying f*** y**, mean you have less soul in the game, does it make you a dog among wolves, or are you just the better man? My own philosophy is that having the ability to say f*** y** via f*** y** money and physical preparation is prudent, but not saying f*** y** anyway through a mixture of modern (your school teachers taught you not to do it) and premodern (your mom would spank your behind) ethical training (probably by women, who lets face it, are better than men) is fine too, if not divine. Forghetabout it? It's really hard to once the words are out there. 1b. I still believe twitter was a technology that was supposed to be for teens and that in brings out the worst in people. 2. The actual philosophy of this book is wonderful and deserves at least two readings. I own the paperback in question, so I can just cross out flagrant vulgarity with a black pen. There isn't that much of it (just enough to make the book unrateable). 3. If you've read Antifragile and Black Swan, much of what is written in this book (but not all) will seem redundant. I think once you've figured out the core of Taleb's philosophy you can start applying it to your own problems with ease. It does help, however, to go back and see how he applies it. I consider Fooled by Randomness to be less essential than Antifragile and Black Swan, but an interesting case study to understand how philosophies evolve. Since apparently, I'm not a real man unless I deadlift, and deadlifting is more important than book lifting at a library, and since I haven't deadlifted since high school football, I guess I should get back to deadlifting. Sadly, 350 pounds was my max in high school and all I've been doing since then is trying to improve myself with book learning. That, or I can embrace a very hidden asymmetrical truth about modernity. Modernity has unlocked the once hidden power of women -- women thinkers, women writers (some who deadlift, many who don't) -- thus, roughly doubling the amount of ingenuity and talent (at least in places that are modern). An interesting question, one I think deserves some thought: How do intelligent, working women -- and to be fair entrepreneurs -- read Taleb? I think I'll explore the Goodreads comment sections and find out."
8,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8484948-ivank,2,"In this book #4, Taleb is more arrogant and pretentious than ever. You can never let go of the feeling that this book is about him, rather than any other topic. He's become profoundly obnoxious and negative. Despite some good points in the book, reading it feels like carrying a burden. In this new book Taleb goes to extra lengths to attack David Runciman, head of the politics department at Cambridge, and a Guardian book reviewer who had torn apart his previous ""Antifragile"" book. Runciman's criticisms for book #3 are totally valid here in book #4 as well: that Taleb is profoundly antisocial, self-contradicting, and disorganized; that ""Black Swan"" and ""Fooled by randomness"" will remain classics, while ""Antifragile"" - and I'm sure ""Skin in the game"" as well - will be forgotten quickly because of their mediocrity."
9,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20495789-muwaffaq,2,"I wanted to like this and I certainly did at the beginning. All of his insults are complex, original and amusing but he insults so many people so frequently that the process itself becomes tedious. I do enjoy his historical anecdotes, but again there are a large volume of them, and not always obviously with a point, other than a demonstration of his research or recall abilities. It is the fact that he criticises many individuals in passing with a specific but cryptic reference to something they have said or written, but then offers no detail or explanation as to what they said or wrote or why they were wrong that annoys me the most. In the end, whilst interesting and amusing there was little of use to take from this book - and that is ignoring how pompous and arrogant he sounds all the time as well."
10,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1725471-gordon,3,"Taleb has a few basic rules of writing, to wit:* Never be boring* Be sure to insult those you disagree with* Remind the reader frequently of how smart you are, as evidenced by a multitude of quotations, in Latin wherever possible* Mix the brilliant with the banal, the insightful with the sophomoric, the wise with the petty* Keep the chapters short* Roam widely across history to draw examples from, especially the classical world of the Eastern Mediterranean* Remind the reader that although you are, like, really smart, you are also salt of the earth, in fact much more salt of the earth than your worthless critics with their fancy degrees and their secure tenured perches who probably never ever go to New York gyms reeking of stale sweat and never ever do dead-lifts* Never mention ""moral hazard"", even though that's what the book is mainly about, because moral hazard sounds dull and well-worn whereas ""skin in the game"" sounds like a man's man kind of thingIn short, the author is erudite and entertaining even if his style is often cringe-worthy and irritating, possessing a personality that shines through on every page. That personality reminds the reader of a much, much smarter version of a certain orange-faced head of state given to frequent outbursts on Twitter. I don't think Taleb is the tweeting sort but if he were his tweets would be...Trumpian, but coherently so, with many more polysyllabic words, and probably without the Random Capitalization so characteristic of our Dear Leader. But I digress.The main idea of this book is that you shouldn't trust the opinions of people without skin in the game, who won't suffer painful consequences, financial or otherwise, if their opinions are wrong. An extension of this idea is that you shouldn't trust people who don't have first-hand, in-the-trenches experience in whatever their chosen profession may be, from cutting hair to running companies to leading armies. However, Taleb leaves little doubt that the best profession of all is being a Wall St. trader, which he was for 20-odd years. The author's curiously narrow working experience, of little value to society or to the economy, consists of skimming some profit off the river of money coursing through the financial exchanges, while avoiding taking major losses from the markets' periodic wild gyrations. At this, Taleb excelled, by his own account, which I have no reason to doubt. But he wasn't even an investor, let alone an entrepreneur, much as he glorifies the entrepreneur. He was a risk-taker, but of the short-term speculator variety. It's by no means a dishonorable profession, and certainly a challenging if lucrative one. But it does tend to shape a certain worldview, especially towards risk. And what Taleb is all about is managing risk, and understanding it quantitatively.A key concept in his idea of risk is his notion of ""ergodicity"", a branch of probability theory I have not studied. As Taleb uses the term, a system is ergodic if the probability of some outcome as a result of 100 independent iterations is the same as the probability of that outcome from one individual running 100 iterations. If 100 people jump off a cliff into the sea and #42 dies, while all the others survive, the chances of death are 1%. If one individual has to jump off that same cliff 100 times, the chances of death for that person approach 100%, not 1%. Hard to argue that you shouldn't run the same 1% risk 100 times and expect to survive if the 1% entails what Taleb calls ""ruin"". In the financial world, if you make enough speculative bets where one of the very low probability outcomes is financial disaster, you will eventually encounter financial disaster. Lone rogue traders have been known to take down entire banks.So why is this idea interesting? As an individual, it tells you not to take repeated life-threatening and solvency-threatening risks if you can instead take smaller risks with expected positive outcomes -- and zero risk of ruin. Applying the idea to problems at the social level, such as GMOs and climate change, Taleb argues that these are the kind of risk scenarios where ruin is a real possibility, where the number of iterations of this risky bet is very high, and where we therefore should not take these risks in the first place. I didn't need any convincing of this with respect to climate change, but Taleb has definitely given me reason to re-assess what I think of GMOs. I am still not sure what to make of the high risk of our planet outrunning its food supply as population grows inexorably towards its peak somewhere between 10-12 billion VS. the risk of GMOs having unforeseen nasty consequences for both human and other forms of life. Taleb says the latter risk is too high because it could be terminal; he says nothing about the risk of the former.A curious feature of the book is that Taleb, who worshipped behavioral economics in his previous book Fooled by Randomness, turns against it in this volume. He does not explicitly attack the fathers of the field, Tversky and Kahneman (who won the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work), but does go on the rampage against some of the other thinkers in the field, such as Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler. The gist of Taleb's argument is that individuals' irrational behaviors due to cognitive biases don't amount to sub-optimal system behavior because systems are not simply the sum of the individual components. He illustrates this with the example of the invisible hand of the market, where purely self-interested individual behaviors nonetheless result in a market that efficiently self-regulates through price signals. I think this is major confusion on his part. Take retirement savings, a problem he mentions. American workers notoriously save too little and put too much of their savings in low interest money market accounts, due in part to certain cognitive biases such as weighting the pleasures of the present (spending the money NOW) disproportionately heavily relative to the the future (having much more money to spend in retirement). Meanwhile, the market does a very efficient job of pricing in myriad factors to determine the constantly-adjusted price of a typical ETF such as Vanguard's VT fund. Does this mean that the retirement savings behavior of individual American workers is going to add up to a rational, optimal retirement savings system somehow, just because the price of the fund these workers might invest in is efficiently determined? Meanwhile, the behavioral economists of whom Taleb is so contemptuous have some very pragmatic ideas about how to nudge the behavior of workers today -- such as making voluntary enrollment in company 401K retirement plans the default rather than something the employee has to proactively select -- so that they will in fact make more rational retirement savings decisions that will serve them well in the future.While there is much that I think Taleb is wrong about -- behavioral economics, the importance of economic inequality, the level of social mobility across classes, the role of government beyond the small scale, the role of a free press, the appropriate number of Latin quotations to put in books about risk and uncertainty ... -- there is much he is right about. And he's right about one central thing: beware of advice from people with no skin in the game, who will suffer no great discomfort if the advice they give you proves disastrous."

12,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32919449-leif-denti,2,"Taleb has lost it. Regrettably. This book is a good example of someone doing a ""Lord Kelvin"", that is, making strong claims about things that are not within your field of expertise. Taleb is a statistician, but of course that doesn't hinder him from having very strong opinions on other matters such as other researchers' fields, politics, banking, journalism, to mention just a few. That's a shame because I loved his first two books. However since Antifragility, quality has been on a downward slope. In this book, Taleb doesn't even bother to back up his claims. Take this claim: old people is right 90 percent of the time but a psychologist is right only 10 percent of the time. Thats interesting for sure but where is the data? Why should I believe this? Last time old people did something they broke the UK by kicking it out of the EU via Brexit. He also claims that - because of the Lindy effect - the only theory that is worthwhile is theory that has ""survived"" the test of time. Like what the ancients wrote about: honor, love, cognitive dissonance. Of course he conveniently leaves out all the counter examples. Oppression, tyranny and dictatorship has survived the test of time. Are those things better ways of organizing a society than democracy? Machiavelli is a classic, and Aristotle maintained that society should be ruled by a thinking class (of philosophers of course, who did you think?). Is that good theory? It's sloppy thinking and I'm disappointed.In fact, Taleb writes off whole professions with the stroke of his pen. The all-knowing, omnipotent thinker that he seem to think he is. Instead of actual corroboration of the many many, many claims, we get to read some ancient story about the Assyrians, or a very technical statistical term that seem to obscure Talebs claims instead of illuminating them. It's funny actually with the terminology in this book. I read a lot of science books and I rarely come across a book that uses so many obscure terms and concepts. For a guy who dislikes scientists (and scientism), he sure likes to sound like one.In summary, the book is severely incoherent - ancient stories are mixed with Talebs observations about modern life, his dismissal of his thought up enemies, and disjointed anectodes from his life. Somehow I get the feeling that the book is actually about Taleb himself. "
13,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20923295-anton,4,"3.5* - rounding up to 4.Be warned: this book is a ranty, largely unstructured, flow-of-consciousness type stuff. It has an equal probability or either delighting the reader or driving them mad. I personally enjoy the erudite style of Taleb's argumentation and find his references and vignettes of the 'times gone by' intellectually stimulating. Also, the black-and-white bluntness of his position makes the book feel refreshing. You may not agree with Taleb's side, but you are never left in doubt which side that is.If you read his other books, Skin in the Game is a largely continuation of Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder rather than The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable. If you have never read Taleb before I urge you to start with the Black Swan. This new book is an awful place to get to know the author. You need to warm up to him first...

NNT is a bit of a diva, and it is obvious that he has some beef with a lot of people. He certainly sounds right. But is he? I don't know. The book revolves around the notion that people not having skin in the game will fuck us up, somehow. Turns out that the idea of skin in the game can be applied to a wide variety of fields and professions. Especially the ones Taleb doesn't like, like academics, policy makers, journalists. Oh, and rationality as you know it sucks because it is made by academics, and other interesting insights. NNT is like your funky weekend drug dealer, comes with something interesting that he stole from the big guns, then goes away mumbling hateful speech about the government. I love the guy, now sue me."

18,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4,I like Taleb's books while hating his politics. I like that he says what he thinks is true and doesn't care who he pisses off. He is also right about a lot of things. He is on target with his jibes at chattering classes who no skin in the game and blythly go on about issues that they will lose nothing on if they are wrong. no accountability. when he goes off on politics defending Trump he goes off rails. Just because his enemies who he calls intellectual yet idiots despise Trump it doesn't bestow virtue on Trump. the enemy of my enemy is not a great guy all the time.

With that said, I think this is a well-written book, as expected, but I don’t believe I learned much from it that I didn’t already know from his previous writings. The point that skin in the game is necessary for accurate examination of changes in the economy and policies is informative and one that economists often overlook, though I think Taleb exaggerates the rate economists overlook this point, at least from mainline economists. If you haven’t read his previous books, then you’ll probably find this book of great value. I give this one 3 stars."

21,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,4,"As with most of Taleb's books, this one is poorly organized, full of childish insults and bravado, and makes some totally absurd claims. But this book also contains some startling, deep insights and ideas. It's frustrating to have to wade through a lot of bullshit to get to these interesting ideas, but when you finally get there, the pay off is pretty damn good. Here are some of the biggest insights I got from this book: 1. The central thesis is that ""skin in the game"" is essential for systems to work efficiently and fairly. Any actor who makes a decision must bear the risk of that decision. Otherwise, you end up with an asymmetry where one actor may get all the upside, and everyone else is stuck with all the potential downside. Examples: - No skin in the game: politician who argues for war, but has no risk of actually dying in that war.- Skin in the game: activist, dissident, revolutionary.- No skin in the game: banker who makes bad investments and is bailed out with tax dollars.- Skin in the game: hedge fund traders. ""Don't tell me what you think; tell me what's in your portfolio.""- No skin in the game: bankers or financial advisors who tell others how to invest (e.g., on TV), but don't invest that way themselves.- Skin in the game: hedge fund traders.- No skin in the game: consultants who dish out lots of advice, and then leave, so that only the customer feels the consequences of following that advice. - Skin in the game: entrepreneurs, investors.Creating a world where everyone has skin in whatever game they are playing may be more effective than adding more laws. 2. Systems work completely differently at different scales and you can't generalize from one scale to anotherYou can't always understand larger systems from smaller parts. Examples:- You can't understand the emergent behavior of an ant colony from the behavior of one ant.- You can't understand the behavior of the mind from the behavior of one neuron. - You can't understand the behavior of an entire country from the behavior of one person.- ""A country is not a large city, a city is not a large family, and, sorry, the world is not a large village.""- A utopian socialist society, where everyone chips in for the good of the tribe, may be possible, but only below a certain scale; beyond that scale, groups of people behave completely differently, and you start to run into issues (e.g., tragedy of the commons) that cause socialism to fail. Due to the curse of dimensionality, small increases in size can lead to massive increases in complexity. For example, we still don't fully understand how the 300 neurons of the tape worm's central nervous system work—it's just too complicated. But going up to 301 neurons may double that complexity; going to 302 neurons may double it again; and so on. The human brain, for comparison, has 100 billion neurons. While our TV-brand of politics pretends like it's all about ""left"" vs ""right"", Taleb has this amazing quote from the brothers Geoff and Vince Graham: ""I am, at the Fed level, libertarian;at the state level, Republican;at the local level, Democrat;and at the family and friends level, a socialist.""3. The Lindy effect: for some things, mortality rate decreases with time.Broadway actors used to gather at Lindy's delicatessen after each performance, and they noticed a pattern where plays that had been running for 20 days were likely to survive another 20 days; plays that had ran for 100 days were likely to survive another 100 days; those that ran for 200 days would run another 200; and so on. The same effect can be seen in many other places: e.g., a book that has been in print for 500 years is likely to be in print another 500 years. In other words, the life expectancy of some things is proportional to their current age. The longer that thing has survived, the longer it's likely to keep surviving, so the mortality rate decreases with time.As a general rule, this is why you should prefer things that have survived longer to those that are newer: e.g., a book that has been in print for hundreds of years is likely to be better than a book that came out last week. That old book has survived so long for a reason! The same goes for ideas, art, and traditions that have been passed down from generation to generation. ""90% of what your grandma says is true."" 4. Rule of the minorityIn many situations, a tiny minority (e.g., 1-3% of the population) can impose its will on a far larger majority. Examples: - A large percentage of food in the US is kosher, even though only a tiny percentage of the population follows kosher practices- Schools and planes ban peanuts even though only a tiny percentage of the population is allergic to themThis arises due to an asymmetry where the minority group can only tolerate one option but the majority group can tolerate either, and so we often accede to the demands of the minority group: e.g., people who are allergic to peanuts can't attend an event at all if there are peanuts there, whereas everyone else can attend events either with or without peanuts, so even though the allergic group is ~1% of the population, we still typically go with their preferences.This is why ""Merry Christmas"" became ""Happy Holidays"", even in a country where the vast majority of people celebrate Christmas. This is also why all it takes is a single angry old lady complaining regularly to change the laws in a small town. More generally, many great changes in society happen not via consensus or voting, but because some small passionate minority (typically with skin in the game) pushes for it. This is also why, even in a society that preaches tolerance, you cannot be tolerant of intolerance. That is, even if you firmly believe in tolerance of all viewpoints and free speech, you cannot be tolerant of, for example, Nazi movements. Even a small minority of intolerant people can overrun a tolerant society. 5. ErgodicityTo understand ergodicity, you must first understand the difference between time averaging and ensemble averaging. Time averaging is taking the average value of one process running over a long period of time; ensemble averaging is taking the average of many copies of the process (representing all the different states of that process) running for a fixed amount of time. Example: if the process is rolling two 6-side dice, then time averaging is where a single person rolls the dice thousands of times, and you take the average value of all of those rolls, and ensemble averaging is where you look at all the possible states from one roll (1-1, 1-2, 1-3, ... 6-1, 6-2, 6-3...) and take the average of those. A system is ergodic if the time average equals the ensemble average. The example with the two dice is ergodic, because the average value of all the possible states will equal the average value of one person rolling the dice over and over on a long enough timeline. However, not all systems are ergodic! Example from this blog post: - Play a game where you flip a coin, and if you get heads, you win 50% of your bet, and if you get tails, you lose 40% of your bet. - Ensemble average: If you were to compute the expected value of all possible states of the system (e.g., heads-heads-tails, tails-heads-heads-tails, etc), you'd expect to make roughly +5%. - Time average: If you actually play this game as one person, on a long enough time line, you end up losing all of your money! - Example playthrough: you bet $100, get heads, and end up with $150; you bet the $150, get heads again, and end up with $225; on the next flip, you get tails, and end up at $135; the next flip ends up tails too, and now you're at $81. You got heads twice and tails twice, but have less money than you started with! - The ensemble average does not equal the time average, so this system is not ergodic. This can lead to counter-intuitive results: ""When many people play the game a fixed number of times, the average return is positive, but when a fixed number of people play the game many times, they should expect to lose most of their money.""Taleb looks at ergodicity in society. If a society has perfect ergodicity, then, over a long enough timeline, everyone would spend some amount of time in each of the lower, middle, and upper classes (i.e., roughly 1% of your life would be spent in the top 1%, 50% of your life in the top 50%, etc); if a society has no ergodicity, then whatever class you start in, is where you stay—there's no social mobility.In order for social mobility to be possible, it's not enough for the lower classes to be able to move up. It also needs to be possible for the upper classes to move down. How? By ensuring they have skin in the game! The upper class must be exposed to risk and downside; for if there's no downside for them, that means there's no upside for the everyone else.""Consider that about 10 percent of Americans will spend at least a year in the top 1 percent, and more than half of all Americans will spent a year in the top 10 percent. This is visibly not the same for the more static—but nominally more equal—Europe. For instance, only 10 percent of the wealthiest five hundred American people or dynasties were so thirty years ago; more than 60 percent on the French list are heirs and a third of the richest Europeans were the richest centuries ago. In Florence, it was just revealed that things are even worse: the same handful of families have kept the wealth for five centuries.""6. Risk and ruinIn systems that contain a risk of total ruin—e.g., a risk of losing all your money, or even more severely, a risk of losing your life—standard cost/benefit analysis doesn't work. This is especially true on repeated playthroughs and in systems that are not ergodic. In such system, risks from seemingly independent events add up! For example, you can't use normal ""expected value"" calculations on Russian roulette. The ensemble average across all possible states of multiple playthroughs of Russian roulette is positive; but the time average for a single person playing the game repeatedly is almost always death. We often don't properly take into account these ideas of ruin, ergodicity, and risks adding up over repeated events. Taleb has some great examples of this:""All risks are not equal. We often hear that “Ebola is causing fewer deaths than people drowning in their bathtubs,” or something of the sort, based on “evidence.” This is another class of problems that your grandmother can get, but the semi-educated cannot. [...] The probability that the number of people who drown in their bathtubs in the United States doubles next year—assuming no changes in population or bathtubs—is one per several trillions lifetimes of the universe. This cannot be said about the doubling of the number of people killed by terrorism over the same period.[...]So we often see the headline that many more American citizens slept with Kim Kardashian than died of Ebola. Or that more people were killed by their own furniture than by terrorism. Your grandmother’s logic would debunk these claims. Just consider that: it is impossible for a billion people to sleep with Kim Kardashian (even her), but that there is a non-zero probability that a multiplicative process (a pandemic) causes such a number of Ebola deaths. Or even if such events were not multiplicative, say, terrorism, there is a probability of actions such as polluting the water supply that can cause extreme deviations. The other argument is one of feedback: if terrorism casualties are low, it is because of vigilance (we tend to search passengers before boarding planes), and the argument that such vigilance is superfluous indicates a severe flaw in reasoning. Your bathtub is not trying to kill you.""7. Random insightsThe book meanders quite a bit, so I had a few fun insights in my notes that seem largely disconnected from everything else:- Does a merchant have the moral obligation to to divulge all relevant information to a buyer? Example: the merchant is bringing grain from Egypt to a city experiencing famine. The merchant knows he can get a high price for his grain now, but he also knows more boats with grain are on the way, so the price will drop. Does he have the moral obligation to tell the buyer that those other boats are on the way?- All other factors being equal, if you're picking, say, a doctor, you should typically prefer the doctor who does not look the part—i.e., does not look like your stereotype of a doctor (e.g., older man with gray hair, refined appearance, silver-rimmed glasses, delicate hands). That's because the doctor who doesn't fit the stereotype, to build a successful career, had to get there through ability and accomplishment, without being able to lean on looks. The same is true of restaurants (the hole-in-the-wall on a side street can only survive by having amazing food, rather than due to location/appearance), leaders (have you noticed that all CEOs always look the same, but entrepreneurs always look different?), and books (don't judge a book by its cover).- History is often told by focusing on major, dramatic events, such as wars; the absence of such events is typically ignored by historians, which leads to an incomplete picture of what life was like. ""Reading a history book, without putting its events in perspective, offers a similar bias to reading an account of life in New York seen from an emergency room at Bellevue Hospital.""8. Random bullshitThis book also contained a lot of childish, absurd, bullshit. Some of it was clearly Taleb having a personal feud with a critic or rival. Some of it was him making claims about things where he is not an expert or where he has no skin in the game: e.g., his praise of Putin and Trump, his comparisons of different religions and atheism. It takes an order of magnitude more energy to refute bullshit than to spout it, so I won't waste time arguing against Taleb's more absurd claims, and merely note down here that I don't agree with many of them."
22,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15903026-tim-o-hearn,5,"I read this book a few months ago and enjoyed it. Taleb is kind of dickish but he often succeeds in making me question whether I'm smart enough to grasp what he's saying. This brings a special level of excitement to reading any of his works. To me, they present a challenge. A crossword puzzle of intellect with some pseudo elements.The underlying concept in this book is evident from the title. It's an extrapolation of the principle-agent problem. Most of my notes from my original reading have been lost, unfortunately, but I managed to dig up one passage that jives:""One problem with Taleb's writing is that when he goes out of his range, you can apply the same systematic ripping-you-a-new-one rebuttal that he applies to his own pieces.He makes the argument that high class restaurants are primarily a way to separate yuppies like me from their money. This is tied to the fact that, as you ascend the ladder of society, life becomes more complicated, social posturing becomes more important, and thus more people are able to more easily extract money from you. The example he provides is that a lot of people order steak when they'd actually prefer a burger because burgers contain more fat. My experience of living in a big city validates part of this argument--that some yuppies spend money wrecklessly. I go through manic spending periods of my own. However, my opinion on the steak vs burger thing is that you go to a steakhouse for an environment and classification of food that you couldn't get at a burger joint. I love going to steakhouses and ordering burgers. I love going to steakhouses and ordering steaks. But a top-class steak at a top-class steakhouse kicks the shit out of a $20 burger at a top-class steakhouse. So the truth here is that his statement is not true.I don't know. It's plausible that yuppies genuinely enjoy socializing at restaurants that may cost a lot. The burger/steak comparison irks me because if you're eating out period you're spending frivolously. I usually spend $17 at McDonald's to eat my fill."""
23,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1388407-lucas-carlson,5,"Love this book. Much smaller in number of words than his others, but equally dense if not more so with ideas. It’s a great compliment to the rest of his books and ties his ideas together well. I’ve heard a lot of otherwise smart people criticize Taleb as trying to sound smart without saying anything new or special, but I can’t disagree more. If I had to distill everything Taleb into one idea, I would focus on the last few sentences of this latest book, which I will summarize in my own memory of his words:There’s a huge difference between volatility and risk of ruin... people overestimate volatility (which is common) and vastly underestimate the risk of ruin (since it’s rare). One cigarette won’t kill you but many cigarettes over time will very likely kill you.Unless you have skin in the game, you usually ignore risk of ruin, and since it’s rare you are often not called out on it. Empty talk is cheap and this world has a lot of empty talk. And empty talk (without skin in the game) is leaving you exposed to the hidden risk of ruin.To ignore this message, or write it off as “obvious” or “goes without saying” or “trying to sound smart” is just another way of hiding or denying risk of ruin. More cheap talk in a world already overflowing with cheap talk."

This ended up being one of my favorite books of 2018, completed on December 31st.I will read this one again next year, for, as Taleb points out:""... learning is rooted in repetition and convexity, meaning that the reading of a single text twice is more profitable than reading two different things once, provided of course that said text has some depth of content."" ""Extending such logic, we can show that much of what we call 'belief' is some kind of background furniture for the human mind, more metaphorical than real. It may work as therapy.""

27,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7393252-stephan,1,"“The mark of a charlatan is to defend his position or attack a critic by focusing on some specific statement (“ look at what he said”) rather than blasting his exact position (“ look at what he means” or, more broadly, “look at what he stands for”)— for the latter requires an extensive grasp of the proposed idea.”This quote from Mr. Taleb perfectly summarizes my problems with his book.The general theme of the book is that one should be wary of those making decisions who lack consequences of those decisions. The book shines when he focuses on that major theme. His perspectives on every from foreign affairs and the economy were both fascinating and and fair.It is when he dives into his personal disagreements from recent years that he begins to bluster. He disagrees with author Steven Pinker, doesn't trust modern medicine, and doesn't want to eat GMOs, Fine. But he can't seem to go very long without going back to those three things over and over again. And he refuses to take his own advice on those topics. Rather than bothering to look at what those he disagrees with stands for, he just insults them and insinuates delusional smear campaigns against himself.And while this may be a cherry picked quote from the book, as it is blatantly dangerous, I feel it needs to be said. Mr. Taleb tells his readers not to listen to their doctors when they are advised to take statins. This advice could literally kill people, and is the reason I felt the need to lower it to only 1 star.In the end he sounds like an old man yelling at clouds. He is living a lonely life and wants to spend entire chapters explaining why he is better than everyone that has a different lifestyle. Like any old man he has some good advice mixed in with the incoherent rambling."
28,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21062245-daniel-ca-ueto,3,"Taleb should know by now that, according to Lindy effect, he should respect the canonical writing style and analysis schemes he tries to avoid.Less new ideas and more off-topic resentful digression. His message keeps being interesting. However, Jordan B. Peterson has been able to distil it in a more productive way for humanity (and not only for contrarian elitists)."
29,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4534250-dino,5,"Few authors through their writing have the ability to make one really think; Taleb is one of the few who can and does. There are many ways to be critical about this book, and the criticisms would not be groundless. For one, Taleb expresses contempt for many present-day scholars such as Steven Pinker, Richard Thaler, and Thomas Picketty. One of the nicer expressions he coins for this group is IYI (Intellectual Yet Idiot). As is usually the case, an attack on another tends to reflect more on oneself than on the person so slandered. In this way, Taleb appears arrogant, bitter and uncharitable (ironically, the ‘Principle of Charity’ toward one’s intellectual opponents occupies a place in the book’s Glossary)Taleb uses the terms Mediocristan for thin-tailed distributions where observations are clustered with few extremes and Extremistan for fat-tailed distribution where a single observation can have a huge impact. Perhaps Taleb would do well to well to consider that human intelligence comes from Mediocristan, not Extremistan. He is a very smart person but not an order of magnitude smarter than the social scientists he lambasts.I think Taleb considers himself a modern-day Socrates who uncovers the conceit of knowledge among the ‘experts’ of his time, revealing them to be fools. Where he departs diametrically from Socrates is in his utter lack of humility. The thesis for “Skin in the Game” is the idea of symmetry: people must face the downside risks of their beliefs, values, and decisions along with the upside. He thus has the utmost respect for martyrs like Socrates or Jesus. Taleb’s beef with modern day society is the emergence of a class of people – bureaucrats, administrators, civil servants…but also social scientists, journalists, executives – who have little or no investment in their ideas or beliefs about what ought to be done. They collect a ready paycheque, but they do not stake anything for their ideas. They have no skin in the game or, as Taleb extends the metaphor, no soul in the game.For Taleb, it is entrepreneurs that deserve exaltation (with some residual respect for traders like himself, artisans, tradesmen and the working class). In other words, the doers not the talkers. Of course, it is also true that successful entrepreneurs, while commonly regarded as risk-takers, are often very good at mitigating and transferring risk to others (see for example, Malcolm Gladwell’s essay “The Sure Thing”). Despite the above, I give Skin in the Game five stars because Taleb puts forth original thinking and stimulates thought about his ideas, such as:-	The Minority Rule and why Non-GMO foods and Kosher foods are ubiquitous-	The Precautionary Principle and why we should be careful about the impact of transgenics on a system that we don’t understand and could have extreme outcomes. Cost-benefit analyses are useless when confronted with the possibility of ruin. -	How to harness the persistence and resourcefulness of a drug addict without being a drug addict (have skin in the game or ‘something to lose’)-	“What matters isn’t what a person has or doesn’t have; it is what he or she is afraid of losing. The more you have to lose, the more fragile you are” -	Why you need to retain contact with the ground (knowledge must be grounded in reality), and why clinical research found in medicine but few other disciplines is more important than theoretical or empirical research -	“Those who don’t take risks should never be involved in making decisions”-	The reframing of the Golden Rule as “The Silver Rule: do not do to others what you do not want them to do to you”-	“You who caught the turtles better eat them” (you need to eat what you feed others)-	Why employees are modern-day slaves: “The best slave is someone you overpay and who knows it, terrified of losing his status”-	The maxim of El Sabio the wise (Alfonso X of Spain): “Burn old logs. Drink old wine. Read old books. Keep old friends.”-	Why an Ivy-league education has become the ultimate luxury good and wealth causes more education versus the opposite -	Why you should not waste your time advertising or signalling virtue. -	“Courage is the only virtue you cannot fake” and courage is embodied by risk-taking / entrepreneurship-	People, left alone, will work out conflicts and learn to collaborate. “Even predators end up in some type of arrangement with their prey”Taleb on ReligionMost of the debate and dissension about religion stems from the fact that it means different things to different people: the law, a nation, aesthetics (pomp and ceremony), spiritual philosophy, a code of ethics, epistemic belief…I find this idea profound because I struggled with religion many years ago as a young adult studying philosophy. In reading this section, I was led to the insight that I had been applying an epistemic lens on religion (whether God exists as a metaphysical entity) and failed to see that others around me weren’t talking about religion in remotely the same way. I believe that much of the scholarship around atheism versus belief turns on this critical difference in perspective identified by Taleb. Taleb argues that religion helps us to survive and “enforce tail risk management across generations”. “Religion does not like fair-weather friends; it wants commitment; it is based on ‘skin in the game’. “Love without sacrifice is theft” (Procrustes). Taleb submits that he knows nobody who is an atheist in both actions and words because everybody practices rituals (broadly defined), has respect for the dead, and believes in superstitions. This rings true because we all believe in and worship something, be it money and wealth, our bodies, a sport, a career, etc. In other words, we all have attachments that stem from our emotions and faith. Why is religion any different? This enquiry leads Taleb to formulate his own definition of rationality: “what is rational is that which allows for survival”, and avoids ruin. The highest virtue for Taleb is courage. Courage is both selfless (implies personal sacrifice) and prudent risk-taking (gamblers are not courageous). We sacrifice our well-being for the sake of the survival of a higher layer: our family and friends, our tribe or community, humanity or the Ecosystem. Taleb, in the end, is very wise and leaves us with much to reflect upon about the things that really matter in life. "
30,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16963542-martin-brochhaus,1,"First of all: I have no idea who the author is or why he matters or why *he thinks* he matters so much. There seems to be somewhat of a personal cult around him, so whatever, I'm going in unbiased.The first 19% (can you even believe that?!) of this book is prologue and can only be described as a lose string of consciousness from a person that very obviously thinks very highly of themselves and seems to hate everything and everyone.Nothing in this book makes any sense. First of all, the chapters are called ""Books"" and the sub-chapters are called ""Chapters"". Why? These so called ""Books"" range from 20-40 pages each, so maybe they should rather be called what they are: Loosely coupled essays. Secondly, the massively long and incredibly badly written introduction seems to serve four pointless purposes:1. Advertise the author's other works2. Wet your appetite with fancy promises as to what great insights you will gain from this book, for example ""How is it that we have more slaves today than we did during Roman times""3. Lots and lots of virtue signalling, the author assures us that he has always lived the life of a saint, having lots of skin in the game.4. An entire sub-chapter telling us in advance, that this book cannot be judged by a reviewer unless he rereads it many times, because this book was specifically designed for rereading - so I guess you can stop reading my review here, because I didn't reread this book and I never will, because it is trash.Disclaimer: I only made it to 25% when I gave up. I was hoping that after the horrible prologue the author would show a little more discipline and try to produce something with less shock-value and insults and a little more coherence, but after I forced my way through ""Book 2 - A First Look At Agency"", it was clear that my hopes would not be met.The book continues to be a lose string of consciousness without any clear structure, without any data or sources backing up any claims, without any clear goal of what we are trying to establish here. The author seems to hate a lot of people and professions, so about 60% of the pages are spent with shitting on other people.The chapter names, for example, are just colourful phrases and at the end of each chapter I had to go back to the chapter title, asking myself ""what the fuck was this chapter supposed to be about?"" - but then, when reading the chapter title, I still was no wiser.I *think* this book doesn't really try to teach anything complex and it doesn't want to give you any call to action. It seems more to be a way for the author to formulate his own personal philosophy and communicate his worldview - which probably isn't even a bad worldview, but it's so utterly confusing laid out that I don't think it's worth the pain of engaging with it. Ironically, he quotes a lot of snippets from old Greek and Roman texts and at some point even points out that you should always read the original source, don't rely on intermediary wannabe philosophers (like himself). So, there you have it: Go read Marcus Aurelius and other practitioners of Stoicism (that is what I will do now, anyways).The most hilarious thing about this book is this: The author complains that academic papers now a days are worded very complex to the point of being unreadable just to make them seem more groundbreaking. Well, the hypocrisy is mind blowing here because just a few pages away from that rant the author basically writes something like ""you know, this book is pretty simple and probably fits into 60 pages"" - and yet he went ahead and blew it up with rants, insults, inside jokes and pretentious bullshit, leaving us with an incomprehensible text - to make us think that it is more groundbreaking?This book is neither entertaining nor insightful. I have seen other works of this author and his tweets are unavoidable when you are into bitcoin - I have come to the conclusion that this man can't write a straight sentence even if his life depended on it. Waste of money."
31,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,1,"Taleb, whose politics I did not pay attention to in Black Swan (and I skipped reading Antifragile), come off as a mix of right-neolib, classic liberal and Hayekian libertarian. It’s certainly possible, in addition, that he’s a Trump Train fellow traveler, though not riding the main line himself.He’s anti-regulatory as part of libertarian part of him. Yes, agencies can suffer regulatory capture, but the libertarian idea espoused by him of regulation through private lawsuit doesn’t work. Most people don’t have the money for lawyers, not even to sue over being forced into arbitration, and contra his classical pseudo-erudition, we’re not classical Athens where one has to defend their own case without lawyers.Second, he hates academics, and this book was presumably being written before Mary Beard punked him over people of color in Roman Britain. Given all the other things he says that relate to academia and are clearly wrong, such as claiming that the Essenes merged with Christianity, I’d hate academics and academia were I him too, because they clearly point out how fricking wrong he is.He has privilege of dual Lebanese-French citizenship at birth and picked up BA and grad degree in Paris.Hypocrite — says he’s no longer an active trader, thus HAS NO SKIN IN GAME, directly undercutting the main premise of this book.Hypocrite 2 — says a lot of things don’t scale up or down well, yet seems to wish for the whole world, all nations, to be organized like Swiss cantonsHis “good fences good neighbors make” for countries inside the Middle East comes an unspoken awfully close to justifying apartheid. He only mentions Arab states, but Israel-Palestine is surely in the back of his Lebanese Christian mind.Related to that, his calling all Sunni Muslims barbarians is ridiculous. It might, or might not, be a stretch to make that claim for all Salafists within Sunni, but all Sunnis? And, when he attacks Sunnis, praising Shi’ites while ignoring Iran?BSes himself about hedge funds having skin in the game. They have some, but not as much as other investors, and the fund manager usually draws a salary plus a percentage.Seems to be strongly anti-GMO, and claims that Seralini was persecuted by Monsanto. Wrong. He had crappy research. His set of anti-GMO rants throughout this book are not just incredibly wrong, above all about risk factors and testing, but they border on the paranoiac. https://grist.org/series/panic-free-g... And he believes in homeopathy.He’s even more laughable when he claims the US was a low-rentier society until Obama. Dude ….. or duuuuuddeeee, the CDO slice-and-dice world, the housing bubble, and the bursting of the housing bubble all began under Shrub Bush.Worse yet, Taleb seems to be some degree of fanboy of Trump on economic grounds. You mean, the four-times bankrupt Trump who gamed the American bankruptcy system to keep his skin out of the game? At this point, Taleb is basically becoming a parody of himself.Also, a kind of one-trick pony, like Robert Wright with non-zero stuff.Cognitive dissonance is not at all about sour grapes. Possibly the stupidest explanation of cognitive dissonance I’ve ever read.The intuitional insight of a grandmother is not right 90 percent of the time. I note from my life that wearing hats does NOT make you go bald. And “masturbation makes you go blind” is of course a moral injunction disguised as insight.Taleb is also wrong about relative economic mobility in the US vs. Old Europe. (Shock me.)To the degree he has anything good to say, I steal from another reviewer: “His ideas are easy to summarize, because they are simplistic: People who commit risk are more interested in outcomes; systems that last longer have undergone more stress tests; and random events affect all plans.”And, you could find that from somebody else."
32,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/353993-john,5,"Admission of shameless bias. Nassim Nicholas Taleb gets it. You can spend a major portion of your life acquiring degrees/certifications, crunching numbers, digesting treatises, pouring through Harvard Biz case studies and working up a well-honed rap to boost your rep ...until you run into Taleb. He could care less about awards, prizes, recognition, Ivy League pedigrees and mainstream acceptance (although one suspects he does pay attention to book sales). His style is compelling. His copious writings and rants, his iconoclastic razor sharp broadsides against the clubby models, his lampooning of conventional economists and their half-baked theories - the entertainment and enjoyment come in waves. He is the H.L. Mencken of Finance who is not afraid to rattle the cages of central bankers, Noble Prize winners, Cabinet members. OK, there are a few very minor flaws. He can conjure up some very complex, dense mathematical models but he very kindly warns readers before it hits and advises them to skip it if they wish. He does tend to run off topic; however, there is always a punchline ... or better yet, somebody getting punched, some theory getting punctured, some ego being deflated. This book is worth reading simply for the Glossary of Talebisms. What is the Bob Rubin trade? What is regulatory capture? Who is an IYI (Intellectual Yet Idiot)? What is the Lindy Effect? The book is also worth reading for the devastating takedowns and dissections of purported charlatans and hypocrites. He calls out his adversaries by name, exposes their follies and rolls up his sleeves. If you are a die hard fan of Bob Rubin, Steven Pinker or Susan Sontag, you might want to give this book a pass. But if you want to hear the other side of finance, markets, risk and investing, take a flying jump off the temple roof and make a Black Swan dive into Taleb."
33,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2237336-bianka-b,5,"The problem with Taleb is not that he is an a**hole. He is, and he admits it openly and unapologetically. The problem with Taleb is that he is right. Skin in the Game is a stream-of-consciousnesses kind of work, where Taleb detects and examines bullshit from micro to macro-level across societies and structures of governance. His ultimate argument, supported by countless fascinating anecdotes, is that the biggest problem of modernity is the rise of an entire parasitic class of people with no skin in the game. Those who expose others to risk, yet their own skin remains unscratched. The warmongers who don’t fight in their own wars, the engineers who don’t sleep under the bridges they create, the traders who privatize their wins, but collectivize their losses. If you read the entire Incerto series from start to finish, you can see how with each book Nassim becomes angrier and more annoyed - after all, he has been taking about the dangers of asymmetry for 20+ years, yet nothing has changed much. "
34,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22849115-brian-yahn,4,"In brief, this book revolves around a single point: the importance of Skin in the Game.Think of this in terms of a gamble: if you have a lot to win, and nothing to lose, you'll obviously take a ""gamble"". Since, you're not really taking a ""chance"", you're just ""giving"" yourself an upside.Rarely does this situation exist. Usually, when you personally have a lot to win and nothing to lose, someone else (or several others collectively) have a lot to lose. As you can see, the selfish will take this trade to extremes. If they can create one dollar for themselves by destroying one dollar for everyone else on the planet, they will -- even though as a species, the trade would be net negative $7Bn.Nassim warns about taking advice from anyone who has something to gain if you follow their advice and things work out, but nothing to lose if you follow their advice and suffer losses. The key point is: you might be altrusitic, but a lot of people are greedy -- especially in business / finance.The main criticism of this book -- that Nassim is being hypocrtical -- is null & void. Nassim doesn't really have anything to gain if you follow his advice. He's just giving advice. Sure, you should be skeptical. But he's not being a hypocrit in giving this advice.The fact that this is a common criticism of the book I think showcases one of Nassim's biggest punching bags, the *intellectual yet idiot*. Someone smart enough to understand the book and its points, and notice that this book is giving advice, but not able to put the full picture together.That being said, this book is a bit of a disappointment.Nassim's previous book, The Black Swan, revolved around a single core point, gave tons of impirical evidence in support of it, and made several logical arguments attempting to prove it. It was easy-to-follow, yet insightful and entertaining.Skin in the Game however seems to make a different point almost every sentence, and in this book, Nassim doesn't back up his claims with nearly the same quality of evidence or arguments.To take three examples, I know quite well and rubbed me the wrong way:1) He regularly bashes Hillary Clinton -- without giving any reason to back up his claims -- and he appears to praise Donald Trump several times, again not giving reason. It's clear that Nassim is contrarian, but for someone to have that kind of view with the type of readership he has, you'd expect him to put in some effort to explain himself, but he doesn't.If he really knows something I don't, it would've been nice to read about it. Instead he just calls Hillary crooked, and Trump a genius. Not buying it...2) Several times he talks about exercise, and that it's better to push yourself to the limits a few times a year, than to exercise regularly throughout the year. He also makes some dietary claims. AFAIK, there's not really any conclusive evidence on what's best to do in either of these. So for him to make these claims, if he really has found conclusive evidence, it would have been nice for him to reveal the sources. Instead, he makes a couple of logical arguments that suspiciously resemble broscience. Then he attempts to tie these into his main message and use that as supporting claims / evidence.I'm not saying his reasoning is bad. It's just far from convincing. If anything, this made me more skeptical of his other claims.3) Nassim criticizes Pikettey and his book Capital in the 21st Century. Nassim loves to criticize economists. And Pikketey's book is far from perfect. Reading it, he seemed to prove that inequality in Europe is MUCH worse than inequality in the US. Yet Pikketey argued just the opposite. Pikettey also seemed to imply it's nearly impossible for a laborer to make it into the upper class, but as a young laborer in the US who has already done this and works with thousands of others who have as well, empirically, I know this to be false (at least in the US). In Europe you're more likely to go from poor to middle class, but it's very unlikely you'll go from rags to riches. In the US, there's more generational poverty, but there's also a lot more mobility into the upper class (hope).Nassim is quick to point that the information economy in the US has created an upward mobility of scale that's rarely existed in the past. But it's as if this evidence that SOME upward mobility exists, that every claim Thomas Pikettey makes is null & void. Then Nassim talks about how the French and Italian political systems have protected wealth for centuries, and that the same few families have had all the wealth in Florence for 700 years. Then he points to some mathematical proof that one of Pikettey's minor points is mathematically incorrect, as if a person making one mistake is enough to dismiss everything he says.Further, Nassim goes on to say that ""most people don't care about the class hirearchy"". That is to say, most people aren't concerned with wealth inequality. He doesn't provide any evidence to this, but jealousy is one of the most fundamental human emotions. I don't have evidence either, but it seems nearly everyone I interact with is frustrated with globally inequality at the moment. I don't think -- as he claims -- that the only people that care about inequality are upper class that aren't quite yet rich. I think a lot of poor people care about inequality, and middle class people, too!--I love reading Nassim because he is a free thinker, and he presents a lot of interesting possibilities to consider. Plus I love his style of writing.But the other big criticism of his writing did resonate with me:He writes like a bully.Ironically, he's someone that espouses the need to be skeptical, but he writes with such authority that it's easy to read his work and accept it as fact rather than fully explore his thoughts and come to your own conclusions.He constantly rails against the *intellectual yet idiot* -- the person that went to Harvard, got an education, thinks he knows more than he does, and is wrong on occasion (or often). Nassim only writes about things he knows very well. Most other people don't have the discipline to restrain their opinions to their small domain of knowledge. So you'll be hard pressed to prove Nassim wrong in the way he proves others wrong. But I think his mockery of others while he does this is antithical to his message.How can one be skeptical of his advice, when he's calling everyone an idiot who disagrees with him? No one wants to be an idiot. So a normal person is tempted to suck up anything he says and accept it as fact without fully considering it.And as I mentioned, there's quite a few commentaries he makes where he provides little evidence, and if you think the other way, you might be tempted to ignore the other things he does have to say. I wish he'd be a little less agressive in his writing and would've had the same discipline to stay focused in this book as he did in The Black Swan.Either way, he really is one of my new favorite authors. And I feel like the advice in this book, will stick with me forever and improve my decision making. What more could I ask for?"
35,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1229019-liviu,5,"The one non-fiction book everyone should take a look at as it puts in (very skilled) words what most people feel - today the smooth talkers have power without risk (unless they are caught at the outrage du jour) and they use it to enrich themselves with an ""after us the deluge"" motto; the ""talk is cheap"" cliche has never been exposed better than in this book and reading it, one may get angry or exhilarated (or both and more) but one will learn a lot from it"
36,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44243874-goktug-yilmaz,5,"Skin in the game3 Keys:- The central asymmetry of life is: In a strategy that entails ruin, benefits never offset risks of ruin.- Take all risks, that doesn’t have a chance for ruin. But has a chance of profits.- The mechanism of transferring risk impedes learning.Rules:- Golden Rule (symmetry): Treat others the way you would like them to treat you.- Silver Rule (negative golden rule): Do not do to others what you would not like them to do to you. - Principle of Charity: Exercise symmetry in intellectual debates; represent the argument of the opponent as accurately as you would like yours to be represented.Morality:- Code of Hammurabi central theme: It establishes symmetries between people in a transaction, so nobody can transfer hidden tail risk.- If you have the rewards, you must also get some of the risks, not let others pay the price of your mistakes. If you inflict risk on others, and they are harmed, you need to pay some price for it. You should share the responsibility for events without unfairness and inequity.- If you give an opinion, and someone follows it, you are morally obligated to be, exposed to its consequences.- The principle of intervention, like that of healers, is first do no harm. Those who don’t take risks should never be involved in making decisions.- We have always been crazy but weren’t skilled enough to destroy the world. Now we can.History:- Historically, all warlords and warmongers were warriors themselves, and, with a few curious exceptions, societies were run by risk takers, not risk transferors.- Prominent people took risks—considerably more risks than ordinary citizens. The Roman emperor Julian the Apostate, died on the battlefield fighting in the never-ending war on the Persian frontier—while emperor.Learning: - Interventionistas don’t learn because they are not the victims of their mistakes.- Evolution can only happen if risk of extinction is present. - People don’t learn so much from their and other people’s mistakes; the system learns by selecting those less prone to a certain class of mistakes and eliminating others. Bad pilots, are under the ocean, dangerous drivers are in the cemetery. Transportation didn’t get safer just because people learn from errors, but because the system does.- Fools of randomness are purged by reality so they stop harming others. Recall that it is at the foundation of evolution that systems get smart by elimination.- Those who talk should do and only those who do should talk.- What you learn from the intensity and the focus you had when under the influence of risk stays with you.- Too high a rate of mutation prevents locking in the benefits of previous changes; evolution requires some, but not too frequent variation. Assistance:- Presence of an assistant suspends your natural filtering—and its absence forces you to do only things you enjoy, and progressively steer your life that way. You want maximal free time, not maximal activity. Otherwise, you end up assisting your assistants, or being forced to “explain” how to do things, which requires more mental effort than doing the thing. Having an assistant (unless necessary) removes your soul from the game. Assistance moves you one step away from authenticity.Entrepreneurship:- Entrepreneurs are heroes in our society. They fail for the rest of us. Because of VC mechanisms, many people mistaken for entrepreneurs fail to have true skin in the game because their aim is to cash out by selling the company they created to someone else. The true value of the company, what it makes, and its long-term survival are of small relevance to them. This is a pure financing scheme and we will exclude this class of people from our “entrepreneur” risk-taker class. We can easily identify them by their ability to write a convincing business plan. (This is the equivalent of bringing great-looking and marketable children into the world with the sole aim of selling them at age four)- Products or companies that bear the owner’s name convey the message: “They have something to lose. Commitment to the company.” Products:- Things designed by people without skin in the game tend to grow in complication (before their final collapse).- Artisans have their soul in the game.- Anything you do to optimize your work, cut some corners, or squeeze more “efficiency” out of it will eventually make you dislike it.Minority vs Majority Rule:- Minority Rule: An asymmetry by which the behavior of the total is dictated by the preferences of a minority. Smokers can be in smoke-free areas but nonsmokers cannot be in smoking ones, so nonsmokers will prevail, not because they are initially a majority, but because they are asymmetric. Languages, ethics, and religions spread by minority rule. Most intolerant wins.- All it takes is a small number of intolerant, virtuous people with skin in the game, in the form of courage, for society to function properly.- Genes follow majority rule; languages minority rule. Languages travel; genes less so.- Formation of moral values and civil rights in society doesn’t come from the evolution of the consensus, it is the most intolerant person who imposes virtue on others precisely because of that intolerance. - The minority rule produces low-variance in outcomes.- An intolerant minority can control and destroy democracy. Actually, it will eventually destroy our world. So, we need to be more than intolerant with some intolerant minorities. They violate the Silver Rule.- “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has” Margaret Mead- Revolutions are driven by an obsessive minority and the entire growth of society, whether economic or moral, comes from a small number of people.- Society doesn’t evolve by consensus, voting, majority, committees, verbose meetings, academic conferences, or polling; only a few people move the needle. All one needs is an asymmetric rule somewhere—and someone with soul in the game. And asymmetry is present in about everything.- Science is a minority rule: a few will run it, others are just back-office clerks.Markets & Trading:- Markets aren’t the sum of market participants, but price changes reflect the activities of the most motivated buyer and seller. A price can drop by 10% because of a single stubborn seller. - The market is like a large movie theatre with a small door. And the best way to detect a sucker is to see if his focus is on the size of the theatre rather than that of the door.- The average behavior of the market participant will not allow us to understand the general behavior of the market.- You can examine markets as markets and individuals as individuals, but markets are not sums of average individuals- Zero-Intelligence-Markets: The underlying structure of reality matters much more than the participants, something policymakers fail to understand. Under the right market structure, a collection of idiots produces a well-functioning market.- Individuals don’t need to know where they are going; markets do. Leave people alone under a good structure and they will take care of things.- Agents increase their risks as they are winning, but contract after losses, a technique called “playing with the house money.” You start betting aggressively whenever you have a profit, never when you have a deficit, as if a switch was turned on or off. Slavery, Employees vs Contractors:- People who are employees for a living don’t behave so opportunistically. Contractors are exceedingly free; as risk-takers, they fear mostly the law. But employees have a reputation to protect. And they can be fired.- Employees are expensive. You have to pay them even when you’ve got nothing for them to do. You lose your flexibility. Talent for talent, they cost a lot more. Lovers of pay checks are lazy, but they would never let you down on time of needs.- Employees exist because they have significant skin in the game—and the risk is shared with them, enough risk for it to be a deterrent and a penalty for acts of undependability, such as failing to show up on time. You are buying dependability.- Someone employed for a while is giving you evidence of submission. Evidence of submission is displayed by the employee’s going through years depriving himself of his personal freedom for 9 hours every day. He is an obedient, housebroken dog.- People are no longer owned by a company but by something worse: the idea that they need to be employable. The employable person is embedded in an industry, with fear of upsetting not just their employer, but other potential employers.- Contracts can be too costly to negotiate due to transaction costs; the solution is to incorporate your business and hire employees with clear job descriptions because you can’t afford legal and organizational bills for every transaction. A free market is a place where forces act to determine specialization, and information travels via price point; but within a firm these market forces are lifted because they cost more to run than the benefits they bring. So market forces will cause the firm to aim for the optimal ratio of employees and outside contractors.- The best slave is someone you overpay and who knows it, terrified of losing his status.Decisions:- People whose survival depends on qualitative “job assessments” by someone of higher rank in an organization cannot be trusted for critical decisions.- Employees are reliable by design, but they cannot be trusted in making decisions, anything that entails serious tradeoffs. Nor can they face emergencies unless they are in the emergency business. Employee has a simple objective: fulfill the tasks that his or her supervisor deems necessary, or satisfy some gameable metric.Freedom:- Freedom entails risks—real skin in the game. Freedom is never free.- Risk takers can be socially unpredictable people. Freedom is always associated with risk taking, whether it leads to it or comes from it. You take risks, you feel part of history. And risk takers take risks because it is in their nature to be wild animals.- You can define a free person precisely as someone whose fate is not centrally or directly dependent on peer assessment.Lindy Effect: - When a technology, idea, corporation, or anything nonperishable has an increase in life expectancy with every additional day of survival—unlike perishable items. So a book that has been a hundred years in print is likely to stay in print another hundred years—provided its sales remain healthy.- Time is equivalent to disorder, and resistance to the ravages of time, that is, what we gloriously call survival, is the ability to handle disorder.- That which is fragile has an asymmetric response to volatility and other stressors. It will experience more harm than benefit from time.- In probability, volatility and time are the same. Fragility idea, the only effective judge of things is time.- That which is “Lindy” is what ages in reverse. Its life expectancy lengthens with time, conditional on survival.- Only the nonperishable can be Lindy. When it comes to ideas, books, technologies, procedures, institutions, and political systems under Lindy, there is no intrinsic aging and perishability.- Fragility is the expert, hence time and survival.- In any activity, hidden details are only revealed via Lindy.- If you hear advice from a grandmother or elders, odds are that it works 90% of the time. On the other hand, in part because of scientism and academic prostitution, in part because the world is hard, if you read anything by psychologists and behavioural scientists, odds are that it works at less than 10%, unless it is has also been covered by the grandmother and the classics, in which case why would you need a psychologist?- When the beard is black, heed the reasoning, but ignore the conclusion. When the beard is gray, consider both reasoning and conclusion. When the beard is white, skip the reasoning, but mind the conclusion.Rationality & Survival:- Rationality resides in what you do, not in what you think or in what you “believe”, and rationality is about survival.- Survival comes first, truth, understanding, and science later. You do not need science to survive, but you must survive to do science. As your grandmother would have said, better safe than sorry.- First, live; then philosophize, Warren Buffett truism “to make money you must first survive. - I have a finite shelf life, humanity should have an infinite duration. I am renewable, not humanity or the ecosystem.- You often get better results making “errors,” as when you aim slightly away from the target when shooting. Making some types of errors is the most rational thing to do, when the errors are of little cost, as they lead to discoveries.- Skin in the game means that you do not pay attention to what people say, only to what they do, and to how much of their necks they are putting on the line. Let survival work its wonders.- When you consider beliefs in evolutionary terms, do not look at how they compete with each other, but consider the survival of the populations that have them.- Not everything that happens happens for a reason, but everything that survives survives for a reason.- Rationality is risk management in order to succeed, you must first survive. - Sequence matters and the presence of ruin disqualifies cost-benefit analyses.- Ruin: no reversibility away from the condition. The central problem is that if there is a possibility of ruin, cost-benefit analyses are no longer possible.- Russian roulette: Expected return is not computable.- Every single risk you take adds up to reduce your life expectancy.- Rationality is avoidance of systemic ruin.- Reality doesn’t care about winning arguments: survival is what matters.- One may be risk loving yet completely averse to ruin.- Love risk, systematic “convex” tinkering, and taking a lot of risks that don’t have tail risks but offer tail profits. Volatile things are not necessarily risky, and stable things are not necessarily safe.- Small injuries will be beneficial, never larger ones, those that have irreversible effects. - Never compare a multiplicative, systemic, and fat-tailed risk to a non-multiplicative, idiosyncratic, and thin-tailed one.Illusion:- True intellect should not appear to be intellectual.- Things that looks sophisticated and scientific is usually scientism, not science. - If a successful person doesn’t look the part, they had much to overcome in terms of perception. Thanks to the presence of some skin in the game, the contact with reality filters out incompetence, as reality is blind to looks.- In any type of activity or business divorced from the direct filter of skin in the game, the great majority of people know the jargon, play the part, and are intimate with the cosmetic details, but are clueless about the subject.- An expert rule in my business is to never hire a well-dressed trader. But it goes beyond: Hire the successful trader, conditional on a solid track record, whose details you can understand the least.- The illusion prevails that businesses work via business plans and science via funding. This is strictly not true: a business plan is a useful narrative for those who want to convince a sucker. It works because, firms in the entrepreneurship business make most of their money packaging companies and selling them; it is not easy to sell without some strong narrative. Most big recent successes (Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Google) were started by people with skin and soul in the game and grew organically—if they had recourse to funding, it was to expand, funding was not the prime source of creation. You don’t create a firm by creating a firm; nor do you do science by doing science.World workings:- Collectively society doesn’t advance with organized education: the level of education in a country is the result of wealth.- Negative Utility: Sophistication can, at some level, cause degradation.- No peace proceeds from bureaucratic ink. If you want peace, make people trade, as they have done for millennia. They will be eventually forced to work something out.- We are largely collaborative—except when institutions get in the way.- If the “law of the jungle” means anything, it means collaboration for the most part, with a few perceptional distortions caused by our otherwise well-functioning risk-management intuitions. Even predators end up in some type of arrangement with their prey.- History is largely peace punctuated by wars.

37,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9077572-irene,3,"Okay, so I pushed through this one because my partner is a fan of Taleb, and I get it. I do. His ideas are good, very good, his ideas are brilliant, and challenging, and even groundbreaking. But the delivery, man, the delivery is just not as good as the ideas. While Taleb's ideas are interesting, they are not that complex. I mean, they are a little bit complex, maybe, but not as complex as they come across in this book. However, Taleb's writing gets in the way of his message. He goes on and on, picking on this person and that book, attacking this or that community, and rambling about this and that. His - albeit great - ideas could have been summarised in 50 pages, probably less than that. I find Taleb's personality gets in the way of his own ideas, and I think he likes himself a little too much. Am I happy I finished this? YesWill I read another book by Taleb? Maybe. I would be grateful if someone re-edited his work."
38,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1947301-ericka-clouther,2,"I've purchased some of his previous books, but I borrowed this one from the library, and this will be my last Taleb book. Taleb said several times that all that matters is the reader (although the future reader- so probably still not me), so let me join the ranks of people who think the manner in which he conveys his ideas is ridiculously rude, offensive, and ineffective. I've read satire and that is certainly not the issue here. His tone was a disaster even at the beginning of the book, but I thought-- I can handle it, I'm not a delicate flower. Then I noticed his extreme lack of logical argument or evidence for his points in this book. I could think of numerous counterarguments and counter-examples to things he said, which Taleb never subsequently addressed. Then I noticed his tone and accusations were getting progressively ruder and more unsubstantiated. While the basic ""skin in the game"" premise makes sense in a way that can be explained in a few sentences or a short essay, the rest of this book is mostly a diatribe against intellectuals and academics. And then Taleb tires to periodically rely on intellectuals for numerous arguments he makes. It's completely crazy. I mean, did he go off medication or develop a brain tumor? Because I actually really liked Black Swan, and I found Antifragile interesting. But I wouldn't recommend this one at all unless you want to waste a chunk of your life and maybe raise your blood pressure.Also, you know what a central problem is with Taleb, in particular, attacking well-read educated individuals? They constitute the majority of the reading public, and especially the portion of the reading public that sits down with books about statistics or probability. He even specifically attacked intellectuals with Black Swan on their bookshelves. I mean, really.PS. Is he pro-anxiety? I can oblige him there."
39,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6429894-jayson-virissimo,3,"Important, high impact ideas, but could have been a long blogpost rather than an entire book. In short, Skin in the Game < Black Swan < Antifragile."
40,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52180824-mircea,2,"Taleb jumps the shark with this one. I’ve read all his previous books and found in them an interesting way of looking at things - is spite of the hateful and arrogant tone. I am willing to a certain degree to overlook the form if the content is worth it.This one is hard to read because it heavily references previous books (Black Swan and Antifragile) and sprinkles the idea of “Skin in the game” over. It’s annoying if you are familiar with the ideas and it’s super annoying if you don’t understand the references (God help you if this is your first book by Taleb). The book has zero structure. The writing style also has not improved over time. You’d expect that this would naturally happen but it doesn’t. Maybe the author believes that this style works but IMHO it doesn’t. And now the part with the Shark: throughout the book, we’re told that people that don’t have “skin in the game” are useless, should not be listened to, etc. Which raises an interesting question? Does Taleb have “skin in the game” when it comes to this book? For me the answer is a resounding no. This book should have never grown past a blog post. It reminded me of the awful books of Seth Godin with their well established formula: 1) a somewhat valid idea 2) blabber and restate/reformulate the idea 3)... 4) profit? Don’t agree? What is the message of the book? Having skin in the game is good and let’s hate the people that don’t and are puppet masters/rent-seekers?Taleb should either up his game when it comes to writing or move on to the next thing (where he would indubitably find a parallel with trading and weight lifting - all while maintaining a flaneur-ish lifestyle). There is a finite amount of times you can do the same trick and expect people to be in awe."
41,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6805662-bhashit-parikh,5,"More wisdom from Taleb. Since this was a Taleb book, I was ready to give it a five star rating without even reading it. Well, I did finish it. And it's not as long or as densely packed as his other books, it's more like a long summary of ideas with some ideas explained in more detail. As with all Taleb books, this one's pretty entertaining too.If you haven't ready any Taleb books before, this is probably not the place to start. It's rather succient, and builds on the ideas already exposed in other books. Sure, you can read this one without having read any of his other books and still take away a lot.Also, another, possibly important, thing to note is that Taleb has been publishing some chapters of this book as articles online for some time. And all the main ideas in the book are already exposed there. So, you might not even need to read the book. But, to repeat, it's entertaining and it has some great insights."
42,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16286825-becca-noggle,5,"WOW...great book but I think I am going to have to reread it at some point. Definitely quite a bit smarter than myself and I enjoyed throughout the book pausing and really thinking about what Taleb was saying. I know I missed some important facts and look forward to reading it again, maybe this year but most likely again in 2020! He is witty and snarky! Also, adding more of his books to my Want to Read as this was my first of his. "
43,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3733820-keith-swenson,1,"Quite a disappointment. I am a huge fan of the Black Swan and Antifragile. The ideas presented in those books were transformative. SITG includes some of the most opaque rhetoric I have been forced to endure in a long time.The theme is straightforward: a complex system with large asymmetric imbalances can give you bad results. If you can construct the system so that everyone has 'skin in the game' then the system has a chance of being fair and optimal. Constructing it otherwise is a ""Moral Hazard"" a term which is useful in explaining the problem, but completely avoided in this book. He illustrates with a stream of anecdotes aimed to show either (a) where unbalanced risk/reward caused a problem, and/or (b) where he thinks he had been clever in the past. The book is notoriously short on verifiable data. His perspective on data: (p138) ""when you buy a thick book with tons of graphs and tables to prove a point you should be suspicious. It means something didn't distill right!"" By ""distill"" he means the reductionist fallacy: that a complex system should be able to be explained in simple, concrete terms. That is really odd given that his main thesis is the complex system don't behave simply.The book reads like an Ayn Rand novel, thoroughly scrambled, smothered in egotism. Fat Tony reappears from the older books as the tough, but sensitive, impeccably honest mafia boss who worries only about his own profit, but because the system is constructed correctly all his actions result in net good for himself and the world. It is all just so simple: make sure that everyone bears some risk of the downside.There is some point to this: Bankers continued to get fat multi-million dollar bonuses in 2007/2008 even when the entire market was crashing around them because of their actions. The motivation for the book is that the public should not be bailing out banks when they fail. Privatized profit with socialized risk is a real problem. I agree.He generalizes this rule to the entire economy: just make sure that everyone bears some risk and all will be OK. He completely ignores the fact that many people are in professions where the risk/rewards are far removed from their actions: e.g. schoolteachers, maids, gardeners, waiters, bus drivers, painters, construction workers, coal miners, oncologists, well actually just about every profession except Wall Street stock traders, and even that is not clear when you consider the big risks like global warming and terrorism. He knows that a completely unregulated market would lead to favoring bullies who win by threatening violence, so he starts in chapter 1 about morals and ethics. He tells us (p54) that a upright trader would never sell stock for one price, when they knew it was worth a different price, or specifically if there was a large supply about to be available. He tells how Antipater of Tarsus at the time of the Greeks said it was unethical to buy grain in a plentiful market at low price, and then sell that for a higher price in a market that had a shortage of grain. One must be completely transparent so that all parties know everything. Taleb completely ignores his own fortune being made exactly this way: buying and selling stock to people who were misinformed about the market. Did he feel it was his moral duty to inform those selling why he felt the price was about to go up? Certainly not. Because he had ""skin in the game"" he is absolved of any possible moral turpitude. Profits and absolution bound in one tight package. Having dealt with ethics in chapter one he then is free to let go with his lassez-faire tantrum.He regales us with these gems and platitudes:(p58) ""I have troubles with intellectuals talking about abstract notions""(p72) ""I once pulled a prank on a friend: [when forced to sit in a smoking section] that we needed to buy cigarettes because you had to smoke in the smoking section.""(p77) ""pseudo-leftist caviar eaters"" are the only people who will complain about ordering pizza(p77) wine is only for women. ""Once you have 10% or more women at a party"" you need to serve wine.(p79) Genes propagate differently than language does(p82) There is no market for French food in South Jersey(p83) The world is run by a stubborn intolerant minority of no more than 3% (p97) an employee denied a paycheck will ""act as a baby deprived of mother's milk""(p98) You should never get married: ""Never buy when you could rent the three F's:"" Floating, flying, and f**king.(p101) Economist Ronald Coase had no interest in the ""ancients""(p107) Workers whose survival depends on ""job assessments"" can not be trusted(p129) Everyone despises people who make a lot of money on salary. Stock trading is OK.(p129) ""people can easily see that someone getting rich is not taking money from your pocket; odds are he is even putting some in yours""(p133) Anyone with investments in general knows that Thomas Pikkety was ""patently wrong""(p134) Considering Balzac and Jane Austin erudite is equivalent to calling a briefcase holder a weight lifter.(p134) Pikkety's purpose was to ""bring down some rich businessman"" that he couldn't see.(p137) ""I left data out of 'The Black Swan' [because] most people flood their stories with numbers and graphs in the absence of solid or logical arguments""(p147) ""Researchers have their own agenda at variance with what [society is] paying them for.""(p149) Clinical results are deemed not scientific(p150) ""If you hear advice from a grandmother or elders, odds are it works 90% of the time."" Anything by psychologists or behavior scientist work only 10% of the time.(p157) ""Hire [people] whose details you can understand the least""Chapter 3 says to be your own boss. Never be an employee, because then you are owned. He tells a parable about a pilot hired to fly a plane, but then lured away by a Saudi Shiekh with where ""money was no object."" His point is that a consultant would accept the job from the Shiekh while the employee won't. It never crosses his mind that the calculation is about what the next job is going to be. If the Shiekh was to offer a long enough contract, then both the consultant and the employee would be equally tempted. He seems oblivious that the only a wall street trader lives in a world where there will ALWAYS be opportunities tomorrow: the pilot might be without an airplane, without an airline, without passengers, and completely unable to do perform any work no matter how willing.The book is ostensibly about game theory, but curiously never mentions the prisoner's dilemma, not even once.Chapter 6 includes a long list of people and professions for no purpose other than to say he looks down on them.Chapter 7, he is impressed by Donald Trump taking the Taj Mahal to bankruptcy. ""There is something respectable in losing a billion dollars provided it is your own money."" But it wasn't Trump's money! The point is he amassed a debt of more than a billion dollars that he owed to people and then had it (largely) cancelled in the bankruptcy. Taleb simply is not thinking straight on this point: If it was Trump's ""own money"" he would not be filing for bankruptcy!He claims ""only 10% of the wealthiest 500 American people or dynasties were so 30 years ago"" 30 years is almost a complete career, and of course more people will be on the list at the end of their career than at the beginning. I am sure there will be people on the list 30 years from now who have not started their career. This distorted picture is standard fare for the libertarian 'I did it all myself' crowd. The question to ask is what decile each person on that list was born into. A casual investigation of the list on Wikipedia shows a majority born into families that were in the top 5% to start with. While it is remotely possible that his figures are correct, he does not CITE his SOURCES so there is no way to check what the figures really mean. He is uncommonly fascinated by the ""Lindy Effect"" which describes a surprising quality of anything exhibiting a 'power law' distribution: The average expected lifetime of such things is proportional to their currently completed lifetime so far. A better way to say this would be ""Given a group of things that have existed for N years, half of them will survive another N years."" This leads Taleb to the conclusion that anything old is good. He carefully distinguishes ""living things"" as not following this behavior, but he is not careful enough on what he applies the ""effect"" to. He uses this as a blunt weapon to claim that all things ancient are good. Except when they aren't. He promises several times to explain the details in Chapter 19, which turns out to once again be a small collection of anecdotes and name-calling. By Chapter 9 he is drifting into the bizarre: (p160) ""intellectuals should not look like intellectuals"" and (p158) ""literature should not look like literature."" He tells us that you should pick the surgeon who looks like a butcher because their trials at overcoming their looks makes them a better surgeon. To be completely honest, I had to put the book down at this point. If the rest of the book shows anything close to an interesting idea, please let me know. By page 160 the book had lost all semblance of credibility for me, and found that instead of reading it, I was just looking for bigger, more ludicrous, unfounded claims. And I was not enjoying it.Taleb has jumped the shark with this book. His basic idea (from the other books) is a good one: complex systems are complex, and attempts to reduce them to simple rules leaves you vulnerable to mistakes (which he employed to make money). Good enough. This book however presents the idea that the complex system can be tamed as long as everyone ""takes some risk"" for their decisions. Yes, I can see that eliminating risk from decision makers is a real problem. So, yes, lets work to correct that in the banking sector. But as a generalized principle, it does not work. Taleb has no understanding of the world outside of Wall Street. Like many Ayn Rand fans, he believes that there is no need for long term commitments or collective action. He thinks that ""skin in the game"" solves the tragedy of the commons. To him, everything is a trade, which either pays or doesn't, before you go on to the next trade. He simplifies the behavior of people in the same way that the Economics texts does: people make decisions based on maximizing utility, but this is not a real-world description of any person. This book gives us nothing that applies to every day life. There is a world outside of Wall Street."
44,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7470463-corina-anghel,4,"Taleb, as you can notice in (most of) his books, argues against intellectuals who rely too much on scientism to make impactful decisions or to support their views. Scientism is a sort of belief in things that tend to look like science, without actually understanding the real science behind or without knowing how to really interpret what the science says. In this book, combining probabilistic theories with history (and the works of thinkers and philosophers such as Aristotle) and some behavior science he promotes the idea of having skin in the game in order to really be entitled to decision-making or interpretations of the world. He believes that there are too many people making decisions without having to experience the real effects of those decisions. The book is written as if you’re listening to this very wise guy, a bit tipsy, preaching in a bar to whomever is there to listen to him about things and people that bother him…which makes it a fun read. He also added a chapter with a lot of calculations and formulas for those who can understand them – which, for those who don’t, just adds a little more credibility to his arguments.I recommend this book, and any of Taleb’s, because he is bold enough to formulate some very well argumented theories that put things in a different perspective thus creating a constructive debate on how we understand the world.Some concepts and ideas that I want to remember:# One of the side effects of specialization is that is ”separating the labor from the fruits of labor”, for example architects start building to impress others in their field rather than to satisfy the needs of the residents.#  Deontic libertarianism  – basically supporting as few regulations as possible so as to allow mistakes that aren’t too great, but having to pay for your mistakes if you harmed others (which kinda looks a bit like consequentialism). #  Skin in the game is required to authenticity, so much so that he recommends not having an assistant (like using Google Translate all the time when you are in a different country, or Waze - because you don’t immerse yourself as much).#  Behavioral economics need to be regarded in a much broader sense as the bracketing that comes with the experiment design might lead to results that are far from accurate. For example, you ask someone in the “lab” to make an economic decision, but that decision might be completely different in the real life when the person has a history, concerns, fears and so on.#  When looking at complex systems one needs to take into account  the “emergent” property of the whole, referring to the fact that the ensemble’s behavior cannot be predicted by studying its parts as what is important are the interactions between such parts (studying an ant in isolation will tell you nothing about how a colony actually behaves).#  You change the world by having a flexible majority surrendering to an intransigent minority (ex: in some regions where kosher populations live the stores sell only kosher drinks because the majority doesn’t mind, but the minority can’t have it otherwise). When the minority becomes the new majority we say the system “renormalized”.#  True equality should function on two principles/conditions: mobility (meaning that someone can get rich) and no-absorbing-barrier (meaning that someone who is rich should never be certain to stay rich).#  The Lindy effect – the theory that the life expectancy of some non-perishable things like a technology or an idea (a book, for example) is proportional to their current age, so that every additional period of survival implies a longer remaining life expectancy.#  “People who are bred, selected and compensated to find complicated solutions do not have an incentive to implement simplified ones”#  Constructed preferences – Taleb argues that rich people more often than not start to prefer certain activities/things only because people sell them the idea that that is a rich person’s preference. Replace “rich” with any other stereotype group.#  Simon Herb’s theory about bounded rationality: we cannot measure and assess everything as if we were a computer therefore we produce, under evolutionary pressures, some shortcuts and distortions (some could be called cognitive biases)."
45,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80152812-maciej-nowicki,3,"Skin in the game, in general, is about if you have the rewards you must also get some of the risks. In such a case, you shouldn’t have an option to let others pay the price of your mistakes. For instance, bureaucracy is a construction by which a person is conveniently separated from the consequences of his or her actions. The worst casualty has been a free market as the public already prone to hating finances conflating free market and higher order forms of corruption and cronyism when in fact it is the exact opposite. It is government, not markets that makes these issues possible by the mechanisms of bailouts.As Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the author of the book writes “People who are bred, selected, and compensated to find complicated solutions, do not have an incentive to implement simplified ones.” Or “Never pay for the complexity of presentation, when all you need is results.”By reading the book “Skin in the game” you become a lot more pragmatic and sceptical about naive and generalised statements. The curse of modernity is that we are increasingly populated by a class of people who are better at explaining than understanding, or better at explaining than doing. The book says that we should avoid taking advice from someone who gives advice for a living unless there is a penalty for their advice. “Beware of the person who gives advice telling you that a certain action on your part is good for you. While it is also good for him, while the harm to you doesn’t directly affect him.”Let me give you some further example. If you had a business and asked some of your friends or a business partners to create a marketing brochure, arrange the price which will have some variable part in it and will be directly dependent on the conversion rate. So let’s say you will pay one thousand dollars plus ten per cent of every sale over a thousand converting from the material. So the reason why you should do that was that you want him to have skin in the game. If you just pay him one thousand dollars straight, he doesn’t have any skin in the game. He will just get his money whether he does a good job, a bad job or whatever. Whereas, if you pay him a bonus based on how much money you make over one thousand dollars, he will get some serious skin in the game.I also have to say that the book is a kind of ranty. I’ve heard some opinions saying that his obsession with the superiority of practice over academics and theory is totally wrong. He reviles “intellectuals”, and thinkers while praising “doers” and men of practice. his skills in persuasion are also severely lacking. I think that in most situations first, we have an idea, a concept to be proven. The next step is execution. However, sometimes we don’t have tools to check the thesis as the risk is too great. We don’t have resources or we have some gaps in the whole equation to run it. Like in theoretical and experimental physicist. Theoretical physicists develop mathematical models while experimental physicists perform tests. He also uses a multitude of subterfuge and polemic to dismiss potential criticism. Yet, I think in many examples he fails to realise that this doesn’t make many of his arguments more right or less complete than they actually are.When I was reading the book I couldn’t agree with his polemics with Steven Pinker and his books. Especially... (if you like to read my full review please visit my blog https://leadersarereaders.blog/skin-i...)"
46,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1680974-alex-zakharov,5,"As expected, SITG is very good, it contains tighter versions of Taleb’s greatest hits as well as some new material.‘Intransigent minority’, ‘skin in the game’, and ‘intellectual yet idiot’ are all there of course, but we all read multiple pre-published versions of this material on medium, which dilutes the punch they would have otherwise undoubtedly delivered. If you are somehow unfamiliar with these ideas, then drop what you are doing and get the book right now.In SITG Taleb nicely rounds of and cleans up his ideas on rationality. Precise formulations and distinctions between pseudo-rationality of a belief vis-à-vis survival-driven rationality of an action are superb, and blow away similar but hand-wavy attempts such as “bounded rationality” (Herb Simon) and “metaphorical truths” (Weinstein brothers).On a related note I very much liked his take on religion as a transgenerational tail-risk management. I do buy that argument, but it still comes third after religion as a lubricant for cooperation (Yuval Harari), and an unavoidable search for meaning (John Gray). To the latter Taleb would reply that to search for meaning one needs to survive first, which is pretty fair. Ergodicity is finally explained well, better than in “Antifragile” or “Black Swan”. In full disclosure, I did have to reread the ergodic sources chapter in John Pierce’s first-rate “Introduction to Information Theory”, so maybe that sealed the deal.There were a couple of areas where Taleb didn’t quite bring it home. The genes and languages discussion was fumbled, I would stick with David Reich’s “Who We Are” instead. Reading about Yamnaya should cool one’s enthusiasm for cultural diffusion models, and suppress the urge to view human history as peace punctuated by wars.Finally, I was surprised by the careless treatment of local ethics and sacrifice for the collective. While I do subscribe to the necessity of local ethics, I was hoping for more rigor. Sure, “good fences make good neighbors” and all that, but even in the Shlomiya Bar-Yam’s eponymous paper, it is contingent on the group size and doesn’t apply when groups are “well-enough” mixed, so a general argument for necessity of locality doesn’t follow. The idea of sacrifice for the collective is even more tenuous, Taleb never moves past the normative injunction. Still, the book is top-notch, his best to date."
47,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32717494-venky,1,"1.	Two footnotes in this book reveal in stark detail the character (of a total lack of it) of the author. I have no choice but to reproduce the two obscene, insensitive and uncalled for footnotes as they appear in the book:•	Actually I usually joke that my death plus someone I don’t like surviving, such as the journalistic professor Steven Pinker, is worse than just my death;•	Just consider that: it is impossible for a billion people to sleep with Kim Kardashian (even her) ……Any author, whether he falls under the category of a universally acclaimed talent or is recognized as a self-proclaimed expert in his chosen field of expertise (such as Nicholas Nassim Taleb), who stoops to such despicable heights involving denigration of a woman’s character and bemoaning the survival of a fellow author does not deserve to get his books published;2.	This book is just Taleb’s vehicle for launching a diatribe against all with whose views he nurses an inexplicable grouse. The list of his damned is an illustrious who’s who including Nobel Laureates in Economics, Paul Krugman and Richard Thaler, the scientist Richard Dawkins, thinker, social scientist and eminent thinker – and Taleb’s pet peeve – Steven Pinker, and one of the greatest book critics ever – Michiko Kakutani of the New York Times. Taleb, with undisguised impunity, designates his avowed foes IYIs or “Intellectuals Yet Idiots”. In fact, going by recent unfortunate trends, all those disagreeing with Taleb’s ideas, howsoever outlandish or impractical are dubbed IYIs;3.	Taleb, with this book, proves that he is one of the most condescending, pompous and self-aggrandizing authors ever to have written a book, to the detriment of common sense and judiciousness. Just consider this passage from one of the Chapters in the book, “he (IYI)doesn’t use Yiddish words even when talking business; he studies grammar before speaking a language; he has a cousin who worked with someone who knows the Queen; he has never read Frédéric Dard, Libanius Antiochus, Michael Oakeshott, John Gray, Ammianus Marcellinus, Ibn Battuta, Saadia Gaon, or Joseph de Maistre; he has never gotten drunk with Russians; he never drinks to the point where he starts breaking glasses (or, preferably, chairs); he doesn’t even know the difference between Hecate and Hecuba (which in Brooklynese is “can’t tell sh**t from shinola”); he doesn’t know that there is no difference between “pseudointellectual” and “intellectual” in the absence of skin in the game; he has mentioned quantum mechanics at least twice in the past five years in conversations that had nothing to do with physics. The IYI likes to use buzzwords….” I GIVE UP!!!4.	Taleb, unwittingly and unknowingly (a shame for one who professes to predict events before they even occur), acknowledges his pitiful cowardice in a Chapter where he makes reference to the egregious and ultra-talented, late Susan Sontag. Having been humiliatingly snubbed by her in a social event, he goes on to list her supposed ‘foibles’ – after her demise. “No, she did not grow her own vegetables, it turned out. Two years later, I accidentally found her obituary (I waited a decade and a half before writing about the incident to avoid speaking ill of the departed). People in publishing were complaining about…….). An unmanly gesture for a man who bores his readers by gloating over his weightlifting abilities in every alternative page!5.	What about the book itself? Ah yes the bloody book. Surprisingly amongst all the books that have been authored by this irascible and intolerable character, this is the one which is most accessible, direct and logical, (when not dealing with personal rivalries, egotistical self-compliments, character assassinations, moral insinuations and the likes that is). The logic that a person must have a skin in the game before goading other to assume risks is a concept that warrants further examination and analysis (especially when one is dealing with investment bankers). A point to ponder from this book would be the following passage:“good rule for society is to oblige those who start in public office to pledge never subsequently to earn from the private sector more than a set amount; the rest should go to the taxpayer. This will ensure sincerity in, literally, “service”—where employees are supposedly underpaid because of their emotional reward from serving society”.6.	Taleb in fact might be an imbecile suffering from a bout of dementia as well. The proof of the pudding lies in the eating. So here goes: “The other customers seemed, as we say in Mediterranean languages, to have a cork plugged in their behind obstructing proper ventilation, causing the vapors to build on the inside of the gastrointestinal walls, leading to the irritable type of decorum you only notice in the educated semi-upper classes. I noted that, in addition to the plugged corks, all the men wore ties”. I rest my case.7.	The hypocrite that is Taleb, deceives himself with writing balderdash, gibberish and malarkey. For e.g. he professes that usage of harsh, uncomplimentary and abuse words on social media such as Twitter bears monument to the strength of an individual. Upon a review of “Antifragile”, his earlier book that was nonsense personified, when I expressed my feelings in the form of a splurge of unwelcome adjectives on Taleb’s Twitter handle, the fraud blocked me! So much for a man professing he virtues of antifragility and not being cowed down! Taleb is not only a synonym for hypocrisy but also a living testament of cowardice!To conclude, the image which I visualize of Taleb is that of a disgruntled, desolate, disheveled and dejected old man, bereft of friends, shorn of company, emptied of all beliefs, sitting in a dimly lit ramshackle corner, putting his pernicious and prejudiced thoughts to paper, knowing very well that all they represent is a load of bunkum and trash, but still gripped in an unfortunate fervor of pretentiousness, condescension, loathing and arrogance. While this visualization might yet be a mere figment of my imagination, I am not willing to bet that this would not materialize as a Black Swan event."
48,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2275270-hriday,4,"I waded into this book warily. NN Taleb was a personal favourite due to his ability to stand up to a large section of the establishment which does not practice what it preaches. Yet over the years his diatribes and jeers towards anyone who doesn’t agree with his world view was a bit jarring. Taleb is hailed by Manu Joseph ( Columnist at The Mint who wrote the amazing “Illicit happiness of other people”) among others.This book did not disappoint in terms of either, his acute insight or his acerbity. A very scholarly work, the book is meticulously researched with the author citing from texts in dead languages apart from much of ancient Greek and Roman wisdom. ( learning dead languages is a hobby of his).The book is all about having “Skin in the Game”. Skin in the Game refers to having something of your own at stake in every decision you take not merely “cheap tawk”. A good referent would be his reference to how builders of bridges in Roman times were made to stand under the bridge the first time a carriage passed over it. If they hadn’t done a good job of making it safe they would DIE. Taleb has used the same idea idea to excellently excoriate bankers in the past- who took no risks and awarded themselves the highest bonus payouts in 2008 during the subprime crisis. Here are some samples.“Bureaucracy is a construction by which a person is conveniently separated from the consequences of his or her actions.” “Scars signal skin in the game.”  “Alexander said that it was preferable to have an army of sheep led by a lion than an army of lions led by a sheep.” “A saying by the brothers Geoff and Vince Graham summarizes the ludicrousness of scale-free political universalism. I am, at the Fed level, libertarian; at the state level, Republican; at the local level, Democrat; and at the family and friends level, a socialist.” “You can tell if a discipline is BS if the degree depends severely on the prestige of the school granting it. I remember when I applied to MBA programs being told that anything outside the top ten or twenty would be a waste of time. On the other hand a degree in mathematics is much less dependent on the school (conditional on being above a certain level, so the heuristic would apply to the difference between top ten and top two thousand schools). The same applies to research papers. In math and physics, a result posted on the repository site arXiv (with a minimum hurdle) is fine. In low-quality fields like academic finance (where papers are usually some form of complicated storytelling), the “prestige” of the journal is the sole criterion.” “Don’t tell me what you think, tell me what you have in your portfolio.” “Having an assistant (except for the strictly necessary) removes your soul from the game.” “If your private life conflicts with your intellectual opinion, it cancels your intellectual ideas, not your private life.”“It is no secret that large corporations prefer people with families; those with downside risk are easier to own, particularly when they are choking under a large mortgage.”""Start by being warm, pleasant, & generous w/every person you meet; but if someone tries to exercise power over you, exercise power over him; & if he messes w/you, remember to keep messing w/him long after he has forgotten about it"".A large part of the book is dedicated to scorning the Intellectual Yet Idiot a person whose main skill is a capacity to pass exams written by people like them or to write papers read by people like them and who also have zero practical knowledge about how the world actually works. The author notes how IYI’s have promoted a fat free diet for thirty years and are now reversing their opinion. The IYI has also speaks of “equality of races” and “economic equality” while never having gone out for a drink with a minority cab driver. The IYI has attended more than one TED talk and has referred to “quantum mechanics” at least once in the past five years without knowing what it is about. “The IYI has been historically wrong about Stalinism, Maoism, GMO’s, Iraq, Syria, low carb diets, trans fats, stochastic equilibrium modelling, housing projects, election forecasting models… But he is convinced his correct position is right.There is a much longer list of colourful insults ( which are all right) for the academic establishment, rent seeking bureaucrats, Hilary Clinton lovers, GMO proponents, interventionists in medicine etc.I agree with Taleb on how much of academia today is about writing papers which impact very few and are read only by peers that too only when strictly necessary- In short as an exercise of self-aggrandisement. Taleb spurns awards quoting Wittgenstein where he says “Where there is competition there is no knowledge. In fact for Taleb the best sign that an author will last the test of time is that the author would NOT have won the Nobel prize. ( Very right. Have a look at the Nobel literature prize winners list for the past 100 years. You will recognize hardly 10 15 of them)The Book is self admittedly repetitive, quite tendentious and very poorly edited. After all Taleb insists that having a copy editor takes away skin in the game.Taleb is an audacious thinker in his having had the guts to rip into the very establishment which lauded him as a top thinker. The very establishment which runs on the “you scratch my back I will scratch your back” principle. Which holds conferences in five star resorts on “How Poverty can be reduced” and which pays mere lip service to liberal values while being extremely hypocritical in their personal lives.Taleb in short has skin in the game. For as he says, courage is the only virtue that cannot be faked."
49,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3067227-tally,3,"I really like some of the main ideas presented in this book, and I’m happy I read it. My main takeaway is that it is important for decision makers to have “skin in the game” for systems to function well. I also thought the author’s discussion of ethics was interesting. However, I thought the book lost focus as it went along, and the author’s condescending writing style became annoying, so I’m giving this book a 3. Still, I think I will check out some of Taleb’s other books because his ideas are useful and important. I would still recommend reading the first few chapters of this book. "
50,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18705047-mike-peleah,5,"""Skin in the Game"" is fourth book of Taleb's Incerto. This volume focuses on Asymmetries in a range of things, from politics, to religion, to GMO. The book presents insights in very readable way, combined with real stories and well peppered by Taleb's trademark arrogance. "
51,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,5,"Nassim Nicholas Taleb is the kind of writer who puts, on the dust jacket of his own book, a comment from someone on Twitter calling him an asshole. He is not, however, just a grumpy purveyor of rants. Even when it is full of things I agree with, a rant always leaves me irritable and simultaneously with the feeling that I have wasted my time reading it. Taleb, even when I disagree with him, always leaves me feeling that I have been helped to think more clearly about issues of fundamental importance, the kind of thing that philosophy ought to be about.For example, issues about what is risk. What is the difference between preparing for the unlikely and preparing for the (literally) unpredictable. What is the opposite of fragile (hint: not just robust). What all of these things have in common is:1) they relate to uncertainty2) they do not fall neatly anywhere along the conventional political axisOne frequent criticism of Taleb after one of his earlier books, ""The Black Swan"", was that he was full of criticism of established methodologies without saying enough about what to use instead. I think this was always a little unfair, but it is true that in previous books Taleb spent more time blasting away at the faults of established thinking in regards to fields like finance, the law, economic theory, and so forth. With ""Skin In The Game"", he spends more time being explicit about what we should be replacing the current economic and legal system with.Not that he neglects to call his intellectual opponents idiots. He does that as well.Whether or not this is a problem for you is basically a matter of whether you can ignore this. It does, occasionally, annoy me, even when I happen to agree with the underlying point he is making. Not everyone who is wrong about something, even an intellectual point about the nature of risk, is an idiot. In Taleb's eyes, though, people like Stephen Pinker or Paul Krugman are idiots. I may not agree with everything they say, but neither Pinker nor Krugman are idiots, and they are worth listening to.But, just when you think Taleb is too ranty and vehement to be worth reading, he makes a point like this:1) the nature of corrupt regimes is to try to insure a ""heads I win, tails you lose"" situation for themselves, where they are insulated from any bad outcomes. It is practically the definition of corrupt.2) but, the nature of human beings is that they are rarely if ever convinced to change their ways by words; they change their ways when their current ways blow up on them3) therefore, it is in the nature of corrupt regimes to undermine their own ability to learn when their system no longer matches the way the world works, and thus4) corrupt regimes will, eventually, blunder so badly as to blow themselves up (although unfortunately, if you are living under them or close to them, they may blow you up with it)This matches a lot of what I am learning about World War 1 recently. The biggest blunders were made by the monarchies, that were able to ignore the mismatch between their methods and the way the world worked. Not that the democracies didn't make plenty of blunders as well, but the democracies survived World War 1, and the monarchies didn't. Taleb's idea gives a good idea of the fundamental reason why, and he wasn't even using World War 1 as one of his examples. When the writer gives you an intellectual tool that makes sense of another topic, which he did not even tell you to use that tool on, it is a good sign that you have been handed something valuable.This kind of thing is why Taleb is worth reading. As the book title implies, the fundamental principle he advocates is ""skin in the game"", to insure good behavior. What galls him about the fact that the bankers who created the 2008 fiscal crisis were not punished for it, is that they DID profit from it first. By taking risks that most years pay off, but when they fail, do so massively, at a scale that threatens to wreck the entire fiscal system, they can do quite well for themselves, even in the long run. This is because, they have no ""skin in the game""; they are paid each year based on that year's results, and have no long term stake in the outcome.Similarly, the company that sells you a mortgage for a house three times as expensive as you can afford, with a balloon payment at the end that you will never be able to make, can sell your mortgage two months after you start payments on it. Even once it goes bust, there is no downside for the company that did it. They had no ""skin in the game"".Taleb's bluster does still get a bit ranty at times, but he is well worth reading, because in between the bluster and personal jabs, he makes good points that few if any others are making, about people who are among the most rich and powerful. His latest book is no exception. As he is fond of quoting: black beard (i.e. young man) listen to the logic, throw away the conclusion. Grizzled beard, listen to the logic and the conclusion. White beard, throw away the logic, listen to the conclusion.Taleb's beard, by the way, is grizzled. You can throw away the bluster. But keep the logic, and the conclusion."
52,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29908437-rt,4,"I am not big fan of Taleb's style but I pay huge respect to his orthogonality. Also, it's not so frequent when an author:(a) has something valuable to say (b) you get it frankly (c) it's falsifiable (id est capable of being tested (verified or falsified) by experiment or observation)Usually it's lack of either one or several items. The most interesting about this book is abundance of original ideas. That's why you've arrived. A book has high 0.34 highlights/pages ratio, which is relatively high. All in all Skin in the game is intellectually enriching, physically difficult (was glad on finish) and emotionally draining (ok, sometimes). If you also affected by form of this book try to read with finding your personal temporal antidote to the style of this 'defiant Eat-Med Greco-Phoenician pride in aging', as he calls himself. Now, some quotes for the aperitif (achtung, spoliers). Please note, that deep ideas are deliberately left out of the scope (minority rule, risk estimation, skin in the game, etc.).- Those who talk should do and only those who do should talk- People who see complicated solutions do not have an incentive to implement simplified ones.- This explains the more severe problems of landscaping and architecture: architects today build to impress other architects- Conventional educational system, made by dweebs for dweebs. Many kids would learn to love mathematics if they had some investment in it, and, more crucially, they would build an instinct to spot its misapplications- By regulating you are robbing people of freedom- Honor means that there are things you would do unconditionally, regardless of the consequences- By some mysterious mental mechanism, people fail to realize that the principal thing you can learn from a professor is how to be a professor—and the chief thing you can learn from, say, a life coach or inspirational speaker is how to become a life coach or inspirational speaker- Simply: if you can’t put your soul into something, give it up and leave that stuff to someone else.- The ethical is always more robust than the legal. Over time, it is the legal that should converge to the ethical, never the reverse.- Would you agree to deny the freedom of speech to every political party that has in its charter the banning the freedom of speech?- Freedom entails risks—real skin in the game. Freedom is never free.- You can define a free person precisely as someone whose fate is not centrally or directly dependent on peer assessment.- Macroeconomics, for instance, can be nonsense since it is easier to macrobull***t than microbull***t—nobody can tell if a theory really works- In any type of activity or business divorced from the direct filter of skin in the game, the great majority of people know the jargon, play the part, and are intimate with the cosmetic details, but are clueless about the subject (hi AI!)- Collectively society doesn’t advance with organized education, rather the reverse: the level of (formal) education in a country is the result of wealth.- If anything, being rich you need to hide your money if you want to have what I call friends. This may be known; what is less obvious is that you may also need to hide your erudition and learning. People can only be social friends if they don’t try to upstage or outsmart one another.- My lifetime motto is that mathematicians think in (well, precisely defined and mapped) objects and relations, jurists and legal thinkers in constructs, logicians in maximally abstract operators, and … fools in words. Two people can be using the same word, meaning different things, yet continue the conversation, which is fine for coffee, but not when making decisions, particularly policy decisions affecting others.- There are people who are atheists in actions, religious in words (most Orthodox and Catholic Christians) and others who are religious in actions, religious in words (Salafi Islamists and suicide bombers) but I know of nobody who is atheist in both actions and words, completely devoid of rituals, respect for the dead, and superstitions (say a belief in economics, or in the miraculous powers of the mighty state and its institutions).- The same applies to distortions of beliefs. Are visual deceits any different from leading someone to believe in Santa Claus, if it enhances his or her holiday aesthetic experience? No, unless it causes harm.- I have shown in Antifragile, the fragility of the system’s components (provided they are renewable and replaceable) is required to ensure the solidity of the system as a whole.Score: 4.49(9). P.S. If you find it difficult to cope with this one, try The Bed of Procrustes: Philosophical and Practical Aphorisms. It's much more accessible, significantly shorter and give you a taste of Taleb's way of thinking."

54,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27266416-thomas-achord,5,"This ranks among the more important books I have read. Taleb's work is an epistemic argument in favor of localist conservative socio-economics. His argument is that people without ""skin in the game"" - down-to-earth, real life, daily, hands-on, field knowledge - lack epistemic data to make even the most basic of decisions and predictions in life. Grandma's folk wisdom is more tested and more sound than the prolix theories of professor so-and-so or the economic machinations of distanced central planners. Further, those removed from the ""game"" are usually the ones posing as leaders, experts, or thought-leaders who tell the rest of us with actual skin in the game what to do, say, or think. The wealthy elite tweet from their gated communities about how local people need to be more welcoming and tolerant. The evangelintsia wag their fingers at the common church-goer for voting in their own interests and not according to some abstract, ill-defined system of theo-politics. Taleb goes at length to strip from authority all such classes of people from academics and trans-national elites to affluent urbanite civil servants and all virtue-signaling westerners. Those removed from the experience and consequences of common life have absolutely no understanding of the ""game"", the real world, the gritty, the unknown, the unideal, the ""other"", or as Taleb puts it - the Black Swan. They pay large sums of money to go visit the real man or woman, taking curious notes and returning to their enclaves. They live apart from reality but comment upon and rule over it. Why? Taleb is well-traveled among such circles and argues these elites have no epistemic clothes. Conservative books usually show how such elites are in positions that cause them not to care or be concerned with the local man, local interests, national heritage, cultural continuity, and so on. Taleb shows that such people are *epistemically* removed and barred from access to knowledge of such modes of life, and are thus disqualified from pontificating and ruling over them. This book should be required reading for a conservative political philosophy."
55,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6169728-max-nova,4,"Full review and highlights at https://books.max-nova.com/skin-in-the-gameTaleb strikes again with ""Skin in the Game"". This incendiary book is the source of his notorious ""Intellectual Yet Idiot"" essay, as well as several other fiery gems, such as ""How to Legally Own Another Person."" This book feels a bit more discombobulated than his previous works - it is really a collection of essays only mildly related to each other by the idea that fair exposure to downside risk is important for a well-functioning society. Yet his fresh, clear argumentation makes this book a joy to read. It's trademark Taleb with a pompous wit, brutal naming of names, and a profound breadth of source material. In fact, Taleb's arguments range so widely that I'm reluctant to accept that he's really qualified to weigh in on some of these topics (GMOs? Really?). Has he really discovered a universal law with such wide applicability? Who are you to question?? Do you even lift bro?!No one is safe from Taleb - be it Thomas Piketty (whose flood of data blinded him to ""the rise of what is called the knowledge economy"") or Barack Obama (who used office to enrich himself, accepting ""a sum of more than $40 million to write his memoirs""). Much of his ire is focused on the global policy elites and ""rich slaves"" who presume to have the rest of us shoulder all of the risks. One of his key policy recommendations is that:The way to make society more equal is by forcing (through skin in the game) the rich to be subjected to the risk of exiting from the 1 percent.Most of ""Skin in the Game"" felt like a straightforward (although a bit rebellious and very ""manly"") application of incentive theory with a dash of anecdotal spice. There wasn't much in here that surprised me, although I did love Taleb's quotes about the moral exploitability of family men. His take on economic mobility in the US vs. Europe was also news to me - I had no idea that ""more than half of all Americans will spend a year in the top 10 percent.""The ""science vs. scientism"" section of the book also caught my eye because of its relevance to my 2017 reading theme on ""The Integrity of Western Science."" Taleb historically has little respect for the ivory tower of academia, and he lays it on thick in this book, calling out entire fields (economics, social science, etc.) as ""charlatanic"" because of their disconnect from reality or consequences. He also condemns ""scientism"" which views science as a bunch of complicated models rather than a skeptical mindset. Speaking of skepticism, Taleb doesn't explicitly comment about climate science, but he does say:Take for now that forecasting, especially when done with “science,” is often the last refuge of the charlatan, and has been so since the beginning of times.Then Taleb starts to get into the philosophy of science. He doesn't have a very fair reading of Karl Popper (see ""Theory and Reality"" for a great intro to the philosophy of science) even though Popper's ideas about falsifiability are the intellectual precursors of Taleb's whole ""skin in the game"" schtick. Taleb also loses some points for his endorsement of the ""emergent behavior"" view - see Yudkovsky's thoughts on ""emergence"" in ""Rationality from AI to Zombies"".I also got a good chuckle out of Taleb's hat tip to the notorious anarchist David Graeber (see my review of his ""Debt: The First 5,000 Years"")."
56,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48992655-john-mihelic,2,"Iconoclasm Sells Books: The Writings of N. N. TalebThe story goes that Socrates was the wisest man in Athens, because only he admitted he knew nothing. Taleb is the Socratic inverse, because he believes that only he knows everything.I have a lot of feelings about Nassim Taleb, most of them not charitable. He’s got me blocked on social media for reasons unknown to me. He brags about liking to win, but that’s not a win.I actually dislike him so much that whatever value his ideas have are lost in the presentation. I dislike him so much when people I respect show their respect for Taleb, it doesn’t make me reassess Taleb, it makes me question those people. I have to ask, what is wrong with Branko Milanović, what is wrong with Miles Kimball. I dislike Taleb so much that I made a point of checking this book out of the library instead of spending my money and having some of that pass through to him.And it’s a shame. I really liked the Black Swan. It was smart and well-written and fun to read and taught me things I hadn’t thought about. The problem was that it was successful. So that gave Taleb the freedom to say no to his editors and just write and be arrogant. Antifragile was overwritten and under edited – oddly in that he decries people loading up books with more and more argument in this book (specifically here to attack Piketty). So instead of looking at each book as a distinct whole, at some point he decided that they were linked and gave them a name. This isn’t “In search of lost time,” Naseem. But I suppose you want it to be, flashing your erudition out there for your readers, posting polyglot sentences and footnoting them, bringing in obscure references and belittling those who would need to google what the heck he’s talking about.Because there’s the elephant in the room you have to talk about when you talk about Naseem Taleb. He has that sort of self-confidence that makes him think he’s above the social norms, like a Donald Trump or a school shooter. You can call him a bully or arrogant, but he likes that because he likes being confrontational. He is certain his worldview is correct, no matter how much it feels like some back-formed justification of who he already is.But he’s smart enough to know that foundation of rhetoric: audience matters. You write [infinitive] [noun]. Here I’m writing to persuade readers. I’m not sure who the audience for these books are. This one, to get to the point, is also overwritten – rambling and unfocused though it is only 250 pages. The weird thing is there is a 15-page technical appendix at the end that is written clearly and readably and void of the personal attacks that fill the rest of the book. Because he does hold grudges – against Stephen Pinker and Sam Harris and the Saudis – he rides these like horses that as a reader get tired. And then there’s the weird thing that he really wants to identify with the cultures to the west of his homeland. Though Lebanese Christian, Turkey is about as Asian as his referents are; Africa ends on the banks of the Nile.The shame is that there’s the seeds of an interesting book here. It just fails to grow."
57,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4756170-daniel,5,"Taleb is at it again: writing a great book while at the same time insulting almost everyone notable Skin in the game is important for us to judge whether. particular advice should be followed. Thus people with a reputation to uphold (professionals), people who risk their own money (business founders and hedge fund managers), people who risk their lives (firemen, police) should be given more credibility when they give advice. On the other hand, people with no skin in the game, or interventionistas, such as Presidents, all academics, psychologists, neuro-anything, cannot really be trusted because they have no stake in the outcome of their advice. Unlike real world people who understands reality, Taleb posited that those people were dangerous because they can literally blow up the system without understanding complex systems and tail risk. He also touched on symmetry of knowledge; if you don’t know who the sucker is, you are the sucker. Taleb particularly despise famous Nobel-prize winning economists, such as Stieglitz, Krugman, and behaviour scientists such as Richard Thaler, and historians such as Steven Pinker. The attacks were extremely personal and judgmental: he claimed that their work had lots of mistakes and none of them understood probability or statistics. Always ask whether the seller of things/ideas would benefit from our buying them. Taleb was very libertarian. He described academia as people forming a system in which they peer-review each other and attend conferences together. He despised Scientism, using pseudoscience or wrong science to solve any problem. He admired Warren Buffett: to make money, you need to survive first. So don’t get blown up by fat tail risks. The good thing about Taleb’s books is that only such an irreverent writer could write vehement attacks such as this. It provides a kind of healthy skepticism about new ideas, to force me to think much more critically. Also there were many truths in what he said, but most writers were just too polite to say it. "
58,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3363047-karel-baloun,3,"The top endorsement quotation on the top of the back cover, borrowed from twitter, proudly says that Taleb is “an asshole” who is right about important things. He’d be more effective, were he not proud of the fact that he writes like an asshole. The concepts of black swans and anti-fragility seem to me much more useful that the (pretty obvious) idea that the world would be more fair if incentives were more fairly aligned. For example, if rich people were made to take downside responsibility, they would lose less public money. But the point of being rich (for rich people) is that they insulate themselves from risk, and the society reflects this in countless ways, and probably always will.So, I’m not sure what Taleb’s purpose here is.. but if he writes as too much of an asshole, he can’t really persuade towards any social change, can he? In contrast, Reich or Pinketty both have approaches to their writing that are highly effective with public opinion. And I regret his tone even as I mostly agree with his anti-interventionist politics. (p8) But in a book with this many (somewhat randomly presented) opinions everyone will see some to hate.. for me his advocacy for walls around israel.So why is he an asshole? He is signaling freedom and competence! (P105). But to whom? Not to me, even as I see I used similar strategy somewhat. It can’t mask Trump who has taken it to the limit, so I think it has expired.In speaking of public image, this statement is bullshit: “The people you understand most easily or necessarily the bullshitters” (p158). Seems that he only knows the trading world, not for example the entrepreneur value creating world, and can’t acknowledge the ambiguity of his world not being the only one.Book 3 on the dominance genes, languages and religion is genuinely unique and interesting: genes stay in one place, language choice follows minority rule, and religions are driven by asymmetry in conversion rules. Especially true and relevant to the acceptance of intolerant Islam in the West. Unfortunately he ends it with completely faith based praise of the invisible hand and Hayek economics. (P92)Talib claims this books is about “justice, honor, and sacrifice” (p6) But none of his preceding foreshadowed examples really excited me as relevant to those lofty themes. Centrally he says that “skin in the game” is the difference between the “collective and individual”, that we can’t be a collective unless we have skin in the game. Certainly we are more aware of our potential losses or gains, but self sufficient individuals can still safely choose to be in a tight collective. Interdependence doesn’t require dependency or co-dependence.Taleb (and many others, including progressives and the 99%) feel enraged, but his prescription seems ... odd. To have only leaders with skin in the game, like engaged warlords... we don’t actually want risk takers, certainly the Chinese and Indians and Tanzanians and Mexicans don’t hope for that. Did the Brazilians and Phillipinos? Maybe..Also, contrary to Taleb’s fascile assertion, hedge fund managers don’t really go down with their ships. (p13). And interventionists (like Bolton) don’t “fail to learn”.. they are politically and financially rewarded for being wrong. Especially inappropriate is his analysis of Sharia law (p56) as a historical artifact, rather than as a sociological form of control by autocrats. He do better if you understood that economists like Bernanke and Greenspan are not idiots, but just paid shills working for their benefactors, just as typical “economics” is just a story to justify whatever the powerful want.You can’t quote Trump vindictively “the facts are facts, the news is fake”, without pointing out his constant other lies, or by disclosing some agenda At some level I do feel that Taleb is more realistic than me, in a world where Putin and MBS can kill journalists and Paris is full of street protests and the GOP covers Trumps crimes.. perhaps ideals are gone, not even viable in my bubble. I don’t want that, and I don’t want to grant that take on reality to Taleb. Isn’t it obvious that stable professionals who acknowledge they have a lot to lose would value risk management via Pinketty? (P135) Doesn’t make them at all wrong, but Taleb just disrespects their lack of bravery.Climate change is a perfect topic where Talib gets his messaging wrong (P181, though I needed to go to Google for context): he rails against unreliable models and says that accepting their fragility should make people be more proactive in preventing climate change, but That’s actually not how psychology works, and he just feeds the denier argument against the models. He’d be better off advocating for Climate by supporting acceptable parts of the model.Taleb is obviously smart, so I worry I’ve just settled into equally stubborn viewpoints at odds with his: that govt is necessary, that power has concentrated so skin in game is meaningless. We both like artisans and only smart regulation... who doesn’t! Yet undeniably Taleb has crossed the rubicon to old curmudgeon, disliking personal assistants, book reviewers, and textbooks. So unlike the first two in this famous series, this weaker conclusion to the self-declared trilogy earns no more than 3 stars, and I’d drop it to 2 except that I found zero actual factual errors, so have to acknowledge that he may be more right than I know.I did appreciate the reminder that Godel and Popper both Predicted the American problem: that a tolerant society must be in intolerant of intolerance. (p86)Taleb has the human-typical blind spot for himself, including the statement that learning Akkadian to read Hammurabi makes him have (even more than skin) soul in the game. (P42) I see no skin, and just angry gesticulating. He is well educated, especially in the Roman/Green/Hebrew classics and is obviously proud of himself for this.. he could make parallel cultural references to more accessible material, but perhaps feels that would reduce his gravitas. He is arrogantly proud of his mathematical record and proficiency, since it is the most precise language, and if people were smart enough to debate him speaking it, they would necessarily admit he is right. The arrogance is never veiled.I do appreciate his sardonic humor. “ consider that an evil person, say an economics professor” (p85)Taleb believes that he is a heroic skin in the game operator, Of the non-pretentious kind that he idolizes. I would love to know reasons why this might be true...He certainly isn’t right about all important things. His idea that “the Donald” looks incredible because he has skin in the game, is ridiculous. All his life he never has, he still refuses to take responsibility, and his base doesn’t care; a more simple explanation is that they just want to play on the winning team. As in chapter 6, from page 123, I find abhorrent that he believes the repudiation of professionals and exports by the writing masses somehow validates his beliefs."

But not only that, he basically snubs the whole discipline of psychology (possibly even Daniel Kahneman's prospect theory) when it comes to rationality and risk-taking. Now, as a long-term believer in psychology as a scientific endeavor, I was in for quite a bit of shock and fascination. Recently I've had doubts about the results of learning science (a branch of psychology), which simplifies things a little too much for good application in daily life. Take, for example, retention and rereading. It's been shown through experiments that rereading doesn't really help with retention. OK, but the experiments miss whole dimensions of learning in the real world: does the material have depth? Is it interesting (better: fascinating) to the reader? Is it something the reader is encountering for the first time, or is the reader familiar with the material somewhat? And is there anything at stake (skin in the game) for the learners/participants?Anyways, though fragmentary (probably b/c Taleb wrote it bottom-up style, writing what came to his mind and stopping when he got bored), the book is awesome. Made me want to learn math again so I can understand the technical notes and the math behind it all."

Taleb is indeed an interesting thinker, but many of his overly-enthusiastic fans who seem to worship him like a perfect demigod are like those people who proclaim a certain food/destination/movie/whatever is the greatest just because it is non-mainstream and provocative-for-the-sake-of-being-provocative and novel-for-the-sake-of-being-novel.

66,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15251834-camille-mccarthy,4," Definitely one of Taleb's better books, because I think he explains the premise pretty well: skin in the game is a huge indicator of risk, symmetry, and competence. This concept really resonated with me, especially since he talks a lot about the ""interventionistas"" who promote interventions in foreign countries to ""promote democracy"" and then don't have to pay any price when those interventions go horribly wrong and end up leading to things like slave markets in modern Libya. This was especially timely given the current situation in Venezuela, where the US is backing a coup against a democratically-elected president of a sovereign nation.  Of all the pro-capitalists out there, he is definitely one of my favorites; I only wish he would use his enormous intellect to go beyond the limits of that worn-out system. Skin in the game is precisely why co-operatively owned businesses tend to do better than traditional models of businesses, and why people such as myself believe that a society based on mutual aid has a higher probability of working out than depending on the benevolence of a handful of out-of-touch billionaires to make good decisions for the rest of us. His examples are (generally) good illustrations of the importance of having ""skin in the game"" to make good decisions, but I think he could take this concept a lot further if he went beyond capitalism's logic.  One thing I take particular issue with is his concept of ""inequality"" - he claims that inequality isn't a huge problem because those at the top tend to rotate, so that a majority of Americans will be part of the top 20% of income at some point in their lifetimes. This, to me, does not mean that inequality is not a problem, because even if the top earners are taking turns and then falling back down the economic ladder, the fact that CEOs of major companies are making hundreds of times the amounts of the average worker and that inequality has reached levels worse than right before the Great Depression are a more concerning reality. It doesn't matter to you that you have a high likelihood of being part of that elite group at some point in your lifetime, if you don't know where your next meal is coming from and you can't afford the life-saving medical treatment that might allow you to live long enough to have the possibility of being in that top tier of earners. As Taleb says elsewhere in the book, the number one goal is survival, and the levels of inequality today make survival extremely difficult for those at the bottom.  I admire Taleb for the unpopular stances he has taken, especially speaking out about the dangers of Genetically Modified Organisms and his unabashed reverence for Ralph Nader, one of my own heroes. This book was interesting, entertaining, and had a strong premise; I don't agree with everything he says, but it is definitely worth a read, along with ""Black Swan."" "
67,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8331026-antti-v-rt,1,"Nassim Taleb has a reputation of being somewhat of an asshole on Twitter, but at the same time he's invented/popularized some very useful concepts, like black swans and antifragility. I've never read any of his books, but decided to try his newest publication about how people who take personal risks can achieve much more than those who don't. There were some insights, but nothing major. The best of the insights was ""minority rule"": how a small inflexible minority can affect the whole nation's choices, if they have no equally inflexible opposition: it's easier to make all your soft drinks kosher or GMO-free, since Jews or anti-GMO people won't touch your products otherwise, but no one declines to drink kosher/non-GMO pop. What this book mainly convinced me of, however, was that Taleb is, indeed, quite an asshole. The whole book felt like a bunch of extended Twitter threads about various subjects, whose main point was to badmouth other writers (mainly Steven Pinker) and boast how Taleb is right about everything, no matter what the subject. Indeed, Taleb seems to be the world's leading expert on sociology, history, economics and biology, at least if you take his claims at face value.It doesn't help that the book is extremely incoherent. Taleb says that the way he treats people rudely on Twitter proves how he's free and his ideas are so good he doesn't need to follow social niceties. 50 pages later he recalls how Susan Sontag didn't shake his hand because he worked as a trader - and this proves that Sontag is a shallow person who doesn't even give basic respect for other people. So which is it: is rudeness the sign of freedom and brilliance or shallowness and pettiness? And that's not an isolated example, either: the whole book is like that. It's full of self-serving boasting and vicious attacts on other (better) writers. This is a work of a mean-spirited, bitter man, and not really worth of my time.DNF at 80%, and I kinda regret reading that far."

Even if you dislike Taleb as a person, I happen to like him, you should offer a charitable look at his ideas and judge them by their rigor, and not “shoot the messenger.” I realize this is book 5 of his Incerto series, but toward the end he acknowledges each book is essentially standalone and can be read and accessed at any time interchangeably. I liked his constant reference to other Incerto books as it further enticed me to read them.

But I didn’t really like the style of the book. I felt he was labouring the point. I felt the author tries too hard to show how smart he is, quoting many different people and examples throughout human civilisation, and how many other people are wrong. It does feel like a rant sometimes. He touches on a few things that are currently happening in society, but in my view, he could have been far more direct and precise. There are a lot of hot topics he could have addressed with more depth instead of staying in the periphery. I would have given 3.5 stars if possible. Still a good book though."

72,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3958765-craig-jaquish,4,"If it isn’t clear why an entire book should be devoted to the importance of having skin in the game it’s probably owing to an overheavy stress on incentives—which are important but at the same time fairly well understood and often already adequately structured. Taleb’s mission is to draw attention to the increasing prevalence of incentive without proportional disincentive whereby bureaucrats, administrative types, policy makers, politicians, professional opiners, and certain classes of academics (IYIs—“intellectual yet idiot”) reap all of the upsides from their actions while downside accrues to an otherwise unaware public. This is the prime asymmetry of the subtitle.And of course this problem is rife in Taleb’s perennial target, the financial sector, and in Skin in the Game this asymmetrical payoff structure goes by the name of the “Bob Rubin Trade” after the former Secretary of the US Treasury who received $120M in compensation from Citibank in the years building to 2008. “When the bank, literally insolvent, was rescued by the taxpayer, he didn’t write any check—he invoked uncertainty as an excuse. Heads he wins, tails he shouts ‘Black Swan.’” Taleb highlights the irony of the popularization of his own term where black swans are (mis)understood simply as large-scale, rare, unpredictable events, whereas Taleb’s real point has been that, rare or not, when these “fat tail” events do come about their magnitude—therefore impact—is greater than all the more chartable occurrences that preceded them. Knowing this it’s best to arrange the system to be antifragile to them. It’s this antifragility step that our Bob Rubins so cheerfully ignore as they mask risk and shuttle it off to other sectors (and ultimately to the taxpayer).While casting aspersions at big finance entails little risk to reputation, Bob Rubin simply provides a readymade asymmetric-risk template for Taleb to apply where needed throughout the rest of the book. And he applies it liberally. Whatever the class of reader, there’s probably at least be some line or to rally heartily around in endorsement of the author’s irascible confidence, but Taleb does seem to be more and more entrenched in his own thoughts over the years and for some much more than this will be hard to take. I don’t see Skin in the Game losing Taleb many of the already converted, but with this book he may start to peel off certain members of that audience who follow him more from afar. But while he speaks in absolutes, Taleb thinks in heuristics, and heuristically is probably the way the reader should think about Taleb.Taleb remarks that each of his books finds its seed in the book prior, and the importance of having skin in the game, of more symmetrical payoff schemes, builds in many ways on Antifragile. Skin in the game is the (evolutionary) filtering mechanism that ensures antifragility. The basic illustration from the book is that the highways aren’t packed with awful drivers because the risk such drivers impose is imposed symmetrically on themselves. They’re therefore quickly weeded from the highways through accidents and license revocation. Likewise, it doesn’t take long to discover that you’ve hired an incompetent plumber or an incompetent dentist.Taleb explains, on the other hand, that for a variety of other professionals skin has been removed from the game. In centuries past warlords—while we might withhold our admiration—put their own lives on the line in the thick of battle. Compare this with the situation today where nations are sent to war by professional policy makers and members of various think tanks, none of whom will be within anything close to dangerous proximity of the battlefield, let alone leading the charge. Skin exits the game partly through diffusion, through ever lengthening of chains of command—cutting off modes of action from critical local knowledge that otherwise might guide (or temper) it. It’s also lost in the glut of metrics people are judged by, metrics which can be gamed. The metrics are incongruent to the risks, and they don’t account for fat tail events, yet it’s the metrics that we optimize for. And then, as in the case with professional academics like economists and psychologists, merit and evaluation is a completely circular process. It’s all peer-review. They’re not judged by the success of their models; rather, they (as a class) judge themselves on self-dictated metrics. Meanwhile “cosmetic” complexity masks how little substance individual publications truly contain. As compared with the plumber or the dentist, an economist could make an entire career on incompetence without ever being discovered. You may not be prepared to cast your critical net over this section of the academic world so thoroughly as Taleb, but it is a strange thought.The solutions to the above lie in making knowledge and decision making more local—localized to the point where those with downside are those deciding whether or not to take on the risk. At a certain level of locality there’s no place to hide the risk. And failure-as-filter should be unencumbered in execution; otherwise bad strategies aren’t weeded out, and the collective loses the opportunity to learn. Those who don’t have a stake shouldn’t have a say. In one sense simplicity is the guiding principle, but simplicity can be distilled into something slightly more functionally actionable, (going back at least to Antifragile) Taleb’s via negative principle of action, that is, by removal. Learning by removal is the antidote to excess (counterproductive) complexity.Where metrics are concerned, the only one Taleb is prepared to accept is survival. Removal is part of his proposed skin-in-the-game filtering mechanism. But when he speaks of survival he doesn’t evoke it on the scale of the individual (as misperceived in some of the reviews I’ve read). Survival, for Taleb, is a function of time (resurrected from Antifragile, this is the Lindy effect). Some things that seem true in the present will be shown false (and vice versa) as time subjects such propositions to its trials. Where the impossibility of a scientific experimental set-up precludes Popperian falsification, the passage of time will be the ultimate falsifier. In the short term not enough time passes for individuals to evaluate each other’s efforts. And no metric will make a shortcut out of this necessary wait. Only by this mechanism systems learn. And the system that doesn’t learn becomes systemically risky/fragile. To bring it back to the lessons of Antifragile, the forest which is cleared of brush to prevent the minor and periodic purge of forest fire will experience rarer but far more devastating and far less manageable conflagrations. Skin in the game ensures removal.Survival is also the only definition Taleb will accept for rationality. He’s quick to identify people he’s pegged as BSers. The book is full of such examples (e.g. Bob Rubin), but from what I’ve noticed Steven Pinker is the one that people have really latched onto as the target of their indignation against Taleb in his practice of naming names, the person people think Taleb has really mischaracterized. While remaining agnostic to the public debate and whether or not Taleb is being unfair, there’s a rationale in his denunciation which is coherent with his overall thesis. (You can look into it yourself and judge whether or not he could have jabbed harder or employed more tact.)As far as I’ve seen Taleb hasn’t come out and said, “This part of Pinker’s argument is worthwhile but then here’s the problematic part.” It’s a complete denunciation. But Taleb’s personality and philosophy don’t permit gradations concerning “bull***t vendors [Taleb’s asterisks]”—a single indiscretion taints an entire career. Taleb doesn’t care how much risk you take on. In fact he encourages you to take on as much as possible provided that you don’t transfer downside to others. And if others have downside you must have just as much or more. The second provision is that the risk you take must be a local risk—it must not scale. Taleb takes odds with Pinker’s 
The Better Angels of Our Nature
 in which Pinker generally shows through discussion revolving around a sequence of graphs that violence has been on a steady decline in whatever way you care to characterize it for as long as we’ve been keeping track of it—actually since even before we started tracking. But what’s problematic according to Taleb’s framework isn’t that shootings, knifings, homicides, rapes, beatings, lynchings, whatever have been forever declining. Such localized manifestations of violence could never scale anywhere close to the point of systemic peril. What gets Taleb going is that Pinker also claims that death from war is on a likewise steady decline, and he takes Pinker to extrapolate from localized forms of violence to systemic modes of destruction such as nuclear war, biological attacks, etc., apparently failing to recognize the asymmetry in the scaling of destruction. Various WMD in the Taleb program equate to a black swan, fat tail event. It doesn’t matter if systemic annihilation occurs only once every n years so long as the probability of n is greater than zero. And here is where he’d evaluate Pinker as a menace and not simply a buffoon. He takes Pinker to be aggravating the possibility of systemic collapse by treating modes of mass destruction as scaling up and down as would stabbings when instead we should be working to make ourselves antifragile to any systemic danger with more than non-zero risk.(This is the simplified breakdown. I haven’t followed too closely, but Taleb apparently does take odds with Pinker’s actual numbers and not just his extrapolations, claiming that the death toll enumerated in Better Angels is underestimated. Then there’s also the fact that Pinker with his abundance of graphs has offended Taleb’s aesthetic via the sin of cosmetic complexity (i.e., “scientism”)—plus Pinker didn’t spend a decade or two as an entrepreneur or a trader first before migrating into academia. Anyway if you want the backstory here’s Pinker’s response and here’s a PDF containing both Taleb’s initial paper plus response to Pinker’s response. And then another from Taleb. There’s apparently much more back-and-forth between the two on twitter and elsewhere, but this seems to be the most formal aspect of the interchange.) Extending the survival metric out to even longer time horizons, it’s misleading to say that time (Lindy) reveals what’s true and false so much as what’s adaptive and maladaptive. From this angle Taleb approaches religion, positing that religion is more crucially an adaptive set of codified actions more than it is a set true or false beliefs. He goes as far as to doubt that “decorative” and “functional” beliefs can be ultimately distinguished. The treatment in the book ranges well beyond this, but maybe it’s of interest to note that Taleb himself is a practicing (as far as I could tell) Greek Orthodox Christian, so this discussion arrives from a different angle than those accompanied by strings of atheistic merelys. To pay a complement, the book in general and in this section in particular bears the weight of millennia without tedium and without coming down too harshly on any one side (the exception being Islam in its Salafi strain—this gets into Taleb’s minority rule, which plays a critical role, but it’s too much to get into here). “[R]eligion exists to enforce tail risk management across generations, as its binary and unconditional rules are easy to teach and enforce. We have survived in spite of tail risks; our survival cannot be that random.”How ultimately does a society ensure itself of maximal symmetry? The solutions are both normative and structural/legal. Taleb does like the federated model of the United States although he’d like decision making to take place at an even more local level (in Antifragile he touts the Swiss canton model). There’s been much debate over inequality in the last few years. Taleb points out that what people care about isn’t that people get rich but whether they got rich with the chance of going broke in the process, and that those who are already rich have downward mobility proportionate to the upward mobility everyone else aspires to. “You do not create dynamic equality just by raising the level of those at the bottom, but rather by making the rich rotate—or by forcing people to incur the possibility of creating an opening.” He argues (here setting Picketty in his sights) that economists studying inequality make the mistake of studying income and wealth distribution snapshots when they should be logging the churn in these metrics over time:Consider that about 10 percent of Americans will spend at least a year in the top 1 percent, and more than half of all Americans will spend a year in the top 10 percent. This is visibly not the same for the more static—but nominally more equal—Europe. For instance, only 10 percent of the wealthiest five hundred American people or dynasties were so thirty years ago; more than 60 percent on the French list are heirs and a third of the richest Europeans were the richest centuries ago. In Florence, it was just revealed that things are even worse: the same handful of families have kept the wealth for five centuries.Systemic versus non-systemic risk follows a problem Taleb sets up of going to the casino where if a hundred people go to the casino and the twenty-eighth person goes bust it doesn’t affect the twenty-ninth person. If one person visits the casino a hundred days in a row and goes bust on the twenty-eighth day there’ll be no day twenty-nine. The latter structure, where ruin entails systemic ruin, is where Taleb advocates for the precautionary principle. These are the scenarios that require government regulation. You don’t want preemptive regulation where risk isn’t systemic because here you stifle the benefits of risk taking and you shut off the learning/filtering mechanism of having skin in the game. For these more localized scenarios you permit risk, and because you can isolate who’s at fault when things go wrong, you arbitrate with tort law.Finally, Taleb promotes an ideal of courage—“the only virtue you cannot fake”—whereby you shoulder the downside of others for the benefit of the larger group. Skin in the Game’s dedicatees are Ralph Nader, who stood up to big corporate interests, and Ron Paul, who stands against big government. They’ve stood up for others, imperiling their personal reputations as targets of smear campaigns by those they speak out against.This is the inspiration for Taleb’s gruff style. If you find Taleb’s style a little too gruff, remember, he’s doing this all for you! Naming names, etc.: this is Taleb putting his skin in the game. He notes that “the highest form of virtue is unpopular. This does not mean that virtue is inherently unpopular, or correlates with unpopularity, only that unpopular acts signal some risk taking and genuine behavior.” The only concern might be that less careful readers will miss the important point that Taleb is putting his reputation on the line by speaking out against Monsanto and cowardly banking practices and think that all that’s required for skin in the game is a lot of brash talk and a few sets of deadlifts. The less than careful critic will make the same omission and fret about a crowd of Talebites who think that all that’s required for skin in the game is a lot of brash talk and a few sets of deadlifts. But there’s more to it than that, and both camps should be mindful that “Some people only express their opinions as part of mob shaming, when it is safe to do so, and, in the bargain, think that they are displaying virtue. This is not virtue but vice, a mixture of bullying and cowardice.” There’s only one Nassim Taleb and you do not get Taleb by focusing on cosmetic Taleb.For those concerned that Taleb’s style will be just too grating or for those who want to get more from the book without a second reading, there are a couple of great Econtalk interviews he did with Russ Roberts about the book. They’re better than most of his other interviews because Roberts is a sympathetic interviewer who’s meanwhile good at prodding from the other side. He’s also someone Taleb is comfortable enough with for a discussion that gets beyond book tour roteness. The first episode is from when the book was still in manuscript form, and for Taleb fans there’s a lot of Taleb-on-Taleb kind of discussion in the second half of the interview. The second episode came out more recently with the publication of the book and covers ground not covered in the first.For those already anticipating the next book, he hints at the end of the second interview that it’ll be about something along the lines of interrogating what a unit is—exploring how it’s bounded from individual, to society, to ecosystem. Indeed you’ll find seeds of this discussion in Skin in the Game.And remember: “What can be phrased and expressed in a clear narrative that convinces suckers will be a sucker trap.”"

75,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5672051-brahm,3,"Antifragile > The Black Swan > Skin in the Game. The Goodreads averages seem to agree with this order; Skin in the Game is just not Taleb's best. It's still good, I still enjoyed it, and it's still classic Taleb: raging against economists, academics, and Steven Pinker. He expands his derision-beam to a couple authors I've enjoyed, including Thomas Piketty and Richard H. Thaler. That's OK, it wouldn't read like a NNT book if he wasn't positioning himself as the smartest human being to ever live. Taleb is no dummy, just arrogant and DNGAF about what we think. He has a good thesis in Skin in the Game, namely that asymmetries in risk exposure determine your ethical standing in a given situation. In this book NNT italicises these one-sentence sound bites so they are unmissable to the reader:Avoid taking advice from someone who gives advice for a living, unless there is a penalty for their advice.Don't tell me what you ""think"", just tell me what's in your portfolio.Those two examples are related to business and finance, but Taleb covers relationships, religion, and other situations with the concept. Why 3 stars? While the thesis felt new and I enjoyed his explorations of the topic, the whole thing somehow felt less coherent than previous books. The innumerous, italicised aphorisms felt a bit condescending to the reader; like a quick summary of an idea that could be fleshed out more. I blacked out my NNT-ism bingo card by the halfway point: describes self as erudite, Pinker-bashing, deadlifting reference (bonus: implies Steven Pinker doesn't even), describes self as a flâneur, etc. I would absolutely recommend Black Swan & Antifragile to those looking for an interesting challenge (you need to learn to love Taleb) and a lot of great ideas and modern philosophy/risk-mitigation, but Skin in the Game was just less exciting. Robyn said: ""you know how I know you weren't that into it? You weren't telling me something every other page"". Regardless... I will re-read this one again someday, as NNT books go down more smoothly and remain interesting the second time through."
76,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/901342-jacob,2,"With a book by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, you know what you are going to get: some good ideas worth thinking about, surrounded by a lot of personal opinion and written in a dense manner that takes time to sort through. Even though I know it's going to be a lot of work just to read and figure out what Taleb is saying, I'm interested enough in his ideas to do it. Even if communicated inefficiently and with a large helping of semi-relevant and odd ideas / stories (like Fat Tony) on the side, it's generally worth it. This book is less so. I'm giving it 2.5 stars and rounding it -- barely -- to 3.More than his previous books, this one feels like a vanity project. It's got less real discussion of Taleb's ideas and more angry screed against whomever he's got a personal grudge, like Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler and various people who have denigrated his work. The grudges are so thick, Taleb doesn't thoroughly explore his idea of ""skin in the game"" by even defining it much, let alone continuing with it in various topics to explore what conclusions we can draw. Thank goodness you can figure most of the gist out from the phrase itself.You can probably save yourself a read here with the summary that Taleb is saying people tend to make much worse decisions when they aren't closely connected to the consequences of the decisions they are making, when they aren't affected by negative consequences for being wrong. I saw that one year as a kid on a 50-mile hike, when our planned route ended up making us scale down a cliff. The person who planned the hike didn't go, and didn't notice the topographical lines get so close together in one spot that it only looked like there was one. I resolved never to go on a hike unless the person who planned it was going too :)Taleb deliberately chooses to discuss his topic in a different way from most books, by building up to it and not really telling us what the idea is about until the end. This is a terrible decision, because for most of the book we don't know what he's talking about except he's referring to it frequently and putting it off to the end, and by the end I found he'd forgotten to do what he planned, for there wasn't really a conclusive presentation of the idea itself, just meandering attempts at a summary of what he'd already said. Clearly, Taleb is not reading his own books to understand his ideas -- he doesn't have skin in this game, and it shows."
77,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69206773-shane-duquette,2,"This is a hard book to rate because it was quite enjoyable to read, thoroughly thought-provoking, and I think the idea that we should most trust the people with skin in the game is a good one.But the book is also absolutely packed full of bullshit. For instance, my area of expertise is weight training to gain muscle size and strength. When Nassim Taleb talks about weight training, he claims that barbells are the only effective way to gain size and strength, and he maligns the use of exercise machines. Now, don't get me wrong, I love barbells—and I train primarily with barbells myself—but there's no doubt that other types of free weights are just as effective. Dumbbells are just as good for building muscle, and in some cases better. Similarly, exercise machines are actually quite effective for stimulating muscle growth, and again, in some cases are better. For example, if we compare the barbell row against the Hammer Strength machine row, the machine row is better. It has a better strength curve. It challenges our muscles in a more stretched position. It yields more muscle size and strength. Going one level deeper, the leading hypertrophy researcher, Dr Brad Schoenfeld, frequently talks about how machines can be effective. Nassim Taleb says that these scientists have no idea what they're talking about because they don't actually have skin in the game. But that's wrong. Dr Schoenfeld is a former natural bodybuilder. He's been lifting weights for several decades. The biggest and strongest people in the world trust his findings. He absolutely has skin in the game. I'm not sure where this idea that researchers aren't personally invested in the fields that they study comes from.The other piece of bullshit that's obvious is the stuff about Steven Pinker. I was reading Steven Pinker right before reading this book, and the criticisms that Taleb makes about him are false. For instance, Steven Pinker argues that there are fewer wars right now, but that nuclear war could be absolutely catastrophic. Nassim Taleb then comes along and says that Steven Pinker is an idiot because, in reality, even though there are fewer wars right now, nuclear war would be catastrophic. But that's exactly what Pinker said. Did he not read the book?So of the things I'm familiar with, Taleb is incorrect. It makes me highly doubt the rest of the content. I'm sure there are some gems in here, but I don't know how I'm supposed to separate them from the bullshit."
78,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,4,"Skin in the Game is the fifth book in the Incerto series by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. Although it states that it is the fifth book, the author also mentions that he intended this to be somewhat of a standalone work as well. It is not necessary to have read the four other books in the Incerto series to understand what Taleb is talking about. I have read some of his other works, I think the only one I missed was The Bed of Procrustes. Without consulting my earlier reviews I believe I enjoyed his other works.Skin in the Game opens by telling you what Taleb means in the Prologue. People make better decisions when they have a stake in what is happening. Generally, there are three flaws in thinking that people have. The first is that they think in Statics and not Dynamics, the second is that they think in low dimensions, the third is that they think in terms of actions and not interactions. Taleb spends the rest of the book discussing how this applies in many different applications.Most of the book focuses on the asymmetry of choices. Taleb’s way to demonstrate this is to talk about a single person who only eats organic in a family of four. Assuming that the financial costs aren’t too great, it isn’t too much of a stretch to imagine that the entire family will subsist on organic food. Therefore, a vocal minority is more effective than a silent majority.I digress though. The book is made up of books and chapters. I don’t really understand this organizational technique, but it does flow quite well. I liked it, but would probably wait for a mass-market paperback if I wanted to buy it. Alternatively, I could always take it out from the Library again. It’s not like they have a policy against taking out a book again."
79,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15120733-onkar,4,"Skin in the Game is an interesting set of essays that touch aspects of philosophy, business, science, psychology, economics, politics and so on. Although the book is arranged in a bit haphazard way, the contents are quite solid. The author, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, is known for such accolades -The problem with Taleb is not that he's an asshole. He is an asshole. The problem with Taleb is that he is right.Taleb is indeed quite right in this book. Barring his pomposity, Taleb comes off as intelligent thinker who values real life experience over academical bullshit, scientific and witty. He has beef with a lot of people and he definitely doesn’t shy away from pulling punches. The core argument of the book is a problem that in today’s modern world, we have way too many people - so called “experts” - that are better at talking than doing, or that are better at explaining than understanding. They live in their echo chambers and are given the power to make critical decisions without having to face the consequences. The book talks about concepts like the Lindy Effect, the rule of minority, ergodicity, risk analysis, probability theory. My most favorite chapter is when Taleb slays the so called intellectuals and rips them to shreds. I could not agree with him more on that part. All those people who love to tell others how to think, how to talk, what to eat, who to vote for, who consider themselves the one and only repository of truth must read this book. This book will systematically offend the so called “opinion-makers” and the “intellectuals” of the world and that’s precisely why they should read it."
80,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22190081-federico-pistono,3,"Taleb is getting older.This, as with everything, has its upside. In some aspects he's becoming wiser, he takes less and less bullshit from people, and feels no obligation to restrain himself from speaking what he believes to be the truth.On the other hand, he's becoming crankier and less focused. While reading skin in the game, I sometimes had a feeling of sitting next to a modern day philosopher imparting valuable lessons and giving insights into the nature of complex systems and human behavior, only to experience a few seconds later the horror of being stuck in a car with an over-opinionated and foul-mouthed cab driver, offering bad and unsolicited advice, with no evidence to support it.There are many valuable concepts: Ergodicity, Lindy Effect, Skin In The Game, Intellectual Yet Idiot, the difference between science and scientism, and an impressive breath of knowledge of ancient customs, which challenge conventional wisdom and provide a much needed perspective, which is sorely missing from American culture (not too much in European/Graeco-Phoenician, perhaps because they have a habit of actually teaching history there).If you can get over the proverbial Talebian rants (which seems to increase exponentially with time), sift through the overly colloquial language–a breath of fresh air at first, stiff and unbreathable after 250 pages–you can extract real gems from this book."
81,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93631990-mila,3,"This is a bit of a strange and idiosyncratic book. I found myself entertained most of the time though, and find Taleb to be endearing like a Lebanese uncle at dinner who has a bunch of theories that, while I may find some crazy, some make me think a little bit. Some stuff in here is genuinely thought provoking. It resembles a stream of consciousness, but it’s still coherent. Some stuff is a bit contradictory. Taleb rightfully talks about how bad strawmen are, but tends to occasionally engage in them: his favourable citation of Dinesh D’Souza strawmanning a college student does not do him favours, because D’Souza is regularly regarded as a lunatic by most sane people. But I found that when Taleb said weird or contradictory things, they were often blips he’d quickly move on from, and they weren’t the focus of the book.Some things I learned from the book included theories of risk, some fascinating tidbits about ancient cultures and practices, and that Taleb *really* doesn’t like Steven Pinker. I found myself agreeing with Taleb about 50-60% of the time, and I think he is, in his own way, a gem that plays a valuable role in current discourses. I think he could probably benefit from being more open to criticism and less sure of himself, as he sometimes engages in behaviour he accuses the academics he despises of engaging in. But of course, that may make him lose some of his Lebanese uncle energy, which, like I said, is very endearing. "
82,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62539265-daniella-araujo,5,"A wonderful, insightful book. That is, if you can get past Mr. Taleb's harsh iconoclasm. I reckon it's truly his most personal work, and naturally, even more harsh and critical and disdainful as ever. Even though he disdains from erudite intellectuals, Mr. Taleb is a deeply read man. In fact, one of the joys of reading his books is the vast bibliography he suggests along the way. Of course there is a difference between him and the ordinary intellectual. And precisely that difference is the core topic of this title. I am rereading as soon as I can."
83,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33546841-andrew,1,"Bottom Line: I was not persuaded by the conclusions the author wanted me to draw. Naturally, when one has ""skin in the game"" there is different (mostly greater) interest in the result, however Taleb writes as if he lives in a world without empathy. In the end, Taleb attacks the idea of science, education, representative democracy, and the immense power of human organization. He would like us to believe that architects don't design buildings for actual usage, that government employees are soulless robots without their own concerns about success, security, family, and happiness, and that there is no value in studying history. Essentially, that human beings are base-level animals that don't understand a thing about their fellow humans. His evidence and anecdotes are half-developed, and he usually ends a chapter or section before any ideas are fully developed or a defend-able point has been made. Furthering the disconnected storytelling are the frequent references to his other books. The writing is obnoxious, with irrelevant or tangential stories (the David Blaine reference seems like an annoying name-drop than in service to any actual point), attempting to be too clever by half, and the italicized, underline-able bullet points remind me of a half-baked powerpoint presentation.

Instead it is a three star book that will soon be forgotten as lesser thinkers create better writing on the topic. The book will be, according to the rubric set by the author, a loser, held back in legacy by the author's childishness. Though, if we go with the rubric that what one does matters more than what one says, the author is not interested in legacy but in sparring with those over whom the sun rose today. Fair enough. I am interested in legacy and it frustrates me to see the author shoot himself in the foot.Is it worth reading?

This book is a continuation of the author's previous Anti-fragile where he claims that for systems to be anti-fragile, all the participants must have skin in the game, i.e; share the disincentives as well as the incentives, for no system will survive for long if some of the participants transfer their share of the risk to others, causing distrust and in the long term, collapsing the entire system. The point that most people do not get is that this is not a book about how to forecast or predict the world better, in some cases it is nigh on impossible. Humanity has since its early times developed heuristics to protect itself (at all scales: tribal, family and single) from small probability, high risk events. It is only when participants share disincentives will they develop a good set of heuristics to survive, for to do science and ""PROGRESS"", one has to first survive. "

If you are not, maybe you will find his style and arrogance insufferable. In any case, the book starts slow but gets increasingly better as it approaches the end (where the central chapters are).In my opinion, Taleb is one of the great thinkers of our time, and his work is provoking, entertaining and educating at the same time.It would be worth reading only for that - but the whole incerto is much more than just fun and games. it's education without the fluff."

This combination makes for interesting writing: there are many truisms in SITG, some meaningful nuggets of wisdom, and a lot of conjecture and name-calling toward people Taleb doesn't like.The best way to enjoy this book is to think of it like the ramblings of an old man you meet in the town square: let go of your expectation for sophistication, think hard about which portions contradict each other/themselves, and remember that he's seen a lot more of life than you have.

94,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27416361-nathan,2,"This is one of the harder books I have had to write a review for. It is ranty and not well written. I disagree with the author on many points he makes. Yet, despite these flaws there's something appealing to me about this book. I finished it, often I'll put something like this down and stop reading it.There is an interesting message in this book although you have to endure the difficult task of separating the message and the man (with his arrogant and polarizing attitude). The message is that our political and economic systems mainly lower risks for a minority to the detriment for the majority. He argues this is because people without skin in the game (consequences for their actions) run much of society and that without skin in the game we are more likely to do stupid things. Taleb argues for decentralization and local decision making where people have more tight consequences for their actions.This message is not easy to discern from the book. In fact, until reading another member's review of this book (here: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...), I don't think I explicitly got this message but implicitly that was what made the book interesting.The 2nd interesting part of this book is sometimes his style is entertaining (when you're not frustrated with him explaining things in obtuse ways). Taleb writes in a way that is entertaining if you like risk takers. He says things that are unorthodox, controversial and calls many people out by name calling them pseudoscientists and other names. I admit, something about this is fun. It is nice to have a different perspective on earnest intellectualism, in the sameway it is funny to watch South Park. Now, I don't think he's right in many cases in the book.There are some interesting principles in the book, but I can't defend any of them because he doesn't do so in a compelling way. At best this book is good original ideas to go research yourself more thoroughly than the author who suggested them. His core idea is that without ""skin in the game"", which he defines as both upside and downside consequences based on an action, people get stupid. Bankers can take risks, then get bailed out if the system collapses, for example. This is intrinsically interesting, but the more you think about it the less clear it is. I don't know how to apply a skin in the game test to a person or thing, it seems very partial. I partially have skin in X game rather than binary yes no.Other interesting ideas include the notion that an inflexible minority can dominate a system. Examples include how kosher labels exist on a large number of US products yet the kosher community is tiny. It is easier for someone to comply to this inflexible minority than to exclude them, or something close to that is his argument.The book is full of fun one liners you almost want to be true because they're unique and original: “Rationality is avoidance of systemic ruin,” he writes, claiming it is rational to be paranoid if the event has a chance, even if small, of killing/ruining you.“Do not pay attention to what people say, only what they do, and to how much of their necks they are putting on the line.” - this is a good quote in the mindset of the main idea, skin in the game.So where do I net out on this book? 2 stars. Interesting ideas need interesting arguments, not rants that are somewhat entertaining but make things harder to read. My biggest regret in reading this book is not knowing more math. Taleb repeatedly claims X person doesn't get math, but he does. Frankly I'm not able to discern, although his general point is that much of social science doesn't get probability, for reasons I don't fully comprehend. This is my beef with his book. He has interesting points but doesn't explain them in easy to comprehend ways. One more thing I do have to say before finishing: he doesn't have skin in the game in what he's writing. He describes himself as having f*** you money and then writes on topics he doesn't have major consequences in if people use the advice he gives. How can he not address that in his book? Seems like a huge oversight."
95,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70155380-jennifer-jank,2,"This book actually started off quite well. The first half of the book, where the author introduces the topic of ""skin in the game"" and some of the ideas that follow from that. And...then... in the second half, the book goes almost completely off the rails, sometimes to hilarious effect. He allows irrational prejudice against people like academics and journalists to blind him to reality.Some of the good ideas in the book include avoiding activities that have big downsides if you don't know what all the outcomes are. People's revealed preferences are in what they do, not what they say, as we all tell stories. You can't always scale from the particular to the general; for example, you can't observe a trader and then assume the market behaves as they do. Groups behave differently at different scale. What matters is what a person is afraid of losing, not what they have.And then the caboose gets loose. He claims that America is more equal than Europe because the rich supposedly rotate. He claims more than half of Americans will spend a year in the top 10% (in terms of wealth.) In order to be in the top 10%, as of 2016 you had to have $942,000. I have absolutely no idea how anyone could possibly think that half of Americans will have a million bucks in their bank account at some point.He complained about Barack Obama earning millions for his memoirs, self-righteously stating that it's unethical to use public office for enrichment. He wrote this in 2018, well after the current occupant of the Oval Office (OOO) made it VERY clear that he intended to profit from being the president - while he was actually IN OFFICE. He makes it obvious that he's a fan of the occupant.Because of his distaste for academics, he also claims that nothing in the social sciences/psychology is valid unless it was explored in ""the classics"". By which, of course, he means specific dead white men of whom he approves. One does wonder how kids should be taught things if academia is so bad. He gets upset because somebody mischaracterized his speech in a newspaper. Then he says journalism is illegitimate. Think there's a connection there? He quotes the current OOO approvingly about fake news. (If you quote the current OOO as an expert on...well, anything... you have gone disastrously wrong in your thinking.) Perhaps if he had read or consumed some actual journalism he would have discovered that the current OOO is known for lying, cheating consumers, cheating his contractors, refusing to pay people, etc. The author, despite all his talk on how bad talk is... apparently swallowed the current OOO's made-up story hook, line and sinker, refusing to look at what the developer actually did during his years as a businessman. Not to mention there is a LOT of information that journalists uncover that people find genuinely helpful. You know, like the Pentagon Papers, Watergate, little things like that. It was a journalist who broke the story about Harvey Weinstein's sexual harassment MO too.Further, he says ""Doing business will always help [mankind]."" Sounds cute, Ayn Rand, but tell that to all the miners' families who lost a loved one in the coal mines because their companies didn't follow safety procedures. Also, he thinks if there was no one in the State Department we'd have peace. I'll pause for your laugh of sheer incredulity. I mean, I can see a Rand-type holding this thought maybe five years ago. Again, this book was published in 2018. The OOO has decimated the State Department, and now we have a trade war with China, saber-rattling from NK and Iran and Russia, and Yemen is being destroyed. How's that peace going, champ?It's always amusing to read what believers think about atheism, and we'll check that box too. According to him, atheism is just like yoga and also if you have respect for the dead you're not an atheist. Um. Guess he didn't read the memo about atheists not believing in god? I don't know what he thinks atheists are. Probably a journalist wrote about it so he couldn't read it.And finally... I did mention it was kind of hilarious how bad this gets... he only likes mathematicians, logicians and legal thinkers because they don't think in words. Yes, the guy who just wrote an entire book of 250+ pages thinks words are terrible."
96,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53114948-n-perrin,5,"Taleb is probably one of the greatest figures in our time--a Toto who grabs the drapes in his teeth and reveals the man hiding behind the curtain. Why do journalists who are wrong in just about everything they predict (most recently in 2019 we've got the Trump-Russia conspiracy theory being debunked) but still coming back to work the next day to make an endless string of inaccurate analyses? Why do academics pontificate without consequence? Why do bankers gamble the wealth of others but receive rewards whether they win or lose? Why do policymakers, doctors, regulators, and other ""professional Brahmins"" make ludicrous decisions?Taleb's answer is that they have no skin in the game.Taleb argues that globalized modern society has become so egregiously bloated because it has developed systems to artificially prevent the failure of systems, individuals, or ideas that would have perished on their own. Big banks and gender studies should be free to die; that's the point of the free market after all. Economic and social inequality are only perpetuated by the upper caste members who implement policies in the name of equality and diversity but only result in bolstering their own power and status.Taleb believes it is unethical to seek reward when you have nothing to lose. Virtue signalling against the market system while working a corporate job at a Wework or waxing poetic on Marxist ideology from the safety of an academic armchair are among the greatest sins of today's generations. Pro-immigration elitsts who shut their own neighborhood gates to refugees cannot be taken seriously.Taleb offers a breath of fresh air in that he does not hesitate to lambast the financial establishment while at the same time puncturing the windy arguments of academics and journalists who complain about capitalism while engorging themselves on it philanthropic teats. Taleb points out several studies and observations that indicate that the working class has far fewer gripes about the wealthy than the urban literati who claim to advocate on the behalf of the working class. Taleb believes that the psychology of envy is fundamentally local. People in working class jobs are jealous of those in similar jobs. Journalists and academics are jealous of stock traders because they both earn their wealth and live in urban proximity to them. The former are insecure because their usefulness is predicated on systemic crutches and the cultic rituals of their spheres and not on any intrinsic value they bring to people's lives. (Note that Taleb is far more woke than Republican politicians who preach about the fiscal bankruptcy of the humanities; Taleb strongly believes in reading the classics but he believes the academic bastardization of the humanities makes people worse on the whole.) In other words, commerce is the most vile activity for today's left. It is okay to be wealthy when you have not worked to earn your money (Clinton), but when you work to earn your money and have become wealthy (Romney), you are an abomination.This book really pulls no punches, and that's what makes it so enjoyable. It would be stupid to try to pin Taleb as right or left; he is merely opposed to the hordes of self-righteous bureaucrats and elites who live without risk while playing with the welfare of other people's lives. Along with his humorous anecdotes and cute witticisms, it's a pretty good book."
97,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17187084-sean-goh,3,"Good ideas muddled by ungracious writing. Taleb wastes no time expounding on his philosophy of doers over talkers while squeezing in a stupendous amount of insults against a wide range of people (mostly economists, with some politicians). Still, there are insights to be had. It's almost as if as he is taking his own advice to be as disagreeable as possible, so that his ideas will be able to stand on their own, rather than due to the halo effect.___Do not mistake skin in the game as defined here and used in this book for just an incentive problem, just having a share of the benefits (as it is commonly understood in finance). No. It is about symmetry, more like having a share of the harm, paying a penalty if something goes wrong.Three flaws of interventionistas - thinking in statics, not dynamics (thinking beyond the first step), think in low, not high dimensions (cholesterol reading VS holistic health), and think in terms of actions, never interactions (feedback, collateral damage etc.).Bureaucracy is a construction by which a person is conveniently separated from the consequences of their actions. (a result of specialisation)Interventionistas do not learn because they are not the victims of their mistakes: the same mechanism of transferring risk also impedes learning.You will never fully convince someone that he is wrong; only reality can.The very idea behind the First Amendment in the US Constitution is to establish a silver rule-style symmetry: you can do what you want as long as you allow me to do the same. There is no democracy without such an unconditional symmetry in the rights to express yourself.When you are rewarded on perception, not results, you need to show sophistication.The mere presence of an assistant suspends your natural filtering - and its absence forces you to do only things you enjoy, and progressively steer your life that way. You want maximal free time, not maximal activity, and you can assess your own ""success"" according to such a metric. Otherwise you end up assisting your assistant, or being forced to explain how to do things, which requires more mental effort than doing the thing itself. Having an assistant removes your soul in the game.Entrepreneurs are heroes in our society, failing for the rest of us. But owing to funding and current VC mechanisms, many people mistaken for entrepreneurs fail to have true skin in the game. Their goal is just to cash out (get bought out, go public). The true value of the company, what it makes, and its long-term survival are of small relevance to them. This is a pure financing scheme, and is the equivalent of bringing great-looking and marketable children into the world with the sole aim of selling them at age four. We can easily identify such entrepreneurs by their ability to write a convincing business plan.Companies beyond the entrepreneur stage start to rot. One of the reasons corporations have the mortality of cancer patients is the assignment of time-define duties. Once you change assignment, or better yet, company, you can now say about the deep risks that emerge:""That's not my problem anymore.""Sympathy for all would be tyranny for thee, my good neighbour. - NietzcheThe persecution of Christians had vastly more to do with the intolerance of the Christians for the pantheon of local gods than the reverse. What we read is history written by the Christian side, not the Greco-Roman one. Religion spread by being uncompromising.Employees exist because they have significant skin in the game - and the risk is shared with them, enough risk for it to be a deterrent and a penalty for acts of undependability, such as failing to show up on time. You are buying dependability.Slave ownership by companies: the golden handcuffs of expat packages. By coddling the expat in luxury that can be removed at any time, the company ensures dependability.The risk management strategy of Roman families: employing a slave to be treasurer. Because one can inflict a much higher punishment on a slave than a free person.In an era with increasing specialisation, employees are even more necessary than before for some specific, delicate tasks. If you miss one step in the process, the entire business shuts down. Things appear to be running more efficiently, but errors are costlier (fragility increased).It is much easier to do business with the owner of the business, rather than an employee who may be gone in a year's time. Similarly it is easier to trust the word of an autocrat than a fragile elected official.To make ethical choices you cannot have dilemmas between the particular (friends, family) and the general.The illusion prevails that businesses work via business plans and science via funding. This is strictly not true: a business plan is a useful narrative to convince a sucker. For a real business (as opposed to a fund-raising scheme), business plans and funding work backwards. You don't create a firm by creating a firm [but by producing something of value].More than a third of our food supply is wasted, and the gains from simple improvement in distribution would far outweigh those from modification of supply. But logistics isn't as sexy/lucrative as GMOs.Poison is drunk from golden cups (the poor are spared from scamming through complications, only the rich are poisoned)The most interesting thing about the Assassins is that actual assassination was low on their agenda. They understood non-cheap messaging, preferring to own their enemies. The only enemy you cannot manipulate is a dead one.To change the behaviour of unethical and abusive persons without verbal threat, just take their picture. Just the act of taking their picture is similar to holding their lives in your hands and controlling their future behaviour thanks to your silence. They don't know what you can do with it and will live in a state of uncertainty.The mark of a charlatan is to defend their position or attack a critic by focusing on some  specific statement (what they said), rather than their exact position (what they meant). The latter requires a extensive grasp of the proposed idea. Note the same applies to religious texts, often extracted from their broader circumstances.Never engage in virtue signalling (appearances that do not reflect reality). Never engage in rent seeking (profit without value).Doing business will always help because it brings about economic activity without large-scale risky changes in the economy. Courage (risk taking) is the highest virtue.If you want peace, make people trade, as they have done for millienia. They will eventually be forced to work something out.Journalism is about events, not absence of events, and many historians and policy scholars are glorified journalists with high fact-checking standards who allow themselves to be a little boring in order to be taken seriously.Religions such as the Abrahamic ones evolved precisely by moving away from the literal. The literal doesn't leave any room for adaptation.If the Pope was in a life threatening situation, he would be rushed to the hospital, not the church.So we define atheism or secularism in deeds, by the distance between one's actions and those of a non-atheistic person for an equivalent situation, not his beliefs and other decorative and symbolic matters.Survival comes first, truth, understanding and science later.This explains supposedly irrational loss aversion, or overcompensating to avoid tail-end risks. The downside is too large to chance.Not everything that happens happens for a reason, but everything that survives survives for a reason. Rationality is risk management, avoidance of systemic ruin.Courage is when you sacrifice your own well-being for the sake of the survival of a layer higher than yours. Courage, according to the Greek ideal, is never a selfish action.In a strategy that entails ruin, benefits never offset risk of ruin. Playing Russian Roulette may have an instant expected return of 83.3%, but has a long-term expected return of death.Every single risk you take adds up to reduce your life expectancy."
98,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67627264-gapag,3,"I feel that this book, more than the other chapters of the Incerto series I read (all but Antifragile), dilutes its messages in invectives against the people Taleb does not like, which is amusing but forces me to get to know who these people are, to realize that eventually it matters very little for the points he wants to make.But I did not read Antifragile before SITG and probably this was a mistake, since there are references to it every now and then.Albeit being a pleasant read, the book falls short in its popularizing mission, at the point that I wonder if it is my mistake to think its purpose is to popularize science; then it is just a collection of essays that portrait the author's opinions, unfiltered, which may be incomprehensible for the layman.The extremely colloquial style to explain complicated concepts makes me think the author has indeed the intention of popularizing his field of research; I remember anyway more clearly the personal attacks/praises he inflicts/awards at a very high rate to existing personalities or archetypal beings than the concepts he introduces.What put me off the most anyway was the technical appendix that looks like the cut and paste from some of his research papers. That is, the chasm between the colloquial style of the book - and hence necessarily imprecise - and the inaccessibility of the appendix makes me wonder what kind of reader he and his collaborators had in mind. I am afraid this makes me an IYI (Intellectual Yet Idiot, as defined in this book). It looks like a book assembled in a hurry.I find it a nuisance that Taleb uses words and concepts before clearly defining them: for instance the concept of ergodicity is introduced in the last chapter, after being used several times in the previous chapters, even emphasizing its importance!I often agree with what Taleb says, insinuates and yells. There are two parts anyway on which I disagreed strongly -- at least the way I understood them, and I might be wrong since English is not my native language:1. In the paragraph ""Wolves among dogs"" in the book with the same name, Taleb says that if you use foul language on the internet, then you are competent. This is not true, not even the reverse. Foul language is certainly fun, but using it as an indicator of competence misses the point more than saying that if you are violent then you are strong.2. Deeper into Agency, chapter 11: Facta non Verba. I never liked any beatification of bullies. I understand the content of the chapter is to be interpreted and applied metaforically to some real life scenario that I will never live in and I suppose Taleb did, but yet I have a repulsion towards attributing virtue to terrorists or mobsters or finding inspiration in them (since the main ingredient of their meals is the skin of the others).Maybe I will read it again after reading Antifragile to see if my opinion changes."
99,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10708119-pieter,4,"I guess this is Mr Taleb’s fourth book I read. One will admit that the author has a special writing skill. He manages to bring daily life into his book, whether that involves financial markets, religion or any other topic as a matter of fact.Mr Taleb blaims some people for taking the easy way out by having no skin in the game. He focuses on journalists who just talk/ write and forecast, but turn out to be wrong in the end (about Brexit, Trump,…) and no one cares. Or bureaucrats that have a life long career with the state without having to bother about evaluations or customer focus. Or a centralised government that lacks democratic checks and balances. Or interventionist politicians (mainly in the US and Europe) who have little knowledge about the complexity of the Middle East and fewer military experience, but take action in Iraq, Syria and Libya to remove dictators and end up worse than before (Islamic State). He also makes fun of so-called intellectuals who do not show true intellect on political issues like stalinism (fellow travellers) or transfats. They aim for equality but tend to forget that given the ‘winner takes all’-economy Mediocristan favours the current rich and prevents new talent to reach the top (see also ‘Wealth, Poverty and Politics: An International Perspective’ by Thomas Sowell). Mr Taleb is particularly worried about these ‘intellectuals’ as they do not practise what they preach (‘class privilege’, but taking advantage of it or living in white neighbourhoods while favouring multiculturalism).The author prefers entrepreneurs or artisans who do have skin the game and can be held liable. Or even more so, saints and warriors and journalists who report fraud. They have soul in the game as they put skin in the game of others. That is called courage: “sacrifice your own well-being for the sake of the survival of a layer higher than ours (family, country, humanity)”. A virtue that resembles in politicians like Mr Ron Paul and Mr Ralph Nader challenging large corporations and bureaucrats.Mr Taleb recycles the Lindy effect which he already used in ‘Antifragile’: the life expectancy of a good, thought,… ages with time, conditional on survival. The Spanish king Alfonso X (‘The Wise’) advised the following: ‘burn old logs, drink old wine, read old books, keep old friends’. Wise words indeed!If the aim of reading a book is at least keep one thought to remember or to chew over, this was worth a read. One comment being a consultant myself. It is true that consultants have less skin in the game as they have no long term commitment. On the other hand, given the value of endorsements and the ‘no show, no pay’-principle, they have to focus on the long term and stay less likely at home due to sickness."
100,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8547839-david,5,"Brilliant book by a brilliant philosopher, from a New Wave of rightwing thinkers challenging the liberal consensus on controversial topics like inequality, colonialism, capitalism, etc.That said, very Boomer/gammon, from his dismissal of peer assessments (e.g. fora, conventions, awards/honours, peer-review) to his castigation of the ""prostitutionalization"" of academia and attacks on his more widely celebrated and well-renowned peers who he believes to be mathematically or logically illiterate (Steven Pinker and Thomas Piketty get a particular slating). Taleb regularly blurs the line between genuine criticism and satirical commentary: 'courses in universities, for which hard-working parents need to save over decades, easily degenerate into fashion. You work hard and save for your children to be taught a post-colonial study-oriented critique of quantum mechanics.' His juvenile acrimony makes the read more entertaining than it otherwise would be - he doesn't explain how the authors he criticises are wrong, just claims that they are (though he often provides citations to blog posts or books that explain his working/reasoning more thoroughly). One gets the sense that he resents those he attacks because of their greater celebrity and economic security, rather than simply because they may be wrong. His derisive term to describe what others like David Goodhart and Matthew Goodwin have called the ""liberal blob"" and ""the Brahmin Left"" - ""Idiots Yet Intellectuals"" - is profound and candid, but speaks to some kind of envy or resentment that other commentators don't have (for whatever reason).He defends against accusations that he is not arrogant or aloof, yet his qualifications for being a genuine intellectual include speaking Yiddish, getting drunk with Russians and cab drivers, and reading 'Frederic Dard, Libanius Antiochus, Michael Oakeshott, John Gray, Ammianus Marcellius, Ibn Battuta, Saadia Gaon or Joseph de Maitre' - embarrassingly obvious virtue signaling there, in order to demonstrate a false superiority over intellectuals he considers to be idiot liberal hypocrites.His concept of ""soul in the game"" or ""meraki"", which he expounds on a bit, is a rare spark of optimism in an otherwise cynical but fascinating book. His philosophy on political justice is also interesting and something that pretty much everyone would agree with - essentially ""clean up your own mess""/ ""if you break it, you buy it"" - those who are behind large ideological projects like military or economic interventions against foreign countries, or the ""war on drugs"", have to be held accountable for the fallout of such decisions by a fair tribunal. Those who call the shots should never be inured from the consequences of their actions."
101,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13638894-mark-mitchell,4,"The latest book in Nassim Nicholas Taleb's Incerto (as he calls the series that began with the Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets) is the most philosophical. While Taleb's seminal The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable explained the risks of fat-tailed probability distributions and the pragmatic Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder provided helpful heuristics for avoiding ruin and benefiting from chaos, Skin in the Game argues that a unifying principle underlies personal morality, organizational ethics, and fair societies: that people with upside benefit should also have downside risk.As an ancient example of the idea, Taleb reminds readers that Hammurabi's code states, among other things, that builders of faulty houses shall suffer punishment equivalent to the harm caused to the occupants of those houses. In a thoroughly modern context, he points out that the fact that CEOs do not, in many cases, suffer ""clawbacks"" when their risky bets do not pay off gives them an incentive to engage in actions that do not benefit their shareholders. Taleb argues that economic inequality is less important than economic mobility -- and that, in particular, the rich should have every opportunity to become significantly less wealthy. He even addresses the concept of rationality, claiming that even objectively false beliefs are rational if they lead to survival. Along the way, Taleb builds on points he has made earlier in the Incerto, including Lindy-ness (the tendency of non-perishable things to persist longer the longer they have been around), fat tails and Black Swans, medicine, and journalism.One of the deepest contributions of the book is the so-called Silver Rule, intended as a complement to the well-known Golden Rule that states that you should ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" Taleb's Silver Rule is that you should ""not do not unto others as you would not have them do unto you."" Taleb's point is that it is easier to know what is bad than what is good and that it is more important to avoid harm than to provide benefit.The reader most interested in ""getting ahead"" might do better to read Antifragile or The Black Swan, but those who want to live ethically and avoid traps of the modern world will enjoy Skin in the Game. As always, Taleb writes in his inimitable style. He does not mince words and is unafraid to disparage people (e.g., Robert Rubin orHillary Clinton) of whom he disapproves. (A sign of Taleb's eclecticism is that the book is dedicated to both libertarian Ron Paul and Green Party leader Ralph Nader.) All but those with the most extensive vocabularies will need a dictionary close at hand. But Taleb's writing is laced with dry humor, making the challenge enjoyable."
102,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40547985-uday-khanna,5,"Me: What's an Intellectual Yet Idiot?NNT: An IDIOTTaleb has done it again. After reading The Black Swan earlier this year(and loving it though not fully agreeing with it), I was very eager to get my hands on this one. Skin in the Game or SITG, surprisingly got a lot of publicity and I dont care if it was negative or positive, and infact the former makes me want to read Taleb's works even more. Well, with three long Prologues to introduce the readers to what was going to come next was very intuitive. His arguments feel real, and to readers who haven't read Taleb's work before you might be taken aback by the sheer intensity of his criticism, simply no BS counter-arguments to what he believes is right(and somewhat I do too), but trust me it's all worth it. All I can say is the INCERTO changes the way you THINK and for newbies this is all thats needed to stop reading this review and grab a copy(sorry for a poor attempt at humour).Okay here's why I'd recommend it:First, He has divided the book into 8 volumes or books that are built around a key idea or principle. Easy to read, hard to digest(at first), these principles. One of the principles that stood out for me was Asymmetry of Information, the uncertainty between the sides engaged in trade(one side has access to more information than the other). His examples are logical, and real ofcourse. Also, he answers a few questions around Inequality, which is like the most used buzz-word in terms of frequency (I think) by us millenials when ""trying' to discuss the free markets or capitalism. But what is Skin in the Game? The central Idea of the entire book, simply defined as having being exposed to the downside of an action as well, if that action rewards with you an upside. That I feel is missing, though not entirely, from every section that has an impact on our lives. Religion, Politics, Healthcare, Education, pretty much everything. The core concepts of the book are hard to forget(The Lindy effect for example) and worth their weight in gold(or BTC) when you realise that they are applicable in your life as well. I'd read this one again on any given day and that is why 5 big stars for the sixth one in INCERTO. "
103,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11673245-peter-gelfan,4,"The first back-cover quote chosen by the publisher or, more likely, by the author: “The problem with Taleb isn’t that he’s an asshole. He is an asshole. The problem with Taleb is that he is right.” The problem with this book is telling one from the other.When reading a novel or memoir, we know that whatever there is to learn from it will never (or should never) be put into words by a character or directly by the author. The same is true when talking to others: it’s hard to separate the useful facts from the bullshit, self-interest, vanity, insecurity, self-promotion, and self-delusion, and that becomes one’s task/game in the encounter. Though nonfiction often purports to deal in straightforward facts and propositions, it can’t help but bring these same personal dynamics into play, even if slick or painfully academic writing and clever editing can plaster them over like a real estate agent’s handyman. At least Taleb lets them all hang out. Perhaps he wants to put us through the deciphering process for our own benefit and/or his own. After all, one of his main themes is that we should give little credence to experts and pundits whether self-styled or lavishly credentialed.You see the picture he’s painting and it’s convincing. Then you follow his own advice—when looking at something convincing, you must ask yourself what is being hidden by this picture. You cheer his anti-snobbery and then realize he’s being downright snobbish about it.It’s refreshing, especially these days, to read a writer who does not push one way or another on the political spectrum. Doctrinarians of any stripe are likely to be offended by this book, for they deal in conviction and faith while Taleb deals in uncertainty. Things aren’t quite as simple as we would like to believe or others would like to con or lull us into believing. Uncertainty is the sea in which swim our bits of knowledge, belief, and faith, pulled this way and that by unseen tides and currents.Skin in the Game presents interesting ideas that can spur new ways of looking at things and dealing with them. Taleb is always entertaining, even in ways he probably didn’t plan."
104,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12036887-vikrant,4,"4/5 stars: Taleb irritated me right at the very beginning of the book, but I guess that was to be expected. He stands for everything that I consider an unsustainable tactic, and I seriously considered if I should stop reading the book. But one of my goals this year is to read more about things that I disagree with, and Taleb seemed like the way to go. But curiously, as I read more and more and despite disagreeing with him on dozens of things, I saw that we agree on many things too! I found that beautiful in a sense - the more I tried to get to know someone whom I completely disagree with, the more I found things that we can agree on.And hence I kept on reading. And then Taleb started impressing me with his knowledge and sheer brainpower, despite (and maybe because of) the way that he manipulated data to make his point seem like the only obvious conclusion (especially if you don't really think about it later). But once again, despite how irritating he is, he understands the world in a very different - and I daresay more accurately - way than I ever might. I have no doubt that he's a genius who is too egoistic to let anyone of any level of intellect ever let him show the error in his ways, but also one whom I would love to talk to, even though I know that all he'll do is be condescending. And that, my friends, is why a book that irritates you yet enlightens you is definitely worth 4 stars, and more importantly - why a book like that needs to be read; forget the irritation, forget the condescending attitude - if you can let him prate and learn from him despite his callous attitude, you'll be much stronger after the fact. I know most of you guys shall never read the book (or even this post till the end), but those of you who do - please consider reading the book, if only for a couple of lines that shall change how you see things forever :)"
105,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15571909-jim-mccormick,4,"This is an initial rewiew - there's a lot to digest. I am attempting independent research into human cognition in the context of technology, so my purpose is to find relevant insights and other avenues to explore. [original 16 Aug 2018, edited for clarity on 22 Aug 2018]My recollection of Black Swan is that there is indeed something important about tail probabilities in complex systems, but there wasn't much else there that I could follow, and I was mildly turned off by the author's ego, though I couldn't ignore the book because it seemed to get a lot of traction with people and organizations around me. An all or nothing leap into extremistan, by becoming an author, for instance, didn't feel like the right thing to do, but I did embrace the concept of tournament rules when they seemed prudent, though they were perceived by others as reckless. I also had the sense that much of what he had to say might not apply so well outside the world of the quant, but there was definitely something there.So, now we have this book by a guy with no skin in the game (assuming you bought the book before you read it, if it were that simple) telling us how people without skin in the game should just be subject to darwinian processes, and we should embrace the oldest ideas around because thay have been proven by the test of time. All wrapped up in a constant stream of 'anybody who doesn't see the beauty of these fine clothes are idiots, but you dear reader are certainly smart enough to understand.' At the same time, it sure is fun to just let loose with whatever you feel about ""interventionista's"" and ""psycholofasters"" and anyone else you want to catagorically dismiss. It's all just a sinister conspiracy anyway.But, if you enjoy that sort of thing, or can get past it, it's a pretty good book for two reasons I want to note here. First, there is a scientistic cultural tendency to either treat the world as if only phenomena that can be isolated for scientific confirmation matter, or to treat science as a specialized endeavor separate from the process of agency in the real world. Statistical hammer that he is, Taleb does a great job of calling attention to this. For what it's worth, I believe people are extraordinarily effective at human scales of complexity, which are qualitatively very different from the simple logic of something like the dictator game in a controlled experiment. If you want to call that skin in the game, then great. And, that same kind of extraordinary effectiveness is neccessary, at least for now, to objectively apply fundamental principles at such human scales, as opposed to something simpler, like a skyscraper or a language or a body of law. And when I say objectively, I mean in contrast to a kind of agency dominated by personal opinion and self interest (i.e., the second reason). In other words, people are messy, so people are tempted to engineer around the mess with inhuman solutions that can't live up to the vast potential of humans, who are really good at taking advantage of things that are less messy, which may be a reason why we suffer so many unintended consequences. I think Taleb is generally suspicious of easy answers, so I don't fault him for looking for an easy answer to that - it's just human nature.Second, we all need to get curuois about a vitally human (Trump-like?) method of discourse that appears to be very effective. In contrast to an academic synthesis of previously established antecedents stripped of any hint of normative intuition or originality, Taleb simply calls it like he sees it, employing framing and other biasing affects that have stood the test of time and been well characterized more recently by behavioral science. Ad hominem, hasty generalization, circular argument, appeal to authority, etc., why not put them all to work to the advantage of your client, like a winning lawyer? Seriously, to be effective at human scales of complexity I believe we need the full range of human expression, and I am very concerned that, as technology increases the complexity of the world, the previously mentioned temptation to simplify will lead to censorship and other ""negativa"" means to bound human behavior, rather than developing a culture where people are rewarded for seeing past local extrema to more symmetric and robust conclusions (maybe even contributing something positive to the world). That probably makes little sense to many of you, but I think it's deeply connected somehow to Taleb's focus on survival first and the many things he has to say about religion, though I'm still trying to connect the dots here. Like Taleb, I appeal to Hayek for help understanding how:""in the social field the erroneous belief that the exercise of some power would have beneficial consequences is likely to lead to a new power to coerce other men being conferred on some authority."" [I picked this quote but I think it related to what the book is saying. Taleb draws from other writings of Hayek.]but in the same way Hayek ignores the reality of such powers throughout history in his appeal to libertarian solutions, it seems that Taleb is overly focused on his own statistical methods as inscrutible justification for tearing down, overlooking the role of changing causalities (i.e., underlying discontinuities foundationally outside the domain of statistics that may create epicyclic complexities when one tries to wrap statistical methods around them) that people grasp intuitively, and he maybe sees only as sinister ergoducity.As far as the method of discourse -- and I want to lump his particular method into a big pot under the heading of ""fake news,"" along with biased exposure to real news, and such (not that there's anything wrong with that) -- the work of Leo Strauss is often caricatured to suggest raw democratic tendencies of the masses must be guarded against by an educated and paternalistic elite. Our founding fathers saw some of this, but it certainly isn't an either-or question, and we seem to be coming to crossroads. Taleb would be quick to label such elites as ""IYI"" (intellectual yet idiot), but the lubricating quality of his arguments give me pause as to his true sentiment. At the same time, I am concerned that his heavy reliance on classical fallacy, however well it may nudge and communicate, will impeach the valuable insights he brings towards navigating the techno-human condition (credit folks at ASU for the term)."

107,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/142949-heidi,3,"Each book is more caustic than the last. There are well thought out, well evidenced points - I particularly thought the importance of evaluating the evolved intelligence of practices over time in a complex system as opposed to the purely theoretical practices that may appear to be more rational without the more complex details of the system. Another point that I thought was interesting was his take on many of the economic/cost-benefit arguments that neglect the distinctions between individual vs collective interest and failure. Behavioral economists are one of the more repeated targets of his writing, but not the only. He's also very down on book reviewers - but the professionals more than the amateurs. He also refers frequently to the ""Bob Rubin Trade"" meaning something where you take the gains, but don't take the losses(he also uses Bob Rubin to describe the habits of traders of thinking that if you do well in 250 small transactions but build up a bigger risk of the 251st going catastrophically bad). The psychology realm, university professors and educational system and academics are also targets. Interesting, smart thoughts aggressively argued - the style was a little negative for me, but the arguments are definitely worth thinking about. "

He’s in his element here, ridiculing academics, sophists, politicians, and anyone else he perceives lacks “skin in the game.” He’s particularly fond of insulting the intelligence of economists (he basically accuses Thomas Picketty and Richard Thaler of being innumerate). He also makes his usual arguments for the importance of religious institutions, ritual and tribal loyalties - all while simultaneously labeling himself a libertarian (I guess he doesn’t like other people telling HIM what to do?). NNT is slightly less curmudgeonly than usual in this volume - but just barely. His overarching thesis - don’t trust anyone without “skin in the game” - could be quite persuasive, were it not for the sinking feeling that Taleb has a paucity “skin” in this game, aside from book sales. On the other hand, most of the people Taleb attacks have reputations to protect. Since Taleb cultivates a reputation as a crotchety gadfly, he stands to lose precious little “skin” by being wrong in any of his assertions. Most of his admirers will continue to stand by him regardless (as long as they get the rant they came for). Ultimately, the book is a bit angry and disjointed, but it was moderately entertaining, and even mildly thought provoking. "
109,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23986620-david-margetts,3,"Interesting, provoking and challenging book. The irony is that Taleb suggests to keep things simple and void complexity and yet writes a book that kept me heading for Google or a dictionary!! In essence the book speaks of accountability, responsibility, sacrifice, discipline and risk taking, lauding those who display such attributes and condemning, not unjustly, those who 'sit on the sidelines' and observe, comment and consult, rather than 'do'! Indeed he illustrates my so many have become disenchanted (Trump / Brexit) with the intelligentsia, experts and the 'elite' which he classes as I.Y.I's - Intellectual - Yet- Idiots - not least may politicians who have never 'done a proper job'!! Indeed he explains why many could understand and empathise with Trump, the businessman and bankrupt (in spite of all his faults) but find it difficult to do so with Clinton, May, Corbyn, McDonnell, Johnson etc who have barely 'lived' outside of politics (Taleb scorns bankers and journalists too) Frankly some of Taleb's writing went 'straight over my head', with an over emphasis on religion and his own beliefs. Had the book been made easier to read for 'idiots', like me, I would have given it 4 stars...so not sure if the idiots he laments will actually understand him!! "

I feel that whatever smart things I will try to write down, I will only embarrass myself. This lecture felt like going through a spiritual procession.The book is generous in explaining a bunch of concepts that we either use them outwardly (in the best case) or cluelessly (in the worse case).If I should narrow everything down to one single lesson, what I took with me is the following thought: if you do not assume consequences and pay the price for whatever you preach so strongly, you should shut the f**k up. You don't have skin in the game, and everything you manifest is what Taleb beautifully underlines under the IYI acronym (intellectual yet idiot). Too often, people take the luxury of sharing their opinion as to if it's an absolute truth that we need to embrace it blindly. Well, not only is this almost a non-sense but if you aren't there when shit hits the fan, I have the right to ignore you and do whatever I think it's best for me. Whoever has skin in the game pushes boundaries and makes the world a better place. Or, at least, these people are far more accountable."

As usual with Taleb, it isn't always easy to catch the cynical comments and I believe this last book is purposefully less stats-heavy and more lets-criticize-everything. It's somewhat unstructured, and the outlined concepts have been largely covered in the previous volumes. A sort of cement between Fooled by Randomness, The Black Swan and Antifragile (not a lot of references to The Bed of Procrustes).I don't fully agree with the approach of ethics he decided to follow but given the cited authors, I can assume his depiction was a shorthand to help him quickly build and justify his observations. Still, since ""ethics"" is sometimes used as a foundation it's a pity that there wasn't more effort put into depicting the concept."

So, I appreciate Taleb giving his thoughts on recognizing those without skin, and how to survive. Like Jordan Peterson there is a lot of commonsense here, but sometimes the distractions outweigh the sense.'Never cross a river if it is on average only 4 feet deep.''Silver Rule (negative golden rule): Do not do to others what you would not like them to do to you. Note the difference from the Golden Rule, as the silver one prevents busybodies from attempting to run your life.'Those, plus descriptors like Lindy Effect, Ergodicity, Mediocristan, Extremistan, and Interventionistas shall remain in my vocabulary for a long time."

The overall theme around the asymmetries of action and consequences was really well argued and can serve as a critical perspective on various issues we see in individual behaviour, organizations, and society. However, I was baffled by the sheer number of and reliance on personal attacks against individuals rather than providing stronger arguments and evidence for the author's (typically) opposing ideas. I understand the seriousness in which Nassim Taleb takes himself, and I understand the persuasiveness of diatribes to signal integrity, but I found it counterproductive. Why is this person wrong? What are your opposing arguments? What evidence disconfirms the other person's ideas? What evidence fails to disconfirm your ideas? Very rarely were these sorts of things provided, but very frequently you knew exactly how much Nassim Taleb loathed a particular person. In any case, it will keep your attention. "

Yes, many things he says might lack nuance, but he seems to know his shit. He is not foolishly dressing down Thaler or Pinker or Sam Harris. But I don't see the depth of this topic. I would give four stars because of the novelty of ideas and for being common-sensically contrarian. On the first listen, what he says is new, nod-worthy and also gives that aha-moment. But to take his views seriously, I need to ""read"" the book and dig deep, instead of ""listening"" to this. My audiobook listening to SITG satisfied my goal. I want to understand in broad stroke why Taleb is being hyped up. In a way, he has ""racked his gun"" and got my attention with SITG. I will have to dig into the Taleb rabbit hole in the next weeks by listening to podcasts and other critiques of him to understand him better. I will revisit my ratings in some months."

At the very least this book will make you think about a lot of your preconceived notions in different ways and will probably elicit more mutterings of ""fuck.. he's kinda right..."" than you're comfortable with. The author does leave certain arguments annoyingly unfinished or incomplete at various parts in the book, but hopefully that will leave your own brain to fill in the rest. If you can stomach getting your philosophical insight from a libertarian who thinks deadlifts are the only correct way to get fit, I can actually recommend this book quite highly."

It was probably partly my mistake to read the Incerto out of order and listen at 1.75x speed (which may have made this more grating, though the audiobook production is good), but the trader-ly machismo and sneering detract from the ideas significantly for me. This certainly won't be the case for everyone. Taleb is very critical (often in ways that sound like they could be a Trump tweet—""creepy Thaler"") of people like Steven Pinker and Richard Thaler that I've found quite interesting and appealing. I think its good to hear critiques of people whose ideas I might accept too readily...but once again the style masks most of the message. Off the top of my head (and bookshelf), Guy Standing's Basic Income has more readable criticisms to Thaler's Nudge if you're looking for such.I think I'll take a break before reading any more Incerto for now, though do want to get to Antifragile at some point."

I would pose that after you finish this book you will never again look quite the same way at anyone who makes a decision that concerns you. And I don't think you have to exercise a whole litany of steps to assist in that process other than ask the question of whether the ""decider of the moment"" has any skin in the game. I took a few minutes to look at the reviews of others when I finished this work, and was quite surprised to see passionate single star and five star ratings - very interesting. Yes, there are places where this work of Taleb's seems a bit fractured and confused - why so many 'books' and 'chapters'?

I am obsessed with anything that explores how our thinking leads us astray and how we are not as rational or reasonable as we like to think we are. Plus, I had read Malcolm Gladwell's New Yorker essay on Taleb. I was primed to dig this book. Unfortunately, Taleb's writing style/voice is insufferable. In an (admirable) attempt to be approachable and accessible, Taleb ends up just providing an extended stream of consciousness that reads like the rants and ravings of a jaded intellectual. It's as if it were written by an over-educated version of Clint Eastwood yelling at an empty chair. There are definitely good ideas to mine here (like the importance of recognizing complexity, or that ethics are inescapable, or that Ivory Tower chauvinism is harmful), but it's totally overshadowed by Taleb's bombastic tirades."

He is kind of a take-no-prisoners combatant and it is reflected in Skin in the Game. He always has something valuable to tell you, but it's obvious that he's pretty much shot his wad in his prior work and is now doing a good deal of hand waving and extreme generalization. I met him at a conference. He's constantly on a laptop or smartphone or a discussion with someone. This leads to a rehashing and defense of his novel ideas, rather than new revelations. But he's always worth reading because he is a brilliant guy. It's just that he's morphing into yet another right wing intellectual--more doctrinal than illuminating. "

In my intent, reading Taleb falls under the latter. In effect, however, he inescapably fulfills both.The book is aptly titled. Taleb focuses on the concept of skin in the game, not just as a solution to incentive problems, but also as a filter of risk and efficacy. He then uses this to explore and elucidate many of life's asymmetries, ranging from intransigent minorities, to ubiquitous and flawed monocultures, and seemingly contradictory features of the everyday. He also provides useful advice.The book could've been written more sterilely in parts which would have actually helped me understand it better, but then it would have been a lot less fun. I think he strikes the balance well but this isn't the easiest subject matter. I'll definitely need to write up a summary of this book to better internalize it (which I'll include in this review later), and will re-read it as well. That's not necessarily a symptom of the writing however; there's a lot in here and it's not always easy or intuitive to understand. I feel this book deserves five-stars not necessarily for the way it has been written, but for the things that he has to say.Taleb is thoughtful, intransigent, and defiant. His erudition is matched by his independence, and while he seems at times exceedingly grumpy, there is never an ounce of bitterness. Who can dislike that?SUMMARY TO BE EDITED IN BELOW:"

The book lists a number of such cases, many involving a domain expert selling goods or services:1. A stock broker can market some stock to you really because he wants to unload some. 2. Rich people can less about money spent than salesman about earning that money. 3. A minority of picky customers can dictate the market when the majority does not care as much. 4. Company can condition you to be loyal by making you lose your social and cultural connections when you leave. Overall, it is not as interesting as some of the author’s other works. "

I suspect that Taleb's goal with his obscure / erudite bouncing among topics and name/topic dropping is an attempt to become recognized as brilliant in the far future - in the same way the pre-Socratic philosopher/scientists have. If only obscure tidbits of this book survive, with made up words, the ""he protests too much"" censored ""cursing."" and the hyping of concepts followed by referential and obscure definitions after much teasing (see ergodicity!).

I've wondered about the concept of skin in the game, less formally, for a long time now. TALEB! breaks down the cognitive dissonance between people's actions and beliefs with the measure of skin in the game. This book was an unexpected source of insight on religion - he says that most non-threatening religious practices are just rituals and congregations - much like therapy. So, maybe we don't have to remove religion (this is near impossible in current day India), just make it indistinguishable from atheism.

He deals with systems thinkings, the Lindy effect, risk-taking (including the Greek Synkyndineo--taking risks together, such as during maritime journeys. He slams behavioral economics, including Richard Thaler and Case Susstein: studying ants never gives us how ant colony operates. A collection of idiots can still produce a well-functioning market. Lays out the minority rule, why 3-4% of a vocal minority can change the choices of the majority (Kosher food, automatic transmissions, and even why more Poles didn't help more Jews: it takes 7-8 Poles to help one Jew, but only 1 Pole to turn in 12 Jews). How being an employee is a form of a slavery, a fascinating discussion. How using foul language signals you don't fear your reputation. The weakness of Pascal's wager: religion demands skin in the game. Love without sacrifice is theft (including the love of God). Loved his discussion of inequality, the points he makes have been made by Thomas Sowell for years. Economists have a hard time studying things that move, and people are videos, not pictures, moving up and down the income chain over the course of their lives. How rationality is avoidance of systemic ruin; how economists misdefine rationality (and irrationality).The Economist reviewed the book and said Taleb was like being trapped in a taxi with a cantankerous cab driver who was too opinionated and settling scores with his critics.

I hope it’s normal and I’m not mentally challenged :)To my deep regret, there is no cliffhanger at the end of the book as it was in the previous volumes.

The author tends to add his own strong opinion (mostly disliking) along the way, repetitively and single out well-known people or ideas. I wonder what it's like to be the receiving end. So far I only read Antifragile and this book. I plan to read the remaining of the Incerto. I think the ideas are worth thinking. "
128,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13613785-jory-carson-burson,1,Drinking whisky with this book does not improve it in any way. I dearly loved the book Black Swan. I was very impressed with the writing and ideas in that book and so decided to give this one a try. It is so completely different in terms of quality and editing as to surprise me that it is by the same author. You are better off reading posts from the subReddit ‘I am very smart’ and taking those seriously. I very rarely write reviews and felt the need to post this one before I was even finished with the book. I have about 20 pages left to go and I’m just not sure if I’m going to make it....
129,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23972261-fduchinar,2,"I liked a lot of ideas in the book. A lot of ideas in this book made me think. However, arrogance and toxicity of the author as well as personal attacks on his opponents really spoiled the experience. Just as a single turd would spoil a barrel of honey. It is easy to preach to the choir and this is what it is - not an attempt to persuade anyone. It is quite sad - a lot of ideas here are very good."
130,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41100566-ian-tay,3,"Taleb is a character. A good portion of this book consisted of unsubstantiated attacks on other public intellectuals like Steven Pinker, Sam Harris, Cass Sunstein etc. Another good portion of this book reads more like life advice of the more metaphorical kind - kind of like Jordan Peterson's 12 Rules for Life. e.g. ""If you do not take risks for your opinion you are nothing."" or ""Those who talk should do and only those who do should talk. ""Despite the above, the book does offer some insights that were quite profound to me. For instance, there was a very good explanation for the paradox of tolerance using an example from the kosher food industry."
131,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23110302-jeannette-tenthorey,1,"So infuriating I had to stop 1/4 of the way through. The author comes across as the most pompous jerk I’ve ever read. Mostly the first quarter seems like an exercise in him asserting that he is clearly right (without providing any clear argument to back up those assertions) and that everyone else is a moron. He even likes to name particular people he thinks are morons, making it feel a bit like a personal vendetta. He also just makes things up. My favorite example: the best know part of Hammurabi’s code is something about builders who build houses that fall down... not an eye for an eye??? I rarely hate a book. I hated this. "
132,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4379555-veselin-nikolov,5,"My first Taleb book. I'll be definitely reading more of his work.Full of so many insights. I'll be definitely coming back to this book time and time again.The book describes so many patterns of asymmetric behavior. From which surgeon to choose based on looks alone to repeated probability and chance of ruin. The main point of ""skin in the game"" - having something to lose and taking risks, is presented in some many aspects of life.The ""no bullshit"" attitude was refreshing."
133,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39644347-chetan,5,"Compendiaria res improbitas, virtusque tarda - the villainous takes the short road, virtue the longer one.Cutting corners is dishonest.This is probably my favorite book of the series. The skin in the game rule is talk the talk and walk the walk. Use it when taking advice from people on doing whatever they suggest. It is one of those wise rules to live by that is old as the dawn of time."
134,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60710932-joseph-brigante,5,"Another wonderful installment of the Incerto from Taleb.Like Antifragile, this kinda defies description. I would call it a philosophical treatise around having ""skin in the game,"" meaning having a share of risk of harm in a given endeavor (not ""risk of not getting something"", risk of _harm_)It goes many places, all of them enriching. Definitely would recommend to anyone, and will be reading again, soon."
135,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10478755-mike,3,"An interesting read as all his books are but it seems Nassim is getting a little over reaching. For instance his idea that economists and opinion writers have nothing to offer because they have no ""skin in the game"" and are only writing to appease their peers does not ring true. Is all of social science a lost cause? Perhaps I'm oversimplifying this but his aphoristic writing style makes it hard to follow his ideas systematically. "
136,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30467433-tiago-soares,4,The book 1 of this book has 60 pages and basically is all you need to read. The rest of the pages is just complementary writing with the type of ideas that we are used to from Nassim Nicholas Taleb.Bottom line: pay attention to the consequences of listening or following the advice of someone who doesn't have skin in the game (something to lose/responsibility).
137,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91396938-james-jacobsen,3,There are books that must be tread twice and my goal is to do so-in my opinion this is a fundamental work in many ways. I read it as a part of my effort to better understand our economic system and the 2008 crash and why the folks who damage our well being never get held accountable for it-but this is a broader study of the human situation and the need for all of us to individually be challenged to be real in what we do.
138,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/724129-diana,1,"I was huge disappointed by this book. Maybe it was just stupid or naive of me, but not knowing anything about the author I was excited to read what he had to say and interested in the ideas the book (I thought) was supposed to be about. It turns out there wasn’t much. I debated whether to give this two stars or one. Not every single idea presented was terrible, but even the interesting ideas weren’t expanded, backed up, or given hardly any practicable real world application. Or honestly even clearly explained. Most frustrating, although he kept advocating scientific rigor, there was none to be found. It was more akin to listening to a drunken angry rant than reading a book making a point. The was maybe enough here for a short lecture or article, but not one that I personally could have gotten anything out of. "
139,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33777084-anastasia-marchenkova,5,"Taleb hates everyone equally. Interesting observations. Definitely needs a reread. Favorite chapters were ""The Most Intolerant Wins: The Dominance of the Stubborn Minority"" and ""How to Legally Own Another Person"""
140,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49747619-philip-wheeler,5,Something very important for all of us to do is to understand our mental blind spots. Especially those creating unnecessary social tension or realizing how our thinking takes us to success or catastrophe. This book is another in the Taleb series to uncover our blind spots. Everyone should read this. 
141,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11199869-prashant-ghabak,3,Entertaining read from Taleb mostly due to historical examples and some new ideas. Not much new content if you have read antifragile and other incerto to books. Definitely not among one of his best works. 
142,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/135047-ilana-bram,0,"He lost me early on with his misunderstanding of the basics of the theory of evolution. I like the main message of skin in the game as a means to morality and to a just society (though he doesn’t say how to implement this idea in practice). The book was unsatisfying in the end because he makes many bold statements without backing them up with solid arguments, but it was entertaining. "
143,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76256132-jessica-farah,4,"In typical Taleb fashion, the book is sarcastic but yet accurate. Makes you think twice about who to take advice from and what motivates people to be honest. Who really has our best interest at heart! "
144,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45400893-pravin,4,"Thought provoking but feels a bit theoreticalHighly thought provoking read, providing insights into what it means to have ""skin in the game"" and to understand why most processes or things you believe/act upon only make sense when there is something truly at stake. I especially enjoyed the last chapter which brought together several concepts, but provided a very interesting stance on what ""rationality"" means.My only issue with the book (opinion) - something that the author preaches about disliking himself - is that it is overintellectualized. I cant find a reason for why it took so many pages to get to the core messages."
145,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5102114-bmoore,3,"I guess I think Taleb's intellect is exceeded only by his ego. Still, there was a number of interesting ideas to consider. I listened to this book on several long driving trips and it served to pass the time. Not sure I'd be able to sit and read the physical book."
146,0241300657,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2359275-daniel-lehn,5,"I would read a cookbook if Taleb wrote it. He comes off as a blowhard at points, but his ideas are like fresh air to me. This is the last book in a series, and I've enjoyed and benefited from each one."
