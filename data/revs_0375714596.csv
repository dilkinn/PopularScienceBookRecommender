0,0375714596,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9102750-katie,4,"This book is awesome!! Okay discount the gimmicky title - the book was written in 1979, they didn't know any better. As a result of reading this book I am now convinced:1. So much of science can be conveyed clearly with words, pictures, and thought experiments, rather than the typical mired-down explanations that use clunky symbols and equations.2. Illustrated books are better than animations at teaching. You go at your own pace, you peruse at your leisure - it's not like Ken Robinson TedEd videos where 1000 visual and auditory stimuli are blaring at you simultaneously, and moving forward incessantly. Your brain has time to mull, and you can actually hear yourself think. (Not to hate on those videos - they are beautiful to behold.)3. Science (chemistry and physics in particular) is so damn hard to understand, but if you sit down with a good teacher (this book for example), it can be broken down. It's not some insurmountable wall you have to keep ramming your head against on your own.And here's a tidbit that I loved:""Don't get worried. Among physicists there's a saying: ""You never really understand a new theory. You just get used to it."" "" (151)."
1,0375714596,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,3,"This book explains the theory of relativity quite well - if you have the patience to wade through random historical tangents, biographies of everyone and their oarents, and the author's push for revolutionary socialism. I am guessing the later is probably a product of being written in 1979; the former of poor editing. The art is atrocious - it mixes steam punk style with silly underdrawn sketches. The type face is mixed; anything harder to understand is in a tiny print. The effect is messy both visually and content wise.The parts pertaining to the theory of relativity are pages 61-66, 88-120, and 136 to 165. Pages 121 to 135 are a history of mathematics, which, while interesting, has no place in the middle of explaining the theory. And this illustrates why I thought of giving up - but I am glad I stuck with it because the end was worth while. "
2,0375714596,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19681786-david-bonello,5,"I found this book the year it came out. On a train ride from Princeton to NY, I must have shared it with at least a dozen others who just fell in love with it. Since then I have bought well over 20 copies to gift friends.The best line from the book is: Scientists have a saying: You never really understand a new theory. You just get used to it. Brilliant book; absolutely brilliant. "
3,0375714596,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85852005-sato,5,"Einstein for Beginners was the first book I could finish in my life about ten years ago! Hawking's 'A Brief History of Time' made me pick that book again last night. I read it again and that was even more interesting for me. I can't describe the extreme delight it brought into my life in hindsight. This book brings a simple account of Relativity and Einstein's life. How Einstein brought a new level of thinking to solve a significant problem is described nicely. When he abandoned the idea of the absolute time, he brought a new level of thinking by going against past premises."
4,0375714596,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19808215-brett-howe,3,"This is a great book but not for beginners. I think you have to already have a pretty good understanding of higher math and physics to really get it. It is a cartoon story first half of Einstein's life. Second half takes you hurtling at literally the speed of light through Einstein's theory of relativity and along the way a brief history of math and physics. Included in this book is a refresher (hopefully) on the Pythagorean Theorem; an overview of the Lorenz transformation necessary to understand the relationship between coordinates of events in two systems traveling at different relative velocities; a discussion of the theory of relativity and the concept of the relativity of simultaneity; the math behind it all; and of course the book culminates with E=mc^2. A paltry page or two discusses the atom bomb (apparently not Einstein's fault), Einstein's leftist tendencies and a list of books to read to go into more detail on everything. I give this book 3.5 stars for me, probably 2 for somebody who isn't into math. It's all relative really! "
5,0375714596,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3748375-jesse,5,"Einstein's achievements were, of course, immense, but this book in particular does a great job of showing how those achievements were just one part of a decidedly group-oriented work ethic which is peculiar to the natural sciences. For Einstein happened upon his space-time continuum only as a result of Faraday's discovery that electromagnetic forces are conducted by space, which was what Maxwell needed to formulate the notion of electric and magnetic fields, which was what Einstein required to intuit that light affected electromagnetism. This, as everyone knows, forced him to contradict Newton when he said that the speed of light is relative where space and time are absolute. Upon this reversal, we are forced into Galileo's principle of relativity, and after some of Einstein's math, we realize that time is relative. This book does not touch on the photoelectric effect, which showed that light photons ejected electrons from metal; this is too bad, since the most amazing thing happened when this knowledge was coupled with four dimensional space time - namely, that Spinozistic neutralism became the only philosophical vision of reality that can really be called scientific. Matter became a set of logical constructs and idealism, materialism and dualism were ousted."
6,0375714596,http://goodreads.com/user/show/752176-vanessa,4,"I picked this up off a sale table in a used book store and was surprised how excellent it was. This could be the best description of relativity I've ever read. Alas, my grasp is still quite tenuous but I was much encouraged by this quote: ""Physicists say they don't so much understand new theories as get used to them.""The book concerns itself with lots of good history on the theory of electromagnetism hence varying amounts of information on Faraday, Maxwell, Hertz, Newton and Michelson. Most of the book is about Einstein's early years and the discovery of special relativity and his famous equation with very little to say on general relativity, in case that matters to you. Worth hunting down if relativity is making you feel stupid. You'll read it and feel, well, at least not as stupid. "
7,0375714596,http://goodreads.com/user/show/732347-kelly,2,"Whhyyyyy the paragraphs at the end about socialism? Those were entirely unnecessary and no, I do not care about your opinions, Mr. Schwartz.I wasn't a huge fan of the book, but I can see young adults who are into science or are reluctant readers digging the format and easy-to-grasp conceptual explanations. "
8,0375714596,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39944-mary-helene,5,So it's graphic; it's great. I am so impressed with how simply yet completely the complexity of this formula was laid out. I almost get it. 
9,0375714596,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74315874-broda-noel,5,A book of excellent reading. Content easy to understand.

13,0375714596,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,2,"Surprisingly, this book is not particularly clear. Cute cartoons and comments and references to ""Albert"" don't make for clarity. Light is central to Einstein but the authors don't tell us why we should care at all about 'light'. The authors reference Einstein's illustration of himself riding along a light wave at the speed of light, holding a mirror, observing that the light from his face wouldn't be able to catch up with the mirror. Here the reader might be puzzled about where the light on Einstein's face comes from and what it has to do with a mirror. The book is also filled with more than a few mathematical formulations (algebra and calculus) that were not helpful. Einstein for 'beginners' is probably a relative term.From this book we know that space and time are not independent, fixed, 'absolute' as Newton thought, and we know that space and time are tied to the speed of light, which Einstein saw as 'absolute' (not variable, as space and time are). But from here it gets fuzzy. If light's speed is constant, then the distance (and time for light to travel) between two points will vary depending on where these two points are located. Shorten the distance, and time is shortened. Lengthen the distance, and time is lengthened. Time and space might be best thought of not as things that we move through or across, but as measurement concepts: Time is speed (velocity) times distance (space). Understanding this depends, again, on the role of light and why it is significant. Whether space and time are more than 'measurement' concepts is also not clear. Interestingly, while reading this, a thought flashed through the mind wondering that if one moves at the speed of light, does space end and time stop? Relative to light, there's little discussion about Einstein's theory of gravity. Force (external push and pull) is referenced as an ""interaction"" as another term for 'force'. Gravity is commonly referred to as an attractive force between two bodies (unlike electromagnetic positive and negative interactions). What is interesting is how this understanding is consistent with inertia (the bigger the mass, plus distance, the harder it is to get a body to move). Inertia can be seen as a counter force, a resistance to being pulled by another body. In other words, it also seems to involve a positive (attraction) and negative (resistance) dynamic. The book ends with an outline of Einstein's political perspective (socialist) which, given the centrality of Einstein's scientific views, seems puzzling to include in this book until one reads the acknowledgments and learns that this ""Beginners"" series is intended in part to critique science in capitalist society. "
14,0375714596,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60791651-ivan,0,"	As someone who is in high school and knows plenty about science and scientist who would have know that Einstein had an odd time growing up just like some other famous people. Once i started reading it it kinda reminded me of Steve jobs because they have a similar history in a way.	The main character in “Einstein for Beginners” is Einstein himself the book talks about how he was when he was young to when he was an adult and what had he accomplished so far. He was not interested in the industrial life nor school when he was young. The environment around him caused to take interest in science and proceed the trend that was in germany at the time which made the world advance faster, the thing was electricity. At the end hEinstein was able to make an equation that no one had yet to discover and involved the speed of light with other factors that involved energy.	The minor characters in the book affect him as well for example his uncles were able to teach him new thing like advanced math. His mother taught him about culture, music, and art> Last but not least his dad tried to teach him about economy and industrial life but as i said he showed no interest and distance himself with those things.	Throughout his journey Einstein was able to meet some of the famous scientist in the world at the time. For example Galileo he helped Einstein further his knowledge so that he was able to accomplish bigger things. Einstein started to connect everything he learned about math and put it on his experiment to find new data. That's when he saw that there was a new method to be able to experiment and make formulas to get new data and make it more reliable.	If you are fascinated with science you should read the book. This book teaches you about one of the great scientist of all time and how he was able to change the world. This book mi9ght even encourage you to try something new or pursue your goal in life. This book might be different since it doesn't have a lot of reading and it's a comic book but it might catch your attention some people don't like long books like you see in the library."
15,0375714596,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1664074-bartholomew-timm,4,"Written in 1979, it was one of the earlier examples of a book with a serious subject being illustrated with comic illustrations. Graphic Novels are no longer novel, but the treatment of serious material in this manner was relatively new, and part of the ""hippie"" culture. This one was a success in that it takes very complicated material - how Einstein came up with several of his theories, including relativity, and presenting the actually mathematics, and the physics in a format that renders it slightly more understandable. I say slightly because understanding the mathematics behind Einsteins theories is extremely difficult. However, I did gain a better feeling for Einstein's thinking, and reasoning, and did see how the mathematics made sense. It also became clear that while a phenomenally original thinker, Einsteins main theories were all based on principles that had been discovered hundreds of years earlier. Even his most famous equation E=MC2 is an updated version of Newton's formulation of Kinetic energy. This book will definitely not appeal to many people, but if you enjoy math, physics, and nature, as I do, you will find it an interesting and educational read."
16,0375714596,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39203607-paulo-gir-o,3,"I got a dubious impression from this book, reason by which I was doubtful to give it three full stars. I feel that the book ends exactly in the middle, and that only focus on the general relativity theory and than it drops the rest of Einstein's (scientific and personal) life entirely. And the last page is completely unnecessary (it really feels like political propaganda put by the author). Just for that is almost worth just one or two stars. The good side(s) of this book is the historical introduction to some of the most important concepts in math and physics that one needs to understand the theory and the simplicity of the explanation (although it jumps some big steps in the mathematical logic behind the theory, but this is a ""for beginners"" book, so that's acceptable). It is a good intro to a very complicated theory, but it's almost at the level that I'll recommend it to my son when he reaches 13 or 14 years of age. It's not very deep, so it is a nice leisurely sunday read. "
17,0375714596,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2270881-ken-rideout,3,"A nice, easy to read graphic novel that gets people up to speed on Special Relativity. A nice bonus of embedding the story in the socialism vs. totalitarianism and emerging field theories of Einstein's time. The author chooses to make a few one to two pages digressions that are actually very good. The book also gets you through E=mc2 but does not get to general relativity. Nothing new to those of us who have been thinking about teaching these issues, but a great loaner book for the high school student who wants to know more. A good reminder to me to embed the story in its proper context rather than just stressing the genius of the man just sitting there thinking while smoking a pipe..."
18,0375714596,http://goodreads.com/user/show/93309941-michael-bowen,3,"Electricity was booming when Einstein was young. This background information helped me understand what encouraged Einstein's choice of problems that I never knew previous to reading this book The book has a fun example explaining the principle of relativity that Einstein used for his theory of relativity. The explanation of the relationship between inertia and the speed of light is spot on too, and I really enjoyed the equation breakdown.I wish the book went more in depth with Einstein's involvement with gravational waves and the atomic bomb. The ending seemed rushed and I do not like how the book ends with a statement about socialism because it is an odd way to end a book. I also found some of the illustrations odd and disturbing, but I enjoyed the narration overall."
19,0375714596,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335973-joseph-harriott,5,"12yrs of science education, graduate courses, and I still couldn't explain Einstein's relativity to myself. Then I read this cartoon book, and suddenly it is all so incredibly simple. Of course you need to have some understanding of the fixedeness of the speed of light, which depends on Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism, but nowadays these are concepts that we don't strain ourselves over, even when we don't understand them, we just take them as true - the evidence is all around us in our modern lives. So I wouldn't be surprised if soon relativity is being taught at primary level, it's actually that simple!"
20,0375714596,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5858840-tracey,4,"I really liked this and I'm not sure that I understood it all, but the authors assure me that I shouldn't on a first read and that's okay. I liked the way the social and historical aspects of the world were explored to help the reader understand the road Einstein was on before he worked out the theory of relativity and that his predecessors were given their due. There were some great graphics in this that helped make the theory of relativity slightly more clear for me, but the math is way above anything that I have done in a while so it was a little difficult to understand in places. Overall, a really super smart book!"
21,0375714596,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2648205-white,5,"This book took the most complex concept in the history of our world (that has been ""proven"") and explains it through the cartoon renditions by the author. It's an excellent, quick read; another purse book. From the simple explanation of how fast light really travels, to why we can't travel into the future, but it is mathematically ""possible"" to travel into the past, and then some; this is a rush of possibilities. This book is full of ""ah ha!s"""
22,0375714596,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5004286-ruth,2,"Despite the fact that this book has been helpful in aiding me (a decidedly scientifically-challenged person) in beginning to understand Einstein's work on the Relativity of Simultaneity (which I've become more or less obsessed with in the past few weeks), I found the format to be very odd, and not as helpful as the authors clearly intended it to be. Sometimes the flow of the page didn't work, causing me to become distracted as I tried to decide what I was supposed to read first. "
23,0375714596,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53432435-kyran,4,I felt like I was cheating in My Reading Challenge reading this book because it is short and more like a comic book but I loved it. I am reading Einstein:Life in Science at the moment and I am glad that I read this book before starting Life in Science because it covers most of the things in the new book but in a very funny and easy to understand way. I think readers trying to understand Relativity should start this book before trying other serious books concerning Relativity.
24,0375714596,http://goodreads.com/user/show/839507-kristin,5,"Seriously good high school summer reading. The illustrations, and commentary, are funny and editorially on point. I am about to get another copy from Amazon to revive the read-ups, or beef up my reference section - (my original one is lost in boxes, but was a gift from a dear friend who was about to leave school for college) - so i am that girl who is torn up by having lost the dedication more.

25,0375714596,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2630343-jennifer,5,"This is probably the best book from the ""for beginners"" series. The book breaks down Einstein's theories making it easy to understand. The pictures are well integrated into the text. The book does rush a tad with the formulas and towards the end. I didn't understand to the fullest extent Einstein's theory, but I don't think I would ever understand it ever if I didn't read the book."

27,0375714596,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24472414-tvrtko-bali,2,"This book is good at explaining physics, but the author should have remembered that this should be a book about Einstein and his contribution to science (that's the reason why people would want to read this book in the first place) and not a tool for sharing his personal opinions whenever he can. I also don't like the cartoons all that much."
28,0375714596,http://goodreads.com/user/show/678644-jill,4,"Great way to relate to a topic...through pictures/cartoons. Fun read. Most interesting way to realize the thinking, the times and the background, and how Einstein came up with his theory of relativity and E=MC2. Good stuff!"

The book talks about more than just Einstein's theories; it also goes into the history of when he was born and what influenced him as a scientist, and even the history of science and math more generally. It might seem like rabbit holes when you're reading it, but the background info is good at helping you see Einstein and his theories in the larger picture of scientific research and development. And I have to add, I think Einstein would 
love
 that. After all, how would you know that he advanced science if you didn't see his theories *relative* to those who came before and after?!? Ha! ha!

In the process, we meet scientific luminaries and personalities of imperial Germany, as well as Galileo, Faraday, and Newton; learn why moving clocks run slower than stationary ones, why nothing can go faster than the speed of light; and follow Albert's thought as he works his way toward E = mc2, the most famous equation of the twentieth century."
