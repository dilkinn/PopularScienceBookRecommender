0,0192862189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/659440-matt,3,"I decided to dust this book off which had been sitting on my bookshelf unread for 15 years. My decision came after reading Richard Dawkin's book, ""The God Delusion"". Which renewed my interest in the looking at evolutionary processes. Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth, is certainly an apt title, as Lovelock does have a fascinating perspective with which he paints our world. His theory, the Gaia hypothesis may at first sound as if it has mystical connotations, but that is not the case, rather he is making a case that the world on which we live is acts as a huge living organism that regulates it's own temperature and tempers it's own ""body"" chemistry so as to be habitable to life. In turn the life which inhabits this ""biosphere"" helps to carry out these processes.I have seen this in action, when I was studying soil science in college. Well aerated soil uses the trapped oxygen to attract hydrogen molecules in water, thus creating a respiratory system that moves nutrient bearing water through the soil and even creating a soil metabolism that can warm or cool the soil in reaction to the ambient air temperature. Often times the intervention of animals helps to aerate the soil, so a symbiosis occurs between the soil and other living organisms. It is these kinds of things which Lovelock calls Gaian interactions.As exciting to me as these circular systems are, Lovelock himself is not a particularly gripping author. He is very much a scientist of a certain age. He earned his science chops in the era right after WWII when sciences had a certain rock star quality, an scientists could be very arrogant, which Lovelock suffers from to a small degree. Having said that his observations about the planet were groundbreaking for their time and his Gaian perspective of an organism that has been going strong for 3 Aeons with or without humans is very humbling. So I would recommend this book with the caveat that the prose is not easy to follow at times, but the ideas about planetary biology are compelling enough to make it worth soldiering through."

The man who achieved global fame for his theory that the whole earth is a single organism now believes that we can only hope that the earth will take care of itself in the face of completely unpredictable climate change.At the age of 90, Prof Lovelock is resigned to his own fate and the fate of the planet. Whether the planet saves itself or not, he argues, all we can do is to ""enjoy life while you can"". Trying to save the planet 'is a lot of nonsense'.31.05.2017"
2,0192862189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/140165-bart-everson,0,"Further proof that a book doesn't have to be good to be great. I read this because of my interest in science-friendly earth religion. In my other readings, and even in private meditations, I keep coming back to Gaia theory. But I didn't really understand what that theory entails. It's often described in a nutshell thusly: ""The Earth can be considered as a single organism."" But what does that mean, really? What does that nutshell contain?This book has the answer. Or at least, the start of an answer. It's seminal stuff. I believe this book, written in 1979, is the first popular articulation of Gaia theory. It's required reading for an interested novice like myself.It may be a popular treatment, but that doesn't mean it's pablum. In fact, I found the technical details a bit tedious at times. I'm not a scientist; mostly I read novels. Fortunately the whole book's rather brief. I found Lovelock's philosophical musings a more compelling read. The epilogue is especially thought-provoking, though it seems to go off the rails in the final paragraphs, with a diatribe against whale-hunting. Still and all, this book transformed my basic understanding of Gaia theory. I feel like I get the basic idea now. It's much subtler and yet, seemingly, more logical and more robust than I'd anticipated. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the topic, with the above caveats. "
3,0192862189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"When I’ve heard of the Gaia theory before, I’ve usually heard of it in a sceptical sort of context that criticises the tree-hugging idea that Earth has a soul. That is not actually the main thrust of Lovelock’s argument at all: instead, what he argues is that Gaia, or Earth, is a self-sustaining system with in-built feedback loops which hold it more or less steady and capable of supporting life.If you’ve studied climate or geology or even the water cycle, you know that he’s not wrong about the self-sustaining system. There’s so many negative feedback loops which keep things in check — some of which are, of course, threatening to be sabotaged by the action of one particular upstart mammal species with delusions of grandeur. We’re a part of the system, of course, but one which may have got out of hand. Or maybe not; maybe our intelligence will help rein us back in. We can only hope.The point is, Lovelock’s not saying anything about a cosy loving Earth Mother spirit watching over us. Though his language in this book is sometimes poetical, and his sense of wonder at nature is clear, he’s talking about self-regulating, self-sustaining systems. He’s talking about the fact that the world has checks and balances in place which bring Earth into equilibrium, even though other factors — like the sun’s energy output — have changed over time. And okay, at some points he goes off on a tangent about whale intelligence and a hypothetical future in which whale brains give us technological advances, but the science here isn’t wrong.There’s nothing actually revolutionary or tree-hugging here. It’s just true. Call it Gaia or call it a complex set of feedback loops; whatever you’re comfortable with, I guess. I do wish I’d read Revenge of Gaia instead, since this is horribly optimistic that humans will pull our collective fingers out and stop damaging the planet. I suspect Lovelock’s less sanguine about that prospect now.Originally reviewed for breathesbooks.com."
4,0192862189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"In Gaia, first published in 1979, Lovelock describes the planet and all living things on it as a self-regulating entity, much like a collection of cells, organs, and bacteria together produce a living entity that we might think of as a person. My favorite thing about Gaia theory is that I paradoxically intuit that it's obviously ridiculous but also that it's obviously correct.Readers new to this theory and book might do well to start in two places outside the introduction. In the epilogue, Lovelock explains that the Gaia Hypothesis: ""postulates that the physical and chemical condition of surface of the Earth, of the atmosphere, and of the oceans has been and is actively made fit and comfortable by the presence of life itself. This is in contrast to the conventional wisdom which held that life adapted to the planetary conditions as it and they evolved their separate ways."" This last distinction is useful to keep in mind when reading the other chapters, which at first glance seem needlessly wonky. I also found the chapter on cybernetics a useful foundation for understanding Gaia. Lovelock defines cybernetics as ""self-regulating systems of communication and control in living organisms and machines."" Put this way, it does seem obvious that the planet should be understood as one massive web of interconnected systems.How should we think about humanity within this Gaia framework? Lovelock considers two ecological views: René Dubos has powerfully expressed the concept of man as the steward to life on Earth, in symbiosis with it like some grand gardener for all the world. It is a hopeful, optimistic view and a liberal one. In contrast to Dubos, Garrett Hardin apparently sees man as acting out a great tragedy which may lead not only to his own destruction but to the that of the whole world. He suggests that our only means of escape is to renounce most of our technology, especially nuclear energy, but he seems to doubt whether we have free choice."" Lovelock, however, is more inclined in this work to decrease human exceptionalism, which would counter the grandeur of Dubos' view. People are just(?) another planetary entity. He is also more optimistic about technology than Hardin and would go on to defend nuclear energy in his later life (which has extended to 100 years as I write this review).It's maybe worth noting that Lovelock is optimistic about humanity's use of technology in relation to the environment because people listen so carefully to journalists and act to mitigate their impact. He writes that ""the rapid dissemination of information about the environment helps to reduce the time constant of our response to adverse changes."" Given how often today's political elites ignore or dismiss both scholars and the press, and given how much online media now seems undermined by misinformation troll and bot armies, we might laugh at this optimism. But for Lovelock, it must have seemed sensible when seeing how readily the liberal democracies responded to Rachel Carson's Silent Spring and to Crutzen's work on the ozone layer (the Montreal Protocol was passed within ten years). At one point, he criticizes environmentalists for underestimating their impact in producing countervailing responses to their concerns, but he foresaw no backlash against environmentalism, the academy, or journalism. (Nathaniel Rich's ""Losing Earth: The Decade We Almost Stopped Climate Change"" might be a useful counter to Lovelock's implicit prediction here.)Random Notes. I was surprised by how often I recognized the scholars and scientific history here. As noted, Carson (Silent Spring, Crutzen (""Anthropocene""), Dubos (""think globally, act locally""), and Hardin (""The Tragedy of the Commons"") appear. Lyn Margulis helps to write and develop the hypothesis and its ideas are first published in (her ex-husband) Carl Sagan's journal. Milutin Milanković is mentioned. Richard Dawkins' skepticism of the Gaia hypothesis is mentioned in the introduction of the edition I read. William Golding, who wrote Lord of the Flies, suggests using ""Gaia"" to name the theory. Arthur C. Clarke is quoted. Lovelock begins thinking about how to recognize life while helping NASA to create probes to study the possibility of life on Mars. The scientists at this time can remember working on what gases most likely warmed the planet in the distant past, not ammonia but carbon dioxide. And they are still working out the atmospheric role of aerosols even if they have already figured out that CFCs are harmful to the ozone layer. A final note: in spite of Lovelock's at least tangential connection to Carl Sagan, he always writes ""1000 million"" rather than a billion."
5,0192862189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1768003-sam,2,"As an ecologist and all round nature lover I am rather familiar with Lovelock's Gaia concept, one that I have not been wholly convinced by. And this book has done nothing to help that. While I do like the idea of nature being an actual single entity/being/organism deliberately managing the planet for the benefit of all species, this is a belief and not something that can or should be applied to science (or visa versa for that matter). Lovelock's explanations of many of the basic Earth systems were good, relatively easy to read and accompanied by useful examples relating them to processes/systems that those without a lot of environmental knowledge can understand. And for this I commend him. However the way he fit these together to provide 'evidence' for his Gaia hypothesis came across forced and comparable to some of the arguments put forward by the Creationists, although they are somewhat more logical...but only just. For me this is not a scientific theory but a belief/idea that has its basis in the religions of old, Wiccan being a good example. "

7,0192862189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5351083-darth-pika,4,Disagree with Gaia Hypothesis did not means this book is bad written. Lovelock gave me insight about how to use chemistry and thermodynamics as analytical tool. 
8,0192862189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1544652-becky,3,"This book was challenging for me due to the high focus on the chemical processes of the earth and atmosphere. I was hoping this focus would drop off after the first few chapters, but Lovelock continues it throughout the book. However, I don't think this will present a problem to those studied in chemistry on a basic level. The hypothesis seemed a little outdated to me as I think the thought of the earth being one large living organism has pretty much seeped into most of our understanding by now. I did, however, especially enjoy the chapter on cybernetics. "
9,0192862189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3553362-zuzia,3,"One great, ingenious concept stretched out over a whole book. By reading the introduction and the last chapter you have a whole summary of the purpose of the book and the ideas behind it. The idea itself is truly fascinating and I think I have come to agree with Lovelock. Love the concept, however the book gets very tedious and repetitive. "

11,0192862189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/436346-brett,3,"I'm having some trouble formulating much of an opinion about this book. On the one hand, it is technical enough that I was often confused by descriptions of chemical processes in our atmosphere or ocean. On the other, Lovelock in his introduction suggests this book is intended for a general audience and that the descriptions of the scientific processes may be too ""poetic"" for people with actual scientific backgrounds.By the same token, Lovelock suggests that the way this theory is often described--earth is one huge, self-regulating living thing--is a silly oversimplification. Yet, the language deployed throughout the book very much lends itself to this exact reading. I guess what we are intended to gather from Gaia is that there are many feedback loops in the Earth's environment that serve to regulate key aspects of our environment, and that living organisms are necessary for these feedback loops to properly operate. Though Lovelock insists he is not suggesting any intentionality on the part of these organisms or networks of organisms, it kind of seems like that is what he is doing. However, he never offers any mechanism of how ""decisions"" are made, or how the system would come to ""understand"" its regulatory function.. I found it...unconvincing.But even if the big picture doesn't seem to add up exactly, there are still sections of the book that are compelling, and I often agreed with Lovelock as he discussed certain particulars of how humankind might better interact with nature. I'm just going to straddle the fence on this review and hope that someday someone that understands this better than me will explain it at a party. "
12,0192862189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34209361-michael,5,"Just imagine for a moment--an organism as big as our planet Earth.Reading Edward Wilson's ""The Future of Life"" served as the spark to pick up and read this book. And its true, good things do come in small packages. The book is all of 140 pages, and is written in a lean, but not glossed-over style. Robert Lovelock (to my knowledge) is the contemporary father of the study of the earth as a complete living system.Lovelock readily admits that the book serves more to promote the dialog about our planet as a living, breathing whole and to share key discoveries that support his concept. (He states in the Preface that his follow-on book, ""The Ages of Gaia"" aims to build the scientific argument to the Gaia theory.)By no means, does Lovelock detour around the science that supports his case. With the scope of the topic requiring knowledge of both physical and biological science, and the small number of pages, he manages to instruct and create a sense of awe in a short amount of time.The 3 major principles he brings to light about Gaia are:1. Gaia exhibits a tendency to keep conditions (e.g., temperature, air quality) constant for all terrestrial life.2. Like other living systems, Gaia has vital organs at the core, and expandable or redundant ones on the periphery.3. Under the worse conditions, Gaia responses similar to other cybernetic systems (i.e., where time constant and loop gain are important)The material is far reaching in both its scope and in shaping our understanding of where we stand. Put in the context of Gaia, we have straddled ourselves to the largest of all known living and breathing creatures."
13,0192862189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44181548-joe-ward,3,"It isn't Lovelock's fault that environmentalists lacking a firm grounding in the natural sciences took his ideas and went whacko with them. This book isn't the metaphysical or new agey nonsense that may have been partially inspired by it. What it is, rather, is a decent treatment of mainstream biogeochemical cycling theory, written for the popular reader and employing somewhat poetic language. I would recommend skipping it and reading Schlesinger's classic ""Biogeochemistry"" text instead, unless you need to know exactly what Lovelock says for countering those who went overboard with his ideas or you lack the background in basic chemistry and biology for following Schlesinger.

And I must say that this theory is deeply interesting (ok, I was already rooting for it before reading this book so it doesn't help) and with the latest climate changes and human trend, the thought of Earth being a sentient organism is something that becomes more and more concrete. If you're interested in discovering why our little planet may be alive on its own, this book will provide you with a wide range of arguments showing that not everything can be explained that simply. Let's just hope we won't destroy it now."
15,0192862189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7833291-globerunner,2,"Considering that this book was written in 1979, the evidence it puts forward to support the Gaia hypothesis is impressive, but it certainly wasn't a light read. Some parts were fascinating, but I often found myself rereading paragraphs because I had lost focus. I was struggling a bit to get through it and my rating is based on the fact that I didn't really enjoy the read, not on the validity of the concept of Gaia."

Lovelock presents a theory of everything that is quite breathtaking in its originality but he presents it in a very clear and credible way.

I began more and more to see things through her eyes and slowly dropped off, like an old coat, my loyalty to the humanist Christian belief in the good of mankind as the only thing that mattered. I began to see us all, as port of the community of living things that unconsciously keep the Earth a comfortable home, and that we humans have no special rights only obligations to the community of Gaia."" Preface, ix""It came to me suddenly one afternoon in 1965 when I was working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California. It came because my work there led me to look at Earth's atmosphere from the top down, from space. Suck a look forces questions about the composition of the air we breathe not previously asked. We all take our first breath of life-sustaining air and from then on take it for granted. We are confident it will be there to breath as constant in composition as is the Sun constant in its rising and setting. Air is invisible almost intangible but if you look at it from above, from space you see it as something new, something unexpected. It is the perfect stained glass window of the world, but also it is a strange mixture of unstable, almost combustible gases. The air is a mixture that somehow always keeps constant in composition. My flash of enlightenment that afternoon was the thought that to keep constant something must be regulating it and that somehow the life at the surface was involved."" Preface, xvi""This seeming conspiracy of silence [on a clear definition of life] may have been due in part to the division of science into separate disciplines, with each specialist assuming that someone else has done the job. Some biologists may believe that the process of life is adequately described by some mathematical theorem of physics or cybernetics, and some physicists may assume that is is factually described in the recondite writings on molecular biology which one day he will find time to read. But the most probable cause of our closed minds on the subject is that we already have a very rapid, highly efficient life-recognition programme in our inherited set of instincts, our 'read-only' memory as it might be called in computer technology. Our recognition of living things, both animal and vegetable, is instant and automatic, and our fellow-creatures in the animal world appear to have the same facility."" ch. Introductory, p. 3""Binary, or double, star systems are quite common in our galaxy, and it may be that at one time our sun, that quiet and well-behaved body, had a large companion which rapidly consumed its store of hydrogen and ended as a supernova. Or it may be that the debris of a nearby supernova explosion mingled with the swirl of interstellar dust and gases from which the sun and its planets were condensing. In either case, our solar system must have been formed in close conjunction with a supernova event. There is no other credible explanation of the great quantity of exploding atoms still present on the Earth. The most primitive and old-fashioned Geiger counter will indicate that we stand on fall-out from a vast nuclear explosion. Within our bodies, no less than 500,000 atoms rendered unstable in that event still erupt every minute, releasing a tiny fraction of the energy stored from that fierce fire of long ago.The Earth's present stock of uranium contains only 0.72 per cent of the dangerous isotope U235. From this figure it is easy to calculate that about four aeons (billions of years) ago the uranium in the Earth's crust would have been nearly 15 per cent U235. Believe it or not, nuclear reactors have existed since long before man, and a fossil natural reactor was recently discovered in Gabon, in Africa. It was in action two aeons ago when U235 was only a few per cent. We can therefor be fairly certain that the geochemical concentration of uranium four aeons ago could have led to spectacular displays of natural nuclear reactions. In the current fashionable denigration of technology, it is easy to forget that nuclear fission is a natural process... Thus life probably began under conditions of radioactivity far more intense than those which trouble the minds of certain present-day environmentalists. Moreover, there was neither free oxygen nor ozone in the air, so that the surface of the Earth would have been exposed to the fierce unfiltered ultra-violet radiation of the sun. The hazards of nuclear and of ultra-violet radiation are much in mind these days and some fear that they may destroy all life on Earth. Yet the very womb of life was flooded by the light of these fierce energies."" ch. In the beginning, p. 15""In our own society since the Industrial Revolution we have encountered major chemical problems of shortages of essential materials and of local pollution. The early biosphere must have been faced with similar problems. Perhaps the first ingenious cellular system which learned to gather zinc from its environment, at first for its own benefit and then for the common good, also unwittingly garnered the similar but poisonous element, mercury. Some slip-up of this nature probably led to one of the world's earliest pollution incidents since now have system of micro-organisms which can convert mercury and other poisonous elements to their volatile methyl derivatives.

19,0192862189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8477296-brandy,3,"When reading Lovelock, I can't help but think of that show I watched as a child, Big Blue Marble.  Wait: was it an entire television series?  Maybe on PBS?  My memory is fuzzy concerning the details, but the impression of a concept of the earth as a self-contained ball adrift in space remains.  It was the concept I grew up with, carried on when I became an  adult in everything from science fiction to tiny, self-perpetuating biosphere glass balls you can purchase at some specialty stores.  It's a vision of the world we know from a point of view that we, generally, don't--a sort of view from above, as if we were gods, or had the vision of one.  Instead of looking out towards the heavens, for the first time, we were looking in at ourselves from a distant perspective, and having what in other contexts might be considered an out-of-body-experience.  (note: the internet tells me that Big Blue Marble WAS a PBS show!)The concept, in any case, is in many ways based on one of the most famous photos humans have ever taken from space (not that there are a lot of other species taking photographs, or so runs the current belief), recorded during a 1972 Apollo mission.  Because I grew up with that image as part of my consciousness, I hadn't realized until I read Lovelock's bok just how fundamentally it and the images like it changed our conception of the planet we live on.  It seems this was the case for Lovelock, a climatologist who did contract work for NASA.  I don't know just what people felt in the pits of their stomachs when they saw that lonely image for the first time, but I can't imagine that it didn't stir something: awe?  humility?  wonder?  curiosity?  For Lovelock, I think it must have been all of these things.It makes me think of another childhood conceptual encounter I had, through the Madeline L'Engle Time Quintet.  In the second book, A Wind in the Door, Meg, the central character, shrinks to a size where she can interact with mitochondria in order to save her brother.  The mitochondria in turn interact with their environment in a surprisingly human (and still, if I recall, decidedly non-human) way.  Perspective again.  Even the tiniest parts of our world are worthy of stories, of drama and development, and even they are integral to the whole of the larger being.  If you consider that much of the first book, A Wrinkle in Time, was concerned with tesseracts, you might get a sense of how L'Engle played with scale and our perceptions of our surroundings.All of this is to say that Lovelock's underlying idea in Gaia theory, that of deep, fundamental bio-physical interconnection, is a concept I've always been so familiar with that the periodic reminders I get about the relative newness of the concept are a bit of a shock.  Then again, maybe it's not new at all--there seem to be some faint echoes of the medieval sphere theory, though that connection would take more time than I have here to elucidate.  Academically, I know that the understanding of the natural world as something that has value beyond its utility to human beings is relatively new in human history (and still being argued in different forms today).  And yet.Lovelock's theories, while underpinning much of what I value about human ecology and environmentalism, still come across as rather broadly pitched and unproveable in this book.  I know, though, he's written more scientific books on the matter and inspired a long series of scientific conferences and symposia over the past forty years since the book's publication, so I'm trusting that some of the details have been worked out.  Not all, apparently, particularly in biology and biological history, but the concept of a unified system in which all parts affect all others seems to be a pinnacle--or a pediment--to our concept of ecology these days.The funny thing is, Lovelock actually pooh-poohs ecology--particularly human ecology-- in the book a bit.  He doesn't think that humans are the be-all, end-all in the health of Gaia, whose truest, purest warriors appear to be microscopic.  Because of this, he also tends to downplay human influence on the environment, pointing out that some level of life will almost undoubtedly survive any human-made disaster.  He argues that global warming, nuclear war, and other large-scale horrors seem so horrible to us because of the dramatic effects they will have on large mammals, but that they become somewhat less horrible when one takes a global view of things.   Gaia will persevere.  The central tenet of the concept is that there is a base intelligence within the Gaian system, which uses some sort of internal communication to regulate and moderate the various systems comprising the whole and optimize survival.  The coming and going of humanity may not be a fatal blow, just a change.This is where I run into a bit of a snarl: does it make sense to argue that the ongoing health of the large system is dependent on the health of the smaller systems and then claim at the same time that man-made changes like global warming, or even widespread husbandry, don't deeply impact the overall health?  Several times, Lovelock sings the beauty of deeply impacted landscapes like those of the British Isles, commenting on how healthy they seem to him even after human impact.  But what we have become aware of in the last century is how long-reaching an impact the smallest land management choices can have, and their unexpected consequences.  Is it just timing that prevents Lovelock from commenting on this in the 70s, or a different focus as a climatologist, or is he arguing that the Gaian intelligence subconsciously guides our decisions no matter how bad they seem in the present?It is, obviously, a lot to consider.  And I suspect that the significance of Lovelock's book is that it marks one of the first times the ideas have been considered in a scientifically global way (though now I'm thinking of the multiple books of that era which trove to build bridges between modern science and ancient wisdom literature).  That Big Blue Marble, forcing us to look beyond the tips of our noses.  Maybe Lovelock was just part of a crest of a scientific wave, a necessary reminder to look up from the microscope from time to time. We never seem comfortable for too long with both close and distant focal points, so perhaps we're stuck alternating back and forth between them.  I went to see my optician recently, and we briefly discussed contacts.  She told me that, for people who see through astigmatism, or a bent lens, as I do, she can seldom offer an easy prescription.  One eye must be measured for closely proximate vision, one for clear distance vision.  Were I to want to clearly see the world around me, I would be forever squinting through one eye or the other, and keeping the opposite eye closed."

Unfortunately, it is neither as compelling in its arguments nor has it aged as well as Carson’s classic. Lovelock’s book is not science (though Carson may well have been selective in the presentation of some of her science in order to bolster her argument), but rather a plausible but likely untestable hypothesis resting upon a set of scientific data.  Lovelock starts at the very beginning - a very good place to start - by reviewing the earth’s early aeons (billions of years). He suggests that after our planet’s climate had stabilized, life was “an almost utterly improbable event with almost infinite possibilities of happening. So it did.” With respect to the early, stabilized physical environment, he postulates that “the evolution of an active control system, however rudimentary, may have been the first indication that Gaia had emerged from the complex of parts.” He continues, “the history of the earth’s climate is one of the more compelling arguments in favour of Gaia’s existence,” an early example of his ascription of natural cycles and feedback loops to a grander design or motive. The following chapters examine the self-regulation of different environmental systems, including the atmosphere and the sea, as well as the challenge of pollution. Lovelock inevitably concludes that, not only do we live on a very special planet, but that it is no accident that it is so robustly self-regulating.Lovelock’s book is grounded in science, with plenty of charts and explanations, but unlike Carson’s alarming ‘cause and effect’ call to action in Silent Spring, it feels more like scientific deism – some sort of grand design. It’s no surprise that amongst the scientists taking issue with his claim is the renowned Oxford zoologist, Richard Dawkins, whose more recent work includes The God Delusion, and whose early work in The Selfish Gene begs direct comparison to Gaia. The Selfish Gene proposes that it is not biological organisms (including humans) that act so as to maximize the prospect of passing along their genes, but rather it is the genes that direct behavior and cause actions that maximize their own replications – an inverted perspective of traditional biological theory. Both Dawkins’ and Lovelock’s books feature hypotheses that are similarly untestable, but in the case of genetic transmission there is no debate that is the very essence of life, and that it is only the perspective that is novel. In Gaia's case, the perspective is novel, but the proposition that Earth is a living, self-regulating organism is both untestable and a leap of faith.  A second weakness is evident in reading Gaia almost 40 years after its initial publication. In this era of climate change and the strong possibility that humans are tilting the balance beyond Earth's ability to self-repair, the book’s environmental focus may be too descriptive, and its message too anemic as a call to arms.Still, despite the two criticisms outlined above, Gaia is a worthwhile read. It is an important book in positioning how we consider our impact on Earth, and should be read by all with a strong interest in the environment."
21,0192862189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7605433-stephen-palmer,5,"The Gaia hypothesis (now Gaia Theory thanks to lots of scientific work, modelling and testing) was a real bolt from the blue for me. I was immediately hooked by the notion of a global, self-regulating geophysical/biological/climate mechanism. I didn’t fall however for any of the daft New Age additions which, to James Lovelock’s considerable annoyance, began to augment the original hypothesis as his ideas achieved mainstream recognition.Gaia Theory has been made more sophisticated – in the manner of all scientific theories – as the decades have passed, but this original book presents all the core ideas. Later, stout-hearted fundamentalists like Richard Dawkins would mock the theory for being teleological, but Lovelock and his aides answered every question flung at them, to the great benefit of the theory as a whole. Though now called Earth System Theory, it has achieved mainstream recognition. Perhaps Gaia Theory was just too hippy-dippy…Lovelock is unique. A fiercely independent scientist, it was his wide range of skills and experience that made him broad-minded enough to put together hunches, ideas and scientific observations into the fledgling Gaia hypothesis (why is the atmosphere of Mars so different to that of the Earth? How come the amount of oxygen in our atmosphere, despite oxygen’s considerably chemical reactivity, has remained constant over millions of years?).This book, and most of those which followed, helped open the eyes of the scientific community to the dangers of global warming, and much more. Though some of Lovelock’s later claims were themselves overheated, he was at least walking in the right direction. His remarkable autobiography 'Homage To Gaia' explains a lot of the background to the development of the mind that teased Gaia out of our planet’s geophysical environment.Decades on, it’s still a ground-breaking book."
22,0192862189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12490903-tiredstars,3,"Gaia, or How the Earth is like an Oven.James Lovelock's look at life on earth isn't new any more; it's now over thirty years old. I found it rather frustrating, but that might be because it's outside of its original context and disciplines.The idea of Gaia is certainly a powerful one. In short, life on earth functions as the key part of a cybernetic system which regulates the planet in order to maintain conditions suitable for life. So, for example, the sun's output has fluctuated a good deal since the start of life on earth. This should have altered the temperature enough to kill everything off. This hasn't happened, Lovelock claims, because life itself evolved to regulate the temperature.The trouble is that this is little more than a hypothesis (or was when the book was written). Lovelock can firmly identify only a small number of cases to demonstrate his point. Even in those cases he can't figure out the sensing part of the mechanism.In addition, he doesn't give any details about how these interlinked systems actually evolved. It's not an implausible idea, but the book did receive heavy criticism early on from evolutionary biologists.Surprisingly, given the theory's place in the environmental and ecological movements, Gaia is rather unsympathetic to those movements. I think part of that is a reaction to un- or even anti-scientific currents of thought. It's also because Lovelock views life on earth as a more resilient system than other people do. (Cf. the extreme view that Gaia will simply kill humans off.) He doesn't address the issue of timescales, though, and whether humans are changing things faster than Gaia can react.In summary, it's a fairly interesting book, and it's nice and concise, but if you only read one book about life on earth as a cybernetic system, this may not be the best choice."
23,0192862189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/447078-noel,4,"Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth is the first accessible synthesis of what is now known as earth system science. Lovelock lays out an argument that the Earth's oceans, atmosphere and biosphere constitute a single living organism, named Gaia. Although he never actually makes a convincing argument that the Earth is a single living organism (and I am not convinced), Lovelock does lay out a clear argument that biology exerts a fundamental control on the composition of the atmosphere and oceans—as biology evolves, so does the abiotic portions of the Earth's surface. The notion of Gaia is rooted in the ancient concept of Mother Earth, but formed in Lovelock's mind as he was trying to figure out how to recognize life on other planets as a NASA consultant in the 1960s. From this conception flow interesting discussions on how to recognize life and differentiate true life from other self-sustaining entities like computer software. There is also a strong emphasis on how human development has altered the state of the Earth system in ways that won't destroy life on Earth (i.e., Gaia), but will destroy Human life on Earth. Lovelock rightfully recognized early on that the environmental movement should have more emphasis on saving ourselves. Although I feel that the concept of Gaia as a single organism is flawed, Lovelock's book is nonetheless largely correct, and it's an accessible and influential science book that everyone should read. I should point out that Lovelock now claims in more recent books and interviews that Gaia is a metaphor , but in this original book there is no hint at metaphor."
24,0192862189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57886276-owen-moorhead,3,"The central argument of the book is fascinating and persuasive, and when Lovelock sticks to this thesis ""Gaia"" is great. It's also a breezy read, which turned out to be a major plus considering my following qualifications.The problems for me come when he attempts to extrapolate this idea in all kinds of weird directions--this kind of speculation is sketchy at best, and is sometimes so ridiculous that it strains the credulity of the reader (this reader, anyway). These grand pronouncements and prognostications, many of which have not aged well, can detract from the credibility of the main argument. Fortunately, these are mostly relegated to the last two or three chapters.I am probably being a little harsh here, considering that Lovelock stipulates in the foreword that this volume is not intended to be a scientific treatise. Indeed, I remember reading ""The Ages of Gaia"" many years ago and liking it a lot more because it felt more focused on the actual Gaia hypothesis rather than its implications for human society.Nevertheless, I appreciate that Lovelock is attempting to outline a completely new worldview and I'm not exactly bothered by his somewhat heterodox views on pollution, agribusiness, and other environmental issues. I guess the price of a thinker creative enough to theorize a quasi-sentient, self-regulating biosphere is that you also have to listen to all his other ideas."
25,0192862189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14834343-mike,4,"I'm known as an environmentalist. I'm not or will never be a scientist of Lovelock's experience, but I do appreciate that he was given credit for promoting his heretofore unsung ""Western"" hypothesis that the Earth is a homeostatic organism. Aboriginal cultures knew this and agreed with it, and Lovelock acknowledges that in this book. So this book is the first ""scientific"" recognition of which I know that such a self-regulating phenomenon would be possible. For that it's absolutely invaluable. Science is by nature reductionistic, and Lovelock's book works in the opposite direction, toward being inclusionistic. It's interesting that he acknowledges that no single human could ever grasp the whole of science now, and that scientists typically know only a subsection of a single chapter in the book of life or knowledge. True.And, the style of this book would be something used by a learned English man 30 years back, when it was published, to make his science accessible. Lovelock would have been at that point the kind of guy you'd love to meet at the pub night after night, and have him regale you with his hypotheses, and you'd have a fabulous time. For an impatient reader like me, I found myself skipping through many sections to cut to Lovelock's conclusions. But his conclusions are important and well worth your time if you've never been exposed to them. "
26,0192862189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11993337-marjan,0,"Here's a thought: what if the whole planet - OK perhaps not the whole planet, but certainly its biosphere - is just one huge organism. Yes, we've read new age freaks, we have even familiarised ourselves with asian traditions, but the argument is so much more powerful and surprising if it comes from one of the foremost scientists and inventors of our age. So once you get under the skin of this idea, there is no going back.The book starts almost like any book on creation and evolution of life; at times I almost felt like I'm re-reading some of it. But then it takes a surprising turn; where most talk about habitable zones and necessity for stable conditions, Lovelock postulates that those stable conditions are actually a result of life, rather than the other way around (once it gets started). The life collective is manipulating atmosphere, oceans, temperatures and perhaps even volcanic activity to serve its survival ends. There are control mechanisms and feedback loops, there are pathways and information transfer - the whole planet is one giant computer, one giant being... Ain't that a paradigm shift! Certainly worth reading!"
27,0192862189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7392549-helen,4,"I'm not going to get into the science, read the book for that, but basically this book is about Lovelock's pan-theory of how Earth regulates itself in terms of environment and interaction between all biological life and chemical elements. Lovelock identifies Earth's ""conscious"" regulator as the titular Gaia, and credits her with the ability to keep all the earth and all it's inhabitants in constant balance. As you read you realise what a fine balance the environment thrives in and it's fascinating how Gaia keeps it all together. Some of the science is a little too complicated without prior knowledge of chemistry and biology but he gives you a glossary in the back and he doesn't speak in language that is too highbrow scientist. It's a book for lay people and as such is popular science but is really interesting, and worth the read... he has a lot of ideas that could save the planet if applied!!"
28,0192862189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6055915-bernard,4,"A very interesting theory of the Earth as an organism and how it may self-regulate to preserve a stable atmosphere conducive to life. Fascinating segments on such control mechanism such as how methane production might be essential to the regulation of oxygen levels, which in excess would prove disastrous for our planet. Highly recommended for a new perspective on our planet which is somewhat more scientific than the average person preaching the interconnectedness of life. However, I skipped over most of his views on pollution. They don't match up to what we know today and are overly optimistic, although he does recognize environmentalists as having a genuine albeit misguided concern. He dismisses industrial pollution by citing deadly toxins and chemicals found in nature. These views I found issue with were based on information at the time, so I don't know if he still holds them. But in any case, the Gaia theory is what I came to read, and it was quite a thought-provoker. "

To find out more, click here.Gaia, written in a style that combines scientific research with metaphysical musings, is the elaboration of a theory or hypothesis conceived by Lovelock, together with Lynn Margulis. Essentially, it postulates that the physical and chemical condition of the surface of the Earth, of the atmosphere, and of the oceans has been and is actively made fit and comfortable by the presence of life itself. This is in contrast to the conventional wisdom, which holds that life adapted to the planetary conditions as it and they evolved their separate ways."

In fact, every work is a product of its time, and by reading the original you get a glimpse not only into the work itself but also into the Zeitgeist of the era from which the work emerged.Gaia is a book I have wanted to read for a long time. This version is the 2000 reissue with a new preface, corrections, and a further reading list of more recent books.The sections on the atmosphere and the sea are full of fascinating detail that succinctly support the main premise that Gaia is a single system in which life functions as a component. In other words, life is not something that occupies a pre-given environment, but rather, is something that actively shapes its environment."

Reading one finally, I find that James Lovelock is indeed a real, independent scientist. He too has been surprised by how his theses have been hijacked. What Lovelock is trying to figure out are the mechanisms by which our planet self-regulates to the point of keeping the gases in our atmosphere at just the right levels to sustain life. The oceans are certainly involved, as well as the continental shelves. He feels these are vulnerable, as are the tropical forests and scrub lands between 45 degrees Latitude North and 45 degrees South. Man does have a potentially large impact on earth, but perhaps not exactly as popular culture describes it.Excellent book to widen your curiosity space, especially about oceans."
32,0192862189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13659327-jacco,4,"What a wonderfull little book! 'Gaia' expounds the hypothesis that earth itself is a living entity, thereby stressing the interdependence of all living things, from the vast amounts of micro-organisms to the great mammals that roam earth. Reading this as a general interest, I read it mainly because it is just one of the ideas out there I wanted to acquaint myself with. I expected some semi-scientific account, well meaning but suspended by vague New Age sentiments. So I was suprised to find solid science, at least in aim, interspersed with moments of deep love and concern for our planet.Definitely recommended, although some knowledge of chemistry is helpful in reading this book. If you know about redox, enthropy and molarity and the like you're good. "
33,0192862189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/374427-adrienne,3,"I generally like what Lovelock has to say, and I agree with his general premise--that the Earth's living and non-living elements (atmosphere, soil, etc.) work together as a self-regulating system like an organism. This is his first book, written in 1979, and although the few factual problems have been corrected, a lot has happened to the hypothesis in the past 30 years. The ""better"" and more condensed version can be found in 'The Vanishing Face of Gaia,' but the purpose of the books are different. The latter is ""A Final Warning"", as the subtitle says, and Lovelock discusses the future of the world. Both are very interesting (and a little scary) and worth the read."
34,0192862189,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17942027-lage-von-dissen,3,"Lovelock explains his perspective of how the Earth functions as a single organism. The Earth's atmosphere and biosphere ultimately regulate the Earth's temperature in many ways. Once the Earth developed an atmosphere, this created a means for homeostasis, and the life within the biosphere provided a symbiotic relationship to help accomplish this, despite the many changes associated with solar output, etc. Lovelock gives us a new way to look at life on Earth, and I think that this book is worth reading for anyone interested in biology, geology, climatology, and their related sub-fields."

Other important works, like Margulis' Symbiosis and Vernadsky's Biosphere also fit in this category. The important insight here is the use of a new metaphor to stimulate discussion and research.
