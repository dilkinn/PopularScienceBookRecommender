It's not Pink's fault for writing a book that says nothing new at all or the publisher's fault for promoting a book that has absolutely no value whatsoever. I knew what it was when I picked it up. And yet, I am a sucker for self-help books that just regurgitate a bunch of soft science I already read in the New York Times. It's my fault. Don't make the same mistake. Maybe I made this terrible decision in the afternoon? "
2,0735210624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5067228-marianne,4,"4.5★sWhen: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing is the fourth book by bestselling American author, Daniel H. Pink. If we’re making an important life decision, what we decide obviously requires careful consideration. But what about when we decide? Could the time of day that we make a decision be significant? Could the time of day affect how well we learn or do our work? Does it really matter when we have that first cup of coffee? According to Dan Pink, it definitely does.In this intriguing book, Pink examines the importance of good and bad timing. He begins by explaining how our individual chronotype (easily established) determines both our mood and our ability to perform at any given time of the day: how it affects our professional and our ethical judgements, as well as our physical function.But he doesn’t just pontificate on the best time to do something for future success and happiness. He acknowledges that not everyone can control their work environment or the financial climate as they enter the job market. Pink also gives practical suggestions for dealing with less than ideal conditions, as well as hints and tips to improve everyday life. Pink supports his points with data and simple, clear graphs. The depth of his research is apparent in every paragraph, and supported by his extremely comprehensive (26-page) notes section detailing references for each chapter. As well as six suggestions for further reading, Pink includes an 8-page index. But the most useful thing about this book is his Time Hacker’s Handbook: salient points from each section are condensed into summaries full of hints and tips and practical exercises that appear after each of the first six chapters. Pink explains in detail: why having a coffee before a power nap makes sense; why combining a lunch break with an education session at 1pm (as some teaching hospitals do with their Grand Rounds) is counterproductive (ditto 8am lectures for University students); when the worst time to be a hospital patient is, and why; and the reason some people have the so-called “mid-life crisis”. He looks at the effects of starting one’s career during a depressed jobs-market; why a mid-point (in a project, in a career, in a life) can cause a slump or a spark; how to overcome a bad start; when to quit your job; when to get married; when to exercise; the importance of breaks; and much, much more. Illustrating his points are choirs and rowing teams and basketballers and dubbawalas delivering tiffin tins and Hanukkah candles and the captain of the Lusitania. Pink’s fourth book should be compulsory reading for bosses, educators, and schedulers, for policymakers, company executives, and performers, but there is plenty in this fascinating book that the average person will find applicable to their lives. This is a quick read that rewards time spent with some excellent insights. Recommended!"
3,0735210624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,2,"This book is very engaging, even entertaining. It is all about how timing can affect our lives. I didn't read the book--I listened to the audiobook, and it is read by the author, Daniel Pink. Usually, authors do not make good narrators, but this audiobook is definitely the exception. Daniel Pink is a marvelous reader. He brings a good voice, and remarkable enthusiasm to his narration. So, if you are planning to read this book, I wholeheartedly recommend the audiobook version.Unfortunately, what Pink has to say is not all that illuminating. In the preface, he writes that the captain of the Lusitania might have averted sinking by a U-boat during World War I, if only he had not made certain doubtful decisions in the afternoon. Really? Yes, the afternoon is a period when many people's intellectual faculties are ebbing, but it is hard to believe that the captain put his ship at risk as a result. And besides that--he had to make decisions in the afternoon--could he possibly have postponed his decisions? I doubt that.It really is just a coincidence, but while listening to this audiobook, I had been simultaneously reading a print book on a similar theme; The Circadian Code: Lose Weight, Supercharge Your Energy, and Transform Your Health from Morning to Midnight. It is a recently-published book, and Pink probably did not have access to it. But, he could have read the research and results that it describes. If Pink had read the recent research, or had talked to the author who is a leading researcher--perhaps the leading researcher in the field of circadian rhythms, Pink would not have written what he wrote about morning people and night owls. Pink's book simply seems like he is talking off the top of his head. I cannot recommend this book to anyone."
4,0735210624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33738834-peter,3,"I feel I have to stress that the title of this book is very misleading. This book doesn't convey any actual secrets and it also doesn't teach you much about perfecting your timing in any of the various scenarios that it covers. What it does teach you, is that there are certain trends and rhythms in many aspects of one's life, from your daily energy and focus levels to more general feelings and commonalities people experiences during a lifetime. There are also the few obligatory case studies focusing on business aspects and other fields such as education which means that pretty much anyone can find something relatable in this book.Pandering to the masses aside, it's actually a difficult book to actively dislike. Sure, there's very little here that's particularly new or mind-blowing, but the style in which it's written in is very engaging and very easy to follow. Having interesting, scientific case studies set up an idea and then following them up with concise discussions and lessons on the topic just works really well. The topics are also usually very applicable to one's own life, so you're constantly engaging with every topic and thinking of how it applies to you. I think it's fair to say that the author has got the formula for writing this type of non-fiction worked out pretty well.There were a few elements I didn't like though. The ""practical advice"" at the end of each chapter was either very obvious or very 'self-helpy'. What I mean by the latter is that the advice wasn't as practical as it sounded since it required implementing ideas that require a lot of mental effort and aren't very sustainable, much like the advice I've read in many self-help books that very few people can actually follow through on. Another smaller element I disliked was the cherry-picking of data and then using it as the basis for far-reaching theories. This is a common practice in books like this and while I suspect for many cases, the theories actually hold up, making broad generalizations sound like facts is unscientific and annoying. As the stars say, I liked this book. I'd even recommend it to most people simply for the exposure to some of the case studies and ideas brought up. It's a weird book though in that it's both engaging and a bit boring at the same time. The latter is probably due to some unnecessary repetition and foreknowledge of some of the ideas. The issues I had with it were mostly relatively minor though, so don't let my ""average"" rating put you off too much. The only warning I'd give to anyone thinking of reading this book is that you shouldn't go into it expecting to learn how to improve your timing, instead, expect to be made aware of timing related theories that are usually quite insightful."

When-decision times come in so many ways: changing jobs, starting a project, running a marathon, when to exercise... it's importantly to do things not in a haphazard way, especially with important decisions.This book is good when you want to build an ideal schedule, have a fresh start, or see time as a friend, not an enemy. Each chapter has a ""time hacker handbook"" in the end, where you can learn the best bits of the chapter, and use them in your life. You might want to keep a bookmark in this Place to be able to see what things are mentioned in the text and which are just in the main text. At the end are some suggestions for further reading (just books).Plenty of studies are included (examples: Twitter's emotion moods during the day, hospital handwashing, student gym attendace, state of well-being in zoo apes, age of first-time marathon runners, and an interesting study of the dabbawalas of Mumbai, how they work every day).How the text is broken down: Pt.1: the day + breaks in it; Pt.2: beginnings + middles + ends; Pt.3: coordinatings with others + time in language and use.Some things that appear in the text that are interesting to me: - biological clock; lark, owl, & third bird-persons- importance of appointment time- the ”nappucino” (coffee and a nap)- recessions impact on the luck at getting work after graduation- ”midlife crisis” (term since 1965)- 9-enders (ages of 29, 39, 49…): challenges or destruction (of self, cheating etc.) starting thenThis was a good read to me. I found it very helpful – inspiring me, surprising me, making me think. Self-improvement really benefits from good timing, and this book really help you with it. There is certain plenty of ideas for everyone, wherever they are in life. I recommend this :)"
6,0735210624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17023677-christopher-lawson,5,"In WHEN: THE SCIENTIFIC SECRETS OF PERFECT TIMING, author Daniel Pink shares scientific, surprising findings that have serious consequences. Did you know, for instance, that the timing of your surgery is important? Studies show that far more mistakes are made later in the day, so be sure to get a morning appointment! Similarly, if you are in court, the disposition of the judge is a lot more lenient in the morning.To work the most efficiently, it's important to figure out your own cycle of effectiveness--what the author calls ""Waves of the Day."" Each day, our disposition traverses three stages--a peak, a trough, and a recovery. So try to tailor your activities to match the best time for that type of task. For instance, most people do analytical tasks better in the morning, and more insightful tasks in the evening. The worst time to tackle serious problems is in the afternoon--that's the ""trough"" time. That period is your least effective time and ""good for very little."" Use that time to do trivial things like checking e-mail.The author provides a simple way to figure out if you are a ""Lark"" (early bird) or ""Owl"" (late riser). The cycles are different for each chronotype. Also, not all places are equally good for both types. For example, school schedules, with classes beginning early, are setup to favor the ""larks,"" or early-risers. This is unfortunate, since many teens are at their best much later in the day. Here's something really scary: A study of parole judges showed a significant difference in their rulings, based on the time of day. If your hearing was scheduled in the afternoon, you had almost zero chance of winning a parole. However, if the judges took an afternoon break, their disposition drastically changed, and parole was far more likely. The author emphasizes the importance of ""restorative breaks."" These are especially important in countering the low time of the trough. Just a ten-minute break, such as a nature walk, can have an enormous impact. For school kids, taking a break is especially important. One Danish study showed that if students took a 20 minute break before a test, their scores were substantially higher. Restorative breaks should ideally be outside, with nature, and away from work. It's best to be moving, and with others: ""Consider a short walk outside with a friend during which you discuss something other than work.""When you start a task has a lasting effect on our attitude and our success. The author cites statistics showing the career path of graduates based on when they first started their career: ""Beginnings stay with us far longer than we know; their effects linger to the end.""So, starting anew, or a ""fresh start"" helps us recover from a false start. There are many ways and times to do the reset. In the section, ""Eighty-Six Days in the Year when you can Make a Fresh Start"" the author provides suggestions for starting anew. You can re-start on the first of the month, for example, or on an anniversary.I found the ""Science of Endings"" particularly intriguing. Research shows that we tend to remember events based on how they end. So, we can decide to change the ending to make it more positive and memorable: ""If we're conscious of the power of closing moments and our ability to shape them, we can craft more memorable and meaningful endings in many realms of life. . .For example, if you are on vacation, plan a great close: ""You'll enjoy the vacation more, both in the moment and in retrospect, if you consciously create an elevating final experience.""The same priniciple applies at work--end your workday on a positive note. One easy trick is to take a few minutes to jot down your accomplishments for the day. This step of ""recording what you've achieved can encode the entire day more positively."" Ending the day with a moment of gratitude is another easy trick, and is a ""powerful restorative."" (Note: The author includes a surprising item of generiosity in the book itself. I hope you find it!)So all in all, I found WHEN to be a fascinating, fun read. The author is a witty writer, who brings a lot of humor to the subject. His experience as a speech-writer is evident in the quality of the writing. I enjoyed reading about the various studies that illustrated peak times and low times. The statistics showing the correlation of medical mistakes to the time of day was especially alarming. Perhaps the most alarming research was the study showing how parole board judges were stricter later in the day. If I ever have to appear before a parole board, I'm definitely asking the judges to first take a restorative break."
7,0735210624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5159766-l-a-starks,5,"Pink has written a gem of a how-to book that cites and summarizes a huge amount of research on how to get things accomplished more efficiently, despite basic biological/organizational challenges like afternoon lulls and beginning-of-project chaos. Readers will close the book with several ideas about how to make better, happier use of each day's hours. Don't miss the last section on the joys of synchronicity, from crew to choral singing to the tradition in India of lunch delivery.Highly recommended."
8,0735210624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36348070-brandice,4,"I really liked When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing by Daniel Pink. The book was interesting. I was into it from the get-go but the last chapter was probably my favorite - thinking in terms of tenses. The book discusses the factor of time, in many facets of life: The impact of one decision and the timing in which you arrived at that decision. It discusses (among other things) the hidden pattern of every day life, beginnings, midpoints, and ends, synching and belonging, and thinking in tenses. There are also interesting studies to support the points made - for example, it’s better to have surgery in the morning than the afternoon (studies show significantly less mistakes are made in the morning). There’s something to be learned for everyone here. “Experiences of awe bring people into the present moment, and being in the present moment underlies awe’s capacity to adjust time perception, influence decisions, and make life feel more satisfying than it would otherwise.Taken together, all of these studies suggest that the path to a life of meaning and significance isn’t to “live in the present” as so many spiritual gurus have advised. It is to integrate our perspectives on time into a coherent whole, one that helps us comprehend who we are and why we’re here.” Daniel Pink is, and has been, for many years, my favorite non-fiction author. He does a great job describing social studies and uncovering results and tips that can help people be better - at work and in life. His books are comprehendible but more importantly, really interesting - at least they always have been to me. He’s speaking at a local event about When that I look forward to attending soon!"
9,0735210624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30181442-yun,3,"When is an exploration of how timing effects everything we do and achieve. Some things covered in this book include the afternoon slump, how starting your career during a recession affects your lifetime earnings, and how working together with others in a cohesive environment produces more positive results than working alone.This book contains some interesting tidbits, but for me, most of it falls under the category of common sense. Therefore, I didn't feel its points were particularly revolutionary or insightful. The book also feels like a collection of separate ideas, tied together under the common umbrella of time, but they didn't really congeal into a whole. Because of that, some of the conclusions feel forced, as if the author had to stretch hard so that they fit into the concept of time.In the end, this book was a bit of a disappointment for me. It didn't contain enough original or compelling ideas. As a result, I don't feel I got anything new out of this book that I didn't already intuit myself or have read elsewhere."
10,0735210624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4756170-daniel,5,"I am a fan of Pink. In this book he talks about timing. 1. Most people do well in analytical tasks and have better mood in the morning, worse in the afternoon, and slightly better in the evening. That is, except the night owls. 2. Breaks are powerful and improve performance. A power nap of 20 minutes is good; it is even better if one drinks coffee just before the nap so that when one wakes up the coffee perks one up. 3. Beginnings are important. Students who start later for school do better. Graduates who start in a lousy economy earn less throughout their lives. So some sort of debt forgiveness should be given to them. 4. Midpoint can be bad or good. People’s happiness dip during midlife. In competitions, the team that is 1 score behind win more. 5. Endings will always be remembered. 6. Working in synchrony with others makes us happy. 7. People who speak languages with poor tenses ( Chinese, German, Finnish) prepare for retirement more, practice safer sex etc. There are other tidbits of timing: divorce peaks in March and August, 2 months after the holidays. Marry between 25 and 32 is best. Switch jobs every 3-5 years. Interesting and to the point, I learn much from this book. "

Now I believe that everything is timing.What is the book about?When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing is written by Daniel Pink, famed author of books like Drive, A Whole New Mind, To Sell is Human etc. Daniel Pink talks about the importance of timing in this book. According to him, Timing is an emerging science and he explores this science further in ‘When’. Some of the themes he covers in this book include when to change careers, deliver bad news, schedule a class, end a marriage, go for a run, or get serious about a project or a person.What does this book cover?When is a relatively short book with 7 chapters spread across three sections. The first section covers diurnal patterns i.e. how to arrange our daily life, when to drink coffee, the benefits of micro naps etc. The second section covers long terms patterns – how do we start habits, how we are influenced by beginnings and endings, how to deal with mid-life crises etc. The last section covers how to get into harmony with timings.Each chapter is also followed by a time hacking section which has practical advice on timing.Read the full review at my blog Digital Amrit"

Then Daniel H. Pink points out that decisions made by the captain of the cruise ship played a huge role in this tragedy, and coincided specifically with the time of the day.With an abundant introduction of various research methods, involving sentiment analysis and techniques such as DRM, the author describes why a reader should pay special attention to the time at which decisions are made. Thereafter, he introduces the discovery of circadian rhythms which open a plethora of biological concepts of human (and other species) nature.Next, he moves to something that I enjoyed the most – efficient resting strategies.

16,0735210624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4692637-fleurette,4,"I'm not a big fan of non-fiction, but this book turned out to be great.The author is undoubtedly fascinated by the topic of time in human life and is able to convey this fascination to his readers in an amazing way. I reached for this book because I needed it for one of my reading challenges, and not because of any particular interest in this topic. But as soon as I started reading, I was as fascinated by this subject as the author himself. It's a great feeling.At least partly it is due to how this book is written. The author uses very accessible language even though he talks about the results of scientific research, and often also has to use scientific terminology. But he can explain everything very simply and easily. I did not have any moment when I would be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information or in which I would not fully understand what I read. It is also due to the huge number of examples that the author uses. And simple analogies to situations that we know from everyday life.Despite these simplifications, the author did something for which I think I value him the most. He placed a huge number of footnotes and references to specific research results in the text. Each claim he writes finds confirmation in specific scientific research results, in a specific scientific article or scientific work. Not only does this make the information presented by the author credible, but it also allows us to independently expand our knowledge of a subject that will be of particular interest to us. It seems to me that too often we read simply ""Swedish scientists say that ..."". Pink gives the names of these scientists, information on what exactly they research and under what circumstances, and a reference to the results of their research. This book is not only a non-fiction item, but a solid monograph. And at the same time extremely interesting. I also liked how Pink tries to relate the results of this research to our daily lives.This is a truly short book and I would like it to be longer. I will definitely look at other books by this author."

The time of day affects how the brain functions, and early in the day, our minds are more vigilant. For most, alertness and energy levels tend to peak around noon. This means you want to solve all your analytical problems in the morning (when your brain is processing data best), and all your insight problems in the afternoon (you want your filters to be loose).Here are some things that happen when we don’t allow our brains to do things at the “proper” time of day: People go to jail for longer; doing poorly in school is easier due to fatigue after long hours without restorative breaks; the Lusitania is catastrophically torpedoed by the Germans. How the F do we even function?Other statements of fact from Daniel Pink: Lunch is the most important meal of the day.Workout in the morning if you want to burn more fat.Naps are zambonis for your brain, they smooth out all the scratches.Delaying high school start times until 8:30am increased number of high school graduates by 11%. When we are younger (ie. 7yrs old) we are early-to-rise larks, but teenagers (on avg) are owls and perform better later in the day.Truly one of the most interesting books I’ve read in a long time.

On top of that, somewhere midway it started to seem like Daniel picked a time topic, ran out of research and core material and started to fill the book with whatever was even remotely related, and sometimes unrelated, like tips when you should quit your job.

At other times, a not-as-interesting self-help book for the overextended and/or the procrastinator. I recommend you skim over the self-help book and enjoy the popular science book. The popular science book still gives some good ideas about how to behave.There are some pretty terrifying statistics that should give second thoughts to anyone with an appointment for surgery in the afternoon. However, there are also some reassuring paragraphs about the sort of counter-measures that well-run hospitals are taking to remedy the daily mid-afternoon drop in mindfulness by medical staff. There’s evidence presented that naps are good for you and teenagers who start school later on the morning do better. There are no instructions on how to beat into submission the mid-level managers and school board who will inevitably fail to be impressed by the evidence.One chapter said, in summary, that groups of people condemned to work together under deadline never get anything done until 50% of the allotted for the task is wasted.

But unlike a typical productivity book, this one is based on your own rhythms and needs, coupled with what science has said about those things. The biggest take away is that the dip in productivity and clarity in the middle of the day is average across all types of people and maybe is best used not on your brainy tasks, but on the mundane. That, or, prior to those brainy needs mid-day, time is offered for a break, a walk, socializing, or other means of stepping away to unplug and replug. Nothing here is hard to enact. It's a quick and thought-provoking read that, like with any self-help/business/productivity book, is take some, leave the rest.

It’s a book about timing, the “when” side of the “what” coin. When is a lot more critical than most of us assume. And it’s importance is naturally underscored simply because “when” seems less controllable than “what”.But both assumptions are generally wrong. Or at least a bit myopic. We can adapt the what to the when in most cases. And we can control the when, perhaps by starting over, or taking a short break, or even a nap (“Zambonis for our brains”), far more than we may currently imagine.The key is to understand “when” in a more expansive context. And, in the end, that’s what the book strives to do, and does well. Pink puts when in the context of the waves of the day (your chronobiology), the events of the day (the importance of lunch, breaks, naps), the when of getting on track (sometimes you need to re-start), the meaning of when milestones (the importance of midpoints and poignant endings), and the important role of timing in becoming synchronized with the people and the world around us, which, in turn, fosters belonging and a sense of purpose.As is the current trend in books of this genre, the prognosis and the recommendations are scientific, which essentially means that Pink and his researchers have scoured a lot of literature looking for patterns.The problem with patterns, however, is that it is often difficult to know if you are witnessing a causal pattern or a resulting pattern. Pink is clearly aware of the problem and has taken as many steps as can be practically taken to differentiate one from the other. Nonetheless, even in a thorough and responsible research effort such as this, the patterns discerned are ultimately probabilistic, not certain.A related problem is determining which patterns are truly natural and which are acquired. A night owl behaves and performs like the night owls in the study but were they born that way or did they acquire the pattern through prior habit, ingrained out of necessity, not choice? And can those patterns be altered or redefined? (Maybe the stuff of a future book?)Pink, however, is well aware of both of these limitations to research such as is chronicled here. And in addition to navigating around them he makes it work by not over-promising on the conclusions. While the book is inspirational, therefore, it stops short of promising an end to world hunger. And that, compared to many popular books in the genre, I think, gives the work even more credibility and importance.In the beginning, I might warn you, many of the observations and recommendations may strike some readers as plainly intuitive. As a sexagenarian I have to admit that I had, through trial and error, already come to some of the same conclusions the book identifies without the benefit of the scientific research. That’s no claim to fame or attempt to dissuade you from reading it, however. I lost a lot of time getting there on my own and, in the end, Pink does what great researchers and historians ultimately do by rising above the facts and figures. He puts it all into a larger perspective that draws it all together and enhances the impact in a way that I never had. While it’s a minor footnote in the book’s premise, the money line for me had less to do with timing and more to do with the bandwidth of time itself. Pink notes, “By now, it’s well known that 99 percent of us cannot multitask.”I could not agree more. Multitasking, I believe, or attempts to multitask, are killing productivity in the American workplace and, in fact, causing a lot of harm (e.g., texting while driving). Multitasking is a myth and we do people a grave injustice by encouraging it. If your boss tells you that you are good at multi-tasking I strongly recommend you find a new boss.I also agree that contrary to what we are frequently told by our personal coaches and advisors, “living in the present” is a lot less important than understanding the present in the larger context of who we are and why we’re here.All told, this is a very easy and quick read. The writing is crisp and clear and the author has a good sense of humor. It should take no more than a few hours and there are plenty of study guides and worksheets to help you translate the research into actual behavior.Very well done."
27,0735210624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5963979-jim-razinha,4,"I read Dan Pink's Drive before I read his A Whole New Mind, which was a better order because Drive was better written and had a more accurate message than Mind. Okay, a message that resonated better. When is as good as Drive, if not as much a paradigm shifter. But it is still a think prompter.Dan Pink writes an easy read...he's really good at it. Drive is excellent. And, as with Drive, he's very good at summarizing the extensive research he's done on this book - which he provides in his end notes, and encourages his readers to read and check his conclusions. (Some authors don't even provide references...Bill O'Reilly, take note...) Pink looks at timing patterns of the day, associated with beginnings, middles, and endings, and synchronization. There's a lot more behind what he presents. Yet, what he presents...well, I'm a rather informed person but I learn stuff every day...at least I try. Drive may have shifted my paradigms, but When taught me some physiological and behavioral changes that I might just want to make. How did I not know that caffeine disrupted the natural cortisol production of my body? And that I needed to delay my morning extra jolt?Things I do naturally seem to be right according to what Pink shares. Detachment is supposed to be critical - I'm paraphrasing, but...check out and you'll actually check in. Not focusing on something else might just help you actually focus on the task that needs your focus. Time is obviously the focus of Pink's work here, and he talks about short and long term timelines, significance of milestones (holidays, just before decades of life, just after say...New Year's Day...), taking stock of time in general... A point that emphasizes living in the present is [researchers]...found that the experience of awe—the sight of the Grand Canyon, the birth of a child, a spectacular thunderstorm—changes our perception of time. When we experience awe, time slows down. It expands. We feel like we have more of it. And that sensation lifts our well-being. “Experiences of awe bring people into the present moment, and being in the present moment underlies awe’s capacity to adjust time perception, influence decisions, and make life feel more satisfying than it would otherwise.”Yes...our perception changes...I've experienced it. Walking through the redwoods or sequoias...time seems to slow.Lots here, and hidden behind here... worth a read, and maybe a reread read or two. Pink's books have that quality."
28,0735210624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/140090-frank,5,"Very well written, with a touch of humour. The book is about what we feel at different times of day and different times of our life. But not all of the info is practically useful; some of the info is only emotionally useful, but that is still a good thing. For example, it is typical for people to feel a slump, a lack of motivation, in the middle of their lives, and this can take some of the edge of a person's guilt for not getting goals achieved by a set time. Other examples:It is typical to feel the need for a nap in the middle of the afternoon. Taking a nap is good for you, it is restorative, it helps cognitive functioning. The best way to take a nap is to have a coffee immediately before the nap and then take the nap. But the nap should not be longer than 20 minutes, or you'll feel groggy afterwards. And the coffee is to ensure the nap isn't longer than 20 minutes, as it takes that long after consumption for the caffeine to kick in.Most people are more productive in the morning between 7 and 12 and then again between 5 pm and 9 pm. For those people, it is best to do their analytical work between those hours. He gives a questionnaire at the end of the chapter to help you determine if you are one of those people.He gives tips or questionnaires at the end of each chapter.I want to mention that everything is based on others'research in case you're wondering on what Pink bases this book. The references to that research are plenty!! I have to say, though, I can't write on the quality of that research.It's a fast read. In fact, I'll be reading it again and taking notes before I return it to the library. "

31,0735210624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38970458-willian-molinari,5,"Amazing insights if you like to base your decisions on scientific research. Daniel pink read dozens of scientific research and used related to *When* it's good to do things. You can read the papers yourself if you want, the references are there. I really like the tone of the book because it's not showing ""how you should do things"" but instead it shows that there are these studies saying that people usually do better when doing in that particular time.As I'm tracking my data for a while now, I can confirm that many of what was written works for me. It was probably the reason why it got 5 stars, BTW.Here are some of my raw notes about the book:* Mention of the Linda problem (feminist banker)* Internal problem. Reading in an algorithm/methodical way will not solve the problem* Mornings guard us on alert (inhibitory control)* Mood follows a common pattern: peak, trough, rebound* Creative tasks are better done in the non-optimal time, at the rebound.* At the beginning of the day, we tend to do better doing Linda problems (analytical ones) that requires focus, sharpness, vigilance* At the end of the day, we do better-doing coin problems that require less inhibition and resolve* For each three peak, down, rebound people, there's one rebound, trough, peak. Know yourself.* Put the most important task into your peak time and the second most important into the rebound* Don't let mundane task interfere with your peak time* Type, task, time method to determine your peak* Complete the mct questionary online (danpink.com/mct)* Print the table available at danpink.com/chapter1-supplement and use it to understand your type* Exercise in the morning to lose weight. When you exercise after eating you tend to lose 20% less weight because you will consume the energy you acquired in the food instead of fat* Exercise in the morning to boost mood. Even walking the dog is enough* Exercise in the morning to build strength. Testosterone peaks in the morning* Exercise in the evening to avoid lesions. Your muscles tend to be warmer.* Exercising in the evening feels more productive in the afternoon* Drink a cup of water right after waking up, you are usually dehydrated because of sleeping* Avoid coffee right after waking up. Caffeine interferes with the production of cortisol. Drinking it right after waking up makes you more immune to caffeine effects. * Early morning coffee increases our tolerance for caffeine, so you have to drink more to enjoy its benefits. Wait from 1 hour to 90 minutes before drinking it* Breaks during the work time help with the mood and productivity, even micro breaks. Take some time to walk around every hour.* Don't skip breakfast! There's no scientific proof of that.* Lunch is the most important meal of the day. Don't eat while working, don't browse social media while eating, use that time to do focus on things that are not part of the office* Take naps increase performance. It has to be between 10 and 20 minutes, more than that you will wake up sleepy. Coffee before the nap helps to boots even more since caffeine takes around 40 minutes to take effect* Schedule breaks just like you schedule other tasks* Plan your nap. A good time is around 7 hours after you woke up. It's your least productive time* Take a coffee before the nap. The caffeine will fully engage after 25 minutes* If possible, make the naps a routine, otherwise, use it when you feel sleepy* Micro breaks: get a smaller water bottle. It will make you get up to refill it* Walk in nature as a break. If you have a dog use him as an excuseUCLA micro-meditation tips* It's important to know when to start. The beginning of cycles (week, month, year) are usually a chance for a fresh start and motivation* Some starts are out of control. Maybe you'll finish your graduation in the middle of a crisis.* In a hiring program, try to be the first if you are above average and try to be the last if you are an average candidate for the position* An U curve is really common. We do better at the beginning, have a trough, and the get better in the end. It appears in many kinds of activities.* Midpoint effect. Be aware of it and transform oh-no in oh-oh's. Use it to motivate you. Oh-no demotivates and oh-oh motivate according to studies.* We usually perceive the endings more than the rest. In an experiment, they create a guy who is a good CEO for decades but changed in the last years. They had another scenario where the same CEO was bad for decades but good in his last months. We usually consider the better ending as the most moral. We believe the best of people are revealed at the end* We usually narrow our social circles near endings. Change of cities, aging, etc.People usually enjoy ""the last"" thing more than the others. If you give one chocolate each time but you say: ""This is the last one"", there's a big chance that he/she will like it the most* A good ending is not always a happy ending in a traditional sense. In Pixar movies, the main character usually achieves what he wants only to realize it's not what he needs* When to quit your job: do you want to be there for your next work year anniversary? Think about it and start looking for something new in case you don't.* Consider moving if your job doesn't provide challenge and autonomy* Does your boss allow you to do your best work?* Are you outside the 3-4 salary bump window?* Does your daily work align with your long-term goals?* End the days by recording what you have done and planning the new day. If the day was bad, the recording will help to show how much you achieved.* To train sync, find a person to play. She has to say a work at the same time as you. If you say banana and she says bicycle, you now have to say another work that mixes banana and bicycle.* The jigsaw technique.

32,0735210624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8715301-nderson,4,"A very good book about timing.PROS:The book is concise and clear about what it offers. After reading it you will surely feel you have learned more about timing and you will have specific changes that you would like to implement. Indeed, Pink demonstrates once again that he is a very practical person and that he is not writing just to keep the wads piling up, but rather because he truly wants to help himself and the readers. Because of that, you can expect very practical strategies recommended at the end of each chapter and a nice commented bibliography at the end.CONS:Obviously, this book is the result of research. However, it does feel like it is saturated with citations that do not necessarily ""flow"". It actually reminded me of the way I was writing my thesis, and one of the reasons why I did not finish it... Basically, there are several parts in which it feels like, ""oh! we have to use this study we researched about, so let's just put a slightly related sentence at the end of the paragraph and add one more footnote!"" Since I was reading on a Kindle and I was genuinely interested in his actual comments in the footnotes, I checked them all, but I wish he would have used a different symbol to distinguish actual comments from study references.CONCLUSION:This is a nice book. Although I knew for a long time about circadian rhythms and the difference between morning and night people, this book presented everything in such a clear way that just for that is worth the reading. Also, I just love when you see that people are passionate about what they do, and it is obvious that this is one of those authors that ""walks the talk"". In fact, once you read the book, you will see that he is even willing to take concrete actions to show you so. Overall, I liked his book ""Drive"" better, but this is still a nice piece of work."

36,0735210624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,4,"Well worth the read for everyone. If I had rated it ""as a whole"" just past the 1/2 way point I would have rated it 5 stars. But the last 1/3rd of the book, especially the entire Section #3 Synching and Thinking- I wouldn't give above a 3 star. So approximately 3.5 stars for the entire book, but do read the first two parts entirely. You'll be glad you did. Some people from early childhood ""know"" some of these facts. And rhythms. Others don't at any age and seem to ""fight"" the ""fight"" against the hard life tide decade after decade. Always putting themselves into the worse or close to worse ""timing"" of capacities for what they ""own"". Their own cognition, emotion, production or artistic abilities, physical strength peaks- and dozens of other categories for their own mental or wellness happiness. It's so much easier to time ""with"" the tide.This book holds empirical proofs and tons of research (noted and listed) for testing to cycles. Day cycles being prime nature born criteria (testable completely) for sleep and optimal ""abilities"" and/or analytical awareness or other specifically defined skills. Throughout geographic, cultural, economic bents- the curves are similar for all homo sapiens populations. And the populations themselves are divided into 3 basic groups everywhere they exist on Earth. This book will set you into your own with a few easy tests. It's not rocket science. The other studies in the first sections are almost universally accepted too. Although the exercise and short naps ones, with intense proofs have been refuted occasionally. Individually, some are difficult. They are for me. Regardless, if you are able to do them as this author sets- they do seem to work.The summations upon group timings? Some are accurate and fairly simple (midpoint group projects timings are accurate to any size group project on any time frame I've ever worked within for work, school, committee etc. for instance)- but none of that is able to be counted in such empirical proof samples as the first half of the books' timing criteria are/were. The trough period is universal to all humans. One of the very reasons I acted much nastier than I wanted to act, but felt I must act- when someone I loved was set into an ""afternoon"" surgery pattern. Not an easy surgery either. I know myself that I need to do every painful or troublesome or lengthy medical procedure in the morning if at all humanly possible. And that I refrain from choosing any elective surgery or service of any kind at a teaching hospital in Chicago during July or early August. The sections on teenagers rhythms are 5 star too. If you have teens, it's well worth the read. My enjoyment in reading this book was a 5 star. It's right up my alley since I studied and worked in Cognitive Psychology for 3 to 4 years. It was more on tracking/ memory- but this is closely related. We are very different at various times of the day. Or at different points of the year, or ending or starting points like ages that end in a ""9"". It does change individuals' actions and initiations. These can be counted and graphed. I don't understand the low star ratings who say this is all BS. It certainly is not at all. Most of the cycle criteria are not pop psychology or psychobabble. Not when you can repeat proof results/ outcomes by numbers.The last 1/3rd of the book has much tangent material that I thought didn't 100% relate to the entire. Almost as if it became much more personal history and example or other ethnic uses for the ""timing"" phrases and systems that work for humans. Both large groups and individuals. But that's a lot more merely excess summation and far less of a science in any definition, IMHO. Although the Indian ""carrier"" meal delivery system is interesting to read in detail. This is a book I would love all my grand kids to read as they start their careers and life choices (like when to marry, when to move, when to divorce, when to change jobs). I like it so much as appropriate for their ages right (16 to 23)now that I might buy a couple of copies for the Christmas take/steal grab bag finale. It's too late for my own kids. Two of them didn't need it and are power larks (one works out at 5:30 to 6:15 every single day-something I would never or could never begin to contemplate- let alone enjoy). One adult child still does need it (the book) but wouldn't sacrifice any of life's ""fun"" time (as he defines fun time) to try some of tricks/ habits it describes. LOL!The truest tangent fact in this entire book is that the economic outcome of an individual rests in a far, far greater percentage in the state of the economy as they leave their educational paths, than it does for nearly any other feature of ""timing"" in their lives. It's been true for all the individuals of 16 or 20 cases in those closest to me. The fall outs are not only evident in the first 10 years' income either. And it isn't only just recession or borrowing or business curves. It can be disease or lacks of disease. My oldest kid was born the first year that birth control pills were widespread (1968), for instance. And because of that the school class size went down about 7 to 10 pupils during his kindergarten and 1st grade years from the previous year. All kinds of ""timing"" issues were tied to that- both good and bad outcomes. They weren't just good ones, either. It was entirely different too than the child 12 years younger who graduated into a system in which not 1 out of 5 of his friends even had a decent job a 6 months post-graduation. Great book, with just a few tangents extra that told you more about the author than the subject matter, IMHO. Not all people will be able to manage all these tips to ""timing"". But in your health and daily cycles there is immense knowledge which matters here. Please read this book.Lastly, I dedicate this review to my Mother who was a Queen Sicilian Owl in a German Lark cultured world. Swimming against the ""timing"" of the tides truly took its toll on her- but exactly like the Sinatra song she sure did it ""My Way"". Not as much as Edison did, but close."

Pink spends some 200 pages going over beginnings, middles, and endings and how we can use them and our awareness of them to improve our lives.He goes into detail about the daily rhythm of life, not unique to humans, where our mood and productivity improve gradually during the morning, dip substantially after lunch, and gradually rise again late in the day. We should make the most of our morning hours, and avoid too many important tasks, (like surgeries, business meetings, and decisions) during the dip. For the middle of the day, breaks, including naps and outdoor constitutionals do a good job of replenishing our energies.Pink also describes the gain in energies and motivation that happen when people are nearing the end of something. As someone who is 59 this year, I was interested in his research that showed that folks in the ""9"" years of their lives (29,39,49,59) tend to do more bucket list things like finishing a marathon.I liked that he put a section of practical pointers at the end of each chapter both for review and for things that you can do right now to take advantage of the best times to engage in activities.All in all, a solid book on a topic I haven't seen covered exactly this way before."

43,0735210624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82829-abeer-hoque,4,"When by Daniel Pink was a fascinating read, and there are things about it that I’ll think about for a long time, and possibly use to change the way I structure my to-do list (aka life). The main point Pink makes throughout the book is that WHEN you do something (or when something happens to you) is sometimes as important as WHAT. Our abilities and moods change throughout the day - and the fluctuations are much more extreme than we realize. Pink brings the research, from sleep cycles and chronobiology to productivity studies to physiological and psychological effects and more. While he focused a bit too much on corporate work culture in parts, I found at least 80% of the book relevant to my life (as a working artist) and much of that 80% eye-opening. One of the first things to do is identify your chronotype, and there’s an easy calculation Pink offers in the text. I personally fall in with 60-80% of people (early birds/larks and middling/third birds) who follow a similar physical and emotional ebb and flow of our waking hours. This consists of 1) a peak in the morning (late morning for me as a third bird) where it’s best to do sharp focused rational logical types of tasks, 2) a trough in the afternoon - where one might take a micro nap, go for a walk, or maybe even do some kinds of creative work that feed off of looser, less vigilant, insight-seeking brain work, and 3) a smaller rebound in the early evening (again good for some focus and/or creative work). About 20% of people (owls) fall into a reverse pattern (rebound, trough, peak at night). Because most of the working world is geared towards larks and third birds, owls have to make some pretty serious adjustments to be effective and happier on the reg. They’re basically like left-handers in a right-handed world. There were some really interesting studies that showed that meetings and emotions and logical tests had a negative cast in the afternoons, no matter the context. For eg, even if a company were doing well, if they had their investors meeting in the afternoon (versus the morning), the conversation/outcome ended up negative. More horrifyingly to me, if you presented two suspects, one white, one POC, with equivalent rap sheets, the POC was judged more harshly in the afternoon trough (versus equally with the white suspect in the morning). Pink uses the apologist term “mental squishiness” to describe this effect, but basically people are more racist, lazier, and stereotypical during their trough periods. Afternoons are basically NOT the best time to make an important ethical or professional decision, have a relationship talk or therapy session, or perform a medical procedure (medical errors abound in the afternoon!). I loved the section on naps and breaks. I’ve never been a napper but have gradually started to change my ways after reading Matthew Walker’s incredible life-changing book, Why We Sleep (which also expounded on the benefits of naps). Basically I was doing naps wrong - sleeping too long and ending up feeling like grumpy sludge for hours afterwards. But according to Pink, if you keep your nap to between 10-20 mins (set an alarm for 25 minutes - apparently, the average person takes about 7 minutes to fall asleep), it can have IMMEDIATE positive effects for up to 3 hours after the nap! These include: improving cognitive performance, memory, alertness, boosting mental and physical health, and even increasing “flow.” Even simply anticipating a nap can reduce your blood pressure. Outside of this 10-20 minute time range, it appears the ratio of time of recovery to increased performance is not worth it. Taking breaks are another vital way to improve our performance and boost our mood. Basically, trudging through our troughs is not a good strategy, physically or mentally. If you can identify that time of day that you regularly have a trough, or if you find yourself sliding into unproductivity or bad moodiness: plan or take a break. Pink has many suggestions for taking ideal breaks. As you might suspect, tech free breaks (ie not your phone or the internet) are more effective. Frequent short breaks are better than longer infrequent ones. Social breaks (with coworkers or talking to a friend on a phone) and lunch breaks (that additionally replenish energy) are great. And “nature breaks [walking outside, sitting under a tree] may replenish us the most.”There are many compelling studies with kids and breaks - running counter to the move away from recess that’s happening within US school systems. “Kids who have recess work harder, fidget less, and focus more intently.” They also earn better grades, have better social skills, show greater empathy, cause fewer disruptions, and eat healthier food. It seems like a no brainer, along with the reams of research that show later school start times correlating highly with better performance and mood. For whatever reason, we are disinclined to give *when* as much weight as *what* and that's not doing us, or the kids, any favors. The rest of the book was divided into the fascinating and curious effects of beginnings, middles, and ends. A temporal landmark (January 1, next Monday, your birthday, etc) is actually a great psychological tool to get past a false start or a failure. Making a fresh start is like opening a new mental account, validating the act of making New Years resolutions, summer beach body promises, and so on. There was a disheartening section on how starting a career in a weak labour market has permanent negative effects on people’s wages and career tracks. There’s no real way to make a fresh start in those cases - it’s just bad timing. And considering the terrible recession this pandemic year and how it might get even worse, I really feel for all the new graduates out there. Midpoints presented some curious and conflicting effects. There’s a slump that can happen in the middle of a project, but midpoints can also fire people up, leading to a surge of activity that often accompanies the “uh-oh effect” of not having accomplished much until then. In fact, being slightly behind might actually be a motivating factor as seen from studies of sports teams where the team that’s just *slightly* behind at halftime actually has a significantly higher chance of winning the whole game. But you have to acknowledge where you are in a project, set interim goals, hold yourself accountable (to someone else - the public part helps!), and celebrate all the small wins as you go. In productivity tips, “doing a few important things well is far more likely to propel you out of the slump than a dozen half-assed and half-finished projects are.” This is important for me to know because I often have half a dozen half-finished projects on my docket at any given time. It’s hard for me to know how to get any of them done, or even started, without feeling overwhelmed. The trick isn’t to pick the one that will get done the easiest or even the one with the deadline, but just to prioritize any one or two projects, and push the others to a way back burner where I don’t see them until I need to. The joy of completing a project or two will energize the next ones. I know this to be true intuitively but it felt more official to read it in a book. The section on endings was also interesting to me as a writer. Endings “help us energize. They help us encode. They help us edit. And they help us elevate.” There are some strange things about endings - for example how we magnify what happens at the end, to the detriment of all else that came before. Even if someone were a terrible person their whole life, one giant death-bed act of generosity would erase that all in our biased eyes. For all you travelers out there, save something special to do for the last day of your trip - since we tend to remember ends and give them more weight - it’ll help elevate those memories. We also prefer happy endings, BUT the best endings come with a little bit of sad. The sensation of unexpected insight, of transcendence, of getting what we need rather than what we thought we wanted all along - this poignance delivers significance. “In the end, we seek meaning.” The book also validated my practice of writing in a gratitude journal every night before I go to sleep: “Gratitude—with its combination of meaning and social connection—is a mighty restorative.” Along with this end of the day practice, Pink says to take a few minutes to write down what you’ve accomplished: “tracking your dones” encodes your day (and thus life) more positively. There was a chapter towards the end on groups, and how social cohesion leads to great synchrony. As someone who has sung in choral groups since I was a teenager, I was blown away by the research on singing in groups and how truly immense the physiological and psychological payoffs are. For eg, cancer patients who sing in choirs showed an improved immune response after just one rehearsal. Basically we should all join a chorus stat. I also loved Pink’s declaration of nostalgia as more than some weak or sentimental emotion (as is often decried in intellectual and literary circles), but in fact is essential to our well-being. Nostalgia gives the present meaning and connects us to others. It can protect against anxiety and stress, boost creativity, heighten optimism, deepen empathy, and alleviate boredom. As someone who lives perpetually in nostalgia, even for things to come, I consider this a personal victory of my psyche. One last thing I'll mention is about the future and planning for it. If we think of our future self as closely connected to our current self and moment, then “we plan more effectively and behave more responsibly.” Basically, leaving things for ""Future Abeer"" to deal with is not the best strategy, but I think we all knew this on some level. As with nostalgia, the future enhances the significance of the present. So by recording ordinary moments today, you are creating meaningfulness for your future self, presenting a gift of the present, as it were. I noted a zillion passages in When (as you can probably tell) and these are only some of the highlights. It’s a quick fun read and some of the findings and suggestions might change the way you think about time and when you do things. They certainly did for me."

So that's a high bar for Pink to clear. And... yeah, he kinda does. He takes the things I liked about Drive - the mix of scientific research and anecdotes, the cheerful, understated tone, the bite-size practical advice - and applies it to the study of timing. He speaks about the daily cycles and how they affect our attention and creativity, about the significance of beginnings and endings, about the power that mid-points have to either reenergize or demoralize us, and about the productive value of syncronizing with other people. I liked it. But then again, was I likely to dislike a book that says breaks and afternoon naps are good?(Did not fit into the PopSugar Reading Challenge 2020)"
45,0735210624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4719513-ali-sattari,3,"There are lots of wisdom shared in this book a some novel perspective for looking at things. Some sounded like collection of anecdotes or (relatively hasty) generalizations, others were rooted in research.Overall, timing IS important in most human endeavors, so include it in your equations or plans.

This book covers many areas in our normal life. It also gives many ways to easily implement how to do them. It was an enjoyable read. How could I not offer a glowing review for a book that covered the value of singing, in particular, “This Land is Your Land”."
47,0735210624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17187084-sean-goh,3,"Easy read (explains the finishing it in two days, but as with many pop psychology books, feels a little skimpy, like junk food. Don't get me wrong though, the references are solid. Though I can't help but notice the lack of any reference to  Stuart Albert's similarly named work . Which made me feel a little off throughout reading this. TL;DR: Naps are good. Caffeine slingshot naps are better.___All of us experience the day in three stages, a peak, a trough, and a rebound. And about 3/4 of (larks and third birds) us experience it in that order. But about one in four, those whose genes or age make them night owls, experience the day in something closer to the reverse order - recovery, trough, peak.Tip: Don't drink coffee immediately after you wake up. Let your body finish producing cortisol for at least an hour, after cortisol has peaked. Ignore if not a coffee person.A break causes an improvement (in test scores) that is larger than the hourly deterioration. Taking a test in the afternoon without a break produces scores that are equivalent to spending less time in school each ear and having parents with lower incomes and less education.Three principles of successful beginnings - start right (strong start), start again (fresh start), start together (group start).The school start time issue isn't new. But because its a when problem rather than a what problem such as viruses or terrorism, too many people find it easy to dismiss. Whether social or personal, these temporal landmarks allow people to open new mental accounts, i.e. make a fresh start, and leave the mistakes of the past behind. They also help to shake us out of the tree so we can glimpse the forest, i.e. switch to a bird's eye view to take stock of things.If you are the default choice, don't go first. Judges tend to stick with the default when they are tired. If there are many competitors, going later (and best, last) can confer an advantage. Judges would likely have relaxed their idealised standard of excellence, and developed a more realistic baseline.Timing for getting married: Don't rush (but don't wait too long, up to 32 apparently). Those who marry young are more likely to divorce. Also wait till you've completed your education, marriage satisfaction tends to be higher for couples tying the knot after finishing school.The mid-life crisis isn't so sudden, it's more of a gradual sag in perceived well-being. This deflation might come about because of the disappointment of unlived expectations, when you've more than half your life behind you and you have to start closing the door on some dreams. In youth our expectations are too high. In odler age, they're too low.Be aware of midpoints, don't let them remain invisible. And use them to utter an anxious ""uh-oh"" rather than a resigned ""oh, no"".Imagine you're behind, but only a little.What the end of the decade does seem to trigger, for good and for ill, is a reenergised pursuit of significance. Which would explain why a disproportionate number of marathon runners are aged x9 (29,59 etc.)Older people tend to have fewer friends, not because of circumstance (friends dying), but because they've begun a process of active pruning, that is, removing peripheral partners with whom interactions are less emotionally meaningful.At the core of meaningful endings is the emotion of poignancy, a mix of happiness and sadness (SHOUTOUT TO INSIDE OUT). Adding a small amount of sadness to an otherwise happy moment elevates rather than diminishes that moment.The best endings don't leave us happy. Instead, they produce something richer - a rush of unexpected insight, a fleeting moment of transcendence, the possibility that by discarding what we wanted we've gotten what we need.Nostalgia benefits because it delivers two ingredients essential to well-being: a sense of meaning and connection to others."
48,0735210624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,4,"Pink's When sounds like another cliche business/ self help book based on a cute organizational principle that allows for a romp through recent psychological journals. Frankly, it is that. After I'd listened to him in a couple promotional podcasts, I figured there was nothing left to gain beyond reading that people do indeed tend to do great work in the morning, do creative stuff in the evening, and slog through the afternoon. But I'm still glad I borrowed this book from the library when my turn came -- perhaps it arrived at the perfect moment for me, but I suspect it will satisfy most of his fans.I was able to accept much of what I read here, but I was skeptical of Pink's exploration of endings, especially his analysis of why people's social networks decrease as we near the end of our lives. The conventional wisdom here, or at least the conclusion I reach, is that the network gets smaller because its members begin dying off. Pink considers this interpretation but argues that as we get older, we begin to prune our network to focus on meaningful relationships. To be honest, I can see how that could be true, but it seems like the wrong spinI can't help thinking that at a certain point, we're largely bored of most of the people around us, maybe all of them, and we've heard all of their stories a hundred times and have long since tired of politely laughing, but we can't escape all of these people. We call these inescapable people our family and our lifelong friends. I further speculate that as we age, getting to know others becomes increasingly exhausting, which is why we hesitate to expand our networks, especially when times are tough or when we anticipate stressful change. In other words, although I get the sense that some economic analysts would say there's not enough payoff to justify investment, I think exhaustion is the more likely explanation. Finally, I think people do start dying off.On the whole, I was most intrigued by his exploration of beginnings and midpoints and am happy to direct anyone reading this review to those chapters. Like many of Pink's books, this one can be read altogether or in parts."
49,0735210624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2996545-aleya,3,"That was a fascinating read. I'm glad I picked this one up. There's a lot of little tidbits in this book that I'll have to go back and listen to again. It provides an interesting look at time. I won't lie, I'm still a little amused by the Daniel Pink connection to Doctor Who. "
50,0735210624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73060983-carrie-templeton,3,"Nothing mind blowing about this book, but solid reminders of the importance of mindful timing at work, taking breaks, and balancing life."
51,0735210624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3736078-uwe-hook,4,"Daniel Pink’s strength in is books is taking interesting studies and framing them with context to make those individual studies have greater meaning through the connections with other work. It may come across as more self-help than social science, but sometimes self-help is needed. In this case, it is at least grounded in science.In “When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing,” Pink looks at the nature of time in three sections. In the first, he looks at the day, and how we can be self-aware of our own natural patterns to make the most of our days, and order them that will optimize our work and decisions. Importantly, this will vary across individuals, so there is no one-size-fits-all answer.In the second section, he pulls back and explores beginnings, middles, and ends separately – their importance and again how to maximize each step in a project if it is going to last a day or even how to make the most out of your whole life. For many reasons, most my age, the section on middles spoke to me. Finally, there is a section on the importance of syncing up with people around you, if you’re in a chorale group or transporting food in India – being part of a larger whole gives purpose and meaning to your actions and is good for you to boot!What makes it self-helpy is that after each chapter is an unnumbered section with worksheets and advice on how to apply the lessons just covered. It is a quick read – just over 200 pages with several charts and sections broken up so you can fly through it in an evening, so there is pretty good bang for your time investment. I wished for a bit more depth but for a quick read, it was worth my investment. "

Pink, I keep thinking that he is so full of himself and his statistics that he can't see reality.""There are lies, damn lies, and statistics"" keeps roiling through my brain as I listen. Where I am totally with him on making high school starts after rather than before elementary school starting times, (because the reason for that weird scheduling is to allow high schoolers out sooner so that they can work rather than be in school, it isn't good for their need for sleep for their rapidly growing bodies and minds, according to biology rather than social constructs) I cannot agree with him about how seniors become more like larks because of their brains. It's really a function of their kidneys. Really, is he too young to know this? With all the information about sleep out there, his treatment of it felt cursory and dismissive. I wanted more. This comes off as one of those books written for middle managers that get cought between demands for production, and sleepy employees. It's just not the book I wanted. YMMV. "
54,0735210624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43381983-sri-shivananda,4,"A good introduction to the science of chronobiology (the branch of biology concerned with natural physiological rhythms and other cyclical phenomena) and how energy, response, reaction, judgment and decision depend on timing and an internal clock within us. I have a bias for Daniel Pink as an author due to his logical and scientific writing style. Recommend it those interested in productivity hacking."
55,0735210624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2426793-pam,2,"This book is uneven (at best)—a kind of hodgepodge of anecdotes, “helpful” lists and graphs of dubious value. Some of the stories are truly interesting (like the part about the food deliverers in Mumbai), but I think this would have made a better New Yorker article (edited, of course), than a book. "
56,0735210624,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7295013-quinn,2,"While I loved the first book Pink wrote (A Whole New Mind), and liked several others, this one did not inspire me. It seemed (to me) that he gathered a lot of facts on diurnal/nocturnal behavior, a lot of circadian rhythms, and then just piled them on his desk and summarized them. Your opinion may vary. I didn't finish the book--I no longer force myself to complete books. "
