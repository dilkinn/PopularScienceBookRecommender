0,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5914661-jason-yang,3,"As a postdoc in a prominent synthetic biology lab, I picked up this book with great enthusiasm - particularly because George Church has been an important leader in our field.In this work, Dr. Church provides a detailed perspective on the history of synthetic biology. To his credit, he does a good job demystifying the field - often separating science potential from science fiction. Moreover, Dr. Church does a great job explaining in layman terms some of the most important discoveries/milestones in our field; particularly the contributions of his lab.But unfortunately, these strengths were also it's biggest detractors. I find the language distracting - at times implying the reader lacks scientific literacy. Unfortunately, the work also feels very biased - neglecting important contributions from leaders such as Frances Arnold, Adam Arkin, Jim Collins, Mike Elowitz, Jeff Hasty, Wendell Lim, Chris Voight and many, many others. Craig Venter gets a possibly unfair treatment as a subtle villain in the field. That said, it is an unrealistic expectation that such a book would adequately capture the status and future of synthetic biology, as the field is still rapidly evolving.Overall, I find this to be a good book - though something I would only recommend to select individuals. It reads easy, but sometimes pushes future potentials too strongly. George Church is an incredible scientist, but I'm not sure if this is the best way to educate the public about the future of synthetic biology."
1,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9968594-maria,5,"Following a evolutionary timescale, the authors introduce you from the ""greatest story ever"", the story of the genome, all the way to synthetic genomics. Here are some points I found interesting and worth discussing among many other things you could find: First of all, on the Late Hadean period you will be introduced on abiogenesis, is it possible that organic molecules can arise from inorganic molecules? Darwin knew, when he wrote On the Origin of Species, that he wasn't ready to answer this even though he did hypothesize about the primordial soup necessary for the arise of these complex molecules. In the chapter of the Paleocene epoch, they introduce you to the evolution of the mammalian immune system, which is when it took place. This is the epoch that followed dinosaurs extinction around 65-55 myas. Now, with this approach on the immunology system they make an example of how the use of synthetic genomics could be applied on this era. For example, through inserting the lux gene from Vibrio fischeri into a newly engineered invasive organism inv+ E. coli gave the researchers a genetically resided bacterium that could distinguish among cells with different densities and selectively invade on higher density cells such as tumor or cancer cells. So eventually, genetically modified bacteria could be used for cancer treatments. I wonder what people terrified with GMO food products will think about the possibility of inserting a bacteria to treat cancer??? My advise: Don't tell them to avoid panic!Another example of these modified bacteria is the possibility to alter E. coli to synthesize PYY (3-36), which is a peptide produced in mammalian colon cells responsible for satiety regulation. I find this fascinating, as obesity is one of the major health problems we are facing today.Later on, making a stop on the Pleistocene period: the age of massive glaciation and global cooling you will read on Nuclear transfer cloning. What do you think on the possibility to bring back a Neanderthal or a mammoth??? One of the arguments mentioned is that this cloning can introduce new genes back into the pool of species for diversity. Remember that diversity is extremely important on the evolution of our species. Well, wouldn't this be against Natural selection or anti Darwinian??? If their genes were already eliminated by our gene pool why bring them back? What new abilities could this possibly offer to our species. It does sound pretty interesting though, it could definitely give us a better understanding of our and their past. On the Neolithic period: Stone Age and the beginning of agriculture and the greatest transformation towards our civilization. In which he makes an analogy of artificial selection through the domestication of plants and animals with synthetic biology. First ""domesticating"" E. coli to produce insulin, EPO or monoclonal antibodies among other uses through gene modification. Later for production of biofuels, new drugs and GMOs and now on the phase creating synthetic genomic enterprises.Well, I don't want to ruin or spoil your reading because there are many great topics I could endlessly keep on debating on this book and on every chapter you will definitely find something worth discussing or stop and give it a thought. Personally I love genetics and I like to imagine all the fascinating possibilities that synthetic genomics could give rise in our health and our environment. Will the rise of genetic engineering lead us to the development of a better species, perhaps a Homo sapiens 2.0???? and, are we really ready to face the challenges that genetic engineering can give us? I think we are. Of course, science will have to continue facing many challenges regarding ethics, humanism, religion, political and economical, but at the end science is about understanding our past and looking for our best options towards our future and our survival. My recommendation: Read this book. It is well written and in a simple way anyone can understand and enjoy from the RNA era to an epigenetics epilogue, to give you an idea how genetics has and will continue to influence our lives."
2,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2130032-daniel-r,2,I found this book suffered from self-aggrandizing and minutiae which combined to make it a chore to read and understand. It felt that because the authors were involved with much of the material being discussed they focused on a level of detail uninteresting to that of a layperson. It resulted in uneven tone and scope between chapters. I did gain some understanding of synthetic biology and how research around it is progressing but overall I'd give book a pass.
3,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83139-jennifer,4,"Just when I was starting to feel a little self-conscious about my list so far being dominated by graphic novels and children's books, I managed to plow through this tome. Okay, that's an unfair characterization. At times, I was enraptured by this book. I delivered spontaneous lectures to my husband and my co-workers. I posted quotes on Facebook. I engaged in conversation with a cashier who took my money after I spent a lunch period reading voraciously. But to get to these amazing stories, to get to those turns of phrase that were so poetical and profound that I was moved to claim this book as a part of my personal gospel, there was a lot to plow through.To say this book was uneven would be a master understatement. Church gave himself an ambitious structure -- telling the progress of synthetic biology as a parallel to the processes of natural evolution. It was a wonderful concept, and in the places where it worked it was brilliant. But in other chapters it was so clearly forced that I wished he hadn't bothered. I also found it strange where he chose to explain concepts in great detail (like the chirality of organic molecules) and where there seemed to be no attempt to explain at all (exactly how one obtains sequences of synthetic DNA -- something central to most of the enterprises in his book.) Finally, there are so many mentions of Church's own work, Church's various business start-ups and organizations that eventually it prompted some eye-rolling.Why, with all this complaining, would I still give this book four out of five stars? Well, because the content is simply amazing. It is hard to walk away from this book and not be awe-struck at what mere mortals have been able to achieve with the tools of science, hopeful for the future, and even a mystical sense of connection with it all. There are amazing stories in here, of synthetic cyanobacteria that can synthesize diesel fuel from the sun, synthetic organisms that can sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in large quantities, scientists working to resurrect species from extinction, possible treatments for cancer, therapies that could render organisms immune to all viruses, and so much more -- an international competition inspiring college students on shoestring budgets to engineer possible solutions to an astonishing variety of problems.Of course, there are ethical considerations in this work, and there are moments (especially in the very beginning), where Church is annoyingly starry-eyed. But what Church sets out to do here is to impress us with the audacity of his dream. (And how close much of it is to reality!) And I must admit, I'm walking away a little starry-eyed myself. "
4,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15132712-remy,4,"Right out of the gate, I've got to say I didn't care for the layout. It seems a bit haphazard for my tastes. Also, the assumed level of the audience's knowledge on the topic seems to really jump around. Some things got simplified that really didn't need to be, while others were well over my head and had no explanation. Given the expertise of the author, I think this is probably a 'curse of knowledge' problem. There's probably not much he could do about it personally, but having it screened by a terribly uneducated person like me might have helped. Beyond that, I thoroughly enjoyed this book! I had only recently discovered that there was a diy bio-hacking movement when I started reading this. Now I feel much, much more up to speed with the state of the field, and it's great import. I'm amazed that some of the developments from this book ever got by me in the first place, since it seems like they would be big news (of the sort I pay attention to, at any rate).The long and short of it is, read this book or in remarkably few years you're going to encounter some incredible and/or nasty surprises."

Bart: How would I go about creating a half-man, half-monkey-type creature?Mrs. Krabappel: I'm sorry, that would be playing God.Bart: God-schmod, I want my monkey man.
I picked up REGENESIS after reading a number of popular science articles on the promise of synthetic biology. The technological advances being made now are truly astonishing to me--Moore's Law famously has computer processing power doubling every 18 months; in comparison, the speed of DNA sequencing & synthesis improved tenfold every year from 2004 to 2011. In 2011, J. Craig Ventner created the first self-replicating cell with a synthetic genome. A DNA synthesizer that might have cost $100,000 in 1999 can be bought on eBay for less than five hundred bucks. Cutting edge projects can be done by high school students (through the annual International Genetically Engineered Machines--iGEM--contest) or by small companies that resemble Microsoft and Apple in the early days.George Church, a professor at Harvard Medical School, is at the center of that; he's involved in the Personal Genome Project--which hopes to sequence 100,000 people and use the genetic information as a public resource for researchers. His biofuel company uses cyanobacteria to produce diesel; he projects that it could be produced on an industrial scale for $50/barrel, which would be tremendous if it actually pans out. He's pioneered the use of DNA to store data and help conceive of Obama's BRAIN initiative. You may have seen him on the Colbert Report, with a big Moses-style beard, brandishing a tiny dot of DNA that had 20 million copies of his book encoded within it.In REGENESIS, George Church presents himself as the fun uncle of synthetic biology, enthusiastic about all sorts of far-out possibilities for genetic enhancement. We could engineered people out of 'right-handed' molecules rather than left-handed, for example, and thus make these 'mirror humans' immune to normal diseases of all kinds (and unfortunately unable to eat food that wasn't also made of 'right-handed' molecules). We could genetically engineer humans for immunity to all sorts of viruses (some people are already immune to HIV, for example, thanks to a beneficent mutation). He's even in favor of my favorite nutty idea, cloning Neanderthals to see what would happen. (After the hardback copy of this book came out, 300 women contacted him to volunteer themselves as surrogate mother to a Neanderthal child.) The power of this technology is really impressive, and when Church covers that it's fascinating.In the great debate over bio-ethics, I generally fall on the 'I want my monkey-man' side of the equations. I am not particularly sentimental, I don't believe that you can't monkey with human nature (it's human nature to monkey with human nature) or that the present human condition is itself 'natural' in any meaningful way. But sometimes Church's attitude gave me the willies a little bit. When Church referred to E.Coli bacteria as 'tiny, obedient factories"", I found that a little creepy. And while it's fascinating that you can genetically engineer a mouse with enough human DNA to make our antibodies interchangeable (and hence use the mice antibodies to help cure disease), the idea of a patented, proprietary species of mice also bothers me on some fundamental way. (This is a common reaction; you may recall George W. Bush decrying 'animal-human hybrids' in a State of the Union, and President Obama reported having 'real concerns' after the first cell with a synthetic genome was created.)Unfortunately, the book is incredibly uneven. Some chapters of the book are very technical in ways that were hard for me to follow while other portions explain technical subjects with great clarity. Sometimes information is presented in a confusing way; a technical description of the replication of DNA shows up several chapters before the explanation of how that could be used to defeat viral infections. Other times Church seemed to be writing for a very small audience of geneticists, engaging internecine disputes with folks like J. Craig Ventner over things that I didn't entirely understand. And of course Church at times is flogging his own research and startups that he's started, and there I felt as if I had to take his arguments with a grain of slate.Perhaps, given the speed at which the field is changing, it's just hard to write a book that summarizes where it's at and where it's likely to go. However, I think I would have much preferred an attempt by a popular science writer who wasn't so close to the subject he was writing about and who could get a measure of distance from it. Given its likely importance for the future, I think a book like that would be really valuable."
6,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8097460-sai,3,"Torn whether this book is worth recommending or not.. the first two chapters were fine, then the book takes a bit of a downturn only to get pretty fun and engaging in the last two-three chapters.The author, Dr. Church, seems like someone who is a deep thinker and prolific scientist in the field of synthetic biology. He understands his field well and is arguably very excited to talk about it to the masses. Yet, the book suffers in the middle because:- he doesn't explain the university-level concepts in biology and chemistry needed to understand some of the scientific content in the book- he focuses only on what he has personally been part of, almost to the point of coming across as a humblebrag- rambles on in his quirky sense of humour about the goings-on in his field of research that seem really unrelatable as a non-academic readerThe kicker for me was when he spent 3-4 sentences explaining what photosynthesis was, a concept that is taught in science class in early high school, yet didn't stop to explain some of the much more complicated molecular biology and organic chemistry concepts that he casually refers to while explaining his research. It seemed like this book could use a good editor. With that out of the way, I think he does a great break down of the different facets of synthetic biology through the different chapters; I thought the book's organization was pretty clever. Moreover, he is very realistic in addressing some of the downsides of experimenting with DNA in a lab setting and democratizing access to such technology to humanity at large. His thoughts on mitigating these problems were worth a read for me. This, having previously read the paper on Precautionary Principle by Taleb.Overall, synthetic biology is an exponentially growing technology field that is not as appreciated as it should be, and reading this book is a good layperson survey of the relevant research in the field."
7,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7257488-fred-rose,2,"This was a very odd book. It started with a couple of very detailed chapters talking about molecular structure that didn't seem all that relevant to the topic. But then gradually become less and less technical and more and more speculative. Hence the best chapters were the ones in the middle, talking about challenges of cloning extinct species or vaccines/treatments for viruses. Synthetic biology is pretty interesting stuff and will be become more and more relevant to daily lives, so this was a good book to catch up on the topic, as it has really advanced in the last decade. But it was hard to get around the ego of the author sometimes and his rather grandiose claims."
8,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1829065-mike,4,"There are many flaws: too many details about Church's many startups, abrupt switches between relatively technical biological language (for a non-biologist) and language appropriate in a mass market book. In the end, though, these flaws are minor. Church is one of the biggest thinkers of our time, and his ideas are among the most important. We're at the start of a revolution in biology that could dwarf the computer revolution, and Church is among the leaders. If you're at all interested in where science is leading us, this book is essential reading."
9,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,1,"This book started out great and got progressively worse and worse. The authors start by describing one of the most exciting results of genetic engineering, biodegradable plastic that was grown from genetically modified bacterial cultures and go on to describe the incredible potential of this field. Unfortunately the book then shifts tone and while still describing the potential for developing new materials, or improving healthcare, the authors, especially in sections seemed to be written by Church, become more self-aggrandizing and start dwelling on the umpteenth startup company that they started to capitalize on this potential. Similarly, while the book present ever more ground-breaking ideas, like changing the human genome to make humanity immune to viruses (!) the authors become more and more dismissive of genuine concerns about the societal ramifications of these technologies. Overall this book turned from an exciting window into the world of genetic engineering to one of bombastic predictions and obdurate hand-waving in the face of genuine concerns. "
10,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6835722-dave-robison,5,"""Regenesis"" is an amazing read that articulately describes the past and present of synth-bio research and the astonishing achievements of the innovative minds exploring it. In addition, it casts a cautious eye to the future, pointing out the break-throughs that are just around the corner and offers salient questions for what lies beyond.The first chapters were a challenge, addressing the hard science of molecular biology and cellular anatomy, but they laid a foundation for the remarkable content yet to come. What I enjoyed most about it was the clear connection between the research, the people conducting it, and the cultural institutions that contributed or participated in its development. From cover to cover, this was an excellent resource for anyone interested in building a comprehensive overview of the very real biology of the not-so-distant future that will quite literally transform our lives."
11,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1800037-brenda-cooper,4,"A tough read, but worth the workI usually read science books by science writers. This is a science book by a scientist, and thus it was hard for a lay person. I advise not being disheartened by the early chapters. Later chapters touch more on the possibilities and are far more comprehensible for those of us who went to school before they taught DNA. Synthetic biology is fascinating, and the fact that Church is one of the prominent people in the field makes it even more interesting, "
12,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11793962-charles,3," Interesting, but a little disappointing .. Not scientific enough for those who know a little molecular biology; not general enough for those who don't. A few thought-provoking insights, but not as ground-breaking as I thought it would be. A collaborative effort by a scientist-writer and a layman-writer also made for a cumulatively awkward literary style."
13,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91577998-jannik-faierson,2,"Starting this book, I was hoping to gain new insights into the field of biotechnology. By picking up different pieces of knowledge, I consequently wanted to develop a basic understanding. In addition to that, it is the question of how future society may look like that excites me. And it seemed very promising at first. G.M. Church integrated several interesting topics cunningly into the history of life on our planet. Therefore, we learn about the possibilities of genetic engineering through the lens of the past itself. Looking at the table of content, the author cleverly connected the current stages of development with historical episodes. In the beginning, we learn about the underlying biochemical principles by exploring the early development of cells millions of years ago.Radical new opportunities, like recreating mammoths, are equally addressed as struggles and challenges regarding our health and well-being that occurred throughout history. Consequently, the author presents gene-therapy and other techniques as prone to solve these problems in the future.By mapping the course of past industrial revolutions, he also embeds the only recent history of synthetic biology with its successes and dropbacks.And here, I began to struggle with this book.I really enjoyed how the author combined the distinct topics within an embracing theme. But over the course of the single chapters, I felt that he increasingly lost his focus. Especially the later chapters seemed overloaded. There were some scientific facts, personal experiences, and portraits of the academic community mixed repeatedly and without connection. In my opinion, he has framed a great overall scheme but then disregarded the reading coherency and merely stuffed everything that he could think of into the appropriate chapters. This frequently disrupted my reading flow and I was annoyed by the lack of connectivity. Furthermore, I was appalled by many claims and conclusions that G.M. Church draws regarding what we should do in the future- basically about the moral of the story. There is one that troubles me above all else:In the ""epigenetic epilogue"" the author distinguishes some complimentary developmental directions for future society, including the theme privacy vs. publicity. He points out that privacy is a very recent phenomenon, unfamiliar in past societies. Additionally, he compares us to computers and artificial intelligence and the key role of informational transparency, contradicting privacy. Influenced by the alludes and rhetoric questions the reader draws the conclusion that privacy is responsible for many problems in modern society.However, in my opinion, privacy allows the individual to define himself. We all share a certain predisposition that is encoded in our genes and equips us with talents and weaknesses. But we are still (in many ways) free to choose our own destiny. And that means deciding which abilities to foster and which ones to disregard. Thus, it is our choices and our personal goals that define who we are. But that also implies that we have to withdraw traits and habits from others that undermine who we want to be. On the other hand, if we allow that our genetic code, our operation manual, to be published, we will lose the freedom to define ourselves. Our abilities, written down in a four-letter-language, will limit our choices and diminish our freedom. Don't forget it is this opportunity- to choose who we want to be - that equips us with individuality and sets us apart from animals. So should we really trust biologists alone to draw the picture of future human beings?"
14,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101957782-nick-crutchley,4,"With a little bit of knowledge about genetics and molecular machinery, one can really get into the first part of this tome. Discussions of mirror life, virus-resistant humans, and a whole host of other potential benefits from recoding genes, will make one either excited or anxious about the possibilities.The last third of the book loses a star as it recounts the recent history of synthetic biology, that has little analysis or discussion. It goes on and on, and nowhere.I have deducted a star due to the sheer lack of exploration of the impact of synthetic organisms on ecosystems. George Church, being a reductionist, is myopic when discussing the environmental impacts of synbio organisms. A multidisciplinary perspective, with an understanding of the holistic impact of this new biotechnological revolution is needed. In short, a lack of ethics centered on the intrinsic value and rights of other species.However, I added a star back as Church influenced my science fantasy novel, and laid a bedrock for future novels. So, thank you George Church."
15,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8660033-aaron-thibeault,5,"*A full executive summary of this book is available at: http://newbooksinbrief.com/2012/10/30...DNA was only discovered about a century ago, and its structure remained a mystery until about half a century ago, but since this time our knowledge and understanding of DNA has grown immensely (indeed exponentially). What's more, this understanding has evolved to include not just an understanding of how DNA works, but also how it can be manipulated to help advance our ends. The most glaring example here is the phenomenon of genetically modified food. Though not without controversy initially (and some fringe opposition that lives on to this day), it is fair to say that genetically modified food was one of the major scientific advances of the 20th century. Over and above this, our understanding of DNA appeared to reach its most impressive manifestation with the successful sequencing of the human genome in the year 2000.For the genetics professor and pioneering genetic engineer George Church, however, genetically modified food and the Human Genome Project are but the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the potential of genomics. Indeed, since the year 2005, the exponential growth rate in our ability to read and write DNA has increased from 1.5-fold per year (a rate that matches Moore's law), to the incredible rate of 10-fold per year (p. 243). This explosion in scientific and technological progress has resulted in dramatic advancements in the areas of biochemicals, biomaterials, biofuels and biomedicine. What's more, advancements in these technologies are but in their incipient stage, and the future of genomics promises to dwarf these initial achievements. In his new book 'Regenesis: How Synthetic Biology Will Reinvent Nature and Ourselves' George Church takes us through the developments that have occurred recently in the area of genomics, and also where these developments are likely to take us in the future.When it comes to the current state of the field, manipulating DNA has already allowed us to produce organisms with new features, such as foodstuffs with novel properties, greater productivity and nutritional value, and resistance to pathogens. Over and above this, micro-species have been programmed to do such things as detect impurities in drinking water, produce electricity from waste-water (and purify the waste-water in the process), produce blood, produce vaccines, take pictures, and even store information. Indeed, the potential to use DNA as a store of information is already recognized to be the likely next leap in computer science, and is poised to initiate a revolution in informatics (just imagine storing all of the information in Wikipedia [in every language] on a chip the size of a blood cell, for a cost of $1 for 100,000 copies [p. 197]).And, of course, the potential to manipulate genomes does not end with other species: it can also be extended to our own. Actualizing this potential is not far off, and includes such things as increasing intelligence, gaining full immunity to any pathogen (real or hypothetical), and dramatically extending the lifespan (if not removing mortality altogether).In addition to manipulating genomes for the purpose of creating new biological features, the productive capacity of the genome can also be exploited to produce new substances and materials, such as chemicals, plastics, fuels, drugs, and vaccines. Successes in each of these areas has already been achieved, and the field is on the cusp of scaling-up these processes to an industrial scale. What's more, manipulating genes shows the promise of expanding the current repertoire of the building blocks of substances and materials to produce a whole new array thereof.Church's book both is both invigorating and inspiring. However, it should be noted that the book is fairly technical throughout, and will only be easily-digested by a reader who already has a fairly deep understanding of the field. Having said that, an educated general reader equipped with a good amount of patience will have no trouble following the argument, and should learn a great deal in the process. A full executive summary of the book is available at http://newbooksinbrief.com/2012/10/30... A podcast discussion of the book will be available soon."
16,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38668688-eric-pollock,3,"Imagine a world where micro-organisms are the mainstay source for petroleum and clean biofuel, humans are genetically altered and impervious to things like HIV and TB--even the existence of mirror organisms spawned from increasing the number of amino acids and proteins. While it sounds like stuff right out of a science fiction movie Regis and Church provide insight into how the seemingly impossible can be achieved through synthetic biology. Beginning with a history of the evolution of genomics, Church highlights how technology has essentially created an exponential boom in the genomics field enabling scientists to sequence DNA at an unprecedented pace and more importantly--match structure to function of our genes. I thought the stance that some scientists believe evolution has altogether halted was interesting to include--their perspective on how we as humans can now harness the power to control evolution is daunting to think about. Throughout the book there are a ton of ethical questions that come up and you can almost see their ideas moving toward a GATTACA-type world. Based on the information and some of the ongoing research mentioned in this book, it looks like we are outpacing Moore's law and will be interesting to see where the next 10-20 years will take us. "
17,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1720603-baal-of,4,"A fascinating tour of past and current developments in synthetic biology, heavy on speculation about where all of this will eventually lead. The author is an active researcher, and so we get an insider's perspective, although the personal descriptions of research projects can sometime feel a bit self-aggrandizing. Some of the passages detailing lists of companies doing active research were a bit tedious, but then that serves to demonstrate how seriously people are taking synthetic biology. I have a personal bias in favor of GMO and related technologies, and hope that I live long enough to see benefits of personalized medicine, or better yet anti-aging and gene-replacement therapies, but like anything this far on the edge of science, its very difficult to predict what will really happen. In any case, the future will be interesting, and this book gives some glimpses into the many possibilities."
18,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18-graham,2,"This author wants ""an extremely adventurous female"" to help him clone a Neanderthal . Science approaching sci fi."
19,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3055905-nils,3,"The basic pretense of synthetic biology is stated well here: ""Just as computers were universal machines in the sense that given the appropriate programming they could simulate the activities of any other machine, so biological organisms approached the condition of being universal constructors in the sense that with appropriate changes to their genetic programming, they could be made to produce practically any imaginable artifact."" (4) The book mixes a description of the ambitions of synthetic biology, an accessible description of the mechanics of how ""precise molecular engineering"" (206) would work, and the mind-blowing things that could be created if it works, with a matter-of-fact account of just how hard it will be to make work in any predictable and reliable manner. A great of the functioning of cells, particularly the interactions between genetic code and actual growth mechanics, remains ""dark matter."" There is some minimal discussions of the social impacts, mostly focused on the upsides, sanguine about the management of the risks to privacy and equality, considering only that some sort of ""contract"" could protect individuals whose genomes were sequenced and perhaps improved, but with no consideration whatsoever about how this might affect those who either were excluded or opted out from joining the brave new world. A typical passage which captures the style of thinking here entailed: ""Cloning is sometimes viewed as dangerous, but many new technologies go through a phase in which they are actually unsafe, or at least perceived as unsafe, and the technology is banned locally. This is often followed by a phase in which the public demands the technology. For example, railroads. (Or for that matter, automobiles, early examples of which were detested by some because they scared the horses.)"" Note the way this history here not just the trivial fact that the potted history is whiggish, but also the way that the collateral collective effects of automobiles (e.g. global warming) are not considered at all relevant for discussion. Only the immediate, first-order effects are relevant, and those who resist the technology on those grounds are implicitly dismissed as pathetic Luddites standing in the way of inexorable progress. A similar jocular dismissal of Malthus follows, in which the great theologian's concerns are dismissed as ""an outpouring of dire forecasts"" that were simply the result of the fact that Malthus had a toothache when he composed the book. (Not a joke: see page 221.) The invocation of a bon mot by Julian Simon is taken as all the refutation we need to move on from Malthusian concerns. Indeed, the point becomes explicit in the last paragraph of the book: ""The vision of a nearly immortal population squelching the job prospects of youth is strongly reminiscent of Luddite concerns about machines taking over jobs from humans."" (223). Of course, the Luddites were right: the machines did take over jobs from humans, and even though ""the economy"" eventually created new categories of jobs and activities, this typically came far too late for the weavers whose livelihoods and communities had been destroyed by the progress of technology. In short, concerns with transitional and distributional justice are outside the scope of the book."
20,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71595-robert,3,"This is fast paced and somewhat technical tour through the world of synthetic biology as of 2012.Most of the chemistry details went over my head as my knowledge of molecular biology is pretty weak.Also I listened to it in audio book which maybe isn't the best way to absorb detailed scientific information.Church is very enthusiastic about the vast potential for synthetic biology to transform our lives (as can be seen in the title).Some caveats:(1) I found him a bit glib and dismissive of potential objections to some of his radical ideas. If and when some of these things happen, such as creating entire synthetic organisms or genetically engineering humans, they will be some of the most consequential events in human history. I don't think there is a simple answer, but I felt like the philosophical, moral and humanistic objections should at least be taken seriously. This technology could completely change our conception of what it means to be human.(2) I also note (a bit cynically), that progress has been much slower than anticipated. Back when the Human Genome Project was announced as complete in 2000, we expected that we would soon know the genetic cause of all human traits. This has not happened, because the genetic code seems much more complicated than anticipated. So I am rather skeptical if all this stuff that Church is talking about will happen any time soon.Overall it's a good general overview of the field (although already slightly outdated since I'm sure a lot has happened between 2012 and 2020), but probably a bit more suited to someone with a solid biology/chemistry background."
21,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7434712-sandeep-tammu,4,"A talk by George Church about personal genome project prompted me to read this one. Overall, a good introduction to synthetic biology, although it becomes too complex to comprehend sometimes.Each chapter is diverse tackling a specific use case of synthetic biology. Some of the interesting pieces include synthetic bio generated petroleum, engineering E.Coli to specific tasks like generation of drugs, mirror molecules to cure all diseases and specific gene therapies. It is interesting to see most of the innovative first generation bio synthetic companies were a failure. May be the society isn't ready for them yet, or industries don't see the business value yet because the technology is too nascent. But George's pitch and his vision for a better future reads astonishingly beautiful on paper.I had a feeling that the book became too complex at times. If you can tolerate those parts, and skip some of them, you will have a nice, almost science fiction like science book. Very enjoyable read, recommend to who are specifically interested in these areas.!"
22,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/134930-emily,3,"A bit of a slog at times with some inside jokes and elbow jabs the general reader is likely not to be privy to, but an interesting pop-science read. I believe I came across this book through a brief appearance of the author in a PBS science show talking about how he wanted to resurrect the Woolly Mammoth, a la Jurassic Park. Apparently, ancient Woolly Mammoth carcasses are turning up with quite some frequency in Siberia due to climate change and the thawing not-so-perma permafrost. So, there is this ongoing race/struggle to capture usable DNA. Also, apparently, some Siberian residents and animals will eat the carcasses when found, so that plays into the scarcity of suitable specimens. (Cue some freaky story line of a prehistoric microbe wreaking havoc on humanity when released from the permafrost and crossing over to the human population... I'm sure Michael Crichton wrote one like that too). Anyway, the book isn't just about that but, golly, what an interested angle, right?"
23,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/88609119-sam,3,"This book is quite difficult to understand, if you don't have a degree in biology o chemistry, or at least you are absolutely not familiar with life sciences. But if you are, then this will give many interesting insights on the field of genetics and syntetic biology, and also there are many vivid examples of genetic researches. George Church, who has a nice sense of humour, describes so many bold ideas about possible applications of genetics, along with the history of genome evolution, that in some places these ideas seem pretty creepy for unprepared mind. Cloning, resurrection of the extinct species, biological weapon. All these things are pretty scary. However, Church masterfully explains, that all these thing have been in the existence for thousands of years already. And now, the human civilization has gained the ability to take the control of evoltion, which opens new frontiers of live, like transhumanistic transformations (already exist in some individuals) or immortality."
24,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89291245-houston-garcia,5,"George Church is a revolutionary. His vision for the future of synthetic biology and genetic engineering bridges the gap between science fiction and scientific fact. Equally as important, he measures the level of political, social, economic, and even religious roadblocks that genetic engineering (of microbes and human genomes) has experienced since its inception. He ends the book with optimistic recommendations for future research and stresses the need for a balance between strict oversight and research freedom in a world that is making genome alternation/exploration a common practice. This book highlights his creative brilliance and brief moments of the nerdy humor which I would recommend as a good weekend-read for any reader.In other words, BRING BACK THE WOOLLY MAMMOTH!"
25,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7168672-joakim,4,"This books gets a bit technical in the beginning. Do I really need to know where things bond to make a polymer? The chapters are broken down to epochs, so things being technical at first is understandable. As we cross Holocene, the books gets more general in terms of what is possible with synthetic biology. The questions is - what is not possible with synthetic genes? It can even be used to bring back the woolly mammoth..given we find a good sample of germ cells frozen somewhere in ice. It is already being used in creating biofuel. And all this in pre-CRISPR era. If you can hold past the technical chapters this book is an enjoyable read. "

How it can be used for designing reverse-life immune to current viruses.2. What is a way to resurrect extinct species? How far we are from resurrecting mammoths?3.

The book could have looked like just a panel of possible applications of synthetic biology, but I think the authors structured as a whole very well. (The second chapter is a little weird though.) All the possibilities that are open, all the implications they have. Of course, the reader needs to be cautious because there is too much optimism. Also, Church has an ego problem..."

I'm certainly not an expert and found his anecdotes to explain the wide range of applications for gene editing. He takes it a step further by also talking to what the implications of the applications might be. I thought gave counterpoints to those resistant to using edited genes that weren't as strong as they could be, for his point in favor of it carried significant weight in my mind: sustainability, diversity and protection from extinction for the human race (or what we think of as the human race)."

44,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18279352-gunner-laine-hardy,5,A truly revolutionary account of the potential that synthetic biology holds. Strongly recommended for the reader in need of a bit of inspiration.
45,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63827331-paul-cline,5,Enjoyable primer on the dawn of synthetic biology. Narrative is form; not a textbook.
46,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25840660-stephen-malina,0,"Synthetic biology is a burgeoning discipline that stems from a long lineage of genetic meddling. Synthetic biology’s ancestral legacy began when man first selected which seeds to plant based on the traits of the plants that birthed them. In Regenesis by George Church, Church takes the reader through this lineage, canvassing the past thousands of years and then focusing in on the past 30.Church does a good job of balancing technical explanations with interesting anecdotes in the book. Some of the explanations of genetic delivery and manipulation techniques pushed the boundary of what a reader with no biology background could comprehend without consulting outside sources, but never crossed that boundary. Fortunately, Church also displays surprising narrative ability during various discussions of evolution and early genetic meddling by farmers, “The original ancient text is written in the genomic DNA of every being alive today. That text is as old as life itself, and over 1030 copies of it are distributed around the earth, from 5 kilometers deep within the earth’s crust to the edge of our atmosphere, and in every drop of the ocean. A version of this text is found in each nucleated cell of our bodies, and it consists of 700 megabytes of information (6 billion DNA base pairs). It contains not only a rich historical archive but also practical recipes for making human beings. For such a significant text, its translation into modern languages began only recently, in the 1970s.” (pg. 38)Another place in which Church excels is in discussing the safety and security concerns of these technologies. As a consummate optimist, I am admittedly more sympathetic than average towards the acceptance and propagation of these technologies. But, in the context of people like Francis Fukuyama and Bill Bryson decrying all forms of technological progress that attempt to enhance humans, I found Church’s cautious but firm support of transparency, progress, and community involvement in science refreshing and needed. I found Church’s justification for human enhancement compelling and in line with my own thoughts on the topic, “There is already a wide variation in talents among members of the human race, but those with great intelligence, strength, and good health do not claim special rights for themselves on that account. Conversely, those with severe physical and/or mental disabilities are nevertheless accorded full human rights by the legal structures of enlightened democratic governments.” (pg. 228)My only gripe about Regenesis is related to the final section of the book where Church discusses the future of synthetic biology and society broadly. Church neglects to delve into the diverse possibilities he promises will be yielded as a result of these technologies' advancement. This leaves the imagination of future applications of these technologies primarily as an exercise for the reader. This was disappointing because Church, as a world authority on these technologies and as someone who has a history of thinking big, is in the perfect position to speculate on what wonderful outcomes the proliferation of synthetic biology may bring. However, like many scientists before him, for Church, modesty overcomes unbridled imagination."
47,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5974604-jack,3,"It's clear from this book that George Church is an extremely intelligent individual, it is also clear that he has some pretty out-there beliefs when it comes to bioethics and human destiny.The book provides an exciting peak into the (maybe no longer) forefront of synthetic biology. Church describes recent research in his and other labs that have pushed forward technology in genetic sequencing, genetic synthesis, and engineering. While he gives an overview of what some of the technology do (such as the exciting MAGE technology that his lab developed to rapidly generate high levels of genetic variation in microbial populations) it is clear that he wanted to keep the book accessible to the laymen, and so often we don't actually find out how they work.The highlight of the book is probably the visions Church offers as potential future applications of synthetic biology. He describes the possibility of engineering entire chiral mirror organisms and possibly mirror humans out of constituent mirror molecules who will be immune to existing viruses and bacterial pathogens. He also talks about more attainable applications of generating sustainable biofuels or data storage in DNA. Church's thoughts on bioethics are for the most part thoughtful. There is a section where he describes what he believes are the 6 ""industrial"" revolutions of human history with the 7th to be the synthetic biology revolution. He takes care to describe the unintended consequences of each previous revolution, but also emphasizes that for each one, the benefits almost indisputably outweigh the costs. In the last chapters however, he seems to get a little careless ethically when discussing the possibility of synthetically altered ""transhumans."" He dismisses the ethically implications largely by comparing the introduction of transhumans as comparable to the natural diversity that already exists within the human population.In the last chapter, Church spells out his sort-of vision of human future, which as I understand it, essentially consists of human civilization colonizing extraterrestial bodies (getting off this planet). This is confusingly disjointed from the rest of the (biology-themed) book, and echos the occasional rant-i-ness of some of the passages throughout.Overall, there are very interesting ideas and well worth a read, but don't count on it to be a well-crystallized manifesto for the synthetic biology movement."
48,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2110619-steve-walker,4,"Outstanding and fascinating book; the only negative being it was a little dry and difficult for me in a few places. It is absolutely amazing what we are able to do today, let alone in the future. This field has grown exponentially the past 10 years and will continue to explode in knowledge and capability.Did you know we are already capable of creating real life from DNA designed and generated from a computer? Did you know we can store data in the nucleus of a cell, form data storage cells into molecules? We are altering plants and animals and are on the verge of creating custom organisms. We will soon be able to fix and eliminate genetic problems at the embryonic stage and even choose attributes for our children such as hair and eye color. It may not be long before we will be able to introduce the infancy of X-Men type capabilities.We will be able to regenerate body parts and organs, slow down or stop the aging process, incorporate computer hardware into our bodies, introduce man-made organism into our bodies to conduct repair, and many other amazing things. We will be able to alter ourselves.Man is beginning to truly play God. We are cloning extinct species such as Wooly Mammoths and may soon have the ability to bring back many extinct species, including Neanderthal man. What are the ramifications of that?Read this book."
49,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1563200-stephen-davis,4,"To some degree this is a book about the author tooting his own horn to emphasize the number of companies he has helped start, or the research his lab has been working on, or the praise he has been receiving. But in another sense the book highlights the change of natural selection to a field of engineering. As technology has improved so has our understanding of genetics, and we are slowly building up a mapping of genes to their effects. More importantly we are building up an understanding of what can go wrong with the genes, and steps that can be taken to correct them. A move from general medicine to more personal medicine seems to be on the horizon.Synthetic biology seems to be where home brew computing was 30 years ago. And from the numbers presented in this book the rate of change taking place in the genetic world is much higher than was obtained with Moore's law. And we are on the verge of being able to create custom genomes with specific purposes in mind. It is hard to imagine the role synthetic biology will have just as it was hard to imagine the early computers being able to carry on informative conversations with us. The combination of computers and synthetic biology will likely lead to explosive changes in medicine and more."
50,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85924078-jesse-leavitt-gallo,4,"This book hooked me from the start. Church summarized the progression of synthetic biology from its early days in generating bioplastics to the near future science fiction-esque developments of Homo evolutis (Humans 2.0). The chapters in the book are methodically placed to emulate the progression of evolution on Earth from the early Hadean eon to the Anthropocene. Church describes parallels in the classic theory of the RNA world, and how the evolution of self-replicating molecules compares to the accomplishment of modern day researchers building synthetic information storing molecules, such as DNA. As a student studying Chemistry and Biology, I often get overly excited about the future of biotechnology. I'm continuously in anticipation for when our current 6th industrial revolution will surface into every day life. The reality of synthetic biology is often hard to distill from the hype of popular science media, however, Church does a service to students and professionals who need help in grounding themselves from many of the dreams tied to the possibilities of a biotech revolution."
51,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18034587-nicholas-crutchley,3,"With a little bit of knowledge about genetics and molecular machinery, one can really get into the first part of this tome. Discussions of mirror life, virus-resistant humans, and a whole host of other potential benefits from recoding genes, will make one either excited or anxious about the possibilities.The last third of the book loses a star as it is a history of recent history in synthetic biology, that has little analysis or discussion. It goes on and on, and nowhere.I have deducted a star due to the sheer lack of exploration of the impact of synthetic organisms on ecosystems. George Church, being a reductionist, is myopic when discussing the environmental impacts of synbio organisms. A multidisciplinary perspective, with an understanding of the holistic impact of this new biotechnological revolution is needed. In short, a lack of ethics centered on the intrinsic value and rights of other species."

The only reason I didn't give a 5-star was for a couple sections that were too scientific for me personally, and were not as digestible as I would have liked. I would still recommend this book for the overall new and exciting look at where biology is headed. For example, I had no idea how useful bacteria could be. Apparently there is a nearly endless potential to recreate our world for the better through the use of these handy micro-organisms. They can be used for creating mass-virus immunity to creating fuel, and even building materials. The book also discusses cloning, as well as discovering genes that code for anything from an increased lifespan to radiation resistance. Super fascinating read!"
53,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5352344-annie,4,"I quite enjoyed this fun little romp through the history of the genome and the future possibilities our DNA holds. Honestly, my favorite thing about the book was that the authors never talked down to their audience (a pet peeve, especially where pop science is concerned); overall, even with the few bio classes I've taken in college, I found the book easy to digest and well-suited to my status as a biological laywoman. The writing was excellent and occasionally even laugh-out-loud funny. That being said...When asked for an opinion, a scientist friend of mine referred to Church as a visionary with his head in the clouds, and there were points that the book sounded much more like science fiction than science. It was very good science fiction at any rate, and I enjoyed it immensely. "
54,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29141033-wersly,4,"George Church is a fucking genius. If you want to read a science book written by the closest thing modern culture has to a 'mad-scientist-Nikola-Tesla-type-figure,' this is the book. This book jumps chapter-to-chapter radically and fantastically from one application of synthetic biology to another, and is supremely bright and optimistic in all its assessments of the pace and application of the field. I will complain (slightly) that Church foregoes discussing a lot of the nitty-gritty of molecular biology to instead focus on the bigger picture - I understand that this is how popular science writing goes, but I always long for a bit more. Regardless, Church is an out-there dude, definitely somewhat of a utopic visionary, and for that, this book is worth reading."

I was a bit worried it would be over my head. I haven't studied genetics since a college course about 20 years ago. However for the most part the book was an easygoing read. Yes there is a lot of science in it but it is science I am interested in and understand. It is pretty cool to see how far we have come with sequencing DNA.

The book is very much a product of Church's vision, and as such is scattered with unsupported opinions and conjectures as well as Church's achievements. Although this aspect certainly reduces objectivity, I found it part of the book's appeal.One major drawback was that the organization of the book into chapters based on time periods didn't make much sense to me. Many topics were fragmented across the chapters, and adjacent sections often didn't have much relevance."

74,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18279352-gunner-laine-hardy,5,A truly revolutionary account of the potential that synthetic biology holds. Strongly recommended for the reader in need of a bit of inspiration.
75,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63827331-paul-cline,5,Enjoyable primer on the dawn of synthetic biology. Narrative is form; not a textbook.
76,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25840660-stephen-malina,0,"Synthetic biology is a burgeoning discipline that stems from a long lineage of genetic meddling. Synthetic biology’s ancestral legacy began when man first selected which seeds to plant based on the traits of the plants that birthed them. In Regenesis by George Church, Church takes the reader through this lineage, canvassing the past thousands of years and then focusing in on the past 30.Church does a good job of balancing technical explanations with interesting anecdotes in the book. Some of the explanations of genetic delivery and manipulation techniques pushed the boundary of what a reader with no biology background could comprehend without consulting outside sources, but never crossed that boundary. Fortunately, Church also displays surprising narrative ability during various discussions of evolution and early genetic meddling by farmers, “The original ancient text is written in the genomic DNA of every being alive today. That text is as old as life itself, and over 1030 copies of it are distributed around the earth, from 5 kilometers deep within the earth’s crust to the edge of our atmosphere, and in every drop of the ocean. A version of this text is found in each nucleated cell of our bodies, and it consists of 700 megabytes of information (6 billion DNA base pairs). It contains not only a rich historical archive but also practical recipes for making human beings. For such a significant text, its translation into modern languages began only recently, in the 1970s.” (pg. 38)Another place in which Church excels is in discussing the safety and security concerns of these technologies. As a consummate optimist, I am admittedly more sympathetic than average towards the acceptance and propagation of these technologies. But, in the context of people like Francis Fukuyama and Bill Bryson decrying all forms of technological progress that attempt to enhance humans, I found Church’s cautious but firm support of transparency, progress, and community involvement in science refreshing and needed. I found Church’s justification for human enhancement compelling and in line with my own thoughts on the topic, “There is already a wide variation in talents among members of the human race, but those with great intelligence, strength, and good health do not claim special rights for themselves on that account. Conversely, those with severe physical and/or mental disabilities are nevertheless accorded full human rights by the legal structures of enlightened democratic governments.” (pg. 228)My only gripe about Regenesis is related to the final section of the book where Church discusses the future of synthetic biology and society broadly. Church neglects to delve into the diverse possibilities he promises will be yielded as a result of these technologies' advancement. This leaves the imagination of future applications of these technologies primarily as an exercise for the reader. This was disappointing because Church, as a world authority on these technologies and as someone who has a history of thinking big, is in the perfect position to speculate on what wonderful outcomes the proliferation of synthetic biology may bring. However, like many scientists before him, for Church, modesty overcomes unbridled imagination."
77,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5974604-jack,3,"It's clear from this book that George Church is an extremely intelligent individual, it is also clear that he has some pretty out-there beliefs when it comes to bioethics and human destiny.The book provides an exciting peak into the (maybe no longer) forefront of synthetic biology. Church describes recent research in his and other labs that have pushed forward technology in genetic sequencing, genetic synthesis, and engineering. While he gives an overview of what some of the technology do (such as the exciting MAGE technology that his lab developed to rapidly generate high levels of genetic variation in microbial populations) it is clear that he wanted to keep the book accessible to the laymen, and so often we don't actually find out how they work.The highlight of the book is probably the visions Church offers as potential future applications of synthetic biology. He describes the possibility of engineering entire chiral mirror organisms and possibly mirror humans out of constituent mirror molecules who will be immune to existing viruses and bacterial pathogens. He also talks about more attainable applications of generating sustainable biofuels or data storage in DNA. Church's thoughts on bioethics are for the most part thoughtful. There is a section where he describes what he believes are the 6 ""industrial"" revolutions of human history with the 7th to be the synthetic biology revolution. He takes care to describe the unintended consequences of each previous revolution, but also emphasizes that for each one, the benefits almost indisputably outweigh the costs. In the last chapters however, he seems to get a little careless ethically when discussing the possibility of synthetically altered ""transhumans."" He dismisses the ethically implications largely by comparing the introduction of transhumans as comparable to the natural diversity that already exists within the human population.In the last chapter, Church spells out his sort-of vision of human future, which as I understand it, essentially consists of human civilization colonizing extraterrestial bodies (getting off this planet). This is confusingly disjointed from the rest of the (biology-themed) book, and echos the occasional rant-i-ness of some of the passages throughout.Overall, there are very interesting ideas and well worth a read, but don't count on it to be a well-crystallized manifesto for the synthetic biology movement."
78,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2110619-steve-walker,4,"Outstanding and fascinating book; the only negative being it was a little dry and difficult for me in a few places. It is absolutely amazing what we are able to do today, let alone in the future. This field has grown exponentially the past 10 years and will continue to explode in knowledge and capability.Did you know we are already capable of creating real life from DNA designed and generated from a computer? Did you know we can store data in the nucleus of a cell, form data storage cells into molecules? We are altering plants and animals and are on the verge of creating custom organisms. We will soon be able to fix and eliminate genetic problems at the embryonic stage and even choose attributes for our children such as hair and eye color. It may not be long before we will be able to introduce the infancy of X-Men type capabilities.We will be able to regenerate body parts and organs, slow down or stop the aging process, incorporate computer hardware into our bodies, introduce man-made organism into our bodies to conduct repair, and many other amazing things. We will be able to alter ourselves.Man is beginning to truly play God. We are cloning extinct species such as Wooly Mammoths and may soon have the ability to bring back many extinct species, including Neanderthal man. What are the ramifications of that?Read this book."
79,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1563200-stephen-davis,4,"To some degree this is a book about the author tooting his own horn to emphasize the number of companies he has helped start, or the research his lab has been working on, or the praise he has been receiving. But in another sense the book highlights the change of natural selection to a field of engineering. As technology has improved so has our understanding of genetics, and we are slowly building up a mapping of genes to their effects. More importantly we are building up an understanding of what can go wrong with the genes, and steps that can be taken to correct them. A move from general medicine to more personal medicine seems to be on the horizon.Synthetic biology seems to be where home brew computing was 30 years ago. And from the numbers presented in this book the rate of change taking place in the genetic world is much higher than was obtained with Moore's law. And we are on the verge of being able to create custom genomes with specific purposes in mind. It is hard to imagine the role synthetic biology will have just as it was hard to imagine the early computers being able to carry on informative conversations with us. The combination of computers and synthetic biology will likely lead to explosive changes in medicine and more."
80,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85924078-jesse-leavitt-gallo,4,"This book hooked me from the start. Church summarized the progression of synthetic biology from its early days in generating bioplastics to the near future science fiction-esque developments of Homo evolutis (Humans 2.0). The chapters in the book are methodically placed to emulate the progression of evolution on Earth from the early Hadean eon to the Anthropocene. Church describes parallels in the classic theory of the RNA world, and how the evolution of self-replicating molecules compares to the accomplishment of modern day researchers building synthetic information storing molecules, such as DNA. As a student studying Chemistry and Biology, I often get overly excited about the future of biotechnology. I'm continuously in anticipation for when our current 6th industrial revolution will surface into every day life. The reality of synthetic biology is often hard to distill from the hype of popular science media, however, Church does a service to students and professionals who need help in grounding themselves from many of the dreams tied to the possibilities of a biotech revolution."

It goes on and on, and nowhere.I have deducted a star due to the sheer lack of exploration of the impact of synthetic organisms on ecosystems. George Church, being a reductionist, is myopic when discussing the environmental impacts of synbio organisms. A multidisciplinary perspective, with an understanding of the holistic impact of this new biotechnological revolution is needed. In short, a lack of ethics centered on the intrinsic value and rights of other species."
82,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2684619-reiden,4,"For anyone interested in an optimistic look on the future of synthetic biology, this book is a must read! The only reason I didn't give a 5-star was for a couple sections that were too scientific for me personally, and were not as digestible as I would have liked. I would still recommend this book for the overall new and exciting look at where biology is headed. For example, I had no idea how useful bacteria could be. Apparently there is a nearly endless potential to recreate our world for the better through the use of these handy micro-organisms. They can be used for creating mass-virus immunity to creating fuel, and even building materials. The book also discusses cloning, as well as discovering genes that code for anything from an increased lifespan to radiation resistance. Super fascinating read!"
83,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5352344-annie,4,"I quite enjoyed this fun little romp through the history of the genome and the future possibilities our DNA holds. Honestly, my favorite thing about the book was that the authors never talked down to their audience (a pet peeve, especially where pop science is concerned); overall, even with the few bio classes I've taken in college, I found the book easy to digest and well-suited to my status as a biological laywoman. The writing was excellent and occasionally even laugh-out-loud funny. That being said...When asked for an opinion, a scientist friend of mine referred to Church as a visionary with his head in the clouds, and there were points that the book sounded much more like science fiction than science. It was very good science fiction at any rate, and I enjoyed it immensely. "
84,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29141033-wersly,4,"George Church is a fucking genius. If you want to read a science book written by the closest thing modern culture has to a 'mad-scientist-Nikola-Tesla-type-figure,' this is the book. This book jumps chapter-to-chapter radically and fantastically from one application of synthetic biology to another, and is supremely bright and optimistic in all its assessments of the pace and application of the field. I will complain (slightly) that Church foregoes discussing a lot of the nitty-gritty of molecular biology to instead focus on the bigger picture - I understand that this is how popular science writing goes, but I always long for a bit more. Regardless, Church is an out-there dude, definitely somewhat of a utopic visionary, and for that, this book is worth reading."
85,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5904441-laurie,4,"I've always loved genetics. I saw George Church, the author, on a tv show and he mentioned this book just coming out. I was a bit worried it would be over my head. I haven't studied genetics since a college course about 20 years ago. However for the most part the book was an easygoing read. Yes there is a lot of science in it but it is science I am interested in and understand. It is pretty cool to see how far we have come with sequencing DNA. What more can we do with DNA and what shoud we do with it? The field of genomic engineering is one I'd be greatly interested in persuing, especially In how to integrate personal genomes and pharmacy,"
86,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5790439-ian-lindstrom,4,"Gives a very good context concerning genetic modification by exploring not only the science & history but the business, legal, and cultural aspects. Church has the understanding & earned the right to discuss the implications & future of genetic engineering, which gives what he says some, well, lots of weight. He does become increasingly speculative, which might annoy some science readers, but I prefer to hear a little of the 'wildest dreams' on the future of a tech from someone who helped to pioneer its development. All in all; it lays out the good & bad, gives an understanding of the possibilities, & provides a context. Fun read."
87,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76337-clark,5,"I already had a pretty profound interest in synthetic biology before I picked up this book and I genuinely think it the most interesting, transformative field of scientific research currently going. It's tough for me to really step back from this book and judge whether it is completely accessible for a lay audience, but it certainly seemed to be written in an approachable, canny way. Some of the ideas are way out there, but a lot of the thought is brilliant, astounding, and realistic. If you have any interest in the kind of biology that could solve major industrial and health problems, you should absolutely give this book a read."
88,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15918679-forest-tong,4,"Sprawling, rambling, inhomogeneous, but glorious account of various applications of synthetic biology from thousands of years ago to only a couple of years ago, two examples being mirror humans and recombinant bacteria. The book is very much a product of Church's vision, and as such is scattered with unsupported opinions and conjectures as well as Church's achievements. Although this aspect certainly reduces objectivity, I found it part of the book's appeal.One major drawback was that the organization of the book into chapters based on time periods didn't make much sense to me. Many topics were fragmented across the chapters, and adjacent sections often didn't have much relevance."
89,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60644385-nikolas-larum,4,"Genetic engineering has been an intellectual hobby of mine since 1999 when I began seriously researching the Nephilim of Genesis 6. Many of the articles I read then warned of what was to come in bio-engineering. Much that was theoretical then is old hat now. George Church is very prominent in the GE field. He compares the science used to sequence the human genome to the Stone Age compared to where the science is today. This book reads like science fiction, but it is scientific intent. And it is terrifying. Science may be amoral, but scientists are not. Humans beware!"

135,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63827331-paul-cline,5,Enjoyable primer on the dawn of synthetic biology. Narrative is form; not a textbook.
136,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25840660-stephen-malina,0,"Synthetic biology is a burgeoning discipline that stems from a long lineage of genetic meddling. Synthetic biology’s ancestral legacy began when man first selected which seeds to plant based on the traits of the plants that birthed them. In Regenesis by George Church, Church takes the reader through this lineage, canvassing the past thousands of years and then focusing in on the past 30.Church does a good job of balancing technical explanations with interesting anecdotes in the book. Some of the explanations of genetic delivery and manipulation techniques pushed the boundary of what a reader with no biology background could comprehend without consulting outside sources, but never crossed that boundary. Fortunately, Church also displays surprising narrative ability during various discussions of evolution and early genetic meddling by farmers, “The original ancient text is written in the genomic DNA of every being alive today. That text is as old as life itself, and over 1030 copies of it are distributed around the earth, from 5 kilometers deep within the earth’s crust to the edge of our atmosphere, and in every drop of the ocean. A version of this text is found in each nucleated cell of our bodies, and it consists of 700 megabytes of information (6 billion DNA base pairs). It contains not only a rich historical archive but also practical recipes for making human beings. For such a significant text, its translation into modern languages began only recently, in the 1970s.” (pg. 38)Another place in which Church excels is in discussing the safety and security concerns of these technologies. As a consummate optimist, I am admittedly more sympathetic than average towards the acceptance and propagation of these technologies. But, in the context of people like Francis Fukuyama and Bill Bryson decrying all forms of technological progress that attempt to enhance humans, I found Church’s cautious but firm support of transparency, progress, and community involvement in science refreshing and needed. I found Church’s justification for human enhancement compelling and in line with my own thoughts on the topic, “There is already a wide variation in talents among members of the human race, but those with great intelligence, strength, and good health do not claim special rights for themselves on that account. Conversely, those with severe physical and/or mental disabilities are nevertheless accorded full human rights by the legal structures of enlightened democratic governments.” (pg. 228)My only gripe about Regenesis is related to the final section of the book where Church discusses the future of synthetic biology and society broadly. Church neglects to delve into the diverse possibilities he promises will be yielded as a result of these technologies' advancement. This leaves the imagination of future applications of these technologies primarily as an exercise for the reader. This was disappointing because Church, as a world authority on these technologies and as someone who has a history of thinking big, is in the perfect position to speculate on what wonderful outcomes the proliferation of synthetic biology may bring. However, like many scientists before him, for Church, modesty overcomes unbridled imagination."
137,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5974604-jack,3,"It's clear from this book that George Church is an extremely intelligent individual, it is also clear that he has some pretty out-there beliefs when it comes to bioethics and human destiny.The book provides an exciting peak into the (maybe no longer) forefront of synthetic biology. Church describes recent research in his and other labs that have pushed forward technology in genetic sequencing, genetic synthesis, and engineering. While he gives an overview of what some of the technology do (such as the exciting MAGE technology that his lab developed to rapidly generate high levels of genetic variation in microbial populations) it is clear that he wanted to keep the book accessible to the laymen, and so often we don't actually find out how they work.The highlight of the book is probably the visions Church offers as potential future applications of synthetic biology. He describes the possibility of engineering entire chiral mirror organisms and possibly mirror humans out of constituent mirror molecules who will be immune to existing viruses and bacterial pathogens. He also talks about more attainable applications of generating sustainable biofuels or data storage in DNA. Church's thoughts on bioethics are for the most part thoughtful. There is a section where he describes what he believes are the 6 ""industrial"" revolutions of human history with the 7th to be the synthetic biology revolution. He takes care to describe the unintended consequences of each previous revolution, but also emphasizes that for each one, the benefits almost indisputably outweigh the costs. In the last chapters however, he seems to get a little careless ethically when discussing the possibility of synthetically altered ""transhumans."" He dismisses the ethically implications largely by comparing the introduction of transhumans as comparable to the natural diversity that already exists within the human population.In the last chapter, Church spells out his sort-of vision of human future, which as I understand it, essentially consists of human civilization colonizing extraterrestial bodies (getting off this planet). This is confusingly disjointed from the rest of the (biology-themed) book, and echos the occasional rant-i-ness of some of the passages throughout.Overall, there are very interesting ideas and well worth a read, but don't count on it to be a well-crystallized manifesto for the synthetic biology movement."
138,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2110619-steve-walker,4,"Outstanding and fascinating book; the only negative being it was a little dry and difficult for me in a few places. It is absolutely amazing what we are able to do today, let alone in the future. This field has grown exponentially the past 10 years and will continue to explode in knowledge and capability.Did you know we are already capable of creating real life from DNA designed and generated from a computer? Did you know we can store data in the nucleus of a cell, form data storage cells into molecules? We are altering plants and animals and are on the verge of creating custom organisms. We will soon be able to fix and eliminate genetic problems at the embryonic stage and even choose attributes for our children such as hair and eye color. It may not be long before we will be able to introduce the infancy of X-Men type capabilities.We will be able to regenerate body parts and organs, slow down or stop the aging process, incorporate computer hardware into our bodies, introduce man-made organism into our bodies to conduct repair, and many other amazing things. We will be able to alter ourselves.Man is beginning to truly play God. We are cloning extinct species such as Wooly Mammoths and may soon have the ability to bring back many extinct species, including Neanderthal man. What are the ramifications of that?Read this book."
139,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1563200-stephen-davis,4,"To some degree this is a book about the author tooting his own horn to emphasize the number of companies he has helped start, or the research his lab has been working on, or the praise he has been receiving. But in another sense the book highlights the change of natural selection to a field of engineering. As technology has improved so has our understanding of genetics, and we are slowly building up a mapping of genes to their effects. More importantly we are building up an understanding of what can go wrong with the genes, and steps that can be taken to correct them. A move from general medicine to more personal medicine seems to be on the horizon.Synthetic biology seems to be where home brew computing was 30 years ago. And from the numbers presented in this book the rate of change taking place in the genetic world is much higher than was obtained with Moore's law. And we are on the verge of being able to create custom genomes with specific purposes in mind. It is hard to imagine the role synthetic biology will have just as it was hard to imagine the early computers being able to carry on informative conversations with us. The combination of computers and synthetic biology will likely lead to explosive changes in medicine and more."
140,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85924078-jesse-leavitt-gallo,4,"This book hooked me from the start. Church summarized the progression of synthetic biology from its early days in generating bioplastics to the near future science fiction-esque developments of Homo evolutis (Humans 2.0). The chapters in the book are methodically placed to emulate the progression of evolution on Earth from the early Hadean eon to the Anthropocene. Church describes parallels in the classic theory of the RNA world, and how the evolution of self-replicating molecules compares to the accomplishment of modern day researchers building synthetic information storing molecules, such as DNA. As a student studying Chemistry and Biology, I often get overly excited about the future of biotechnology. I'm continuously in anticipation for when our current 6th industrial revolution will surface into every day life. The reality of synthetic biology is often hard to distill from the hype of popular science media, however, Church does a service to students and professionals who need help in grounding themselves from many of the dreams tied to the possibilities of a biotech revolution."
141,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18034587-nicholas-crutchley,3,"With a little bit of knowledge about genetics and molecular machinery, one can really get into the first part of this tome. Discussions of mirror life, virus-resistant humans, and a whole host of other potential benefits from recoding genes, will make one either excited or anxious about the possibilities.The last third of the book loses a star as it is a history of recent history in synthetic biology, that has little analysis or discussion. It goes on and on, and nowhere.I have deducted a star due to the sheer lack of exploration of the impact of synthetic organisms on ecosystems. George Church, being a reductionist, is myopic when discussing the environmental impacts of synbio organisms. A multidisciplinary perspective, with an understanding of the holistic impact of this new biotechnological revolution is needed. In short, a lack of ethics centered on the intrinsic value and rights of other species."

I would still recommend this book for the overall new and exciting look at where biology is headed. For example, I had no idea how useful bacteria could be. Apparently there is a nearly endless potential to recreate our world for the better through the use of these handy micro-organisms. They can be used for creating mass-virus immunity to creating fuel, and even building materials.

I found Church’s justification for human enhancement compelling and in line with my own thoughts on the topic, “There is already a wide variation in talents among members of the human race, but those with great intelligence, strength, and good health do not claim special rights for themselves on that account. Conversely, those with severe physical and/or mental disabilities are nevertheless accorded full human rights by the legal structures of enlightened democratic governments.” (pg. 228)My only gripe about Regenesis is related to the final section of the book where Church discusses the future of synthetic biology and society broadly. Church neglects to delve into the diverse possibilities he promises will be yielded as a result of these technologies' advancement. This leaves the imagination of future applications of these technologies primarily as an exercise for the reader. This was disappointing because Church, as a world authority on these technologies and as someone who has a history of thinking big, is in the perfect position to speculate on what wonderful outcomes the proliferation of synthetic biology may bring. However, like many scientists before him, for Church, modesty overcomes unbridled imagination."
167,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5974604-jack,3,"It's clear from this book that George Church is an extremely intelligent individual, it is also clear that he has some pretty out-there beliefs when it comes to bioethics and human destiny.The book provides an exciting peak into the (maybe no longer) forefront of synthetic biology. Church describes recent research in his and other labs that have pushed forward technology in genetic sequencing, genetic synthesis, and engineering. While he gives an overview of what some of the technology do (such as the exciting MAGE technology that his lab developed to rapidly generate high levels of genetic variation in microbial populations) it is clear that he wanted to keep the book accessible to the laymen, and so often we don't actually find out how they work.The highlight of the book is probably the visions Church offers as potential future applications of synthetic biology. He describes the possibility of engineering entire chiral mirror organisms and possibly mirror humans out of constituent mirror molecules who will be immune to existing viruses and bacterial pathogens. He also talks about more attainable applications of generating sustainable biofuels or data storage in DNA. Church's thoughts on bioethics are for the most part thoughtful. There is a section where he describes what he believes are the 6 ""industrial"" revolutions of human history with the 7th to be the synthetic biology revolution. He takes care to describe the unintended consequences of each previous revolution, but also emphasizes that for each one, the benefits almost indisputably outweigh the costs. In the last chapters however, he seems to get a little careless ethically when discussing the possibility of synthetically altered ""transhumans."" He dismisses the ethically implications largely by comparing the introduction of transhumans as comparable to the natural diversity that already exists within the human population.In the last chapter, Church spells out his sort-of vision of human future, which as I understand it, essentially consists of human civilization colonizing extraterrestial bodies (getting off this planet). This is confusingly disjointed from the rest of the (biology-themed) book, and echos the occasional rant-i-ness of some of the passages throughout.Overall, there are very interesting ideas and well worth a read, but don't count on it to be a well-crystallized manifesto for the synthetic biology movement."

He compares the science used to sequence the human genome to the Stone Age compared to where the science is today. This book reads like science fiction, but it is scientific intent.

Synthetic biology’s ancestral legacy began when man first selected which seeds to plant based on the traits of the plants that birthed them. In Regenesis by George Church, Church takes the reader through this lineage, canvassing the past thousands of years and then focusing in on the past 30.Church does a good job of balancing technical explanations with interesting anecdotes in the book. Some of the explanations of genetic delivery and manipulation techniques pushed the boundary of what a reader with no biology background could comprehend without consulting outside sources, but never crossed that boundary. Fortunately, Church also displays surprising narrative ability during various discussions of evolution and early genetic meddling by farmers, “The original ancient text is written in the genomic DNA of every being alive today. That text is as old as life itself, and over 1030 copies of it are distributed around the earth, from 5 kilometers deep within the earth’s crust to the edge of our atmosphere, and in every drop of the ocean. A version of this text is found in each nucleated cell of our bodies, and it consists of 700 megabytes of information (6 billion DNA base pairs). It contains not only a rich historical archive but also practical recipes for making human beings. For such a significant text, its translation into modern languages began only recently, in the 1970s.” (pg. 38)Another place in which Church excels is in discussing the safety and security concerns of these technologies. As a consummate optimist, I am admittedly more sympathetic than average towards the acceptance and propagation of these technologies. But, in the context of people like Francis Fukuyama and Bill Bryson decrying all forms of technological progress that attempt to enhance humans, I found Church’s cautious but firm support of transparency, progress, and community involvement in science refreshing and needed.

225,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63827331-paul-cline,5,Enjoyable primer on the dawn of synthetic biology. Narrative is form; not a textbook.
226,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25840660-stephen-malina,0,"Synthetic biology is a burgeoning discipline that stems from a long lineage of genetic meddling. Synthetic biology’s ancestral legacy began when man first selected which seeds to plant based on the traits of the plants that birthed them. In Regenesis by George Church, Church takes the reader through this lineage, canvassing the past thousands of years and then focusing in on the past 30.Church does a good job of balancing technical explanations with interesting anecdotes in the book. Some of the explanations of genetic delivery and manipulation techniques pushed the boundary of what a reader with no biology background could comprehend without consulting outside sources, but never crossed that boundary. Fortunately, Church also displays surprising narrative ability during various discussions of evolution and early genetic meddling by farmers, “The original ancient text is written in the genomic DNA of every being alive today. That text is as old as life itself, and over 1030 copies of it are distributed around the earth, from 5 kilometers deep within the earth’s crust to the edge of our atmosphere, and in every drop of the ocean. A version of this text is found in each nucleated cell of our bodies, and it consists of 700 megabytes of information (6 billion DNA base pairs). It contains not only a rich historical archive but also practical recipes for making human beings. For such a significant text, its translation into modern languages began only recently, in the 1970s.” (pg. 38)Another place in which Church excels is in discussing the safety and security concerns of these technologies. As a consummate optimist, I am admittedly more sympathetic than average towards the acceptance and propagation of these technologies. But, in the context of people like Francis Fukuyama and Bill Bryson decrying all forms of technological progress that attempt to enhance humans, I found Church’s cautious but firm support of transparency, progress, and community involvement in science refreshing and needed. I found Church’s justification for human enhancement compelling and in line with my own thoughts on the topic, “There is already a wide variation in talents among members of the human race, but those with great intelligence, strength, and good health do not claim special rights for themselves on that account. Conversely, those with severe physical and/or mental disabilities are nevertheless accorded full human rights by the legal structures of enlightened democratic governments.” (pg. 228)My only gripe about Regenesis is related to the final section of the book where Church discusses the future of synthetic biology and society broadly. Church neglects to delve into the diverse possibilities he promises will be yielded as a result of these technologies' advancement. This leaves the imagination of future applications of these technologies primarily as an exercise for the reader. This was disappointing because Church, as a world authority on these technologies and as someone who has a history of thinking big, is in the perfect position to speculate on what wonderful outcomes the proliferation of synthetic biology may bring. However, like many scientists before him, for Church, modesty overcomes unbridled imagination."
227,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5974604-jack,3,"It's clear from this book that George Church is an extremely intelligent individual, it is also clear that he has some pretty out-there beliefs when it comes to bioethics and human destiny.The book provides an exciting peak into the (maybe no longer) forefront of synthetic biology. Church describes recent research in his and other labs that have pushed forward technology in genetic sequencing, genetic synthesis, and engineering. While he gives an overview of what some of the technology do (such as the exciting MAGE technology that his lab developed to rapidly generate high levels of genetic variation in microbial populations) it is clear that he wanted to keep the book accessible to the laymen, and so often we don't actually find out how they work.The highlight of the book is probably the visions Church offers as potential future applications of synthetic biology. He describes the possibility of engineering entire chiral mirror organisms and possibly mirror humans out of constituent mirror molecules who will be immune to existing viruses and bacterial pathogens. He also talks about more attainable applications of generating sustainable biofuels or data storage in DNA. Church's thoughts on bioethics are for the most part thoughtful. There is a section where he describes what he believes are the 6 ""industrial"" revolutions of human history with the 7th to be the synthetic biology revolution. He takes care to describe the unintended consequences of each previous revolution, but also emphasizes that for each one, the benefits almost indisputably outweigh the costs. In the last chapters however, he seems to get a little careless ethically when discussing the possibility of synthetically altered ""transhumans."" He dismisses the ethically implications largely by comparing the introduction of transhumans as comparable to the natural diversity that already exists within the human population.In the last chapter, Church spells out his sort-of vision of human future, which as I understand it, essentially consists of human civilization colonizing extraterrestial bodies (getting off this planet). This is confusingly disjointed from the rest of the (biology-themed) book, and echos the occasional rant-i-ness of some of the passages throughout.Overall, there are very interesting ideas and well worth a read, but don't count on it to be a well-crystallized manifesto for the synthetic biology movement."
228,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2110619-steve-walker,4,"Outstanding and fascinating book; the only negative being it was a little dry and difficult for me in a few places. It is absolutely amazing what we are able to do today, let alone in the future. This field has grown exponentially the past 10 years and will continue to explode in knowledge and capability.Did you know we are already capable of creating real life from DNA designed and generated from a computer? Did you know we can store data in the nucleus of a cell, form data storage cells into molecules? We are altering plants and animals and are on the verge of creating custom organisms. We will soon be able to fix and eliminate genetic problems at the embryonic stage and even choose attributes for our children such as hair and eye color. It may not be long before we will be able to introduce the infancy of X-Men type capabilities.We will be able to regenerate body parts and organs, slow down or stop the aging process, incorporate computer hardware into our bodies, introduce man-made organism into our bodies to conduct repair, and many other amazing things. We will be able to alter ourselves.Man is beginning to truly play God. We are cloning extinct species such as Wooly Mammoths and may soon have the ability to bring back many extinct species, including Neanderthal man. What are the ramifications of that?Read this book."
229,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1563200-stephen-davis,4,"To some degree this is a book about the author tooting his own horn to emphasize the number of companies he has helped start, or the research his lab has been working on, or the praise he has been receiving. But in another sense the book highlights the change of natural selection to a field of engineering. As technology has improved so has our understanding of genetics, and we are slowly building up a mapping of genes to their effects. More importantly we are building up an understanding of what can go wrong with the genes, and steps that can be taken to correct them. A move from general medicine to more personal medicine seems to be on the horizon.Synthetic biology seems to be where home brew computing was 30 years ago. And from the numbers presented in this book the rate of change taking place in the genetic world is much higher than was obtained with Moore's law. And we are on the verge of being able to create custom genomes with specific purposes in mind. It is hard to imagine the role synthetic biology will have just as it was hard to imagine the early computers being able to carry on informative conversations with us. The combination of computers and synthetic biology will likely lead to explosive changes in medicine and more."
230,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85924078-jesse-leavitt-gallo,4,"This book hooked me from the start. Church summarized the progression of synthetic biology from its early days in generating bioplastics to the near future science fiction-esque developments of Homo evolutis (Humans 2.0). The chapters in the book are methodically placed to emulate the progression of evolution on Earth from the early Hadean eon to the Anthropocene. Church describes parallels in the classic theory of the RNA world, and how the evolution of self-replicating molecules compares to the accomplishment of modern day researchers building synthetic information storing molecules, such as DNA. As a student studying Chemistry and Biology, I often get overly excited about the future of biotechnology. I'm continuously in anticipation for when our current 6th industrial revolution will surface into every day life. The reality of synthetic biology is often hard to distill from the hype of popular science media, however, Church does a service to students and professionals who need help in grounding themselves from many of the dreams tied to the possibilities of a biotech revolution."
231,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18034587-nicholas-crutchley,3,"With a little bit of knowledge about genetics and molecular machinery, one can really get into the first part of this tome. Discussions of mirror life, virus-resistant humans, and a whole host of other potential benefits from recoding genes, will make one either excited or anxious about the possibilities.The last third of the book loses a star as it is a history of recent history in synthetic biology, that has little analysis or discussion. It goes on and on, and nowhere.I have deducted a star due to the sheer lack of exploration of the impact of synthetic organisms on ecosystems. George Church, being a reductionist, is myopic when discussing the environmental impacts of synbio organisms. A multidisciplinary perspective, with an understanding of the holistic impact of this new biotechnological revolution is needed. In short, a lack of ethics centered on the intrinsic value and rights of other species."
232,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2684619-reiden,4,"For anyone interested in an optimistic look on the future of synthetic biology, this book is a must read! The only reason I didn't give a 5-star was for a couple sections that were too scientific for me personally, and were not as digestible as I would have liked. I would still recommend this book for the overall new and exciting look at where biology is headed. For example, I had no idea how useful bacteria could be. Apparently there is a nearly endless potential to recreate our world for the better through the use of these handy micro-organisms. They can be used for creating mass-virus immunity to creating fuel, and even building materials. The book also discusses cloning, as well as discovering genes that code for anything from an increased lifespan to radiation resistance. Super fascinating read!"
233,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5352344-annie,4,"I quite enjoyed this fun little romp through the history of the genome and the future possibilities our DNA holds. Honestly, my favorite thing about the book was that the authors never talked down to their audience (a pet peeve, especially where pop science is concerned); overall, even with the few bio classes I've taken in college, I found the book easy to digest and well-suited to my status as a biological laywoman. The writing was excellent and occasionally even laugh-out-loud funny. That being said...When asked for an opinion, a scientist friend of mine referred to Church as a visionary with his head in the clouds, and there were points that the book sounded much more like science fiction than science. It was very good science fiction at any rate, and I enjoyed it immensely. "
234,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29141033-wersly,4,"George Church is a fucking genius. If you want to read a science book written by the closest thing modern culture has to a 'mad-scientist-Nikola-Tesla-type-figure,' this is the book. This book jumps chapter-to-chapter radically and fantastically from one application of synthetic biology to another, and is supremely bright and optimistic in all its assessments of the pace and application of the field. I will complain (slightly) that Church foregoes discussing a lot of the nitty-gritty of molecular biology to instead focus on the bigger picture - I understand that this is how popular science writing goes, but I always long for a bit more. Regardless, Church is an out-there dude, definitely somewhat of a utopic visionary, and for that, this book is worth reading."
235,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5904441-laurie,4,"I've always loved genetics. I saw George Church, the author, on a tv show and he mentioned this book just coming out. I was a bit worried it would be over my head. I haven't studied genetics since a college course about 20 years ago. However for the most part the book was an easygoing read. Yes there is a lot of science in it but it is science I am interested in and understand. It is pretty cool to see how far we have come with sequencing DNA. What more can we do with DNA and what shoud we do with it? The field of genomic engineering is one I'd be greatly interested in persuing, especially In how to integrate personal genomes and pharmacy,"

Church has the understanding & earned the right to discuss the implications & future of genetic engineering, which gives what he says some, well, lots of weight. He does become increasingly speculative, which might annoy some science readers, but I prefer to hear a little of the 'wildest dreams' on the future of a tech from someone who helped to pioneer its development.

285,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63827331-paul-cline,5,Enjoyable primer on the dawn of synthetic biology. Narrative is form; not a textbook.
286,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25840660-stephen-malina,0,"Synthetic biology is a burgeoning discipline that stems from a long lineage of genetic meddling. Synthetic biology’s ancestral legacy began when man first selected which seeds to plant based on the traits of the plants that birthed them. In Regenesis by George Church, Church takes the reader through this lineage, canvassing the past thousands of years and then focusing in on the past 30.Church does a good job of balancing technical explanations with interesting anecdotes in the book. Some of the explanations of genetic delivery and manipulation techniques pushed the boundary of what a reader with no biology background could comprehend without consulting outside sources, but never crossed that boundary. Fortunately, Church also displays surprising narrative ability during various discussions of evolution and early genetic meddling by farmers, “The original ancient text is written in the genomic DNA of every being alive today. That text is as old as life itself, and over 1030 copies of it are distributed around the earth, from 5 kilometers deep within the earth’s crust to the edge of our atmosphere, and in every drop of the ocean. A version of this text is found in each nucleated cell of our bodies, and it consists of 700 megabytes of information (6 billion DNA base pairs). It contains not only a rich historical archive but also practical recipes for making human beings. For such a significant text, its translation into modern languages began only recently, in the 1970s.” (pg. 38)Another place in which Church excels is in discussing the safety and security concerns of these technologies. As a consummate optimist, I am admittedly more sympathetic than average towards the acceptance and propagation of these technologies. But, in the context of people like Francis Fukuyama and Bill Bryson decrying all forms of technological progress that attempt to enhance humans, I found Church’s cautious but firm support of transparency, progress, and community involvement in science refreshing and needed. I found Church’s justification for human enhancement compelling and in line with my own thoughts on the topic, “There is already a wide variation in talents among members of the human race, but those with great intelligence, strength, and good health do not claim special rights for themselves on that account. Conversely, those with severe physical and/or mental disabilities are nevertheless accorded full human rights by the legal structures of enlightened democratic governments.” (pg. 228)My only gripe about Regenesis is related to the final section of the book where Church discusses the future of synthetic biology and society broadly. Church neglects to delve into the diverse possibilities he promises will be yielded as a result of these technologies' advancement. This leaves the imagination of future applications of these technologies primarily as an exercise for the reader. This was disappointing because Church, as a world authority on these technologies and as someone who has a history of thinking big, is in the perfect position to speculate on what wonderful outcomes the proliferation of synthetic biology may bring. However, like many scientists before him, for Church, modesty overcomes unbridled imagination."
287,0465021751,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5974604-jack,3,"It's clear from this book that George Church is an extremely intelligent individual, it is also clear that he has some pretty out-there beliefs when it comes to bioethics and human destiny.The book provides an exciting peak into the (maybe no longer) forefront of synthetic biology. Church describes recent research in his and other labs that have pushed forward technology in genetic sequencing, genetic synthesis, and engineering. While he gives an overview of what some of the technology do (such as the exciting MAGE technology that his lab developed to rapidly generate high levels of genetic variation in microbial populations) it is clear that he wanted to keep the book accessible to the laymen, and so often we don't actually find out how they work.The highlight of the book is probably the visions Church offers as potential future applications of synthetic biology. He describes the possibility of engineering entire chiral mirror organisms and possibly mirror humans out of constituent mirror molecules who will be immune to existing viruses and bacterial pathogens. He also talks about more attainable applications of generating sustainable biofuels or data storage in DNA. Church's thoughts on bioethics are for the most part thoughtful. There is a section where he describes what he believes are the 6 ""industrial"" revolutions of human history with the 7th to be the synthetic biology revolution. He takes care to describe the unintended consequences of each previous revolution, but also emphasizes that for each one, the benefits almost indisputably outweigh the costs. In the last chapters however, he seems to get a little careless ethically when discussing the possibility of synthetically altered ""transhumans."" He dismisses the ethically implications largely by comparing the introduction of transhumans as comparable to the natural diversity that already exists within the human population.In the last chapter, Church spells out his sort-of vision of human future, which as I understand it, essentially consists of human civilization colonizing extraterrestial bodies (getting off this planet). This is confusingly disjointed from the rest of the (biology-themed) book, and echos the occasional rant-i-ness of some of the passages throughout.Overall, there are very interesting ideas and well worth a read, but don't count on it to be a well-crystallized manifesto for the synthetic biology movement."
