0,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8739994-darrel,3,"I am a fan of Frans DeWaal's and have read much of his work. I think he has been instrumental in opening up our view and making us less homocentric. Unfortunately, this book seems like something his editor asked him to write so as to catch the current secular wave. There is so much he could have written but didn't and so much he did write and should not have. His incessant focus on the art of Hieromimous Bosch is inexplicable. Why spend so much time discussing a piece of art (even if it is a masterpiece), when there is so much he could have told us about primates and human ethics, etc. I cannot and do not see how Bosch contributes anything to his argument. Through out the book I felt like things were just getting interesting when he would revert back to art criticism.On the other hand, his explication of bottom up morality and ethics is important and there is no doubt that religion has usurped our natural desire for harmony and fairness, and taken credit for it. It is a good argument and demonstration by way of his and other's research with primates and I applaud him for that. When he gets into discussing the new atheists, he seems a bit out of touch. He criticizes them, but seems unaware of the driving force behind much of the movement - church state separation, religious child abuse, political control of school boards, etc. Yes, he makes passing reference to some of these issues and to the anti science of many religionists, but he seems to need to throw a bone to the religious while ignoring much of what is done in the name of their religion. He is probably correct, that religion is not going to disappear any time soon, but I see no need for pandering to patriarchal religions.While critical of the new atheists, he observes that Humanism is not anti religion and was not in its beginning. That may be a bit loose with the facts, but even if correct, the reason Humanism has become more aggressive of late if largely because the accommodationist approach has done nothing but emboldened the religionists. Playing nice with the Catholic Church does not stop child rape. Playing nice with evangelicals does not stop preachers preaching politics from the pulpit. Playing nice with Pentecostals does not stop religious child abuse. Playing nice with the Black Church does not stop ministers from taking the last dime from a single mom for the promise of prosperity or heaven later. Sure, we may get our ethics from natural tendencies in our species, but it is not enough to simply make that argument and then lay low on the whole issue of religion and its impact on our species. He seems unaware of the real emotional, psychological and social damage that religion does to millions of people even as they proclaim religious morality and ethics. He duly notes that we are a hierarchical species, but fails to show how such hierarchies can be high jacked by religion and used to oppress and distort our natural fairness instincts.I wish he had done a more complete analysis of religion and morality rather than constantly giving religion a pass or the benefit of the doubt. If he is going to talk about religion, it seems to me that he needs to be a good deal more interested in how it actually works in our species. His only attempt seems to be in the last chapter where he tries to look through the eyes of the bonobo. It doesn't work. I will not recommend this book. I struggled to get through it because there is insufficient information or argument to be worth the time investment. If you have not read any of his other works, this may be worth your time that is why I give it three stars, but why not just read his best stuff and let this one pass. There are far better authors to read on morality and ethics."
1,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6069526-taede-smedes,5,"A book about religion from one of the foremost primatologists in the world. In this brilliant book, De Waal defends his thesis that morality is not an invention of religion, but that religion is a cultural scaffolding that builds upon and enhances biologically innate moral rules. Even more, De Waal acknowledges that religion is so deeply engrained in human nature that it has become one of the defining characteristics of humanity. Interestingly, De Waal’s conclusions resonate deeply with the findings of the cognitive science of religion (De Waal hints to this resonance himself in the final chapter). I am curious to see where this will go in the future.Moreover, even though De Waal explicitly admits he is an atheist himself, he argues against the militant new atheists (whose behavior he describes as having a religious zealousness), that religion should perhaps not be done away with before atheism is able to come up with an equally solid and generally convincing scaffolding. Not surprisingly, some of these atheists, such as Sam Harris, have already responded to De Waal’s view with ridicule.This is a highly interesting multi-layered book: it is a book about the biological and evolutionary roots of human morality; it also is a book with numerous anecdotes showing how moral behavior is already displayed by non-human primates and even other animals like elephants and dogs; and it is a philosophical meditation on what it means to be human. De Waal is an optimist. He dismisses the idea that humans are born evil and that morality is meant to keep our evil tendencies in check. He believes that humans are social animals, being born to cooperate and support each other. But De Waal is also a realist in that he recognizes that such cooperation and support is extremely volatile and difficult to maintain. I found this book a delightful read. And as a philosopher of religion and a theologian, taking science very seriously, I wholeheartedly agree with De Waal’s analysis and conclusions. "
2,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/440651-dov-zeller,4,"Frans De Waal makes a well researched and eloquent argument about the source of human morality. He is not feverishly opposed to organized religion, though he is an atheist. He is opposed to the kind of violence that any kind of fundamentalist mind-set can bring. He describes empathy, and, by extension, morality as a mammalian and certainly a primate thing. He sees its formulation as a'bottom up' rather than 'top down' approach, arguing that morality doesn't come from religion but from the mammalian need and capacity for communal living. De Waal doesn't doubt the importance of religion and/or spirituality as forms of spiritual and cultural nourishing and sees their value as great organizing forces. But he carefully argues that all social animals (except the occasional psychopath) are by nature and neurology moral and empathic beings who rely at least as much on cooperation as on competition. This is a very good book. There are a few things I would argue with. One is his assertion that science is a recent invention and that religion is more inherent and as old as we are. I suppose it depends on what one means by science, but if one means the observation of natural phenomenon. Well, how about this. Here is a dictionary definition.The intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behavior of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment.And I am pretty sure, when reading this, that science is at least as old as religion, and that the two are not always so far apart. They both, at their best, allow for and encourage wonderment, reverence, appreciation, etc. I could write a book about this book, and I may write a longer review at some point, but for now, going to end with some quotes.There is no evidence whatsoever that sexual violence is heritable. (104)on GouldI agree with Gould that we gain little from evolutionary guesswork about each and every human behavior. Gould made himself any enemies, though, by voicing skepticism. Several skirmishes between him and the evolutionary establishment unfolded in the pages of the New York Review of Books in 1997. It was a sight to behold, all those outsized egos tumbling over each other with innuendos, criticism by hearsay, name-calling (one was ridiculed as another’s ‘lapdog’), or acting as if they’d never heard of one another. The vitriol obviously didn’t help them close ranks. Creationists were rubbing their hands in delight and exploited the row to their own ends as was reflected in remarks about the theoretical discord in places as unexpected as the Miss USA Pageant. Someone should have nominated those Darwinists for a Darwin Award.But this confrontation was nothing compared with the reaction to another Gould opinion. An atheist himself, he declared science and religion compatible well before neb-atheists decided they were not. Following his untimely death, in 2002, Gould thus became a lightning rod for his lack of intolerance. (104)More GouldSOMETHINGISM In his famous essay, published in the same year as the above loveliest with fellow evolutionists, Gould recalled running into a group of lunching priests at the Vatican. The priests expressed worry about a new brand of creationism that had sprung up , known as intelligent design. They asked Gould why on earth evolution was still under attack. In his essay, the paleontologist comment on the profound irony that he, an ex-Jew, had to reassure Catholic priests that evolution was in fact doing fine and that the opposition was restricted to a small segment of the American population. This story was Gould’s way of hinting that the alleged war between science and religion is overblown. (105)On Darwin and Queen VictoriaIt is precisely this impact that upset Queen Victoria. Staring into the ape’s mirror, she felt the metaphysical ground shifting underneath her royal feet. Seeing the same orangutan and chimpanzee at the same zoo, Darwin reached quite a different conclusion; he invited anyone convinced of man’s superiority to come take a look. Darwin felt a connection where the queen felt a threat. (107)Empathy finds its origin in bodily synchronization and the spreading of moods. Complex forms based on imagination and projection grow out of this, but only secondarily. (133)I have never felt any attraction to the view of animals as stimulus-response machines; it is so impoverished that I don’t even know where to begin taking it apart. (135-136)Empathy is hopelessly biased, as was shown, for example, in a study…Needless to say, the Swiss take their soccer seriously. Only their own club members activated empathy. In fact, seeing fans of the rival club getting shocked activated the brain’s pleasure areas. So much for loving thy neighbor. (141)Empathy is multilayered like a Russian doll. At its core is the capacity to match another’s emotional state. Around this core, evolution has built ever more elaborate capacities, such as feeling concern for others and adopting their viewpoint. Few species show all layers, but the core capacity is as ancient as the mammals. (144)I refuse to use a different terminology for these reactions in human and apes, as urged by the opponents of anthropomorphism. Those who exclaim that ‘animals are not people’ tend to forget that, while true, it is equally true that people are animals. To minimize the complexity of animal behavior without doing the same for human behavior erects an artificial barrier. (145)"
3,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30387720-a-r-mert-bak-rc,4,"It is certainly a great book in terms of animal behavior and about the quest to find the scientific basis of morality. I really enjoyed the first-hand experiences de Waal delivers, as well as the examples from the field about the relationships between the primates and even some elephants, dogs, etc. It is not up to me to criticize his knowledge in the field of ethology.However... I am shocked by how naive he is and how much information and insight he lacks about atheism debates. He is so unfamiliar or simply uninterested about these debates that he can ask ""I understand why religious people try to spread their religion, but why does atheists debate against religious people? For what they do this?"" Seriously? Is this de Waal's vision about atheism and theism debates? Should not having an imaginary friend prevent us from fighting against the modern day religious crusades against secularism, education, science? I think de Waal sits too much in his office with his cute and very interesting chimpanzees, that he forgot why atheists are angry about religious right and their actions, as well as simply religious people who claim we will burn in hell since we do not agree with them. Also, de Waal deeply disappointed me when he said that we really need something to fill the space that removing religion creates and this simply cannot be done. Are you sure? He presents no evidence for his claim, other than demonizing communism trials in the past. Can the terrible outcomes of communism be because of the dictators of those countries, rather than the communism itself or removal of religion? I don't want to go into the topic of politics; however, I strongly disagree with the idea that removal of religion would require something else that would be just like religion again. I double, even triple strongly disagree that science cannot be something that can fill the space of religion. It sure can. If you need a subject that managed completely to do that, I would love to be a subject for such research. Science can and does fill the ""need to believe"". It is about the education and proximity to science during development. Religious belief does not have a special space in us. I don't see a research that shows that. I know it might be useful (especially for politics), but it is not a must. I believe de Waal wanted to play nice to ""both sides"" in this debate, but I find his explanations deeply poor and they lack the power to reflect the intellectual background of the author. That deeply saddened and concerned me. I am strongly against what he calls ""neo-Atheism"" and I also strongly agree that these topics must not be made a field of war. Yet, his softness and naiveness about this topic is very peculiar.Still, I tried to ignore these disturbing so-called ""explanations"" of de Waal about atheism and religion. When you remove those simply unnecessary and uninteresting (and mostly debatable or obciously wrong) sections, the book is a masterpiece for science of morality and ethology."
4,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5842890-sara,2,"There are things I liked about this book, and things I can't agree on. I learned a lot about primatology that I didn't know before, I feel he is quite an objective expert in this. It surprised me to learn bonobo had a sense of consequence, or played pranks on each other. This was well written and I learned quite a bit. I couldn't agree with De Waal's perspective on human issues. He opposes a ""top down"" morality imposed by religion but not religion. He talks about Genital mutilation and circumcision here in the US as if it is exactly the same yet treated differently. He talks about Atheist evangelicals who proselytize as much as Christians, giving the analogy that it like ""sleeping furiously"". It is a fair criticism to say that some atheists go out and try to convert others. It is a hotbed of an issue here, but I think he is looking in and not understanding there is a lot of infringement. He was raised in a country where religious people are a minority and are not pushing their beliefs on others, an ideal situation where it is very peaceful. He has nostalgic, and sentimental feelings toward these religious groups who are a minority in Holland, this is totally understandable.Here unfortunately there is a vocal number of religious people who can't respect people with different beliefs or none at all. They are on TV, in government, and taking the schools to court over not teaching creationism or intelligent design. A month ago a public school librarian pulled my daughter aside and told her about Jesus, she is one of many. I am not angry about it but I do wish people would keep their beliefs to themselves and I kindly told her that. Last week a protest took place in Texas because intelligent design was trying to make its way back into the curriculum. These people that oppose this receive plenty of criticism and its easy to see how an outsider could describe it as ""sleeping furiously"". He also compared female genital mutilation to circumcision in the US, seeing us a hypocrit on the issue. While I can't imagine how these trends ever started and don't agree with them they are not comparable. FGM removes sexual pleasure for a lifetime, the clitoris as twice as many nerves as the penis. Circumcision removes the outside skin, and not the ability to have an orgasm. My last thought on this book is that he really displays a superior air throughout the book no matter the issue. When he talks about these issues he seems to put himself above them. He is a good writer and explains the issues and discoveries in Primatology well. They are very well studied and thought out, his personal perspectives not nearly as much. "
5,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,5,"De Waal begins with a famous Nietzsche quote: ""Is man only a blunder of God? Or is God only a blunder of man?"" The central question of the book seems to be: ""Where does morality come from? Does it come from above or from within us?"" As someone who thinks scientifically, I believe it obviously comes from within, but how and why? De Waal speaks of apes holding a door open for another ape to get food even if it means they will eat less. And capuchin monkeys would rather play a card that gets food for others, again even if it means they get less. Mammals give and respond to affection; reptiles do not appear to. Birds show examples of emotion. American neuroscientist Paul MacLean named the limbic system as the seat of the emotions. He said one of the surest signs of a caring attitude is the ""lost call"" of young animals. A baby monkey will look miserable and coo until its mother returns. That has been noted in alligators, one example of reptilian emotion. The crocodile family transports some of their young in their mouths. De Waal summarizes the Dalai Lama's comments by saying, ""Compassion goes to the root of what life is all about."" Buddhist monks laugh at the thought of measuring the brain to find compassion. They believe it comes from the heart. They make a point since the sounds of human suffering cause a quickening heart rate. In 2005, the Dalai Lama spoke of the need to integrate science and religion. Does secularism cause a decline in moral authority? Do we fully understand the ""moral implications"" of secularism? And I ask this along with De Waal as a secularist myself. DeWaal states in chapter 1: ""I am not convinced the morality needs to get its weight from above, though. Can't it come from within. . . ."" But later he also asks, "". . . but what good could possibly come from insulting the many people who find value in religion? And more pertinently, what alternative does science have to offer? Science is not in the business of spelling out the meaning of life and even less in telling us how to lead our lives."" And this: "". . . For me, understanding the need for religion is a far superior goal to bashing it."" And also: ""Science isn't the answer to everything."" So not only does he point out examples of seeming morality in animals, but he also shows some of the horrors of science. For me personally, I can't escape the feeling the world would be better off if we relied more on science and appreciated our humanity rather than our different views of the supernatural. Carl Linnaeus assigned humans their own separate genus, apparently to avoid trouble with the Vatican. Three centuries later, DNA offered better ways to compare species than anatomical comparisons. Surprisingly, the new data placed us apart from the monkeys and smack in the middle of apes. Walking on two legs is not a big deal, even chickens do it. Our ancestors probably kept returning to the apes the way grizzlies and polar bears do. They may have bred together for over a million years. It was Jean-Baptiste Lamarck who first proposed human descent from the apes in 1809. But Lamarckian theories of evolution were no match for Darwin. Lamarck would die penniless the subject of many mocking obituaries. Lorenz defined aggression as within-species behavior. Herbivores are no less aggressive than carnivores. And we are living proof of aggressiveness in omnivores. Predation should not be confused with aggression. Claude Levi-Strauss proposed that human civilization started with the incest taboo. Before then, everyone did it with everyone. But suppression of inbreeding is well developed in all sorts of animals, from fruit flies to rodents to primates. We share genes with bonobos that we don't share with chimps and vice versa. We can be as nice as bonobos and as violent as chimps. De Waal tells an interesting story about meeting with a group of Mormons when his pet jackdaw flies in. It terrified them and they left hastily speaking of the ""devil.""In the military, I agreed to speak with Mormons every Tuesday night for about two months. The deal was that they would tell me about the Mormon church, and I would express my concern about black Americans not being allowed into the Mormon priesthood. That law has since changed. On the final night, they came to see me after ""praying all night"" that I would ""become one of them."" I felt so bad. I spent the whole evening apologizing. I kept repeating that I told them from the very beginning that I would never belong. They left very disappointed. An interesting Dutch coined word: ""ietsism."" ""Ism"" is the same as in English, and ""iets"" means ""something."" An ""ietsist"" does not believe in God, but thinks there must be something between heaven and earth. Neuroscience offers two basic messages about empathy. 1. No sharp dividing line between human and animal emotions. (Makes sense since we ARE animals.) 2. Empathy runs from body to body. Stick a needle in a woman's arm and the pain centers in her husband's brain light up. The IgNobel Award is given each year for research that ""first makes people laugh, and then think."" In 2011 it was given to an attempt to find contagious yawning in turtles. Investigators exposed red-footed tortoises to a member of their own species trained to open and close its mouth. Since no tortoises reacted, the researchers concluded turtles lacked mimicry and empathy. In a debate about passing laws dealing with castration of pigs, a roomful of men was shown a video of an awake pig being castrated. By the end, the men looked very pale and sat ""with their hands firmly between their legs."" The video helped change the tide on anesthesia. (I remember how disgusting Joni Ernst's ad was when she bragged about ""castrating hogs."") A rat will often help another rat in distress before going to a door with chocolate chips in it.A story of two unrelated chimps who became friends and shared everything. When one died, the other one became depressed. Friendship can be applied to animals, but it was resisted as anthropomorphic at first. Chapter 6 discusses the Ten Commandments and the difference between ""is"" and ""ought."" The ""is"" is about facts, the way things are, and the ""ought"" is about the way they should be. Anyone interested in the environment knows we have a problem with the ""ought."" I recommend David Hume for the greatest discussion ever on this topic. One of the many interesting gems DeWaal puts in his book: The apocalyptic right panel of Bosch's The Garden includes two ears pierced by an arrow with a knife between the ears that are riding roughshod over doomed souls. No one knows what it means. We are good at finding reasons to suit our purposes. As Blaise Pascal said, ""The heart has its reasons, of which reason knows nothing."" Hunter-gatherers often eliminated dangerous deviants from their group by delegating a member of the community to kill the deviant. In a famous example on The Colbert Report, a conservative politician spoke of the importance of the Ten Commandments, but he could not name them when asked to do so. Most of the Commandments have nothing to do with morality anyway. Peter Singer, the extremist animal rights activist, paid private aides to take care of his mother with advanced Alzheimer's. This went against all his theories about utilitarianism. Chimps follow the principle of ""toeing the line."" They will punish chimps that get them in trouble with their keepers in a zoo. Some chapter 7 notes: Research implies that religion helps people simply because of its ""social dimension."" That's why we need more secular gatherings that promote good behavior. We need science groups and book clubs. Whatever does the trick. I'm a fan of atheist ""churches."" DeWaal asks about the origin of religion. I kept wondering if animals other than humans have anything resembling religion or supernatural beliefs. Tough to do without a language. He describes chimps doing a ""rain dance"" at a waterfall. An early human ""rain dance"" that coincided with actual rain might have started someone on a path to priesthood. ""Young chimps are smarter than children."" But he never explains how old the children were. Are humans the only animals that have thanatophobia? The piraha, a Brazilian forest people, are perhaps the only example of a tribe that lacks religion. But they do believe in ""evil spirits."" To me, it's the belief in the supernatural that distinguishes religion. Is Communism an example of atheism gone wild? Pol Pot said: ""To keep you is no benefit, to destroy you is no loss."" Did William Golding have it right in The Lord of the Flies? Children develop a pecking order quickly. I have witnessed that in playgrounds. I watched a touch football game where the ""alpha male"" could run for touchdowns at will because the other kids were afraid of touching him. But children would never develop science. Religion will never go away. Science is fragile. The antisciences forces must be kept at bay. The best secular model is now in northern Europe, but it is under duress. As I finish the book with Chapter 8, I find two flaws: 1. Not that much about bonobos in the book, so a misleading title, and 2. Not a coherent essay leading to a conclusion about ""humanism"" or ""morality"" or whatever Mr. de Waal was looking for. But I loved all of the great stories. The book was filled with them on almost every page. One of the last was about chimps. When there is a ""female with swollen genitals,"" the males will try to keep peace and maintain calm. No mating until they are under control. De Waal's ultimate conclusion is that morality arose long before any religions came about. Religion only bolstered the morality, or at least tried to. "
6,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3809399-stormin,5,"The must frustrating thing about this book was how much of it was quotable. I listened to it as an audiobook, and I use the bookmark feature of Audible regularly, but that means I have to go back after the fact and transcribe all the passages that I liked into Evernote. I probably have literally 30-40 passages I'm going to have to do that for with this book because it was just so tense with stories I want to capture, pithy lines, or surprising scientific findings. (OK, I don't really ""have to,""--nobody's forcing me--but I'm going to do it.)I've already had one person ask me--when I posted about the book on Facebook--why a religious person such as myself would like it. But I've always enjoyed the writing of smart atheists. It's kind of a weird question for me, honestly. Most of the most influential thinkers on me have been atheists (Camus, de Beauvoir, Bowles, etc.) Besides: de Waal is more than happy to go after the New Atheists as dogmatic extremists, so you know he's going to endear himself to me on that front.But that's not the main thing that I loved about the book. That was just the empathy and respect and warmth with which de Waal wrote about animals (especially bonobos and chimps, but also others like elephants) in terms of the ability to demonstrate pro-social behavior and even the kernel of what we would consider to be friendship or remorse or other positive traits in humans.Now: as for de Waal's primary point: I think he does not succeed. The problem is one that he pinpoints himself, but then doesn't adequately deal with: the is/ought gap. De Waal does a great job of showing that the origins of what we consider to be moral behavior arise in animal behavior. He also does a great job of explaining how, evolutionarily, humanity could build on those foundations to reach more and deeper morality (including, in his mind, the creation of religion.) But there are two key problems.First, the evolutionary origins of behavior we regard as moral is not actually the same as the origin of ""morality."" He's got the ""is."" But--in order to be regarded as morality--he needs an ""ought."" And he never gets one. Intuitively, we regard behaviors such as remorse and repairing relationships as moral. And so it is fascinating to see their origins in primate behavior. But that's just an ""is."" It's only an ""ought"" if we regard our intuition as correct. And de Waal doesn't take a position on that one. I don't mind at all: I think the book is fascinating merely for the information it presents (and the way it does), but I think it's a critical flaw in his thesis.Second, de Waal also seems to fall into a particularly problem that is common to relativism: that is the idea that if you can explain how a trait arises, then that trait must be contingent, relative, etc. But--as Thomas Nagel explains in The Last Word--that doesn't actually follow. Nagel's example was math. The evolutionary origins of humanity's mathematical abilities are contingent and subjective. It's interesting to ask what survival advantage the ability to do formal logic conferred. But if we can explain that, it doesn't mean that somehow mathematics or logic stop being objectively true and become (like de Waal's idea of morality) somehow merely relavistically or contingently true.So, if evolution can bring is in contact with objective logic in terms of math, why is it impossible for evolution to bring us into contact with objective morality?And that, for me, is the key problem with de Waal's approach: he doesn't think very carefully or deeply about what morality means. He says, for example, that morality will be different in hunter-gatherer vs. agrarian societies because they will have different concerns regarding incentives and behavior. True. But that doesn't actually mean that morality is relative. The same moral principles can be applied in different ways. So de Waal seems to be replying a kind of superficial notion of moral absolutism (the idea that there are moral laws that never change) as opposed to a more sophisticated notion of moral objectivism (the idea that their are moral principles that never change, but that their application can create diverse rules in different contexts.)As an analogy: imagine the task of making an airplane for use in Earth's atmosphere. Now imagine the task of making an airplane for use in Mars' atmosphere. You're gong to get very different-looking crafts, which will in turn behave differently, be integrated into society differently, require different skills to pilot, and entail different kinds of maintenance, etc. But does this mean that the laws of building airplane are relative? Not really, because behind the particular situation of Earth (thick atmosphere, lots of gravity) and Mars (thin atmosphere, less gravity) there's a common set of physical laws that apply--identically--in both cases. Terrestrial aeronautics and Martian aeronautics would be just special cases of general physical rules. In the same sense, it's premature to say that--because the rules are going to look like in hunter-gatherer vs. agrarian societies--we're dealing with moral relativism as opposed to special cases of objective, universal moral principles.This isn't a proof of objective moral principles, of course, but the failure of de Waal to interact with the possibility shows a major shortcoming of his book as a philosophical text. In terms of philosophy, it just doesn't work.But I read it primarily as a science book, and in terms of science it is fascinating, eye-opening, and compelling. "
7,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2736187-lucsly,3,"A well written and at times fascinating explanation of the author's views on similarities between humans and mammals, with other primates taking center stage (obviously as De Waal is a primatologist). He also has interesting things to say about the origin of morality in primates, including in humans but the book falters a bit in my opinion when he tries to invent a conflict between his views and atheists' in order to give his book a problem to solve.Not only does he generalise atheists heavily (to me it seems there as many views of atheism as there are atheists of which there are plenty), he also handily ignores reasons for their activism or demand for equal treatment in certain countries. He doesn't give religion the same treatment however which may seem biased, though the author isn't religious himself. Interestingly, the title of the book was translated to his native Dutch (possibly by the publisher) as ""The bonobo and the ten commandments"". Not only are they rarely mentioned, De Waal focuses much more heavily on atheism than on religion. On the plus side, the book has many fascinating stories of primate behaviour, further reducing the distance between humans and our closest relatives. Definitely worth a read for this alone, though the book was apparently meant as an general summary of books and views so some information might be familiar for readers of his previous works.Edit: fixed a typo"
8,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,4,"Frans De Waal is the sort of guy who, even within an alternative subculture, is fond of espousing alternative viewpoints. For example, he's a scientist (specializing in primates, especially chimpanzee and bonobos), and it's not much of a surprise to discover he's an atheist, but he also seems to think that Dawkins, Harris, and their ilk get too worked up about it. He doesn't like the term ""brights"" that some atheists wish to use for themselves, and says ""what good could possibly come from insulting the many people who find value in religion?""Another quote: ""to know what morality would look like without religion...would require a visit to a human culture that is not now and never was religious. That such cultures do not exist should give us pause.""But, de Waal is not writing this book primarily to defend religion. In fact, he is intending to look at the idea that we need religion to keep us moral. If we cannot find human societies that are not either highly religious (most of the world), or were highly religious until within living memory (parts of Europe), then we can look at our close relatives. Chimpanzees and bonobos are the species most closely related to homo sapiens, and they do not have anything we could call ""religion"" unless we stretched the meaning of the term so much as to make it not very useful. What does their morality look like?He also looks at questions that bear on the idea of the inner lives, such as whether they are aware of death, whether they feel guilt, whether they are outraged at moral offenses, what they think is happening when they cooperate, and so forth. One repeated point is that in order to learn about what kinds of tasks they are capable of doing, you have to construct the test in such a way that they want to do it, and it makes sense for their abilities. For example, he mentions a study which looked at the ability of chimpanzees to do facial recognition, that tested them using the same pictures of human faces that had been used on human subjects. Not surprisingly, chimpanzees did not do as well, but when given pictures of chimpanzees instead they were equal to humans.When explaining experiments on, for example, whether or not elephants can think ahead to use tools, or chimpanzees can understand the concept of money, or so on, he often provides us with his own illustrations. There is something about his simple but entertaining and informative style of illustration that mirrors and complements very well his writing style.There has been a bit of a pendulum effect over the centuries, in the attitude of scholars towards the inner lives of other animals, from thinking them similar to ourselves and then as mindless automatons (or reasonless and driven by emotion only). Frans de Waal does a great job of guiding us through the last few decades of research, which have gradually swung opinions back towards the idea that the inner lives of humans and other mammals exist on a continuum, rather than two separate worlds. It is also clear that a great deal of our own morality predates religion, and is shared with many other species, where we can see cooperation, punishment of cheating, adoption of infants who are not closely related, and many other behaviors that are hard to explain if you have Skinner as your model for the way in which animals think.On the other hand, de Waal does not shrink (too much) from showing us the very real limits which our biological heritage provides us in regards to morality. First and foremost, it doesn't scale very well to large societies. The behavior of chimpanzees towards monkeys, or even other groups of chimpanzees, is sometimes pretty gruesome. The behavior of bonobos, though often portrayed as like flower children from the 1960's, is pretty violent compared to most human societies. If religion is an imperfect way of scaling up morality, it is at least clear that there is a real need which it is attempting to fill, and simply removing it does not solve the problem.To his credit, de Waal does not try to answer every question for us. It is clear, though, that a career in studying our close relatives has given him a better perspective for thinking about them, and with this book he has done a great job of sharing that perspective with us."
9,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5377423-emily-carter,5,"I highly recommend this book to anybody who is passionate about religion and science, particularly the intersection of the two. The central argument is that morality predated religion, and that religion would not be such a strong force in the world without our species having evolved from other community minded creatures. My personal favorite point, however, is peripheral. He asserts that atheists who are vehemently opposed to religion likely grew up in fundamentalist religions, and they simply replace one fundamentalism with another. Using the names we find familiar today, namely Harris and Hitchens, he describes a group of people who actually ignore the societal importance of religion in preference of their own small minded beliefs, similar to how some religious people dismiss basic science. There are fascinating discussions of different animal experiences, which prove different levels of logic and some form of ""morality"" in mice, elephants, dogs, and of course, bonobos. He is also particularly obsessed with Bosch's painting The Garden, and uses it and other art to support his arguments. In short, it is an incredible book that any person who struggles with morality should appreciate."
10,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,4,"If you’ve ever wondered about the evolution of morality and whether humans are the only moral creatures, this is a good exploration of the idea. Frans de Waal posits that we have an innate sense of morality, and like Jonathan Haidt, suggests that this sense dictates what we do – the emotional tail wags the rational dog, rather than the other way round, in Haidt’s terminology.The main attraction for me is not the ideas, which I’ve come across plenty of times before, but the anecdotes about the behaviour of wild and captive bonobos and chimpanzees. They’re our closest relatives, on the evolutionary tree, and we can learn a lot about ourselves from observing them. Frans de Waal includes a lot of interesting titbits, and I found his work fascinating, though not surprising.It probably won’t convince anyone who thinks that morality comes only as handed down from God, but if you wonder about this kind of thing, you’ll probably find this interesting.Reviewed for The Bibliophibian."
11,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1201123-iz,3,"I finished this a few months ago so I can't find the exact passages that stuck with me the most. While I definitely appreciate the defense of humanist morality (and this book really is an important, well-written read, though not necessarily new - see The Moral Animal: Why We Are the Way We Are: The New Science of Evolutionary Psychology), I can't help but think that the skeptic/humanist world is too saturated with the old white male perspective. Perhaps this is what lies behind de Waal's criticism of the ""dogmatic"" atheist and scientific community. In what appeared to me to be a rant against these men, de Waal seems to think that the worst negative effects of religion currently are merely preaching creationism and a flat earth. Let me then reply-rant: this completely ignores the groups of people who are the most damaged by religion in the western world, namely women and non-Christian people of colour, whose lives are actually, literally, endangered by religious dogmatism. And let's remember these are not fringe groups, but people with considerable political power. In the last chapter, de Waal mentions a certain ""Dr. Benjamin Carson,"" probably unknown to most people when this book was written, but you'd have to be living under a rock to not know who he is now. In the past few months, Dr. Carson has provided us with an tremendous assault on anything related to reality, truth, rationality and logic. He can only do this because he is able to appeal to the only group of people who appreciate this rhetoric of absolute ignorance, the religious extremists. Regardless of religion, throughout history, extremists have waged wars against knowledge and inquiry - and this is what is at the heart of the problem with religion. It's not enough to show with rational arguments that morality is innate and doesn't come from religion. You can't win an argument using logic with someone who is completely irrational. However, I do get where he's coming from in defense of spirituality, and if anyone who is an atheist/skepting has an interest in appreciating the benefit of the search for spiritual meaning and traditional knowledge, I highly suggest reading The Wayfinders: Why Ancient Wisdom Matters in the Modern World. May I suggest as well searching for humanist ethic books written by women and PoC, because while I respect de Waal's views tbh I'm getting bored of this same old tired perspective. "
12,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18849995-dick-zeeman,2,"The subject of the book is very interesting. Frans de Waal has a very nice style which makes for an easy read.However, he does not convince me of his opinions, even though I share many of them. Mainly he does himself what he accuses other scientists of: cherry picking, confirmation bias and even stating his opinion as fact.For example (I don't say I don't agree with some of the below, the point is the way he presents his ideas and opinions):""Such behaviour is sure to be selected against"" (page 76). Why is this sure? Is there any evidence? None that Mr. de Waal presents. It is just opinion.""Faith is driven by attraction to certain persons, stories, rituals and values"" (page 96) Is that so? Even though his book contains many references, he conveniently forgets to mention references whenever he states his opinion as fact.""Isn't knowledge invariably good?"" (page 137). Seems like a weird comment from a scientist. Knowledge is neither good nor bad. Knowledge can be used to do good or do badThe book contains many examples like this. Also with the examples of animal behaviour, he seems to be picking the examples that suit him best, which give me the feeling he is cherry picking them.Specific to the kindle edition: the book contains lots of references, by means of endnotes. These are not links, so if you want to check a reference you have to go to the end of the book and look up the endnote yourself. The same goes for the index: no links, so you have to find the page mentioned manually."
13,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23428788-john-kaufmann,5,"Despite its title, this book does not trash religion or espouse atheism. The main premise is that morality is not the stepchild of religion - on the contrary, morality predates religion and comes from within (i.e. human nature). de Waal discusses how morality is grounded in emotions and social interaction, citing various ""pre-moral"" behaviors among primates, bonobos, and even other animals. In small groups, these behaviors can be enforced by shunning and other direct punishment. But as societies grew in size, people needed larger gods to bolster the behaviors. That is the only role of religion de Waal discusses. He acknowledges that religion will never be eliminated and that it has a role to play, and he is critical of militant atheism. The book is very interesting reading, and it is well-written. More section headings could have helped a little."
14,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3183576-cheri,5,"In an area fraught with ill will and name calling, Frans de Waal offers a warm, optimistic and peaceable view of the ""conflict"" between science and religion. The real conflict is with dogma, which can appear on both sides. This beautifully written book is the product of a lifetime of studying primates, whom he sees as natural moralists -- as are humans, who share an evolutionary past with them. His stories of bonobos gave me a feeling of kinship with other living creatures and a better understanding of my fellow humans. "
15,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4357283-john-david,3,"This is an awkwardly named book, partially because it has nothing to do with humanism, per se. de Waal seems to think that “humanism” seems to be roughly definitionally coterminous with “secular morality,” but there are plenty of humanists who don’t subscribe to secular morality and many secularists who aren’t humanists. The book could have been better had that word not been in the title at all. “The Bonobo and the Atheist” presents a pretty uncontroversial thesis, even for someone like me whose grasp of the scholarly literature in primate ethology is virtually nonexistent: humans aren’t the only animals that display moral behavior. In fact, de Waal’s book is a great sourcebook of just these kinds of behaviors across a wide range of species, mostly culled from anecdotes relating to his personal research at various institutions over the last several decades. (He’s currently the Charles Howard Candler Professor of Primate Behavior in the Department of Psychology at Emory University.) There are plenty of examples of chimps and bonobos showing prosocial behavior all over the book, and even behavior that we could call moral, like expressing frustration or anger at a perceived lack of fairness. If you are a reader whose curiosity was piqued by the word “atheist” in the title, and were looking for another Hitchens- or Dawkins-inspired dime store screed on how religion will be the end of humanity as we know it, you will be disappointed as well. In fact, the thesis of this book presented no reason whatsoever to even discuss the relatives merits and drawbacks of religion, but I guess throwing in a buzzworthy word into the title can’t harm sales. As is pretty clear from the summary of the book, the main idea he’s trying to present is that moral behavior is present in all of the higher apes (other animals too, but being a primatologist, his focus is mostly the bonobo and the chimpanzee). Consequently, it should come as no surprise that the moral tendencies we share with these animals predates any idea of God, and certainly predates any attempts at formal institutions built to worship said God. The big take-away from the book is that morality, no matter which animal it occurs in, is a product of biology, not of divine revelation or supernatural intercession.  Being originally from the Netherlands, de Waal was at first very perplexed at the popularity, not to mention the fundamentalism, of American life. He moved to the states at in 1981, when he was 33 years old, and has spent more than half of his life here. It’s understandable why European atheists look at American atheists with bemusement, because they seem to be so passionate about something so obvious. However, despite all his time in the U.S, de Waal still seems to think that popularizing atheists with a broad American audience (Dawkins, Hitchens, and Harris – he thinks Dennett is by far the most rational and thoughtful of the bunch) are “sleeping furiously” – that is to say, since atheism is essentially the rejection of a proposition, they’re making a big deal out of the existence of essentially … nothing. He drives this point home repeatedly in the book, and it’s somewhat befuddling. Here’s a scientist, an open atheist, and yet he doesn’t seem to see the value in doing the yeoman’s work of getting bullshit like “creation science” out of the classroom where it most certainly doesn’t belong. Are the Dawkins, Hitchens, and Harris sometimes grating and strident? Sometimes, tin-eared interlocutors for the ideas they’re trying to promote? Most certainly. But when he refers to them as sleeping furiously, he seems to be criticizing them for more than their stentorian shrillness. In a country where one out of three Americans still believe that the creation account(s) in Genesis hold the authority of science, we need to learn how to walk before we can run. We need more public education about science, and at their best, most effective and most appealing, that’s what they’re doing. Only then can we get the buffoons who think the world was created in six days kicked off of school boards and out of Congress. But to say they are sleeping furiously is akin to calling their work in vain. Perhaps it’s the optimist in me (it occasionally peeks out), but I hope that’s not the case. I’m convinced that a world that makes its decisions based on evidence, weighted consideration of the facts, and rational criticism of ideas is the best possible world that we have to offer future generations. But that kind of world doesn’t just pop into existence ex nihilo. It has to be worked for, and that’s what I’ve always imagined as the most important role for the “public atheist.” "
16,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/77536251-modern-major-general,5,"Very much worth the read, particularly if you love reading about stories of how intelligent animals are and how very much like them we still are, in spite of our continued insistence that we are not (an idea to which I do not subscribe).To sum up, ""morality"" is not uniquely Human, and in fact, what we consider morality is, in fact, simple evolved and learned behavior that our closest animal cousins, as well as many other social animals, have developed to help them survive, adapt, and thrive."
17,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12679809-melissa-choi,4,"Frans de Waal is a very accomplished primatologist, and in addition, he also possesses the rare gift for elegant prose. This book reinforces the growing scientific perspective that morality is not the exclusive domain of homo sapiens, and instead is a result of evolution. Indeed, the study of animal behavior has revealed that primates and apes exhibit rudimentary forms of morality such as reciprocal altruism, co-operation, and a sense of fairness/justice. Although the book title features the bonobos prominently, it actually discusses the ethology of other animals including elephants and capuchin monkeys, representing a rather comprehensive view of the building blocks of moral behavior throughout the animal kingdom. While I appreciate his attempts to weigh in on the philosophical and sociocultural implications of a bottom-up morality especially in the vein of humanism, I find it somewhat puzzling that he inveighs a tone of stridency towards the so-called New Atheists. For one, he shares a lot in common with Richard Dawkins. Both of them are zoologists/ethologists by training and both have an uncanny ability to traverse effortlessly between highbrow cultural analysis and the technical minefield of scientific discourse.Although chimpanzees are the most well-studied human relative, it turns out that bonobos are at least as phylogenetically equidistant from our species as the chimps are. I couldn’t help but extrapolate and think of the implications of De Waal’s insight into bonobo behavior with respect to the spectrum of human political tendencies: you have the lefty hippie types who believe in free love (bonobos) and then you have the hawkish war-mongering conservatives (chimpanzees). One thing that I took away from the bonobos is that sex can and does serve positive non-reproductive functions.Besides impassioned diatribes against the New Atheists, as and when he can, De Waal also takes a stab at Dawkin’s genes-eye view of evolution, especially in light of nature and morality. I find this somewhat perplexing as it is quite clear to anyone who has read Dawkin’s Selfish Gene that descriptions of genes as being conscious and intentional agents is at best, metaphorical. I’m sure that ultimately, Dawkins would agree with De Waal that humans and other primates need not be consciously motivated by selfish desires, even if the outcomes of moral evolution were shaped by selfish means. The older I get, the more I find myself subscribing to the Humean as opposed to the Kantian school of thought. Recent advances in cognitive science and neurobiology corroborate with that of animal studies, further cementing the idea that Descartes wasn’t quite on the right side of the rationality argument. I agree with De Waal that understanding the need for religion is a far superior goal to bashing it. However, even if the existence of God isn’t provable, unlike him, I do find that question rather important and interesting. Works by the likes of Dr. Andy Thomson show us why religion needs to be studied as a phenomenon that has co-evolved with humanity and its cultures. I also think that it’s important to figure out why, as De Waal discusses in this book, communities based on secularism disintegrate much faster than those based on religious principles. Why is it that sharing a religion dramatically raises trust? The question is not so much whether religion is true or false, but how it shapes our lives, and what might possibly take its place if we were to get rid of it.The Dutch scientist may have grown up with a milder religious upbringing in Europe. And in a sense he’s probably right that a harsh childhood fomented by religious indoctrination is related to the extent of bitterness and contempt for religion after deconversion. But De Waal completely fails to even objectively probe or discuss the negative externalities of religion; invariably, his views are commensurate with that of the typical liberal academic apologist and relativist. For one, I am tired of the argument that the crusades/inquisition was just a front for political or colonial ambitions, and that religion had no role in it. I like how we’re slowly beginning to build up a story of how religion came to be. When our ancestors lived in small groups, similar to primate groups, everyone knew everyone. When surrounded by an intimate community, we had reasons to follow the rules and get along with each other; there were personal reputations to uphold. It was only when our human ancestors aggregated in ever-larger societies, that these face-to-face mechanisms fell apart. With bigger groups came the need for bigger gods. This framework is highly satisfying from an intellectual standpoint, analogous to when Dawkins explained how replicating machines arose from a “primordial soup,” such that one could so clearly see and understand the continuity of life. In this case, the study of animal behavior has revealed a continuity in moral evolution and the latest insight into the enigmatic bonobos have shed much light on the foibles and triumphs of the human condition."
18,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4969387-john,4,"A strong 4.5A real thinker of a book. Right from the beginning I was challenged by de Waal’s approach to religion and atheism. He is very passive. Dogma on either side does not help. People’s minds are not changed by dogma. And both science and religion have a horrible track record of justifying atrocious acts in the name of the greater good. Both religion and science are imperfect. In chapter 4 the author dives deeper into the ideas of religion and atheism. I went back and reread this chapter to try and digest more of it. I agree that religion and science are not in a war with each other, as most Americans seem to think. Much of the rest of the world seems to have figured out that they can coexist. He had a couple of comparative lines on pages 100 and 101 that blew me away. “Science is a collective enterprise with rules of engagement that allow the whole to make progress even if its parts drag their feet.”  “In comparison, religion is static. It does change with a changing society, but rarely as a result of evidence.” A second big take away for me is rethinking my views on anthropomorphism. Due to my religious upbringing, I kept a huge gap between man and the beasts of the earth. Though I am no longer religious, I have mostly kept this gap, despite trying to look at the world and humanity through the lens of our evolutionary history. I have mostly ignored the similarities between animal behavior and human behavior. But I realize I have been prejudiced to do so, and have ignored the facts. After the evidence presented in this book, I can see how obvious it is that social animals (especially primates) act like humans. Or rather we act like them since we have mostly the same brain and genes, and have been shaped by a shared evolutionary experience. This is not to downplay the impact of the main point of the book; that morality stems not from religion, but rather is prevalent in societies of social animals. Since losing my religion, I have not fretted over where that leaves me (and humanity) morally. Without being able to explain it, I have felt confident that moral footing can exist absent god. This book gave me plenty of tools and provisions to build a logical moral platform. By the many examples of animal morality and their sense of fairness, we know that morality predates religion by eons and epochs. In that sense it was nice to find something I did not feel I was lacking. Although it is more passively presented than thrust upon the reader, I agree with the author that society needs to have morals that help us all do what is good for society, as opposed to a top down model where getting away with what is morally deplorable, yet legal, is accepted. It might be legal for big banks to make billions off of poor people’s mortgages and bank account fees, but that does not mean it is morally right. A top down morality seems to encourage behavior that is morally questionable (or outright wrong) because it fits between the cracks of what is specifically ruled out. The thinking becomes: If god (or the government) did not specifically make something illegal, than my actions must be ok, even if they seem questionable and I am taking advantage of others.My only small complaints are about the writing style and organization of the book. It was far from horrible, but could have been improved. Some sections felt a bit jumpy, and trains of thought meandered. I highly recommend this book to either people who claim to be an atheist, or are religious. I found the author’s approach fresh, thought provoking, and non-combative. I would be very surprised if it did not make you think. "
19,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10185571-adam-s-rust,3,"This book is a mixed bag. Its best contribution involves its rebuttal of the ""scientific Calvinism"" of more dour interpretations of Darwinian theory advocated by early evolutionary popularizers like Huxley. De Waal labels this view as the ""the veneer theory"" of human morality. Basically it comes down to the belief that any moral action is ""really"" about looking out for ones own benefits. De Waal's critique based on recent scientific research into the moral reasoning of primates and other mammals does an admirable job of defeating this thesis. These sections are far and away the best parts of the book.Unfortunately, these sections are lost in a sea of side ruminations that vary from irrelevant to wrong-headed. The irrelevant sections involve reflections on the art work of Hieronymus Bosch that de Waal only tenuously connects to the main thesis. The wrong-headed sections involve an over-simplified critique of the New Atheists. The over simplification leads to some speculations that don't line up with the facts. At one point de Waal hypothesizes that militant atheism arises from a bitterness about ones profoundly conservative religious background. Unfortunately the two major examples he offers, Dawkins and Hitchers are both products of that lackadaisical branch of the most the limpid manifestation of the Christian tradition: the Church of England. While de Waal has a point when he critiques the New Atheists for not being more friendly with the religiously liberal he carries this criticism too far. This leads to an unwillingness to acknowledge that certain types of religiously motivated metaphysical thinking are the biggest barrier to wider acceptance of his arguments in favor of morality emerging from our natural inclinations as opposed to from divine dictates that keep our savage nature in check. If you're looking for a book to introduce you to the thinking of this important primatologist and evolutionary thinker, try one of his earlier works. This lackluster performance, for all its virtues, lacks the focus on his area of expertise that made earlier books like ""Good Natured"" worthwhile reads. "
20,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7796525-phelecia-odima,4,"Frans de Waal brings forth a beautiful display of the intersection between primatology and humanity in ""The Bonobo and the Atheist: In Search of Humanism Among the Primates"". This book will prove a mind-blowing piece of literature for the modern human being catching flights around the globe, enjoying advancements in technology and perhaps understandably, forgetting that we are just animals-primates-and we have a lot in common with our closest relatives, the bonobos. De Waal seeks out to answer the age-old question of where human morality comes from. Bonobos are bent on resolving conflict between members of the same clan and between different clan members- so bent in fact, that they are famous for unabashedly using sex to reach a resolution in situations of conflict. Chimps will adopt orphan babes and take care of them as if they were their own. Humans will risk their own lives in order to save others'. Of all these apes, only humans attribute morality to religion. Where do the rest of these presentations of altruism come from then? Referencing important landmark research studies conducted on apes such as bonobos, chimpanzees and ourselves, he concludes that the most rational explanation for the origins of morality is that it comes from within us mammals, and most specifically apes, and not from a deity or a higher power. And yet, if you are expecting an attack on religion and along the lines of Hitchens and Harris, you are mistaken. This is a thoroughly written scientific novel, through which De Waal gifts us with his decades' long experience as a primatologist. Full of illustrations by the author himself and interesting case studies, this book is sure to educate. Brimming with heartwarming stories that remind us about our primate cousins who we never remember to bring up at the dinner table, this book will equally charm and humble you."
21,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33921897-kusaimamekirai,4," What is the role of religion in determining our personal moral codes as well as how we treat others? Is religion the source of morality to such an extent that without it we all would just do whatever we want without regard for anyone else (the theory of the entertaining if not always wise Ben Carson)? Or does religion reinforce pre-existing ideas we've always held about fairness and empathy? In ""The Athiest and the Bonobo"", Frans De Waal comes down on the side of the latter by looking at our nearest primate neighbors. It seems that much like ourselves, bonobos in particular have an intricate system of hierarchies in which all things from hunting, sharing of food, and sex (bonobos do love sex) are done with an eye toward how it will affect others.  Much like with obnoxious humans, some bonobos will step out of line and do what they please but it's often met with swift physical or social reprisals. You can be a jerk, but expect people to treat you like one as well. While bonobos clearly are not religious, De Waal sees a role for religion in strengthening the communal ties that ensure we all get along.  While he doesn't advocate a dogmatic adherence to a spiritual God, he stops short of the vitriol atheists have toward believers. There is always room in the world for the duality of science and fact based conclusions and the mysteries of imagination. As De Waal says, we don't have to point out to our partner while watching Titanic that Leo DiCaprio wasn't really on the ship. We can enjoy the film while not abandoning the reality when it's over.  This book is a call for cooperation and community, not with religion at its center, but also not something that needs to be scorned and completely abandoned either. An engaging and lovely book that will truly make you think. And yes, you'll want to live with bonobos after reading it."
22,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5838785-ivana,5,"I haven't read Frans De Waal before, but I am glad I picked up this book. As every good book does, this one left me with more questions than when I started reading it. The topic of morality, and whether it antedates religion or is a product of it has been debated and contested for ages. De Waal offers conclusive evidence that morality has evolved, and though we may not understand all the drivers behind it, moral codes are present in apes, primates, and canids, among others. De Waal very delicately addressed the place of religion in our societies as well. He is impartial in that he brings up very valid arguments against religion (all too known), but doesn't let the new atheism off the hook either. He brings up some very valid points, but ultimately, what we know today is that morality evolved from within, then was appropriated by many religions. But our sense of fairness and what is right and wrong is something that was cultivated through millennia as life continued to evolve. De Waal argues that it is precisely because of this that humans invented religions- to bolster this innate mechanism. This is one of those rare books that, I believe, should be read by the devout and secular alike, or as De Waal writes, those partial to the frocked priesthood, as well as those partial to a white-coated one (such as myself)."
23,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3898791-udit-nair,5,"Frans de waal presents an eloquent and well researched argument claiming that human morality comes from within and is not a result of top down approach as it is envisaged to be. At the start of the book he offers insights into bonobo behaviour and how it starkly differs from chimpanzees. Meanwhile in the book he also refers to issues like fundamentalism of any dogma. He equally criticizes religious authorities for imposing their beliefs and well neo atheists too for rampantly assaulting the religion and other apparatus. Well the author is absolutely right when he says that dogma of any kind is the true enemy of reason. Most of the book deals with how things like caring, altruism, empathy, concern, resolving conflicts etc are indeed not uniquely human. Our nearest cousins have lot of abilities which essentially gives us the idea that human morality is not a result of top down approach. The moral law is not imposed from above or derived from well reasoned principles, rather it arises from ingrained values that have been there since the beginning of time. The most fundamental one derives from the survival value of group life. The desire to belong, to get along, to love and to be loved,prompts us to do everything in our power to stay on good terms with those on whom we depend."
24,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3948872-laura,4,"For the most part, this book was lovely. A loving and critical exploration of the roots of morality in the whole brain itself, not just the little veneer of cells that characterizes us smug humans. He recounts many well documented stories of chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, whales, rats, and dogs being better than they had to be; showing compassion, empathy and insight. The sour note was his discussion of atheists. He clearly doesn’t like most of us. He keeps accusing us, sometimes in the voice of a bonobo, of “sleeping furiously,”; getting way to excited about the non-existence of god. He name checks Dawkins (with actual contempt); Harris and Hitchens. But it’s not a fair framing, at least of Dawkins and Hitchens. They’re not furious about the nonexistence of god. They are furious at living in a culture that has long embraced the illusion of god, and the consequences of living in a world formed by those beliefs. De Waal frames it as if Dawkins, et al, are furious that Luke never blew up the Death Star. That’s just not it. (Though some of us are still pretty pissed about Hypatia). But that aside, it was lovely. "

I'm primed to like this clearly and conversationally written work, in part because I read part of The Age of Empathy (must get back to it now), and in part because morality/empathy as a product of evolution has always seemed intuitively obvious to me. Refinements and definitions, restrictions and regulations, of ""morality"" are products of the later constructs of religion. For those laboring under those yokes, morality is relative. Frans de Waal shows that in the grander panoply of the animal kingdom, the foundations came first."

As an agnosticist myself, I agree with Frans de Waal about how there is no point to disprove religion when the need for it is rooted deeply in humanity. I enjoyed reading about all the experiments but not so much about the paintings, albeit it is largely relevant to prove the point. I also enjoyed learning how anthropologists disregarded the link between bonobos and human because the male bonobos aren't as macho compared to the male chimps."

He shows the subtle inclines between religion and morality, science and morality, and evolution and morality. He describes why philosophy is probably not enough to establish morality. Numerous observations of animal behavior and experiments are in this book to show his viewpoint. A tremendous read for people interested in the origins of morality."

Perhaps advancing the species to the point where a more comfortable life can be led (food stored instead of searched for every day and ipods)leads to materialism and selfishness but as it is unlikely that we will ever go back to a truly simple life, maybe all we can take away from this book is that buried in us there could be an inate drive to care for our fellow creatures."
29,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109504-clifford,2,"De Waal should stick to biology, because he's weak on philosophy and logic. I found the discussion of ""morality"" in bonobos and chimps interesting and compelling. It's absolutely clear that morality doesn't depend on religion. And he seems to acknowledge that religion is just a comforting lie, but that doesn't seem to bother him. Atheists are rude to point this out, he says. No, they aren't. Aren't we all obligated to speak the truth?"
30,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41590197-yani,5,A refreshing book which discusses morality from a perspective I had bever heard before. It gives a neat alternative which I think is indeed much more plausible and not as polarised as apparently everything is nowadays. It is written in a compelling style and Frans de Waal clearly explains his arguments and conclisions.
31,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33852158-halli-lauren,3,"I read and enjoyed De Waal’s “Are we smart enough to know how smart animals are”, so when I saw this book was written by him, I was pretty intrigued! As a baby atheist myself, and someone who is interested in studying bonobos, this seemed like the perfect book for me. Unfortunately, De Waal spent way more time talking about chimpanzees than bonobos. He also spent way more time talking about Heironymus Bosch than was necessary. What was the point of that?? I was pretty on board with the author’s broader points about religion:1. Trying to “convert people to atheism” is a waste of energy 2. Religion isn’t going away any time soon, and if it did, we’d need to find something to replace it because of all the important things it does for us as humans (ie: community building)But here are my qualms:1. Why did he spend so much time condemning Neo-Atheists and so little time condemning the abuse and manipulation in so many religions? Toward the beginning, De Waal pointed out that he came from a much more casual religious background, so leaving his religion wasn’t as big of a deal. But the thing is, so many religions are extremely dogmatic which can lead to much more harm than good. De Waal definitely condemned dogmatism, which I agree with, but he didn’t seem to realize how inescapable dogmatism can be. Maybe that’s just my point of view coming from a high demand, very dogmatic religion. 2. So yeah, religion is important and isn’t going away any time soon. Then what should atheists do? De Waal spent so much time saying how important religion is, and even though he is an atheist himself, he didn’t share any of his ideas of how to get the benefits of religion elsewhere. I guess that’s what I wanted out of the book, and I didn’t get it. Then of course there’s the main subject matter of the book: the evolution of morality and altruism. This was all well and good, but while reading I didn’t have any “Aha!” moments- nothing felt very fresh to me. Overall a disappointing read. Not good, not bad. Just meh. Oh also I’m just sick of reading books by old white men… if anyone has recommendations of nonfiction science books by women or people of color?? Definitely would love to hear those."
32,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15812925-adrian-undrea,4,"Frans de Waal is probably best known for his appearances on TED Talks. Having seen his presentations on animal morality I have to admit I have started reading his book being biased. I consider myself an atheist and somehow I had been looking at this book to reinforce this view. But The Bonobo and the Atheist shouldn't be read for that as Frans de Waal looks to explore the origins of morality and debunk the myth, so deeply ingrained in most of us, that morality is the trademark of humanity. And while sometimes it jumps too fast from one idea to the other, reading The Bonobo and the Atheist with an open mind might change the way you view morality. Far from being a hallmark of mankind, morality is a product of evolution, shaping the interactions of all social animals. By the use of countless experiments Frans de Waal argues morality is a mere tool of the highly evolved animals that makes living in groups possible. It is one more nail in the coffin of the idea that somehow we are special from the rest of the biological world. And while Frans de Waal thinks letting go of religion might not be possible for humanity, he favors the optimistic idea that our moral compass is an inner one (a bottom-up approach) instead of having its origins in religion (a top-down view)."
33,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18494756-olivia,5,"This is probably the second book I've read this year that I think everyone should read. (The other was SO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT RACE by Ijeoma Oluo.)A fascinating look into the moral universe of our closest genetic relatives, and an examination of the ought vs is of their world without religion (as we would recognize it. Frans de Waal is a very engaging writer, and considerably more knowledgeable about the topic than the most well-intended science reporter. (I've read some non fiction by people who write layman's overviews of science topics by interviewing researchers, and they also serve a purpose, but this book combines a depth of understanding of the topic with an engaging readability that is sometimes lacking in non fiction written by academics. I'm already seeking out more of his work.Atheist, believer, or.those of us in between will find much of interest here."
34,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13162061-amirography,3,"Hmmm. It is hard to give a review for this book. It is full of great arguements against conventional thinking. and deWaal is certainly well read about science and morality. But he is mostly driven by arguing against skeptics (skeptics of animal-cognition, not in general) so he is great at giving counter examples. But he is not that great at proposing new ideas. So I might be wrong. Basically, from what I understood, bottom-up morality is descriptive to prescriptive morality with emphasis on socially enforced ones. I might be wrong because he was not that clear -to me- about it. Which is, underwhelming. Both because intuitive morality is at the end a prescriptive morality, however he wants to say that they are not that different. The arguments against different schools of normative thinking was also weak because from a utilitarian point of view, he was arguing a straw-man, as a utilitarian (like me) wouldn't exactly argue as he did in the place of a utilitarian. Though I have to say, it may have been not because if an intentional effort, but because he probably did not check his argument with a utilitarian. Overall, I don't think this book-essay was a ""great-read"" type, but it is certainly better than reading a fiction in search of meaning."

If there is a short-coming here, it is that the balance between these elements will be a little unsatisfactory for anyone who is mainly interested in the science. Compared to Frans de Waal's Primates and Philosophers—which features commentary from Robert Wright, Christine Korsgaard, Philip Kitcher and Peter Singer—The Bonobo and the Atheist also lacks the clarity that comes from having de Waal's most ambitious ideas reigned in by more cautious thinkers."

37,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15731711-samantha,4,"I am totally on the fence when it comes to Frans de Waal. Sometimes I find myself underlining sentences in this book in agreement, and other times I find myself scribbling frustrated notes of disagreement in the side margins. For example, on page 184 de Waal practically ridicules Peter Singer for not taking his view that we should have ""special loyalty"" to our own species while excluding other species from our moral equations. He basically argues that we should determine our morals (in some cases) based on loyalty to our own group - in this case, our own species. It's terribly reminiscent of people from history who argued the same way - substituting ""species"" for ""race"" or ""sex"". I assume that some time in the future, people will read this and think ""Wow, de Waal was a good primatologist, it's a shame he was such a speciesist"" as we now say about 18th and 19th century writers. In the margins on page 184 I wrote ""But sometimes fierce loyalty to one's own group is immoral - it would be immoral for me to say a black person is not equal to a white person merely out of loyalty to my own race."" This morality based on loyalty to one's own group is rather small-minded, if you ask me.Another rather bad part of de Waal's book was on page 204, where he writes, ""Neo-atheists are like people standing outside a movie theater telling us that Leonardo DiCaprio didn't really go down with the Titanic. How shocking! Mostly of us are perfectly comfortable with the duality."" The flaw in his argument is this: no one ridicules Titanic watchers because no Titanic watcher actually believes that Leo went down with the famous ship. But atheists ridicule theists because they ACTUALLY believe ridiculous things like wine turning into blood or demons in the form of talking snakes tempting people to eat some fruit. He argues that atheists who criticize religion are advocating the elimination of imagination. But the key difference between people with active imaginations and theists is that imaginative people ultimately recognize that their fantasies aren't part of reality. Theists make no such recognition; they actually believe, metaphorically, that Leonardo DiCaprio was on the Titanic. Or anything else equally absurd. This is why they are ridiculed and the imagination is not. Imagination is beautiful and beneficial in many ways. I'm a fiction writer, I have a very deep appreciation of imagination, but I recognize it as just that - imagination. Unlike imagination, I consider most religious claims ridiculously illogical because the theist seriously believes in these fantasies. I would have not the slightest problem with religion if this was not the case (but then it wouldn't really be religion, would it?). The weakness in de Waal's analogy (criticizing theists to criticizing moviegoers) is so obvious that I can't help thinking de Waal might not completely understand religion or what it means to condemn it.There are other ways in which I strongly disagreed with de Waal, particularly when he talked about religion (I write in a margin, ""Can we go back to the apes now?"") but overall I tended to agree with what he said. It was a good book and I learned a lot from it about chimps and bonobos. The parts about the apes were very interesting, but the parts where de Waal starts talking religion and philosophy were out of touch with how I feel about those matters. Overall, it was a good book and worth reading for anyone interested in the origins of morality."
38,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9716384-vivify-m,5,"I very much enjoyed this book. Primatology enthralls me - learning about our primate cousins, and how researchers work with them is a joy. But, the resulting insights into our own psychology, is the highlight. I also, enjoyed understanding how the experiments were constructed and the challenges the researchers faced.On the downside, I was put off by the authors attitude towards other disciplines. I found his criticism of biologists unnecessary, in particular his misrepresentation of geneticists as calling prosocial behaviour a mistake. I’m no expert, but I also questioned his representation of evolution. At times I thought he was confusing selfish genes with selfish individuals. Possibly, the most significant contribution of the book, is the idea that key to our salvation is in understanding our natural selves. I love this sentiment, but I also get nervous of overly naturalistic thinking, and I’m not convinced by the arguments against utilitarianism. Ultimately, this was a deeply thought provoking and enjoyable book."
39,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57079482-chuck-kollars,4,"The author has kept and done research with Chimpanzees and Bonobos (formerly known as Pygmy Chimps) for decades, is top of his field, and has written many books. The main theme of this book is an observation and bit of reasoning. The observation is that our animal relatives routinely display a fairly strong sense of morality (focused on maintaining good relations within the group). The obvious reasoning from this is that our current morality -often embedded in ""religion""- comes not from anything external like religion but rather from something internal that predates religion. He makes this case pretty strongly, but without placing it in a larger hypothetical framework. The book mentions, but doesn't even try to answer larger questions such as how did our morality come to be deposited in religion?, how does a morality focused on good group relations work with much larger groups (tribe, nation, globe, etc.)?, how much can we deviate from our unthinking inborn sense of morality before everything falls apart?, and how will we know when we don't need religion at all any more?He does several other things in this same book: He responds to the ""four horsemen of atheism"" that made such a splash a few years ago. He presents many interesting anecdotes from his subjects, some of which are closely tied to a sense of morality and some that illustrate more intelligence/forethought/non-aggression than we typically credit our close relative animals with. And he tries his hand at an explication of the painting ""The Garden"" by ""Heironymus Bosch"". He draws some interesting parallels between these topics, but in my opinion not enough, so the book seems less focused than it could be. There are indeed connections between these strands (even though they're not as strong as I'd like). For example, the author thinks the ""four horsemen of atheism"" give too much credit to religion in accusing it of being the root of horrible wars and genocides. Such abominable behavior is also displayed by chimps in certain circumstances. Humans must have gotten it from the same place, and our common ancestor predates religion. Also, chimp society is clearly uninfluenced by any human religion ...or any religion at all. So for the wars and genocides, despite its claims, religion was really more ""cover story"" than ""cause"". In a way the whole book is a plea for humble moderation rather than conspicuous ideology. We're asked to actually look at the evidence in front of our faces and to not completely throw out religion until we understand it a little better and so forth. This is his critique of the atheists too: most scientists are rather dubious about religion, but why is it so important to you that other people think exactly the same way you do? He describes the seemingly contradictory combination of a lackluster subject with passionate advocacy as ""sleeping furiously""."
40,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12402305-hanan-elsharif,3,"In her 1985 book Sex and Friendship in Baboons, Barbara Smuts was the first to apply the term “friendship” to animals,ha ha. her name is Smuts. um. Back to some serious reading nowIn all honesty, I chose to read this book to learn about Bonobos and didn't want to fully enter into any religious debate. That part of the book I really enjoyed. However. since this book is titled 'The Bonobo and the Atheist', I will make a few comments.I will say that I enjoyed reading about Veneer theory. Unfortunately, I am not so sure that I agree with Frans de Waal's notion that this theory is no longer valid with the overwhelming evidence of innate altruism. Perhaps I'm a skeptic but I still feel that people do in fact weigh up the possible benefits of their actions and not just in business and with acquaintances but also with family and friends; which is not what he believes. He believes we are altruistic with those closest to us and that is not always the case. What I will say is that I don't argue that there is something innate within us that gives us our moral compass but one could argue that it is a higher being that gives us that moral compass in the first place. Nonetheless, what I do respect is that at no point does he belittle other religions or in fact hail atheism as the one true faith. I respect that he is not a militant atheist like Dawkins. He even mentions that for him - when considering that it was wrongly believed Darwin agreed with 'the expulsion of morality from the natural domain'-""the height of absurdity was reached when Dawkins explicitly disavowed Darwin, telling an interviewer in 1997 that 'in our political and social life we are entitled to throw out Darwinism.'"" He doesn't appreciate Dawkin's ability to be so dismissive of other beliefs.This is a good read but, as mentioned in some other reviews that I've read, I also feel that Frans de Waal is mixing two ideas that needn't be discussed together. When he does discuss some points, I often feel like saying, 'just get to the point'. He spends over a page using various works of art to comment on how we react to them and how it shows our bodily empathy.It felt like he introduced this list of art to fill a few pages. There can often be much speculation based on what he observes in the bonobos and humans themselves. There are often times when I feel he speculates too much. Though I will say that I was pleased to hear another one of his many examples that'humans most prone to yawn contagion also have the most empathy'. That is pleasing to know since simply reading the word yawn sets me off :).I have enjoyed reading this book but when he stated 'My first book on this topic, Good Natured (1996), barely mentioned religion' I almost wish I had read that instead."
41,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196037-jrobertus,5,"De Waal is a primatologist with a philosophical bent. I have read several of his books; they are not only interesting but important. He shows from his experimental work the basis for morality in our simian ancestors. They have empathy and an innate sense of fairness, required for communal living an hunting, that sets the basis for a moral code. (His experiments showing a sense of fairness in monkeys is fmous and the subject of a terrific TED tak). Region, or other social institutions, build on this inherent bent. De Waal describes morality as bottom up and not top down. Although he is atheist himself, he takes issue with the “neo atheists” like Hitchins and Dawkins who are aggressive in attacking religion. He urges tolerance and open mindedness and to not be as dogmatic as relious fundamentalists. He feels religion plays an important role in the social structure of close knit groups, it is robust (whereas science is new, difficult, “unnatural” and therefore fragile in an all out battle with religion). He feels northern Europe is carrying out a large scale gradual experiment in secularism. Can education and the state take over the amalgamating role of relion and make a strong, moral society without religion? We'll see eventually. Certainty efforts to remove religion by force, like the communists and Khmer rouge, have been horrible failures, worse than the superstition and dogmatism they wanted to replace. The animal work, an observations of behaviour, that De Waal uses to support his arguments are interesting in their own right. This is a most worthwhile read for its science and for the way science can inform philosophy and politics.De Waal is a hero of mine; he is an imaginative scientist, and a mature reviewer of the biological basis of empathy, altruism, and morality. In this book he continues his eye-opening work on the behavior of primates, especially our nearest relatives, the chimps and bonobos. His careful monitoring of their behavior in laboratories and in the wild, points out the ancient foundation of moral behavior among animals living in interdependent societies. In this book he also addresses the ongoing debate between religion, particularly fundamentalists, and science. Although he is an atheist he sees the value in religious practice and bonding, if not in the dogma. He takes aim at the “new atheists”, like Hitchens and Dawkins, and chides them for a combative and often insulting tone that does not help bridge the social gap. The tone of this book is so mature and thoughtful it is quite humbling. I wish I could be more like him."
42,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71935584-ben-zimmerman,3,"As a book about fascinating and well-told narratives about animal behavior and cognition, I would give this book a better rating (as I would rate many of Frans De Waal’s books). However, the purpose of this book seemed to be more about a reflection of religion and a bit of a criticism of the “new atheists”. I thought that the religious reflections weren’t very interesting and often wrong in the way that he characterized the views of both many atheists and many religious people. Some of his reflections and connections seemed disconnected and not well thought out. I would definitely recommend reading Frans de Waal, but maybe a different book. "
43,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10397934-erich,3,"Somewhat meandering in its approach, this book does make some convincing and enlightening arguments that I am happy to ponder. Frans de Waal's obvious expertise in primate prosocial behavior gives him an excellent vantage point to show that morality certainly evolved well before any religious institutions were established, especially as we know them today. The anecdotes are enticing and revealing, and really make the thesis very compelling. Primatology sounds even more fascinating when we see ourselves so vividly reflected in his vignettes. Some of the digressions into how we are to deal with morality and religion in the face of scientific progress are less persuasive. I did not find de Waal's writing to be particularly cohesive or share the logical argumentative power of a Dawkins or Hitchens. Towards the end of the book I finally began to grasp his viewpoint, and mostly embraced it, but there was no feeling of real enlightenment. I think the book overall, and some of its arguments, could have been better organized. The book did serve a good counterpoint to what de Waal calls ""neo-Atheists"" such as Sam Harris, Dawkins, and Hitchens (well, ""Marxist"" for him), though I happen to love these authors. If you are looking for that, it has its moments. I have to admit that I had problems with de Waal's recommendation to give modern religion so much leeway and to dispense with the heated ""anti-religious"" rhetoric of those mentioned above. While humans may be naturally predisposed to accepting religion as a form of social normalizing (which I agree has had its place in our civilizing process), this doesn't mean it we should accept it as necessary today. Its stranglehold on truth in the face of scientific evidence does nothing to enforce our common morality. If anything, it holds us back from truly understanding our place in the universe and extending a moral code to everyone. I see a need for more strong voices opposed to this willful ignorance and dogma, not fewer. All in all, a good read with some nice points. And bonobos!"
44,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13928228-sortal,1,"Muddy thinking, misrepresentation (or ignorance?) of atheist arguments, and lots of irrelevant passages on Hieronymus Bosch. I've really enjoyed other books by Frans de Waal, but this is an unsuccessful departure from his areas of expertise. Insofar as I can figure out what de Waal is arguing for, I agree with most of his premises: 1. Moral conduct exists on a continuum, including the behaviours of other animals.2. Dogmatism is terrible and should be avoided. 3. Religion is superfluous to morality. 4. Hardline atheism is unlikely to persuade the devoutly religious to give up their faith.But then things go wrong. 5. De Waal never addresses whether religion is inherently dogmatic. (Insofar as it's faith-based, where faith is belief without evidence, it certainly seems that way.) 6. De Waal never addresses the harm done by religion (a crucial point made by the thinkers he so blithely dismisses, such as Dawkins and Harris). 7. De Waal claims (without any supporting argument) that religion will always exist.If you replaced the passages on Bosch with a fair representation of the atheists de Waal is arguing against, you'd have a wonderful book. Better still would be a book using de Waal's research to build on the project of Harris' Moral Landscape, helping to create an alternative to religion (the logical next step from premises 2-4 once you accept 5 and 6 and dismiss 7). Instead, you get an infuriatingly murky read of jumbled ideas with just enough interesting anecdotes about primates to keep you reading through the rambling about Bosch.   "
45,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"The book really should have been titled ""The Bonobo and Human Empathy"". The two pillars of all philosophy are empathy and reciprocity. He completely examines the first pillar, empathy, by illustrating empathetic behavior in Bonobos (and other animals) and linking it to our behavior.He's such a good writer even when he wrote about things I completely disagreed with I would find the book thought provoking. I thought he trivialized the arguments of Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens and John Stuart Mill. But, I'm not bothered. I believe what I believe and I appreciated the different perspective.The narrator did a perfect job.The book is much better than most pop science books I have listened to and I'm much richer for having listened to this highly entertaining book and can definitely say because of this book I'm much closer to my goal of understanding our place in the universe. He does talk about philosophy but I enjoyed those parts as much as I did about bonobos.(P.S. Matt Ridley's book, ""The Rational Optimist"", fully covers the second pillar of human philosophy, reciprocity. Also, my personal take on the author he seemed like an apologetic atheist and he didn't want to offend anyone. But as I say, I wasn't bothered by this, but I disagreed with him regarding those sections. Also, he seemed to characterized the utilitarianism of John Stuart Mill in a comic book fashion. Once again I wasn't bothered but I don't want to leave the impression that I agreed with him on those two points)."
46,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51675760-mark-james,3,"I really enjoyed learning about the idiosyncrasies of many of the primates, as well as having a better sense of the differences between bonobos and chimps. Choosing Bosch's ""The Garden of Earthly Delights"" as a focal point was interesting on de Waal's part. I couldn't help but feel the book could have been better organized, as the topic shifts from bonobos to religion to morality to art without any obvious structure. Finally, there were several points made about atheism that don't hold up to scrutiny. For instance, he writes, ""Everything humans have accomplished anywhere - from architecture to music, from art to science - developed hand in hand with religion, never separately."" Do you mean, de Waal, that religion has existed at the same time that these wonderful things were created, or that all people who created these things were religious? Certainly neither is true. In fact, most examples of human achievement come in spite of religion, not because of it.Elsewhere, de Waal faults Christopher Hitchens for shifting loyalties several times before landing on an antitheist stance. To me, this only means that Hitchens was tireless in his pursuit of truth.I detected countless other examples of unfair judgments, but overall, the author tends to take the safe middle ground when failing to acknowledge that anything we can do without belief in the supernatural, we can do without it, and then some."
47,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3050574-a-b-gayle,3,"Humanism and the BonoboI struggled to get through this book while I was totally immersed in another of his, questioning whether humans were smart enough to understand animals. I think part of my alienation arose because of his obsession with Heironymous Bosch’s art. (I thought he was an LAPD detective, lol!)Basically, I totally agree with the main premise of this book. Best summed up in the final chapter.Thank God, if I may, we share with other primates a background as group animals, which makes us value social connections. Absent this background, religion could be preaching about virtue and vice until it became blue in the face, we’d never get its point. We are receptive only because of our evolved grasp of the value of relationships, the benefits of cooperation, the need for trust and honesty, and so on. Even our sense of fairness derives from this background.In other words, we are receptive to religion (some might say vulnerable) simply because we like other mammals have empathy and value relationships, the benefits of cooperation, the need for trust and honesty, and so on. Even our sense of fairness derives from this background. But just because something is possible doesn’t mean it is necessary.Throughout the preceding chapters, he has shown different ways this morality manifests itself within the animal kingdom. He refutes the notion that if it weren’t for religion, humans would be no better than animals. In fact he states Morality arose first, and modern religion latched onto it. Instead of giving us the moral law, the large religions were invented to bolster it. We are only just beginning to explore how religion does so by binding people together and enforcing good behavior. It is far from my intention to minimize this role, which was vital in the past and may remain so in the foreseeable future, but the wellspring of morality it is not.In fact he sees the evolutionary development of this bottom up morality that has allowed us to develop to where we are today.So why not give this a higher rating?Firstly, the continual referral to the Bosch painting “The Garden” which seemed a stretch at times to illustrate a point he was making. We can no more know why Bosch painted it the way he did than know what Bonobos are actually thinking.Sure, studying them in the wild and conducting experiments can demonstrate that they have recognisable emotions, but in one section he has Bonobos thinking about what atheists would be thinking. So that was my second star off.The third star off is for his dodgy logic in many sections. Take for example his dismissal of the Golden Rule of Christianity (Do unto others as you would have them do unto you).To give a rather crude example, if at a conference I follow an attractive woman whom I barely know to her hotel room and jump into her bed uninvited, I can pretty well guess how she’d react. If I explain that I am just doing to her what I would love her to do to me, I’m afraid my appeal to the golden rule won’t fly. Or, let’s assume that I knowingly serve pork sausages to a vegan. Liking meat myself, I am just following the golden rule, but the vegan will consider my behavior obnoxious, perhaps even immoral.In both cases he has only looked at the physical side of the equation, not the effects of those acts. Would he like someone to rape him or insult his beliefs? You can’t divorce the act from the motive or consequence of the act. If all three are taken into account, the Golden Rule still applies.Chapter 7 particularly had some lazy logic. Whereas in previous chapters I’d been highlighting very well presented arguments, this one is full of my exasperation at the arguments used to justify the need for religion in society. Take this one for example.We humans were plenty moral when we still roamed the savanna in small bands. Only when the scale of society began to grow and rules of reciprocity and reputation began to falter did a moralizing God become necessary.But perhaps the “necessity” for this moralising God and his acolytes comes about because the chances of having a psychopath or control freak who wants this power (in the form of a controlling religion) has increased because of the larger population? He had already acknowledged that personalities varied within animal groups, so the ‘need’ for religion could just as easily be attributed to statistics producing people who wanted power for power’s sake.Interestingly when you look at early Greek and Roman religion, the gods just existed. They were used to explain the unexplainable. It was only later that the gods started telling people how to behave. I’m pretty sure the population of Ancient Greeks and Romans was not insignificant.But let’s look at another lazy analogy The whole purpose of God is to do the latter (loving moral actions). We endowed him with the capacity to keep us on the same straight and narrow that we’d been following ever since we lived in small bands.How different is this from the concept of Santa Claus being used to make children behave? Adults understand that rewards that are achievable are the best ways to control children. Likewise those who perceive the need to control large numbers of adults do so by playing up to the fears that adults have (as evidenced previously in this chapter) - a fear of death and hence the need for an afterlife.While I can see his point that a focusing deity that encourages people to be good is not bad, but the dogma that accompanies it and the divisions this creates makes me question whether this need could be better met in other ways or at least recognised for what is really happening. Perhaps the need is more that many individuals are not going to take orders from one of their own, but prefer that order to come from some unquestionably alpha figure.So my final verdict? Animals follow their own form of moral code developed in response to the betterment of their community. While some humans are still capable of doing this, others through laziness, unwillingness to kowtow to one of their own issuing instructions or fear of their mortality need some sort of mystical religion to guide their actions. I added another star back in because he made a good case for respecting that animals at times are better socialised than many humans."
48,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5889085-h-wesselius,4,"The title is somewhat misleading. De Waal is not writing a tight coherent account of morality and humanism among the primates. He is instead writing meandering thought provoking but far more personal account of humanism and science. His constant reference to the Bosch painting which he uses as a metaphor is an irritant. From this and his forays into philosophical discussions on the nature of God and morality, its obvious he's writing more of a personal discussion which he's entitled to after years of work. One of the frequent arguments for the existence of God is the cited need for moral law. Its the existence of God and his instruction to man that sets us apart, apparently. De Waal successful challenges that assumption citing evidence of moral behavior in not only primates but in other larger social animals such as dolphins and elephants. From this he proposes that morality is derived from the social nature of animals and has an bottoms up origins as opposed to the top down model proposed by various religions. Pulling it all together, he makes a compelling argument that morality is the basis for religion and a belief in God and not the other way around. An excellent read with a good and interesting argument. "
49,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/119364-melee-farr,3,"The premise of the book was right up my alley - examining the roots of morality (and ultimately religion) from a larger mammalian perspective. And I think it was effective on that front. de Waal is a primatologist, first and foremost, and there were countless examples from his and others' research, observations, and publications of moral behavior existing consistently in the animal world, with sound evolutionary reasoning for pro-social behaviors being retained throughout mammalian phylogeny. I flew through the first half of the book. He uses Bosch's triptych painting ""Garden of Earthly Delights"" as a recurring metaphor throughout the book, and honestly, he lost me with it. I mean, I understood the metaphor, but, to use another, it was kind of beating a dead horse. This may reveal the fact that I'm not particularly well-versed in the visual arts. He also is rather dismissive of atheism as often aggressive and exclusionary, and permissive of religion because he sees it as inevitable and having some consistently positive societal traits. Both points are well-made, but may whitewash the good done by skepticism and the evil done by dogmatism. But that perspective may also just reveal my bias. "
50,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6664778-andrea,3,"Tracing the beginning of morality may be as close as our fellow primates the Bonobos, as de Waal explains in this book. I am interested in the topic of the origins of morality and the book has a flow that kept me reading. I do think de Waal has a little Richard Dawkins envy though. Richard Dawkins is simply a better writer. This author makes the point that although morality predates religion there is no point in egging on the religious majority by calling such religious beliefs delusional, which in fact Dawkins does. I agree it is pointless and may be even counter productive however I feel the author fails to give due the bias that atheists face, bias that denies us jobs, social status and even basic human rights. Try getting into high political positions as an outed atheist. Frans does a disservice to human rights when he says that there is no reason to state an atheist agenda, and I agree, but what about a human agenda? Frans doesn't take the biases seriously enough. This being said the book is worth a read to remind us of our roots, to connect with fellow primates and to learn more about the origins of morality."
51,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5318025-nina,3,"Frans de Waal's research is impressive, and I found his insights into primate behaviors, including those of humans, very interesting. However, if the purpose of his study had to do with religion and morality, then he failed to connect the two sides of the book (primatology and religion). By the time I finished the book, my big questions were, What does religion have to do with this study? and What does Bosch have to do with primatology? Personal admiration for the painter does not constitute expertise, and while interesting, the bursts of art history did not in any way advance de Waal's argument, especially because they did not rely on art history so much as on the author's personal responses to The Garden of Earthly Delights. Sadly, de Waal does not really understand atheists either, neither old-school nor the ones he refers to as ""neo-atheists."" Personal opinions rather than data dominate this book, and opinions do not prove very much. The lack of hard evidence for the arguments on morality is only part of the problem, though. The author's attempts at wit are offensive to many readers, and together with speculation rather than evidence hurt the book's message. "
52,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11200007-douglas-cosby,1,"1.5 stars (the extra half point is for the narrator): Not my bag. I read the first third of this book, but couldn't get any further. Franz de Waal's point is simple: morality is a result of evolution, not imposed by religion or ""invented"" by humans. A very good point, and I sympathize with de Waal's frustration with biologists/scientists that fall prey to the rampant anthropomorphism we humans tend to overlay on the way we see other animals. He uses a few scientific studies, but mainly just anecdotes and cute stories, to justify his position, and this book feels more like a feel-good article in O magazine than something that would be in Scientific American or Nature. Additionally, while de Waal harshly criticizes recent atheist authors, it doesn't seem like he has really read them. For instance, his criticism of Sam Harris's The Moral Landscape, seems like it came from the back-of-the-book summary, not the actual details of the book. If you are in the mood for a bunch of touching ape stories, then this book might be for you. If you are looking for a book on the scientific basis of prehuman morality supported by scientific evidence and logical conclusions, look elsewhere."
53,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5078550-robert-bor,4,"I got this book from my friends, who appreciate my interest in evolution, politics and society. Frans de Waal weaves two different threads in this book. On the one hand, he proceeds to show clearly how animals (the Bonobo primate in particular) have an extremely good sense of moralistic behavior. This undermines the argument that moralistic behavior is one of the primary consequences of religion. No, not just undermines, evaporates. This is where he weaves in the other thread, where he distances himself from the Atheist camp (Dawkins et al) and states that religion should not just be abandoned if we cannot replace it with something else. He understands the need of humans for spirituality and does not just wish this away. In the dual aspect, a bit of a weird combination, but understandable, since being seen in the Atheist camp, pretty much shuts you out from dialogue with the religious one. Is Mr de Waal aiming for a diplomatic role in bringing the two camps closer together? On another note, if you like the work of Hiëronymus Bosch, know that it features prominently in this book."
54,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7349461-cody,3,"This book had its ups and downs. de Waal's argument for morality emerging from bottom-up processes is convincing, and I really enjoyed when he would dive into the details of primate research, as well his many anecdotes. This alone makes the book worth reading. I do, however, think he was quite off the mark with his criticism of the ""neo-Atheists"" (i.e., the New Atheists). On top of the misguided attacks (A.C. Grayling addresses some of these in a review in Prospect Magazine http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/mag...), at times he comes across as patronizing. He stresses the need for religion to help secure ethics among the masses (at least at present), while apparently considering himself fully capable of living morally without religion. That said, I think the book drives home some good points (especially in the final chapters), and will get both believers and non-believers thinking about some of these issues."
55,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8076824-geoff,3,"I have a soft spot for primates, and books on morality are catching my attention at the moment so I thought I would have enjoyed this book more than I did. I also recently read The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt, so I can't help but compare the two. While I did enjoy this book more than The Righteous Mind, I still gave both books three stars. Frans de Waal's writing style is much more enjoyable and conversational than Haidt's. However, there seemed to be less science involved in this book. I know there are countless endnotes and references at the back of the book, but somehow the observations came across as purely anecdotal. While I agree with de Waal's bottom up approach to morality, rather than from top down, I didn't find that the strength of his arguments would convince anyone who don't already believe as he does."
56,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6323134-darcey,3,"I found this an interesting read, though perhaps one with more extraneous information than I wanted. I enjoyed de Waal's anecdotes and commentary about Bosch and how that was related to humanity, symbolism, and the growth of ideas - however, there was more of it than necessary (including recounting experiences of being at the Prado in Madrid). The linkage between the fact that primates (and other animals) exhibit traits which we as humans consider ""moral"" - and that animals do not follow religion - is clear, leaving us with no way to avoid the conclusion de Waal sets out to prove: morality is not something encoded purely by religion, and those who believe that without religion humans will descend to immoral madness have a significant amount of evidence to overcome to prove their position. "
57,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5777523-jami,4,"This was a well researched, informative book. I was not familiar with Frans de Waal's work before this book, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I thought there would be more focus on the Bonobo anecdotes, but there were enough to keep me entertained and interested. This book looks at the issue of what the source of morality and other behaviors is; it combines many areas of study, including religion, philosophy, science, sociology, psychology, and history. While parts of the book dragged a little, overall it was well done. There were some parts of the book that fascinated me and that I had never considered before, such as the yawn response in relation to empathy; I also particularly enjoyed the passages about specific behaviors usually only attributed to humans that are found in bonobos and other species. The narration was very good and easy to listen to."
58,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/906313-diane,3,"This was a surprisingly interesting argument on the origin of morality. In a spiritual context, morality is something that is imposed by God with commandments and injunctions, etc. deWaal, however, draws from his many years as a primatologist to suggest that morality is an internal motivator, something that is inherent within us and those species most closely related to us. The bonobo is his primary example of a primate that clearly demonstrates moral qualities such as empathy. I found it very interesting to listen to, but kind of disorganized. And since de Waal frequently mentions the Hieronymus Bosch painting, ""Garden of Earthly Delight,"" I wished I had that image on hand. Nevertheless, I enjoyed de Waal's ideas and his intelligent presentation."
59,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/746637-sally,4,"A thoughtful consideration of the origins of morality in humanity's evolutionary past. The author's work with primates, and less frequently with other social mammals, provides convincing evidence for a continuity of development of consciousness and empathetic/moral behavior between humankind and other animals. It successfully combats the idea that humans and other social animals are at the core selfish, with altruism as a thin, self-serving veneer; that without top-down religious mandates, such as the 10 commandments, people would live in a nightmare Hobbesian world; and that ""selfish gene"" theories are a adequate way of understanding and interpreting an organism's behavior and motivations. An enjoyable read."
60,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41590197-yani,5,A refreshing book which discusses morality from a perspective I had bever heard before. It gives a neat alternative which I think is indeed much more plausible and not as polarised as apparently everything is nowadays. It is written in a compelling style and Frans de Waal clearly explains his arguments and conclisions.
61,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33852158-halli-lauren,3,"I read and enjoyed De Waal’s “Are we smart enough to know how smart animals are”, so when I saw this book was written by him, I was pretty intrigued! As a baby atheist myself, and someone who is interested in studying bonobos, this seemed like the perfect book for me. Unfortunately, De Waal spent way more time talking about chimpanzees than bonobos. He also spent way more time talking about Heironymus Bosch than was necessary. What was the point of that?? I was pretty on board with the author’s broader points about religion:1. Trying to “convert people to atheism” is a waste of energy 2. Religion isn’t going away any time soon, and if it did, we’d need to find something to replace it because of all the important things it does for us as humans (ie: community building)But here are my qualms:1. Why did he spend so much time condemning Neo-Atheists and so little time condemning the abuse and manipulation in so many religions? Toward the beginning, De Waal pointed out that he came from a much more casual religious background, so leaving his religion wasn’t as big of a deal. But the thing is, so many religions are extremely dogmatic which can lead to much more harm than good. De Waal definitely condemned dogmatism, which I agree with, but he didn’t seem to realize how inescapable dogmatism can be. Maybe that’s just my point of view coming from a high demand, very dogmatic religion. 2. So yeah, religion is important and isn’t going away any time soon. Then what should atheists do? De Waal spent so much time saying how important religion is, and even though he is an atheist himself, he didn’t share any of his ideas of how to get the benefits of religion elsewhere. I guess that’s what I wanted out of the book, and I didn’t get it. Then of course there’s the main subject matter of the book: the evolution of morality and altruism. This was all well and good, but while reading I didn’t have any “Aha!” moments- nothing felt very fresh to me. Overall a disappointing read. Not good, not bad. Just meh. Oh also I’m just sick of reading books by old white men… if anyone has recommendations of nonfiction science books by women or people of color?? Definitely would love to hear those."
62,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15812925-adrian-undrea,4,"Frans de Waal is probably best known for his appearances on TED Talks. Having seen his presentations on animal morality I have to admit I have started reading his book being biased. I consider myself an atheist and somehow I had been looking at this book to reinforce this view. But The Bonobo and the Atheist shouldn't be read for that as Frans de Waal looks to explore the origins of morality and debunk the myth, so deeply ingrained in most of us, that morality is the trademark of humanity. And while sometimes it jumps too fast from one idea to the other, reading The Bonobo and the Atheist with an open mind might change the way you view morality. Far from being a hallmark of mankind, morality is a product of evolution, shaping the interactions of all social animals. By the use of countless experiments Frans de Waal argues morality is a mere tool of the highly evolved animals that makes living in groups possible. It is one more nail in the coffin of the idea that somehow we are special from the rest of the biological world. And while Frans de Waal thinks letting go of religion might not be possible for humanity, he favors the optimistic idea that our moral compass is an inner one (a bottom-up approach) instead of having its origins in religion (a top-down view)."
63,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18494756-olivia,5,"This is probably the second book I've read this year that I think everyone should read. (The other was SO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT RACE by Ijeoma Oluo.)A fascinating look into the moral universe of our closest genetic relatives, and an examination of the ought vs is of their world without religion (as we would recognize it. Frans de Waal is a very engaging writer, and considerably more knowledgeable about the topic than the most well-intended science reporter. (I've read some non fiction by people who write layman's overviews of science topics by interviewing researchers, and they also serve a purpose, but this book combines a depth of understanding of the topic with an engaging readability that is sometimes lacking in non fiction written by academics.

64,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13162061-amirography,3,"Hmmm. It is hard to give a review for this book. It is full of great arguements against conventional thinking. and deWaal is certainly well read about science and morality. But he is mostly driven by arguing against skeptics (skeptics of animal-cognition, not in general) so he is great at giving counter examples. But he is not that great at proposing new ideas. So I might be wrong. Basically, from what I understood, bottom-up morality is descriptive to prescriptive morality with emphasis on socially enforced ones. I might be wrong because he was not that clear -to me- about it. Which is, underwhelming. Both because intuitive morality is at the end a prescriptive morality, however he wants to say that they are not that different. The arguments against different schools of normative thinking was also weak because from a utilitarian point of view, he was arguing a straw-man, as a utilitarian (like me) wouldn't exactly argue as he did in the place of a utilitarian. Though I have to say, it may have been not because if an intentional effort, but because he probably did not check his argument with a utilitarian. Overall, I don't think this book-essay was a ""great-read"" type, but it is certainly better than reading a fiction in search of meaning."

If there is a short-coming here, it is that the balance between these elements will be a little unsatisfactory for anyone who is mainly interested in the science. Compared to Frans de Waal's Primates and Philosophers—which features commentary from Robert Wright, Christine Korsgaard, Philip Kitcher and Peter Singer—The Bonobo and the Atheist also lacks the clarity that comes from having de Waal's most ambitious ideas reigned in by more cautious thinkers."

67,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15731711-samantha,4,"I am totally on the fence when it comes to Frans de Waal. Sometimes I find myself underlining sentences in this book in agreement, and other times I find myself scribbling frustrated notes of disagreement in the side margins. For example, on page 184 de Waal practically ridicules Peter Singer for not taking his view that we should have ""special loyalty"" to our own species while excluding other species from our moral equations. He basically argues that we should determine our morals (in some cases) based on loyalty to our own group - in this case, our own species. It's terribly reminiscent of people from history who argued the same way - substituting ""species"" for ""race"" or ""sex"". I assume that some time in the future, people will read this and think ""Wow, de Waal was a good primatologist, it's a shame he was such a speciesist"" as we now say about 18th and 19th century writers. In the margins on page 184 I wrote ""But sometimes fierce loyalty to one's own group is immoral - it would be immoral for me to say a black person is not equal to a white person merely out of loyalty to my own race."" This morality based on loyalty to one's own group is rather small-minded, if you ask me.Another rather bad part of de Waal's book was on page 204, where he writes, ""Neo-atheists are like people standing outside a movie theater telling us that Leonardo DiCaprio didn't really go down with the Titanic. How shocking! Mostly of us are perfectly comfortable with the duality."" The flaw in his argument is this: no one ridicules Titanic watchers because no Titanic watcher actually believes that Leo went down with the famous ship. But atheists ridicule theists because they ACTUALLY believe ridiculous things like wine turning into blood or demons in the form of talking snakes tempting people to eat some fruit. He argues that atheists who criticize religion are advocating the elimination of imagination. But the key difference between people with active imaginations and theists is that imaginative people ultimately recognize that their fantasies aren't part of reality. Theists make no such recognition; they actually believe, metaphorically, that Leonardo DiCaprio was on the Titanic. Or anything else equally absurd. This is why they are ridiculed and the imagination is not. Imagination is beautiful and beneficial in many ways. I'm a fiction writer, I have a very deep appreciation of imagination, but I recognize it as just that - imagination. Unlike imagination, I consider most religious claims ridiculously illogical because the theist seriously believes in these fantasies. I would have not the slightest problem with religion if this was not the case (but then it wouldn't really be religion, would it?). The weakness in de Waal's analogy (criticizing theists to criticizing moviegoers) is so obvious that I can't help thinking de Waal might not completely understand religion or what it means to condemn it.There are other ways in which I strongly disagreed with de Waal, particularly when he talked about religion (I write in a margin, ""Can we go back to the apes now?"") but overall I tended to agree with what he said. It was a good book and I learned a lot from it about chimps and bonobos. The parts about the apes were very interesting, but the parts where de Waal starts talking religion and philosophy were out of touch with how I feel about those matters. Overall, it was a good book and worth reading for anyone interested in the origins of morality."
68,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9716384-vivify-m,5,"I very much enjoyed this book. Primatology enthralls me - learning about our primate cousins, and how researchers work with them is a joy. But, the resulting insights into our own psychology, is the highlight. I also, enjoyed understanding how the experiments were constructed and the challenges the researchers faced.On the downside, I was put off by the authors attitude towards other disciplines. I found his criticism of biologists unnecessary, in particular his misrepresentation of geneticists as calling prosocial behaviour a mistake. I’m no expert, but I also questioned his representation of evolution. At times I thought he was confusing selfish genes with selfish individuals. Possibly, the most significant contribution of the book, is the idea that key to our salvation is in understanding our natural selves. I love this sentiment, but I also get nervous of overly naturalistic thinking, and I’m not convinced by the arguments against utilitarianism. Ultimately, this was a deeply thought provoking and enjoyable book."
69,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57079482-chuck-kollars,4,"The author has kept and done research with Chimpanzees and Bonobos (formerly known as Pygmy Chimps) for decades, is top of his field, and has written many books. The main theme of this book is an observation and bit of reasoning. The observation is that our animal relatives routinely display a fairly strong sense of morality (focused on maintaining good relations within the group). The obvious reasoning from this is that our current morality -often embedded in ""religion""- comes not from anything external like religion but rather from something internal that predates religion. He makes this case pretty strongly, but without placing it in a larger hypothetical framework. The book mentions, but doesn't even try to answer larger questions such as how did our morality come to be deposited in religion?, how does a morality focused on good group relations work with much larger groups (tribe, nation, globe, etc.)?, how much can we deviate from our unthinking inborn sense of morality before everything falls apart?, and how will we know when we don't need religion at all any more?He does several other things in this same book: He responds to the ""four horsemen of atheism"" that made such a splash a few years ago. He presents many interesting anecdotes from his subjects, some of which are closely tied to a sense of morality and some that illustrate more intelligence/forethought/non-aggression than we typically credit our close relative animals with. And he tries his hand at an explication of the painting ""The Garden"" by ""Heironymus Bosch"". He draws some interesting parallels between these topics, but in my opinion not enough, so the book seems less focused than it could be. There are indeed connections between these strands (even though they're not as strong as I'd like). For example, the author thinks the ""four horsemen of atheism"" give too much credit to religion in accusing it of being the root of horrible wars and genocides. Such abominable behavior is also displayed by chimps in certain circumstances. Humans must have gotten it from the same place, and our common ancestor predates religion. Also, chimp society is clearly uninfluenced by any human religion ...or any religion at all. So for the wars and genocides, despite its claims, religion was really more ""cover story"" than ""cause"". In a way the whole book is a plea for humble moderation rather than conspicuous ideology. We're asked to actually look at the evidence in front of our faces and to not completely throw out religion until we understand it a little better and so forth. This is his critique of the atheists too: most scientists are rather dubious about religion, but why is it so important to you that other people think exactly the same way you do? He describes the seemingly contradictory combination of a lackluster subject with passionate advocacy as ""sleeping furiously""."

Back to some serious reading nowIn all honesty, I chose to read this book to learn about Bonobos and didn't want to fully enter into any religious debate. That part of the book I really enjoyed. However. since this book is titled 'The Bonobo and the Atheist', I will make a few comments.I will say that I enjoyed reading about Veneer theory. Unfortunately, I am not so sure that I agree with Frans de Waal's notion that this theory is no longer valid with the overwhelming evidence of innate altruism. Perhaps I'm a skeptic but I still feel that people do in fact weigh up the possible benefits of their actions and not just in business and with acquaintances but also with family and friends; which is not what he believes. He believes we are altruistic with those closest to us and that is not always the case. What I will say is that I don't argue that there is something innate within us that gives us our moral compass but one could argue that it is a higher being that gives us that moral compass in the first place. Nonetheless, what I do respect is that at no point does he belittle other religions or in fact hail atheism as the one true faith. I respect that he is not a militant atheist like Dawkins. He even mentions that for him - when considering that it was wrongly believed Darwin agreed with 'the expulsion of morality from the natural domain'-""the height of absurdity was reached when Dawkins explicitly disavowed Darwin, telling an interviewer in 1997 that 'in our political and social life we are entitled to throw out Darwinism.'"" He doesn't appreciate Dawkin's ability to be so dismissive of other beliefs.This is a good read but, as mentioned in some other reviews that I've read, I also feel that Frans de Waal is mixing two ideas that needn't be discussed together. When he does discuss some points, I often feel like saying, 'just get to the point'. He spends over a page using various works of art to comment on how we react to them and how it shows our bodily empathy.It felt like he introduced this list of art to fill a few pages. There can often be much speculation based on what he observes in the bonobos and humans themselves. There are often times when I feel he speculates too much. Though I will say that I was pleased to hear another one of his many examples that'humans most prone to yawn contagion also have the most empathy'. That is pleasing to know since simply reading the word yawn sets me off :).I have enjoyed reading this book but when he stated 'My first book on this topic, Good Natured (1996), barely mentioned religion' I almost wish I had read that instead."

He shows from his experimental work the basis for morality in our simian ancestors. They have empathy and an innate sense of fairness, required for communal living an hunting, that sets the basis for a moral code. (His experiments showing a sense of fairness in monkeys is fmous and the subject of a terrific TED tak). Region, or other social institutions, build on this inherent bent. De Waal describes morality as bottom up and not top down. Although he is atheist himself, he takes issue with the “neo atheists” like Hitchins and Dawkins who are aggressive in attacking religion. He urges tolerance and open mindedness and to not be as dogmatic as relious fundamentalists. He feels religion plays an important role in the social structure of close knit groups, it is robust (whereas science is new, difficult, “unnatural” and therefore fragile in an all out battle with religion). He feels northern Europe is carrying out a large scale gradual experiment in secularism. Can education and the state take over the amalgamating role of relion and make a strong, moral society without religion? We'll see eventually. Certainty efforts to remove religion by force, like the communists and Khmer rouge, have been horrible failures, worse than the superstition and dogmatism they wanted to replace. The animal work, an observations of behaviour, that De Waal uses to support his arguments are interesting in their own right. This is a most worthwhile read for its science and for the way science can inform philosophy and politics.De Waal is a hero of mine; he is an imaginative scientist, and a mature reviewer of the biological basis of empathy, altruism, and morality. In this book he continues his eye-opening work on the behavior of primates, especially our nearest relatives, the chimps and bonobos. His careful monitoring of their behavior in laboratories and in the wild, points out the ancient foundation of moral behavior among animals living in interdependent societies. In this book he also addresses the ongoing debate between religion, particularly fundamentalists, and science. Although he is an atheist he sees the value in religious practice and bonding, if not in the dogma. He takes aim at the “new atheists”, like Hitchens and Dawkins, and chides them for a combative and often insulting tone that does not help bridge the social gap. The tone of this book is so mature and thoughtful it is quite humbling. I wish I could be more like him."
72,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71935584-ben-zimmerman,3,"As a book about fascinating and well-told narratives about animal behavior and cognition, I would give this book a better rating (as I would rate many of Frans De Waal’s books). However, the purpose of this book seemed to be more about a reflection of religion and a bit of a criticism of the “new atheists”. I thought that the religious reflections weren’t very interesting and often wrong in the way that he characterized the views of both many atheists and many religious people. Some of his reflections and connections seemed disconnected and not well thought out. I would definitely recommend reading Frans de Waal, but maybe a different book. "
73,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10397934-erich,3,"Somewhat meandering in its approach, this book does make some convincing and enlightening arguments that I am happy to ponder. Frans de Waal's obvious expertise in primate prosocial behavior gives him an excellent vantage point to show that morality certainly evolved well before any religious institutions were established, especially as we know them today. The anecdotes are enticing and revealing, and really make the thesis very compelling. Primatology sounds even more fascinating when we see ourselves so vividly reflected in his vignettes. Some of the digressions into how we are to deal with morality and religion in the face of scientific progress are less persuasive. I did not find de Waal's writing to be particularly cohesive or share the logical argumentative power of a Dawkins or Hitchens. Towards the end of the book I finally began to grasp his viewpoint, and mostly embraced it, but there was no feeling of real enlightenment. I think the book overall, and some of its arguments, could have been better organized. The book did serve a good counterpoint to what de Waal calls ""neo-Atheists"" such as Sam Harris, Dawkins, and Hitchens (well, ""Marxist"" for him), though I happen to love these authors. If you are looking for that, it has its moments. I have to admit that I had problems with de Waal's recommendation to give modern religion so much leeway and to dispense with the heated ""anti-religious"" rhetoric of those mentioned above. While humans may be naturally predisposed to accepting religion as a form of social normalizing (which I agree has had its place in our civilizing process), this doesn't mean it we should accept it as necessary today. Its stranglehold on truth in the face of scientific evidence does nothing to enforce our common morality. If anything, it holds us back from truly understanding our place in the universe and extending a moral code to everyone. I see a need for more strong voices opposed to this willful ignorance and dogma, not fewer. All in all, a good read with some nice points. And bonobos!"
74,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13928228-sortal,1,"Muddy thinking, misrepresentation (or ignorance?) of atheist arguments, and lots of irrelevant passages on Hieronymus Bosch. I've really enjoyed other books by Frans de Waal, but this is an unsuccessful departure from his areas of expertise. Insofar as I can figure out what de Waal is arguing for, I agree with most of his premises: 1. Moral conduct exists on a continuum, including the behaviours of other animals.2. Dogmatism is terrible and should be avoided. 3. Religion is superfluous to morality. 4. Hardline atheism is unlikely to persuade the devoutly religious to give up their faith.But then things go wrong. 5. De Waal never addresses whether religion is inherently dogmatic. (Insofar as it's faith-based, where faith is belief without evidence, it certainly seems that way.) 6. De Waal never addresses the harm done by religion (a crucial point made by the thinkers he so blithely dismisses, such as Dawkins and Harris). 7. De Waal claims (without any supporting argument) that religion will always exist.If you replaced the passages on Bosch with a fair representation of the atheists de Waal is arguing against, you'd have a wonderful book. Better still would be a book using de Waal's research to build on the project of Harris' Moral Landscape, helping to create an alternative to religion (the logical next step from premises 2-4 once you accept 5 and 6 and dismiss 7). Instead, you get an infuriatingly murky read of jumbled ideas with just enough interesting anecdotes about primates to keep you reading through the rambling about Bosch.   "
75,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"The book really should have been titled ""The Bonobo and Human Empathy"". The two pillars of all philosophy are empathy and reciprocity. He completely examines the first pillar, empathy, by illustrating empathetic behavior in Bonobos (and other animals) and linking it to our behavior.He's such a good writer even when he wrote about things I completely disagreed with I would find the book thought provoking. I thought he trivialized the arguments of Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens and John Stuart Mill. But, I'm not bothered. I believe what I believe and I appreciated the different perspective.The narrator did a perfect job.The book is much better than most pop science books I have listened to and I'm much richer for having listened to this highly entertaining book and can definitely say because of this book I'm much closer to my goal of understanding our place in the universe. He does talk about philosophy but I enjoyed those parts as much as I did about bonobos.(P.S. Matt Ridley's book, ""The Rational Optimist"", fully covers the second pillar of human philosophy, reciprocity. Also, my personal take on the author he seemed like an apologetic atheist and he didn't want to offend anyone. But as I say, I wasn't bothered by this, but I disagreed with him regarding those sections. Also, he seemed to characterized the utilitarianism of John Stuart Mill in a comic book fashion. Once again I wasn't bothered but I don't want to leave the impression that I agreed with him on those two points)."
76,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51675760-mark-james,3,"I really enjoyed learning about the idiosyncrasies of many of the primates, as well as having a better sense of the differences between bonobos and chimps. Choosing Bosch's ""The Garden of Earthly Delights"" as a focal point was interesting on de Waal's part. I couldn't help but feel the book could have been better organized, as the topic shifts from bonobos to religion to morality to art without any obvious structure. Finally, there were several points made about atheism that don't hold up to scrutiny. For instance, he writes, ""Everything humans have accomplished anywhere - from architecture to music, from art to science - developed hand in hand with religion, never separately."" Do you mean, de Waal, that religion has existed at the same time that these wonderful things were created, or that all people who created these things were religious? Certainly neither is true. In fact, most examples of human achievement come in spite of religion, not because of it.Elsewhere, de Waal faults Christopher Hitchens for shifting loyalties several times before landing on an antitheist stance. To me, this only means that Hitchens was tireless in his pursuit of truth.I detected countless other examples of unfair judgments, but overall, the author tends to take the safe middle ground when failing to acknowledge that anything we can do without belief in the supernatural, we can do without it, and then some."
77,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3050574-a-b-gayle,3,"Humanism and the BonoboI struggled to get through this book while I was totally immersed in another of his, questioning whether humans were smart enough to understand animals. I think part of my alienation arose because of his obsession with Heironymous Bosch’s art. (I thought he was an LAPD detective, lol!)Basically, I totally agree with the main premise of this book. Best summed up in the final chapter.Thank God, if I may, we share with other primates a background as group animals, which makes us value social connections. Absent this background, religion could be preaching about virtue and vice until it became blue in the face, we’d never get its point. We are receptive only because of our evolved grasp of the value of relationships, the benefits of cooperation, the need for trust and honesty, and so on. Even our sense of fairness derives from this background.In other words, we are receptive to religion (some might say vulnerable) simply because we like other mammals have empathy and value relationships, the benefits of cooperation, the need for trust and honesty, and so on. Even our sense of fairness derives from this background. But just because something is possible doesn’t mean it is necessary.Throughout the preceding chapters, he has shown different ways this morality manifests itself within the animal kingdom. He refutes the notion that if it weren’t for religion, humans would be no better than animals. In fact he states Morality arose first, and modern religion latched onto it. Instead of giving us the moral law, the large religions were invented to bolster it. We are only just beginning to explore how religion does so by binding people together and enforcing good behavior. It is far from my intention to minimize this role, which was vital in the past and may remain so in the foreseeable future, but the wellspring of morality it is not.In fact he sees the evolutionary development of this bottom up morality that has allowed us to develop to where we are today.So why not give this a higher rating?Firstly, the continual referral to the Bosch painting “The Garden” which seemed a stretch at times to illustrate a point he was making. We can no more know why Bosch painted it the way he did than know what Bonobos are actually thinking.Sure, studying them in the wild and conducting experiments can demonstrate that they have recognisable emotions, but in one section he has Bonobos thinking about what atheists would be thinking. So that was my second star off.The third star off is for his dodgy logic in many sections. Take for example his dismissal of the Golden Rule of Christianity (Do unto others as you would have them do unto you).To give a rather crude example, if at a conference I follow an attractive woman whom I barely know to her hotel room and jump into her bed uninvited, I can pretty well guess how she’d react. If I explain that I am just doing to her what I would love her to do to me, I’m afraid my appeal to the golden rule won’t fly. Or, let’s assume that I knowingly serve pork sausages to a vegan. Liking meat myself, I am just following the golden rule, but the vegan will consider my behavior obnoxious, perhaps even immoral.In both cases he has only looked at the physical side of the equation, not the effects of those acts. Would he like someone to rape him or insult his beliefs? You can’t divorce the act from the motive or consequence of the act. If all three are taken into account, the Golden Rule still applies.Chapter 7 particularly had some lazy logic. Whereas in previous chapters I’d been highlighting very well presented arguments, this one is full of my exasperation at the arguments used to justify the need for religion in society. Take this one for example.We humans were plenty moral when we still roamed the savanna in small bands. Only when the scale of society began to grow and rules of reciprocity and reputation began to falter did a moralizing God become necessary.But perhaps the “necessity” for this moralising God and his acolytes comes about because the chances of having a psychopath or control freak who wants this power (in the form of a controlling religion) has increased because of the larger population? He had already acknowledged that personalities varied within animal groups, so the ‘need’ for religion could just as easily be attributed to statistics producing people who wanted power for power’s sake.Interestingly when you look at early Greek and Roman religion, the gods just existed. They were used to explain the unexplainable. It was only later that the gods started telling people how to behave. I’m pretty sure the population of Ancient Greeks and Romans was not insignificant.But let’s look at another lazy analogy The whole purpose of God is to do the latter (loving moral actions). We endowed him with the capacity to keep us on the same straight and narrow that we’d been following ever since we lived in small bands.How different is this from the concept of Santa Claus being used to make children behave? Adults understand that rewards that are achievable are the best ways to control children. Likewise those who perceive the need to control large numbers of adults do so by playing up to the fears that adults have (as evidenced previously in this chapter) - a fear of death and hence the need for an afterlife.While I can see his point that a focusing deity that encourages people to be good is not bad, but the dogma that accompanies it and the divisions this creates makes me question whether this need could be better met in other ways or at least recognised for what is really happening. Perhaps the need is more that many individuals are not going to take orders from one of their own, but prefer that order to come from some unquestionably alpha figure.So my final verdict? Animals follow their own form of moral code developed in response to the betterment of their community. While some humans are still capable of doing this, others through laziness, unwillingness to kowtow to one of their own issuing instructions or fear of their mortality need some sort of mystical religion to guide their actions. I added another star back in because he made a good case for respecting that animals at times are better socialised than many humans."
78,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5889085-h-wesselius,4,"The title is somewhat misleading. De Waal is not writing a tight coherent account of morality and humanism among the primates. He is instead writing meandering thought provoking but far more personal account of humanism and science. His constant reference to the Bosch painting which he uses as a metaphor is an irritant. From this and his forays into philosophical discussions on the nature of God and morality, its obvious he's writing more of a personal discussion which he's entitled to after years of work. One of the frequent arguments for the existence of God is the cited need for moral law. Its the existence of God and his instruction to man that sets us apart, apparently. De Waal successful challenges that assumption citing evidence of moral behavior in not only primates but in other larger social animals such as dolphins and elephants. From this he proposes that morality is derived from the social nature of animals and has an bottoms up origins as opposed to the top down model proposed by various religions. Pulling it all together, he makes a compelling argument that morality is the basis for religion and a belief in God and not the other way around. An excellent read with a good and interesting argument. "
79,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/119364-melee-farr,3,"The premise of the book was right up my alley - examining the roots of morality (and ultimately religion) from a larger mammalian perspective. And I think it was effective on that front. de Waal is a primatologist, first and foremost, and there were countless examples from his and others' research, observations, and publications of moral behavior existing consistently in the animal world, with sound evolutionary reasoning for pro-social behaviors being retained throughout mammalian phylogeny. I flew through the first half of the book. He uses Bosch's triptych painting ""Garden of Earthly Delights"" as a recurring metaphor throughout the book, and honestly, he lost me with it. I mean, I understood the metaphor, but, to use another, it was kind of beating a dead horse. This may reveal the fact that I'm not particularly well-versed in the visual arts. He also is rather dismissive of atheism as often aggressive and exclusionary, and permissive of religion because he sees it as inevitable and having some consistently positive societal traits. Both points are well-made, but may whitewash the good done by skepticism and the evil done by dogmatism. But that perspective may also just reveal my bias. "
80,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6664778-andrea,3,"Tracing the beginning of morality may be as close as our fellow primates the Bonobos, as de Waal explains in this book. I am interested in the topic of the origins of morality and the book has a flow that kept me reading. I do think de Waal has a little Richard Dawkins envy though. Richard Dawkins is simply a better writer. This author makes the point that although morality predates religion there is no point in egging on the religious majority by calling such religious beliefs delusional, which in fact Dawkins does. I agree it is pointless and may be even counter productive however I feel the author fails to give due the bias that atheists face, bias that denies us jobs, social status and even basic human rights. Try getting into high political positions as an outed atheist. Frans does a disservice to human rights when he says that there is no reason to state an atheist agenda, and I agree, but what about a human agenda? Frans doesn't take the biases seriously enough. This being said the book is worth a read to remind us of our roots, to connect with fellow primates and to learn more about the origins of morality."
81,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5318025-nina,3,"Frans de Waal's research is impressive, and I found his insights into primate behaviors, including those of humans, very interesting. However, if the purpose of his study had to do with religion and morality, then he failed to connect the two sides of the book (primatology and religion). By the time I finished the book, my big questions were, What does religion have to do with this study? and What does Bosch have to do with primatology? Personal admiration for the painter does not constitute expertise, and while interesting, the bursts of art history did not in any way advance de Waal's argument, especially because they did not rely on art history so much as on the author's personal responses to The Garden of Earthly Delights. Sadly, de Waal does not really understand atheists either, neither old-school nor the ones he refers to as ""neo-atheists."" Personal opinions rather than data dominate this book, and opinions do not prove very much. The lack of hard evidence for the arguments on morality is only part of the problem, though. The author's attempts at wit are offensive to many readers, and together with speculation rather than evidence hurt the book's message. "
82,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11200007-douglas-cosby,1,"1.5 stars (the extra half point is for the narrator): Not my bag. I read the first third of this book, but couldn't get any further. Franz de Waal's point is simple: morality is a result of evolution, not imposed by religion or ""invented"" by humans. A very good point, and I sympathize with de Waal's frustration with biologists/scientists that fall prey to the rampant anthropomorphism we humans tend to overlay on the way we see other animals. He uses a few scientific studies, but mainly just anecdotes and cute stories, to justify his position, and this book feels more like a feel-good article in O magazine than something that would be in Scientific American or Nature. Additionally, while de Waal harshly criticizes recent atheist authors, it doesn't seem like he has really read them. For instance, his criticism of Sam Harris's The Moral Landscape, seems like it came from the back-of-the-book summary, not the actual details of the book. If you are in the mood for a bunch of touching ape stories, then this book might be for you. If you are looking for a book on the scientific basis of prehuman morality supported by scientific evidence and logical conclusions, look elsewhere."
83,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5078550-robert-bor,4,"I got this book from my friends, who appreciate my interest in evolution, politics and society. Frans de Waal weaves two different threads in this book. On the one hand, he proceeds to show clearly how animals (the Bonobo primate in particular) have an extremely good sense of moralistic behavior. This undermines the argument that moralistic behavior is one of the primary consequences of religion. No, not just undermines, evaporates. This is where he weaves in the other thread, where he distances himself from the Atheist camp (Dawkins et al) and states that religion should not just be abandoned if we cannot replace it with something else. He understands the need of humans for spirituality and does not just wish this away. In the dual aspect, a bit of a weird combination, but understandable, since being seen in the Atheist camp, pretty much shuts you out from dialogue with the religious one. Is Mr de Waal aiming for a diplomatic role in bringing the two camps closer together? On another note, if you like the work of Hiëronymus Bosch, know that it features prominently in this book."
84,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7349461-cody,3,"This book had its ups and downs. de Waal's argument for morality emerging from bottom-up processes is convincing, and I really enjoyed when he would dive into the details of primate research, as well his many anecdotes. This alone makes the book worth reading. I do, however, think he was quite off the mark with his criticism of the ""neo-Atheists"" (i.e., the New Atheists). On top of the misguided attacks (A.C. Grayling addresses some of these in a review in Prospect Magazine http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/mag...), at times he comes across as patronizing. He stresses the need for religion to help secure ethics among the masses (at least at present), while apparently considering himself fully capable of living morally without religion. That said, I think the book drives home some good points (especially in the final chapters), and will get both believers and non-believers thinking about some of these issues."
85,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8076824-geoff,3,"I have a soft spot for primates, and books on morality are catching my attention at the moment so I thought I would have enjoyed this book more than I did. I also recently read The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt, so I can't help but compare the two. While I did enjoy this book more than The Righteous Mind, I still gave both books three stars. Frans de Waal's writing style is much more enjoyable and conversational than Haidt's. However, there seemed to be less science involved in this book. I know there are countless endnotes and references at the back of the book, but somehow the observations came across as purely anecdotal. While I agree with de Waal's bottom up approach to morality, rather than from top down, I didn't find that the strength of his arguments would convince anyone who don't already believe as he does."
86,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6323134-darcey,3,"I found this an interesting read, though perhaps one with more extraneous information than I wanted. I enjoyed de Waal's anecdotes and commentary about Bosch and how that was related to humanity, symbolism, and the growth of ideas - however, there was more of it than necessary (including recounting experiences of being at the Prado in Madrid). The linkage between the fact that primates (and other animals) exhibit traits which we as humans consider ""moral"" - and that animals do not follow religion - is clear, leaving us with no way to avoid the conclusion de Waal sets out to prove: morality is not something encoded purely by religion, and those who believe that without religion humans will descend to immoral madness have a significant amount of evidence to overcome to prove their position. "
87,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5777523-jami,4,"This was a well researched, informative book. I was not familiar with Frans de Waal's work before this book, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I thought there would be more focus on the Bonobo anecdotes, but there were enough to keep me entertained and interested. This book looks at the issue of what the source of morality and other behaviors is; it combines many areas of study, including religion, philosophy, science, sociology, psychology, and history. While parts of the book dragged a little, overall it was well done. There were some parts of the book that fascinated me and that I had never considered before, such as the yawn response in relation to empathy; I also particularly enjoyed the passages about specific behaviors usually only attributed to humans that are found in bonobos and other species. The narration was very good and easy to listen to."
88,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/906313-diane,3,"This was a surprisingly interesting argument on the origin of morality. In a spiritual context, morality is something that is imposed by God with commandments and injunctions, etc. deWaal, however, draws from his many years as a primatologist to suggest that morality is an internal motivator, something that is inherent within us and those species most closely related to us. The bonobo is his primary example of a primate that clearly demonstrates moral qualities such as empathy. I found it very interesting to listen to, but kind of disorganized. And since de Waal frequently mentions the Hieronymus Bosch painting, ""Garden of Earthly Delight,"" I wished I had that image on hand. Nevertheless, I enjoyed de Waal's ideas and his intelligent presentation."

The author's work with primates, and less frequently with other social mammals, provides convincing evidence for a continuity of development of consciousness and empathetic/moral behavior between humankind and other animals. It successfully combats the idea that humans and other social animals are at the core selfish, with altruism as a thin, self-serving veneer; that without top-down religious mandates, such as the 10 commandments, people would live in a nightmare Hobbesian world; and that ""selfish gene"" theories are a adequate way of understanding and interpreting an organism's behavior and motivations. An enjoyable read."

91,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33852158-halli-lauren,3,"I read and enjoyed De Waal’s “Are we smart enough to know how smart animals are”, so when I saw this book was written by him, I was pretty intrigued! As a baby atheist myself, and someone who is interested in studying bonobos, this seemed like the perfect book for me. Unfortunately, De Waal spent way more time talking about chimpanzees than bonobos. He also spent way more time talking about Heironymus Bosch than was necessary. What was the point of that?? I was pretty on board with the author’s broader points about religion:1. Trying to “convert people to atheism” is a waste of energy 2. Religion isn’t going away any time soon, and if it did, we’d need to find something to replace it because of all the important things it does for us as humans (ie: community building)But here are my qualms:1. Why did he spend so much time condemning Neo-Atheists and so little time condemning the abuse and manipulation in so many religions? Toward the beginning, De Waal pointed out that he came from a much more casual religious background, so leaving his religion wasn’t as big of a deal. But the thing is, so many religions are extremely dogmatic which can lead to much more harm than good. De Waal definitely condemned dogmatism, which I agree with, but he didn’t seem to realize how inescapable dogmatism can be. Maybe that’s just my point of view coming from a high demand, very dogmatic religion. 2. So yeah, religion is important and isn’t going away any time soon. Then what should atheists do? De Waal spent so much time saying how important religion is, and even though he is an atheist himself, he didn’t share any of his ideas of how to get the benefits of religion elsewhere. I guess that’s what I wanted out of the book, and I didn’t get it. Then of course there’s the main subject matter of the book: the evolution of morality and altruism. This was all well and good, but while reading I didn’t have any “Aha!” moments- nothing felt very fresh to me. Overall a disappointing read. Not good, not bad. Just meh. Oh also I’m just sick of reading books by old white men… if anyone has recommendations of nonfiction science books by women or people of color?? Definitely would love to hear those."
92,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15812925-adrian-undrea,4,"Frans de Waal is probably best known for his appearances on TED Talks. Having seen his presentations on animal morality I have to admit I have started reading his book being biased. I consider myself an atheist and somehow I had been looking at this book to reinforce this view. But The Bonobo and the Atheist shouldn't be read for that as Frans de Waal looks to explore the origins of morality and debunk the myth, so deeply ingrained in most of us, that morality is the trademark of humanity. And while sometimes it jumps too fast from one idea to the other, reading The Bonobo and the Atheist with an open mind might change the way you view morality. Far from being a hallmark of mankind, morality is a product of evolution, shaping the interactions of all social animals. By the use of countless experiments Frans de Waal argues morality is a mere tool of the highly evolved animals that makes living in groups possible. It is one more nail in the coffin of the idea that somehow we are special from the rest of the biological world. And while Frans de Waal thinks letting go of religion might not be possible for humanity, he favors the optimistic idea that our moral compass is an inner one (a bottom-up approach) instead of having its origins in religion (a top-down view)."

But he is mostly driven by arguing against skeptics (skeptics of animal-cognition, not in general) so he is great at giving counter examples. But he is not that great at proposing new ideas. So I might be wrong. Basically, from what I understood, bottom-up morality is descriptive to prescriptive morality with emphasis on socially enforced ones. I might be wrong because he was not that clear -to me- about it. Which is, underwhelming. Both because intuitive morality is at the end a prescriptive morality, however he wants to say that they are not that different. The arguments against different schools of normative thinking was also weak because from a utilitarian point of view, he was arguing a straw-man, as a utilitarian (like me) wouldn't exactly argue as he did in the place of a utilitarian. Though I have to say, it may have been not because if an intentional effort, but because he probably did not check his argument with a utilitarian. Overall, I don't think this book-essay was a ""great-read"" type, but it is certainly better than reading a fiction in search of meaning."

The Bonobo and the Atheist explores the evolution of morality and the place of religion in our lives, seamlessly blending science, speculation, storytelling, and⁠ (yes, even⁠) art criticism. If there is a short-coming here, it is that the balance between these elements will be a little unsatisfactory for anyone who is mainly interested in the science. Compared to Frans de Waal's Primates and Philosophers—which features commentary from Robert Wright, Christine Korsgaard, Philip Kitcher and Peter Singer—The Bonobo and the Atheist also lacks the clarity that comes from having de Waal's most ambitious ideas reigned in by more cautious thinkers."
96,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21008908-magda-linga,4,"A fascinating read about the roots of morality, religion, atheism and primates. The author is a very understanding, smart person and it’s a pleasure to read his thoughts compiled in this book. "
97,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15731711-samantha,4,"I am totally on the fence when it comes to Frans de Waal. Sometimes I find myself underlining sentences in this book in agreement, and other times I find myself scribbling frustrated notes of disagreement in the side margins. For example, on page 184 de Waal practically ridicules Peter Singer for not taking his view that we should have ""special loyalty"" to our own species while excluding other species from our moral equations. He basically argues that we should determine our morals (in some cases) based on loyalty to our own group - in this case, our own species. It's terribly reminiscent of people from history who argued the same way - substituting ""species"" for ""race"" or ""sex"". I assume that some time in the future, people will read this and think ""Wow, de Waal was a good primatologist, it's a shame he was such a speciesist"" as we now say about 18th and 19th century writers. In the margins on page 184 I wrote ""But sometimes fierce loyalty to one's own group is immoral - it would be immoral for me to say a black person is not equal to a white person merely out of loyalty to my own race."" This morality based on loyalty to one's own group is rather small-minded, if you ask me.Another rather bad part of de Waal's book was on page 204, where he writes, ""Neo-atheists are like people standing outside a movie theater telling us that Leonardo DiCaprio didn't really go down with the Titanic. How shocking! Mostly of us are perfectly comfortable with the duality."" The flaw in his argument is this: no one ridicules Titanic watchers because no Titanic watcher actually believes that Leo went down with the famous ship. But atheists ridicule theists because they ACTUALLY believe ridiculous things like wine turning into blood or demons in the form of talking snakes tempting people to eat some fruit. He argues that atheists who criticize religion are advocating the elimination of imagination. But the key difference between people with active imaginations and theists is that imaginative people ultimately recognize that their fantasies aren't part of reality. Theists make no such recognition; they actually believe, metaphorically, that Leonardo DiCaprio was on the Titanic. Or anything else equally absurd. This is why they are ridiculed and the imagination is not. Imagination is beautiful and beneficial in many ways. I'm a fiction writer, I have a very deep appreciation of imagination, but I recognize it as just that - imagination. Unlike imagination, I consider most religious claims ridiculously illogical because the theist seriously believes in these fantasies. I would have not the slightest problem with religion if this was not the case (but then it wouldn't really be religion, would it?). The weakness in de Waal's analogy (criticizing theists to criticizing moviegoers) is so obvious that I can't help thinking de Waal might not completely understand religion or what it means to condemn it.There are other ways in which I strongly disagreed with de Waal, particularly when he talked about religion (I write in a margin, ""Can we go back to the apes now?"") but overall I tended to agree with what he said. It was a good book and I learned a lot from it about chimps and bonobos. The parts about the apes were very interesting, but the parts where de Waal starts talking religion and philosophy were out of touch with how I feel about those matters. Overall, it was a good book and worth reading for anyone interested in the origins of morality."
98,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9716384-vivify-m,5,"I very much enjoyed this book. Primatology enthralls me - learning about our primate cousins, and how researchers work with them is a joy. But, the resulting insights into our own psychology, is the highlight. I also, enjoyed understanding how the experiments were constructed and the challenges the researchers faced.On the downside, I was put off by the authors attitude towards other disciplines. I found his criticism of biologists unnecessary, in particular his misrepresentation of geneticists as calling prosocial behaviour a mistake. I’m no expert, but I also questioned his representation of evolution. At times I thought he was confusing selfish genes with selfish individuals. Possibly, the most significant contribution of the book, is the idea that key to our salvation is in understanding our natural selves. I love this sentiment, but I also get nervous of overly naturalistic thinking, and I’m not convinced by the arguments against utilitarianism. Ultimately, this was a deeply thought provoking and enjoyable book."
99,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57079482-chuck-kollars,4,"The author has kept and done research with Chimpanzees and Bonobos (formerly known as Pygmy Chimps) for decades, is top of his field, and has written many books. The main theme of this book is an observation and bit of reasoning. The observation is that our animal relatives routinely display a fairly strong sense of morality (focused on maintaining good relations within the group). The obvious reasoning from this is that our current morality -often embedded in ""religion""- comes not from anything external like religion but rather from something internal that predates religion. He makes this case pretty strongly, but without placing it in a larger hypothetical framework. The book mentions, but doesn't even try to answer larger questions such as how did our morality come to be deposited in religion?, how does a morality focused on good group relations work with much larger groups (tribe, nation, globe, etc.)?, how much can we deviate from our unthinking inborn sense of morality before everything falls apart?, and how will we know when we don't need religion at all any more?He does several other things in this same book: He responds to the ""four horsemen of atheism"" that made such a splash a few years ago. He presents many interesting anecdotes from his subjects, some of which are closely tied to a sense of morality and some that illustrate more intelligence/forethought/non-aggression than we typically credit our close relative animals with. And he tries his hand at an explication of the painting ""The Garden"" by ""Heironymus Bosch"". He draws some interesting parallels between these topics, but in my opinion not enough, so the book seems less focused than it could be. There are indeed connections between these strands (even though they're not as strong as I'd like). For example, the author thinks the ""four horsemen of atheism"" give too much credit to religion in accusing it of being the root of horrible wars and genocides. Such abominable behavior is also displayed by chimps in certain circumstances. Humans must have gotten it from the same place, and our common ancestor predates religion. Also, chimp society is clearly uninfluenced by any human religion ...or any religion at all. So for the wars and genocides, despite its claims, religion was really more ""cover story"" than ""cause"". In a way the whole book is a plea for humble moderation rather than conspicuous ideology. We're asked to actually look at the evidence in front of our faces and to not completely throw out religion until we understand it a little better and so forth. This is his critique of the atheists too: most scientists are rather dubious about religion, but why is it so important to you that other people think exactly the same way you do? He describes the seemingly contradictory combination of a lackluster subject with passionate advocacy as ""sleeping furiously""."
100,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12402305-hanan-elsharif,3,"In her 1985 book Sex and Friendship in Baboons, Barbara Smuts was the first to apply the term “friendship” to animals,ha ha. her name is Smuts. um. Back to some serious reading nowIn all honesty, I chose to read this book to learn about Bonobos and didn't want to fully enter into any religious debate. That part of the book I really enjoyed. However. since this book is titled 'The Bonobo and the Atheist', I will make a few comments.I will say that I enjoyed reading about Veneer theory. Unfortunately, I am not so sure that I agree with Frans de Waal's notion that this theory is no longer valid with the overwhelming evidence of innate altruism. Perhaps I'm a skeptic but I still feel that people do in fact weigh up the possible benefits of their actions and not just in business and with acquaintances but also with family and friends; which is not what he believes. He believes we are altruistic with those closest to us and that is not always the case. What I will say is that I don't argue that there is something innate within us that gives us our moral compass but one could argue that it is a higher being that gives us that moral compass in the first place. Nonetheless, what I do respect is that at no point does he belittle other religions or in fact hail atheism as the one true faith. I respect that he is not a militant atheist like Dawkins. He even mentions that for him - when considering that it was wrongly believed Darwin agreed with 'the expulsion of morality from the natural domain'-""the height of absurdity was reached when Dawkins explicitly disavowed Darwin, telling an interviewer in 1997 that 'in our political and social life we are entitled to throw out Darwinism.'"" He doesn't appreciate Dawkin's ability to be so dismissive of other beliefs.This is a good read but, as mentioned in some other reviews that I've read, I also feel that Frans de Waal is mixing two ideas that needn't be discussed together. When he does discuss some points, I often feel like saying, 'just get to the point'. He spends over a page using various works of art to comment on how we react to them and how it shows our bodily empathy.It felt like he introduced this list of art to fill a few pages. There can often be much speculation based on what he observes in the bonobos and humans themselves. There are often times when I feel he speculates too much. Though I will say that I was pleased to hear another one of his many examples that'humans most prone to yawn contagion also have the most empathy'. That is pleasing to know since simply reading the word yawn sets me off :).I have enjoyed reading this book but when he stated 'My first book on this topic, Good Natured (1996), barely mentioned religion' I almost wish I had read that instead."
101,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196037-jrobertus,5,"De Waal is a primatologist with a philosophical bent. I have read several of his books; they are not only interesting but important. He shows from his experimental work the basis for morality in our simian ancestors. They have empathy and an innate sense of fairness, required for communal living an hunting, that sets the basis for a moral code. (His experiments showing a sense of fairness in monkeys is fmous and the subject of a terrific TED tak). Region, or other social institutions, build on this inherent bent. De Waal describes morality as bottom up and not top down. Although he is atheist himself, he takes issue with the “neo atheists” like Hitchins and Dawkins who are aggressive in attacking religion. He urges tolerance and open mindedness and to not be as dogmatic as relious fundamentalists. He feels religion plays an important role in the social structure of close knit groups, it is robust (whereas science is new, difficult, “unnatural” and therefore fragile in an all out battle with religion). He feels northern Europe is carrying out a large scale gradual experiment in secularism. Can education and the state take over the amalgamating role of relion and make a strong, moral society without religion? We'll see eventually. Certainty efforts to remove religion by force, like the communists and Khmer rouge, have been horrible failures, worse than the superstition and dogmatism they wanted to replace. The animal work, an observations of behaviour, that De Waal uses to support his arguments are interesting in their own right. This is a most worthwhile read for its science and for the way science can inform philosophy and politics.De Waal is a hero of mine; he is an imaginative scientist, and a mature reviewer of the biological basis of empathy, altruism, and morality. In this book he continues his eye-opening work on the behavior of primates, especially our nearest relatives, the chimps and bonobos. His careful monitoring of their behavior in laboratories and in the wild, points out the ancient foundation of moral behavior among animals living in interdependent societies. In this book he also addresses the ongoing debate between religion, particularly fundamentalists, and science. Although he is an atheist he sees the value in religious practice and bonding, if not in the dogma. He takes aim at the “new atheists”, like Hitchens and Dawkins, and chides them for a combative and often insulting tone that does not help bridge the social gap. The tone of this book is so mature and thoughtful it is quite humbling. I wish I could be more like him."
102,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71935584-ben-zimmerman,3,"As a book about fascinating and well-told narratives about animal behavior and cognition, I would give this book a better rating (as I would rate many of Frans De Waal’s books). However, the purpose of this book seemed to be more about a reflection of religion and a bit of a criticism of the “new atheists”. I thought that the religious reflections weren’t very interesting and often wrong in the way that he characterized the views of both many atheists and many religious people. Some of his reflections and connections seemed disconnected and not well thought out. I would definitely recommend reading Frans de Waal, but maybe a different book. "
103,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10397934-erich,3,"Somewhat meandering in its approach, this book does make some convincing and enlightening arguments that I am happy to ponder. Frans de Waal's obvious expertise in primate prosocial behavior gives him an excellent vantage point to show that morality certainly evolved well before any religious institutions were established, especially as we know them today. The anecdotes are enticing and revealing, and really make the thesis very compelling. Primatology sounds even more fascinating when we see ourselves so vividly reflected in his vignettes. Some of the digressions into how we are to deal with morality and religion in the face of scientific progress are less persuasive. I did not find de Waal's writing to be particularly cohesive or share the logical argumentative power of a Dawkins or Hitchens. Towards the end of the book I finally began to grasp his viewpoint, and mostly embraced it, but there was no feeling of real enlightenment. I think the book overall, and some of its arguments, could have been better organized. The book did serve a good counterpoint to what de Waal calls ""neo-Atheists"" such as Sam Harris, Dawkins, and Hitchens (well, ""Marxist"" for him), though I happen to love these authors. If you are looking for that, it has its moments. I have to admit that I had problems with de Waal's recommendation to give modern religion so much leeway and to dispense with the heated ""anti-religious"" rhetoric of those mentioned above. While humans may be naturally predisposed to accepting religion as a form of social normalizing (which I agree has had its place in our civilizing process), this doesn't mean it we should accept it as necessary today. Its stranglehold on truth in the face of scientific evidence does nothing to enforce our common morality. If anything, it holds us back from truly understanding our place in the universe and extending a moral code to everyone. I see a need for more strong voices opposed to this willful ignorance and dogma, not fewer. All in all, a good read with some nice points. And bonobos!"
104,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13928228-sortal,1,"Muddy thinking, misrepresentation (or ignorance?) of atheist arguments, and lots of irrelevant passages on Hieronymus Bosch. I've really enjoyed other books by Frans de Waal, but this is an unsuccessful departure from his areas of expertise. Insofar as I can figure out what de Waal is arguing for, I agree with most of his premises: 1. Moral conduct exists on a continuum, including the behaviours of other animals.2. Dogmatism is terrible and should be avoided. 3. Religion is superfluous to morality. 4. Hardline atheism is unlikely to persuade the devoutly religious to give up their faith.But then things go wrong. 5. De Waal never addresses whether religion is inherently dogmatic. (Insofar as it's faith-based, where faith is belief without evidence, it certainly seems that way.) 6. De Waal never addresses the harm done by religion (a crucial point made by the thinkers he so blithely dismisses, such as Dawkins and Harris). 7. De Waal claims (without any supporting argument) that religion will always exist.If you replaced the passages on Bosch with a fair representation of the atheists de Waal is arguing against, you'd have a wonderful book. Better still would be a book using de Waal's research to build on the project of Harris' Moral Landscape, helping to create an alternative to religion (the logical next step from premises 2-4 once you accept 5 and 6 and dismiss 7). Instead, you get an infuriatingly murky read of jumbled ideas with just enough interesting anecdotes about primates to keep you reading through the rambling about Bosch.   "
105,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"The book really should have been titled ""The Bonobo and Human Empathy"". The two pillars of all philosophy are empathy and reciprocity. He completely examines the first pillar, empathy, by illustrating empathetic behavior in Bonobos (and other animals) and linking it to our behavior.He's such a good writer even when he wrote about things I completely disagreed with I would find the book thought provoking. I thought he trivialized the arguments of Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens and John Stuart Mill. But, I'm not bothered. I believe what I believe and I appreciated the different perspective.The narrator did a perfect job.The book is much better than most pop science books I have listened to and I'm much richer for having listened to this highly entertaining book and can definitely say because of this book I'm much closer to my goal of understanding our place in the universe. He does talk about philosophy but I enjoyed those parts as much as I did about bonobos.(P.S. Matt Ridley's book, ""The Rational Optimist"", fully covers the second pillar of human philosophy, reciprocity. Also, my personal take on the author he seemed like an apologetic atheist and he didn't want to offend anyone. But as I say, I wasn't bothered by this, but I disagreed with him regarding those sections. Also, he seemed to characterized the utilitarianism of John Stuart Mill in a comic book fashion. Once again I wasn't bothered but I don't want to leave the impression that I agreed with him on those two points)."
106,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51675760-mark-james,3,"I really enjoyed learning about the idiosyncrasies of many of the primates, as well as having a better sense of the differences between bonobos and chimps. Choosing Bosch's ""The Garden of Earthly Delights"" as a focal point was interesting on de Waal's part. I couldn't help but feel the book could have been better organized, as the topic shifts from bonobos to religion to morality to art without any obvious structure. Finally, there were several points made about atheism that don't hold up to scrutiny. For instance, he writes, ""Everything humans have accomplished anywhere - from architecture to music, from art to science - developed hand in hand with religion, never separately."" Do you mean, de Waal, that religion has existed at the same time that these wonderful things were created, or that all people who created these things were religious? Certainly neither is true. In fact, most examples of human achievement come in spite of religion, not because of it.Elsewhere, de Waal faults Christopher Hitchens for shifting loyalties several times before landing on an antitheist stance. To me, this only means that Hitchens was tireless in his pursuit of truth.I detected countless other examples of unfair judgments, but overall, the author tends to take the safe middle ground when failing to acknowledge that anything we can do without belief in the supernatural, we can do without it, and then some."
107,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3050574-a-b-gayle,3,"Humanism and the BonoboI struggled to get through this book while I was totally immersed in another of his, questioning whether humans were smart enough to understand animals. I think part of my alienation arose because of his obsession with Heironymous Bosch’s art. (I thought he was an LAPD detective, lol!)Basically, I totally agree with the main premise of this book. Best summed up in the final chapter.Thank God, if I may, we share with other primates a background as group animals, which makes us value social connections. Absent this background, religion could be preaching about virtue and vice until it became blue in the face, we’d never get its point. We are receptive only because of our evolved grasp of the value of relationships, the benefits of cooperation, the need for trust and honesty, and so on. Even our sense of fairness derives from this background.In other words, we are receptive to religion (some might say vulnerable) simply because we like other mammals have empathy and value relationships, the benefits of cooperation, the need for trust and honesty, and so on. Even our sense of fairness derives from this background. But just because something is possible doesn’t mean it is necessary.Throughout the preceding chapters, he has shown different ways this morality manifests itself within the animal kingdom. He refutes the notion that if it weren’t for religion, humans would be no better than animals. In fact he states Morality arose first, and modern religion latched onto it. Instead of giving us the moral law, the large religions were invented to bolster it. We are only just beginning to explore how religion does so by binding people together and enforcing good behavior. It is far from my intention to minimize this role, which was vital in the past and may remain so in the foreseeable future, but the wellspring of morality it is not.In fact he sees the evolutionary development of this bottom up morality that has allowed us to develop to where we are today.So why not give this a higher rating?Firstly, the continual referral to the Bosch painting “The Garden” which seemed a stretch at times to illustrate a point he was making. We can no more know why Bosch painted it the way he did than know what Bonobos are actually thinking.Sure, studying them in the wild and conducting experiments can demonstrate that they have recognisable emotions, but in one section he has Bonobos thinking about what atheists would be thinking. So that was my second star off.The third star off is for his dodgy logic in many sections. Take for example his dismissal of the Golden Rule of Christianity (Do unto others as you would have them do unto you).To give a rather crude example, if at a conference I follow an attractive woman whom I barely know to her hotel room and jump into her bed uninvited, I can pretty well guess how she’d react. If I explain that I am just doing to her what I would love her to do to me, I’m afraid my appeal to the golden rule won’t fly. Or, let’s assume that I knowingly serve pork sausages to a vegan. Liking meat myself, I am just following the golden rule, but the vegan will consider my behavior obnoxious, perhaps even immoral.In both cases he has only looked at the physical side of the equation, not the effects of those acts. Would he like someone to rape him or insult his beliefs? You can’t divorce the act from the motive or consequence of the act. If all three are taken into account, the Golden Rule still applies.Chapter 7 particularly had some lazy logic. Whereas in previous chapters I’d been highlighting very well presented arguments, this one is full of my exasperation at the arguments used to justify the need for religion in society. Take this one for example.We humans were plenty moral when we still roamed the savanna in small bands. Only when the scale of society began to grow and rules of reciprocity and reputation began to falter did a moralizing God become necessary.But perhaps the “necessity” for this moralising God and his acolytes comes about because the chances of having a psychopath or control freak who wants this power (in the form of a controlling religion) has increased because of the larger population? He had already acknowledged that personalities varied within animal groups, so the ‘need’ for religion could just as easily be attributed to statistics producing people who wanted power for power’s sake.Interestingly when you look at early Greek and Roman religion, the gods just existed. They were used to explain the unexplainable. It was only later that the gods started telling people how to behave. I’m pretty sure the population of Ancient Greeks and Romans was not insignificant.But let’s look at another lazy analogy The whole purpose of God is to do the latter (loving moral actions). We endowed him with the capacity to keep us on the same straight and narrow that we’d been following ever since we lived in small bands.How different is this from the concept of Santa Claus being used to make children behave? Adults understand that rewards that are achievable are the best ways to control children. Likewise those who perceive the need to control large numbers of adults do so by playing up to the fears that adults have (as evidenced previously in this chapter) - a fear of death and hence the need for an afterlife.While I can see his point that a focusing deity that encourages people to be good is not bad, but the dogma that accompanies it and the divisions this creates makes me question whether this need could be better met in other ways or at least recognised for what is really happening. Perhaps the need is more that many individuals are not going to take orders from one of their own, but prefer that order to come from some unquestionably alpha figure.So my final verdict? Animals follow their own form of moral code developed in response to the betterment of their community. While some humans are still capable of doing this, others through laziness, unwillingness to kowtow to one of their own issuing instructions or fear of their mortality need some sort of mystical religion to guide their actions. I added another star back in because he made a good case for respecting that animals at times are better socialised than many humans."
108,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5889085-h-wesselius,4,"The title is somewhat misleading. De Waal is not writing a tight coherent account of morality and humanism among the primates. He is instead writing meandering thought provoking but far more personal account of humanism and science. His constant reference to the Bosch painting which he uses as a metaphor is an irritant. From this and his forays into philosophical discussions on the nature of God and morality, its obvious he's writing more of a personal discussion which he's entitled to after years of work. One of the frequent arguments for the existence of God is the cited need for moral law. Its the existence of God and his instruction to man that sets us apart, apparently. De Waal successful challenges that assumption citing evidence of moral behavior in not only primates but in other larger social animals such as dolphins and elephants. From this he proposes that morality is derived from the social nature of animals and has an bottoms up origins as opposed to the top down model proposed by various religions. Pulling it all together, he makes a compelling argument that morality is the basis for religion and a belief in God and not the other way around. An excellent read with a good and interesting argument. "
109,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/119364-melee-farr,3,"The premise of the book was right up my alley - examining the roots of morality (and ultimately religion) from a larger mammalian perspective. And I think it was effective on that front. de Waal is a primatologist, first and foremost, and there were countless examples from his and others' research, observations, and publications of moral behavior existing consistently in the animal world, with sound evolutionary reasoning for pro-social behaviors being retained throughout mammalian phylogeny. I flew through the first half of the book. He uses Bosch's triptych painting ""Garden of Earthly Delights"" as a recurring metaphor throughout the book, and honestly, he lost me with it. I mean, I understood the metaphor, but, to use another, it was kind of beating a dead horse. This may reveal the fact that I'm not particularly well-versed in the visual arts. He also is rather dismissive of atheism as often aggressive and exclusionary, and permissive of religion because he sees it as inevitable and having some consistently positive societal traits. Both points are well-made, but may whitewash the good done by skepticism and the evil done by dogmatism. But that perspective may also just reveal my bias. "
110,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6664778-andrea,3,"Tracing the beginning of morality may be as close as our fellow primates the Bonobos, as de Waal explains in this book. I am interested in the topic of the origins of morality and the book has a flow that kept me reading. I do think de Waal has a little Richard Dawkins envy though. Richard Dawkins is simply a better writer. This author makes the point that although morality predates religion there is no point in egging on the religious majority by calling such religious beliefs delusional, which in fact Dawkins does. I agree it is pointless and may be even counter productive however I feel the author fails to give due the bias that atheists face, bias that denies us jobs, social status and even basic human rights. Try getting into high political positions as an outed atheist. Frans does a disservice to human rights when he says that there is no reason to state an atheist agenda, and I agree, but what about a human agenda? Frans doesn't take the biases seriously enough. This being said the book is worth a read to remind us of our roots, to connect with fellow primates and to learn more about the origins of morality."
111,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5318025-nina,3,"Frans de Waal's research is impressive, and I found his insights into primate behaviors, including those of humans, very interesting. However, if the purpose of his study had to do with religion and morality, then he failed to connect the two sides of the book (primatology and religion). By the time I finished the book, my big questions were, What does religion have to do with this study? and What does Bosch have to do with primatology? Personal admiration for the painter does not constitute expertise, and while interesting, the bursts of art history did not in any way advance de Waal's argument, especially because they did not rely on art history so much as on the author's personal responses to The Garden of Earthly Delights. Sadly, de Waal does not really understand atheists either, neither old-school nor the ones he refers to as ""neo-atheists."" Personal opinions rather than data dominate this book, and opinions do not prove very much. The lack of hard evidence for the arguments on morality is only part of the problem, though. The author's attempts at wit are offensive to many readers, and together with speculation rather than evidence hurt the book's message. "
112,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11200007-douglas-cosby,1,"1.5 stars (the extra half point is for the narrator): Not my bag. I read the first third of this book, but couldn't get any further. Franz de Waal's point is simple: morality is a result of evolution, not imposed by religion or ""invented"" by humans. A very good point, and I sympathize with de Waal's frustration with biologists/scientists that fall prey to the rampant anthropomorphism we humans tend to overlay on the way we see other animals. He uses a few scientific studies, but mainly just anecdotes and cute stories, to justify his position, and this book feels more like a feel-good article in O magazine than something that would be in Scientific American or Nature. Additionally, while de Waal harshly criticizes recent atheist authors, it doesn't seem like he has really read them. For instance, his criticism of Sam Harris's The Moral Landscape, seems like it came from the back-of-the-book summary, not the actual details of the book. If you are in the mood for a bunch of touching ape stories, then this book might be for you. If you are looking for a book on the scientific basis of prehuman morality supported by scientific evidence and logical conclusions, look elsewhere."
113,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5078550-robert-bor,4,"I got this book from my friends, who appreciate my interest in evolution, politics and society. Frans de Waal weaves two different threads in this book. On the one hand, he proceeds to show clearly how animals (the Bonobo primate in particular) have an extremely good sense of moralistic behavior. This undermines the argument that moralistic behavior is one of the primary consequences of religion. No, not just undermines, evaporates. This is where he weaves in the other thread, where he distances himself from the Atheist camp (Dawkins et al) and states that religion should not just be abandoned if we cannot replace it with something else. He understands the need of humans for spirituality and does not just wish this away. In the dual aspect, a bit of a weird combination, but understandable, since being seen in the Atheist camp, pretty much shuts you out from dialogue with the religious one. Is Mr de Waal aiming for a diplomatic role in bringing the two camps closer together? On another note, if you like the work of Hiëronymus Bosch, know that it features prominently in this book."
114,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7349461-cody,3,"This book had its ups and downs. de Waal's argument for morality emerging from bottom-up processes is convincing, and I really enjoyed when he would dive into the details of primate research, as well his many anecdotes. This alone makes the book worth reading. I do, however, think he was quite off the mark with his criticism of the ""neo-Atheists"" (i.e., the New Atheists). On top of the misguided attacks (A.C. Grayling addresses some of these in a review in Prospect Magazine http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/mag...), at times he comes across as patronizing. He stresses the need for religion to help secure ethics among the masses (at least at present), while apparently considering himself fully capable of living morally without religion. That said, I think the book drives home some good points (especially in the final chapters), and will get both believers and non-believers thinking about some of these issues."
115,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8076824-geoff,3,"I have a soft spot for primates, and books on morality are catching my attention at the moment so I thought I would have enjoyed this book more than I did. I also recently read The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt, so I can't help but compare the two. While I did enjoy this book more than The Righteous Mind, I still gave both books three stars. Frans de Waal's writing style is much more enjoyable and conversational than Haidt's. However, there seemed to be less science involved in this book. I know there are countless endnotes and references at the back of the book, but somehow the observations came across as purely anecdotal. While I agree with de Waal's bottom up approach to morality, rather than from top down, I didn't find that the strength of his arguments would convince anyone who don't already believe as he does."
116,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6323134-darcey,3,"I found this an interesting read, though perhaps one with more extraneous information than I wanted. I enjoyed de Waal's anecdotes and commentary about Bosch and how that was related to humanity, symbolism, and the growth of ideas - however, there was more of it than necessary (including recounting experiences of being at the Prado in Madrid). The linkage between the fact that primates (and other animals) exhibit traits which we as humans consider ""moral"" - and that animals do not follow religion - is clear, leaving us with no way to avoid the conclusion de Waal sets out to prove: morality is not something encoded purely by religion, and those who believe that without religion humans will descend to immoral madness have a significant amount of evidence to overcome to prove their position. "
117,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5777523-jami,4,"This was a well researched, informative book. I was not familiar with Frans de Waal's work before this book, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I thought there would be more focus on the Bonobo anecdotes, but there were enough to keep me entertained and interested. This book looks at the issue of what the source of morality and other behaviors is; it combines many areas of study, including religion, philosophy, science, sociology, psychology, and history. While parts of the book dragged a little, overall it was well done. There were some parts of the book that fascinated me and that I had never considered before, such as the yawn response in relation to empathy; I also particularly enjoyed the passages about specific behaviors usually only attributed to humans that are found in bonobos and other species. The narration was very good and easy to listen to."
118,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/906313-diane,3,"This was a surprisingly interesting argument on the origin of morality. In a spiritual context, morality is something that is imposed by God with commandments and injunctions, etc. deWaal, however, draws from his many years as a primatologist to suggest that morality is an internal motivator, something that is inherent within us and those species most closely related to us. The bonobo is his primary example of a primate that clearly demonstrates moral qualities such as empathy. I found it very interesting to listen to, but kind of disorganized. And since de Waal frequently mentions the Hieronymus Bosch painting, ""Garden of Earthly Delight,"" I wished I had that image on hand. Nevertheless, I enjoyed de Waal's ideas and his intelligent presentation."

The author's work with primates, and less frequently with other social mammals, provides convincing evidence for a continuity of development of consciousness and empathetic/moral behavior between humankind and other animals. It successfully combats the idea that humans and other social animals are at the core selfish, with altruism as a thin, self-serving veneer; that without top-down religious mandates, such as the 10 commandments, people would live in a nightmare Hobbesian world; and that ""selfish gene"" theories are a adequate way of understanding and interpreting an organism's behavior and motivations. An enjoyable read."

It gives a neat alternative which I think is indeed much more plausible and not as polarised as apparently everything is nowadays. It is written in a compelling style and Frans de Waal clearly explains his arguments and conclisions.
121,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33852158-halli-lauren,3,"I read and enjoyed De Waal’s “Are we smart enough to know how smart animals are”, so when I saw this book was written by him, I was pretty intrigued! As a baby atheist myself, and someone who is interested in studying bonobos, this seemed like the perfect book for me. Unfortunately, De Waal spent way more time talking about chimpanzees than bonobos. He also spent way more time talking about Heironymus Bosch than was necessary. What was the point of that?? I was pretty on board with the author’s broader points about religion:1. Trying to “convert people to atheism” is a waste of energy 2. Religion isn’t going away any time soon, and if it did, we’d need to find something to replace it because of all the important things it does for us as humans (ie: community building)But here are my qualms:1. Why did he spend so much time condemning Neo-Atheists and so little time condemning the abuse and manipulation in so many religions? Toward the beginning, De Waal pointed out that he came from a much more casual religious background, so leaving his religion wasn’t as big of a deal. But the thing is, so many religions are extremely dogmatic which can lead to much more harm than good. De Waal definitely condemned dogmatism, which I agree with, but he didn’t seem to realize how inescapable dogmatism can be. Maybe that’s just my point of view coming from a high demand, very dogmatic religion. 2. So yeah, religion is important and isn’t going away any time soon. Then what should atheists do? De Waal spent so much time saying how important religion is, and even though he is an atheist himself, he didn’t share any of his ideas of how to get the benefits of religion elsewhere. I guess that’s what I wanted out of the book, and I didn’t get it. Then of course there’s the main subject matter of the book: the evolution of morality and altruism. This was all well and good, but while reading I didn’t have any “Aha!” moments- nothing felt very fresh to me. Overall a disappointing read. Not good, not bad. Just meh. Oh also I’m just sick of reading books by old white men… if anyone has recommendations of nonfiction science books by women or people of color?? Definitely would love to hear those."
122,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15812925-adrian-undrea,4,"Frans de Waal is probably best known for his appearances on TED Talks. Having seen his presentations on animal morality I have to admit I have started reading his book being biased. I consider myself an atheist and somehow I had been looking at this book to reinforce this view. But The Bonobo and the Atheist shouldn't be read for that as Frans de Waal looks to explore the origins of morality and debunk the myth, so deeply ingrained in most of us, that morality is the trademark of humanity. And while sometimes it jumps too fast from one idea to the other, reading The Bonobo and the Atheist with an open mind might change the way you view morality. Far from being a hallmark of mankind, morality is a product of evolution, shaping the interactions of all social animals. By the use of countless experiments Frans de Waal argues morality is a mere tool of the highly evolved animals that makes living in groups possible. It is one more nail in the coffin of the idea that somehow we are special from the rest of the biological world. And while Frans de Waal thinks letting go of religion might not be possible for humanity, he favors the optimistic idea that our moral compass is an inner one (a bottom-up approach) instead of having its origins in religion (a top-down view)."
123,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18494756-olivia,5,"This is probably the second book I've read this year that I think everyone should read. (The other was SO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT RACE by Ijeoma Oluo.)A fascinating look into the moral universe of our closest genetic relatives, and an examination of the ought vs is of their world without religion (as we would recognize it. Frans de Waal is a very engaging writer, and considerably more knowledgeable about the topic than the most well-intended science reporter. (I've read some non fiction by people who write layman's overviews of science topics by interviewing researchers, and they also serve a purpose, but this book combines a depth of understanding of the topic with an engaging readability that is sometimes lacking in non fiction written by academics. I'm already seeking out more of his work.Atheist, believer, or.those of us in between will find much of interest here."
124,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13162061-amirography,3,"Hmmm. It is hard to give a review for this book. It is full of great arguements against conventional thinking. and deWaal is certainly well read about science and morality. But he is mostly driven by arguing against skeptics (skeptics of animal-cognition, not in general) so he is great at giving counter examples. But he is not that great at proposing new ideas. So I might be wrong. Basically, from what I understood, bottom-up morality is descriptive to prescriptive morality with emphasis on socially enforced ones. I might be wrong because he was not that clear -to me- about it. Which is, underwhelming. Both because intuitive morality is at the end a prescriptive morality, however he wants to say that they are not that different. The arguments against different schools of normative thinking was also weak because from a utilitarian point of view, he was arguing a straw-man, as a utilitarian (like me) wouldn't exactly argue as he did in the place of a utilitarian. Though I have to say, it may have been not because if an intentional effort, but because he probably did not check his argument with a utilitarian. Overall, I don't think this book-essay was a ""great-read"" type, but it is certainly better than reading a fiction in search of meaning."

If there is a short-coming here, it is that the balance between these elements will be a little unsatisfactory for anyone who is mainly interested in the science. Compared to Frans de Waal's Primates and Philosophers—which features commentary from Robert Wright, Christine Korsgaard, Philip Kitcher and Peter Singer—The Bonobo and the Atheist also lacks the clarity that comes from having de Waal's most ambitious ideas reigned in by more cautious thinkers."

127,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15731711-samantha,4,"I am totally on the fence when it comes to Frans de Waal. Sometimes I find myself underlining sentences in this book in agreement, and other times I find myself scribbling frustrated notes of disagreement in the side margins. For example, on page 184 de Waal practically ridicules Peter Singer for not taking his view that we should have ""special loyalty"" to our own species while excluding other species from our moral equations. He basically argues that we should determine our morals (in some cases) based on loyalty to our own group - in this case, our own species. It's terribly reminiscent of people from history who argued the same way - substituting ""species"" for ""race"" or ""sex"". I assume that some time in the future, people will read this and think ""Wow, de Waal was a good primatologist, it's a shame he was such a speciesist"" as we now say about 18th and 19th century writers. In the margins on page 184 I wrote ""But sometimes fierce loyalty to one's own group is immoral - it would be immoral for me to say a black person is not equal to a white person merely out of loyalty to my own race."" This morality based on loyalty to one's own group is rather small-minded, if you ask me.Another rather bad part of de Waal's book was on page 204, where he writes, ""Neo-atheists are like people standing outside a movie theater telling us that Leonardo DiCaprio didn't really go down with the Titanic. How shocking! Mostly of us are perfectly comfortable with the duality."" The flaw in his argument is this: no one ridicules Titanic watchers because no Titanic watcher actually believes that Leo went down with the famous ship. But atheists ridicule theists because they ACTUALLY believe ridiculous things like wine turning into blood or demons in the form of talking snakes tempting people to eat some fruit. He argues that atheists who criticize religion are advocating the elimination of imagination. But the key difference between people with active imaginations and theists is that imaginative people ultimately recognize that their fantasies aren't part of reality. Theists make no such recognition; they actually believe, metaphorically, that Leonardo DiCaprio was on the Titanic. Or anything else equally absurd. This is why they are ridiculed and the imagination is not. Imagination is beautiful and beneficial in many ways. I'm a fiction writer, I have a very deep appreciation of imagination, but I recognize it as just that - imagination. Unlike imagination, I consider most religious claims ridiculously illogical because the theist seriously believes in these fantasies. I would have not the slightest problem with religion if this was not the case (but then it wouldn't really be religion, would it?). The weakness in de Waal's analogy (criticizing theists to criticizing moviegoers) is so obvious that I can't help thinking de Waal might not completely understand religion or what it means to condemn it.There are other ways in which I strongly disagreed with de Waal, particularly when he talked about religion (I write in a margin, ""Can we go back to the apes now?"") but overall I tended to agree with what he said. It was a good book and I learned a lot from it about chimps and bonobos. The parts about the apes were very interesting, but the parts where de Waal starts talking religion and philosophy were out of touch with how I feel about those matters. Overall, it was a good book and worth reading for anyone interested in the origins of morality."
128,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9716384-vivify-m,5,"I very much enjoyed this book. Primatology enthralls me - learning about our primate cousins, and how researchers work with them is a joy. But, the resulting insights into our own psychology, is the highlight. I also, enjoyed understanding how the experiments were constructed and the challenges the researchers faced.On the downside, I was put off by the authors attitude towards other disciplines. I found his criticism of biologists unnecessary, in particular his misrepresentation of geneticists as calling prosocial behaviour a mistake. I’m no expert, but I also questioned his representation of evolution. At times I thought he was confusing selfish genes with selfish individuals. Possibly, the most significant contribution of the book, is the idea that key to our salvation is in understanding our natural selves. I love this sentiment, but I also get nervous of overly naturalistic thinking, and I’m not convinced by the arguments against utilitarianism. Ultimately, this was a deeply thought provoking and enjoyable book."
129,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57079482-chuck-kollars,4,"The author has kept and done research with Chimpanzees and Bonobos (formerly known as Pygmy Chimps) for decades, is top of his field, and has written many books. The main theme of this book is an observation and bit of reasoning. The observation is that our animal relatives routinely display a fairly strong sense of morality (focused on maintaining good relations within the group). The obvious reasoning from this is that our current morality -often embedded in ""religion""- comes not from anything external like religion but rather from something internal that predates religion. He makes this case pretty strongly, but without placing it in a larger hypothetical framework. The book mentions, but doesn't even try to answer larger questions such as how did our morality come to be deposited in religion?, how does a morality focused on good group relations work with much larger groups (tribe, nation, globe, etc.)?, how much can we deviate from our unthinking inborn sense of morality before everything falls apart?, and how will we know when we don't need religion at all any more?He does several other things in this same book: He responds to the ""four horsemen of atheism"" that made such a splash a few years ago. He presents many interesting anecdotes from his subjects, some of which are closely tied to a sense of morality and some that illustrate more intelligence/forethought/non-aggression than we typically credit our close relative animals with. And he tries his hand at an explication of the painting ""The Garden"" by ""Heironymus Bosch"". He draws some interesting parallels between these topics, but in my opinion not enough, so the book seems less focused than it could be. There are indeed connections between these strands (even though they're not as strong as I'd like). For example, the author thinks the ""four horsemen of atheism"" give too much credit to religion in accusing it of being the root of horrible wars and genocides. Such abominable behavior is also displayed by chimps in certain circumstances. Humans must have gotten it from the same place, and our common ancestor predates religion. Also, chimp society is clearly uninfluenced by any human religion ...or any religion at all. So for the wars and genocides, despite its claims, religion was really more ""cover story"" than ""cause"". In a way the whole book is a plea for humble moderation rather than conspicuous ideology. We're asked to actually look at the evidence in front of our faces and to not completely throw out religion until we understand it a little better and so forth. This is his critique of the atheists too: most scientists are rather dubious about religion, but why is it so important to you that other people think exactly the same way you do? He describes the seemingly contradictory combination of a lackluster subject with passionate advocacy as ""sleeping furiously""."

Back to some serious reading nowIn all honesty, I chose to read this book to learn about Bonobos and didn't want to fully enter into any religious debate. That part of the book I really enjoyed. However. since this book is titled 'The Bonobo and the Atheist', I will make a few comments.I will say that I enjoyed reading about Veneer theory. Unfortunately, I am not so sure that I agree with Frans de Waal's notion that this theory is no longer valid with the overwhelming evidence of innate altruism. Perhaps I'm a skeptic but I still feel that people do in fact weigh up the possible benefits of their actions and not just in business and with acquaintances but also with family and friends; which is not what he believes. He believes we are altruistic with those closest to us and that is not always the case. What I will say is that I don't argue that there is something innate within us that gives us our moral compass but one could argue that it is a higher being that gives us that moral compass in the first place. Nonetheless, what I do respect is that at no point does he belittle other religions or in fact hail atheism as the one true faith. I respect that he is not a militant atheist like Dawkins. He even mentions that for him - when considering that it was wrongly believed Darwin agreed with 'the expulsion of morality from the natural domain'-""the height of absurdity was reached when Dawkins explicitly disavowed Darwin, telling an interviewer in 1997 that 'in our political and social life we are entitled to throw out Darwinism.'"" He doesn't appreciate Dawkin's ability to be so dismissive of other beliefs.This is a good read but, as mentioned in some other reviews that I've read, I also feel that Frans de Waal is mixing two ideas that needn't be discussed together. When he does discuss some points, I often feel like saying, 'just get to the point'. He spends over a page using various works of art to comment on how we react to them and how it shows our bodily empathy.It felt like he introduced this list of art to fill a few pages. There can often be much speculation based on what he observes in the bonobos and humans themselves. There are often times when I feel he speculates too much. Though I will say that I was pleased to hear another one of his many examples that'humans most prone to yawn contagion also have the most empathy'. That is pleasing to know since simply reading the word yawn sets me off :).I have enjoyed reading this book but when he stated 'My first book on this topic, Good Natured (1996), barely mentioned religion' I almost wish I had read that instead."
131,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196037-jrobertus,5,"De Waal is a primatologist with a philosophical bent. I have read several of his books; they are not only interesting but important. He shows from his experimental work the basis for morality in our simian ancestors. They have empathy and an innate sense of fairness, required for communal living an hunting, that sets the basis for a moral code. (His experiments showing a sense of fairness in monkeys is fmous and the subject of a terrific TED tak). Region, or other social institutions, build on this inherent bent. De Waal describes morality as bottom up and not top down. Although he is atheist himself, he takes issue with the “neo atheists” like Hitchins and Dawkins who are aggressive in attacking religion. He urges tolerance and open mindedness and to not be as dogmatic as relious fundamentalists. He feels religion plays an important role in the social structure of close knit groups, it is robust (whereas science is new, difficult, “unnatural” and therefore fragile in an all out battle with religion). He feels northern Europe is carrying out a large scale gradual experiment in secularism. Can education and the state take over the amalgamating role of relion and make a strong, moral society without religion? We'll see eventually. Certainty efforts to remove religion by force, like the communists and Khmer rouge, have been horrible failures, worse than the superstition and dogmatism they wanted to replace. The animal work, an observations of behaviour, that De Waal uses to support his arguments are interesting in their own right. This is a most worthwhile read for its science and for the way science can inform philosophy and politics.De Waal is a hero of mine; he is an imaginative scientist, and a mature reviewer of the biological basis of empathy, altruism, and morality. In this book he continues his eye-opening work on the behavior of primates, especially our nearest relatives, the chimps and bonobos. His careful monitoring of their behavior in laboratories and in the wild, points out the ancient foundation of moral behavior among animals living in interdependent societies. In this book he also addresses the ongoing debate between religion, particularly fundamentalists, and science. Although he is an atheist he sees the value in religious practice and bonding, if not in the dogma. He takes aim at the “new atheists”, like Hitchens and Dawkins, and chides them for a combative and often insulting tone that does not help bridge the social gap. The tone of this book is so mature and thoughtful it is quite humbling. I wish I could be more like him."
132,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71935584-ben-zimmerman,3,"As a book about fascinating and well-told narratives about animal behavior and cognition, I would give this book a better rating (as I would rate many of Frans De Waal’s books). However, the purpose of this book seemed to be more about a reflection of religion and a bit of a criticism of the “new atheists”. I thought that the religious reflections weren’t very interesting and often wrong in the way that he characterized the views of both many atheists and many religious people. Some of his reflections and connections seemed disconnected and not well thought out. I would definitely recommend reading Frans de Waal, but maybe a different book. "
133,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10397934-erich,3,"Somewhat meandering in its approach, this book does make some convincing and enlightening arguments that I am happy to ponder. Frans de Waal's obvious expertise in primate prosocial behavior gives him an excellent vantage point to show that morality certainly evolved well before any religious institutions were established, especially as we know them today. The anecdotes are enticing and revealing, and really make the thesis very compelling. Primatology sounds even more fascinating when we see ourselves so vividly reflected in his vignettes. Some of the digressions into how we are to deal with morality and religion in the face of scientific progress are less persuasive. I did not find de Waal's writing to be particularly cohesive or share the logical argumentative power of a Dawkins or Hitchens. Towards the end of the book I finally began to grasp his viewpoint, and mostly embraced it, but there was no feeling of real enlightenment. I think the book overall, and some of its arguments, could have been better organized. The book did serve a good counterpoint to what de Waal calls ""neo-Atheists"" such as Sam Harris, Dawkins, and Hitchens (well, ""Marxist"" for him), though I happen to love these authors. If you are looking for that, it has its moments. I have to admit that I had problems with de Waal's recommendation to give modern religion so much leeway and to dispense with the heated ""anti-religious"" rhetoric of those mentioned above. While humans may be naturally predisposed to accepting religion as a form of social normalizing (which I agree has had its place in our civilizing process), this doesn't mean it we should accept it as necessary today. Its stranglehold on truth in the face of scientific evidence does nothing to enforce our common morality. If anything, it holds us back from truly understanding our place in the universe and extending a moral code to everyone. I see a need for more strong voices opposed to this willful ignorance and dogma, not fewer. All in all, a good read with some nice points. And bonobos!"
134,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13928228-sortal,1,"Muddy thinking, misrepresentation (or ignorance?) of atheist arguments, and lots of irrelevant passages on Hieronymus Bosch. I've really enjoyed other books by Frans de Waal, but this is an unsuccessful departure from his areas of expertise. Insofar as I can figure out what de Waal is arguing for, I agree with most of his premises: 1. Moral conduct exists on a continuum, including the behaviours of other animals.2. Dogmatism is terrible and should be avoided. 3. Religion is superfluous to morality. 4. Hardline atheism is unlikely to persuade the devoutly religious to give up their faith.But then things go wrong. 5. De Waal never addresses whether religion is inherently dogmatic. (Insofar as it's faith-based, where faith is belief without evidence, it certainly seems that way.) 6. De Waal never addresses the harm done by religion (a crucial point made by the thinkers he so blithely dismisses, such as Dawkins and Harris). 7. De Waal claims (without any supporting argument) that religion will always exist.If you replaced the passages on Bosch with a fair representation of the atheists de Waal is arguing against, you'd have a wonderful book. Better still would be a book using de Waal's research to build on the project of Harris' Moral Landscape, helping to create an alternative to religion (the logical next step from premises 2-4 once you accept 5 and 6 and dismiss 7). Instead, you get an infuriatingly murky read of jumbled ideas with just enough interesting anecdotes about primates to keep you reading through the rambling about Bosch.   "

He completely examines the first pillar, empathy, by illustrating empathetic behavior in Bonobos (and other animals) and linking it to our behavior.He's such a good writer even when he wrote about things I completely disagreed with I would find the book thought provoking. I thought he trivialized the arguments of Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens and John Stuart Mill. But, I'm not bothered. I believe what I believe and I appreciated the different perspective.The narrator did a perfect job.The book is much better than most pop science books I have listened to and I'm much richer for having listened to this highly entertaining book and can definitely say because of this book I'm much closer to my goal of understanding our place in the universe. He does talk about philosophy but I enjoyed those parts as much as I did about bonobos.(P.S. Matt Ridley's book, ""The Rational Optimist"", fully covers the second pillar of human philosophy, reciprocity. Also, my personal take on the author he seemed like an apologetic atheist and he didn't want to offend anyone. But as I say, I wasn't bothered by this, but I disagreed with him regarding those sections. Also, he seemed to characterized the utilitarianism of John Stuart Mill in a comic book fashion. Once again I wasn't bothered but I don't want to leave the impression that I agreed with him on those two points)."

Choosing Bosch's ""The Garden of Earthly Delights"" as a focal point was interesting on de Waal's part. I couldn't help but feel the book could have been better organized, as the topic shifts from bonobos to religion to morality to art without any obvious structure. Finally, there were several points made about atheism that don't hold up to scrutiny. For instance, he writes, ""Everything humans have accomplished anywhere - from architecture to music, from art to science - developed hand in hand with religion, never separately."" Do you mean, de Waal, that religion has existed at the same time that these wonderful things were created, or that all people who created these things were religious? Certainly neither is true. In fact, most examples of human achievement come in spite of religion, not because of it.Elsewhere, de Waal faults Christopher Hitchens for shifting loyalties several times before landing on an antitheist stance. To me, this only means that Hitchens was tireless in his pursuit of truth.I detected countless other examples of unfair judgments, but overall, the author tends to take the safe middle ground when failing to acknowledge that anything we can do without belief in the supernatural, we can do without it, and then some."
137,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3050574-a-b-gayle,3,"Humanism and the BonoboI struggled to get through this book while I was totally immersed in another of his, questioning whether humans were smart enough to understand animals. I think part of my alienation arose because of his obsession with Heironymous Bosch’s art. (I thought he was an LAPD detective, lol!)Basically, I totally agree with the main premise of this book. Best summed up in the final chapter.Thank God, if I may, we share with other primates a background as group animals, which makes us value social connections. Absent this background, religion could be preaching about virtue and vice until it became blue in the face, we’d never get its point. We are receptive only because of our evolved grasp of the value of relationships, the benefits of cooperation, the need for trust and honesty, and so on. Even our sense of fairness derives from this background.In other words, we are receptive to religion (some might say vulnerable) simply because we like other mammals have empathy and value relationships, the benefits of cooperation, the need for trust and honesty, and so on. Even our sense of fairness derives from this background. But just because something is possible doesn’t mean it is necessary.Throughout the preceding chapters, he has shown different ways this morality manifests itself within the animal kingdom. He refutes the notion that if it weren’t for religion, humans would be no better than animals. In fact he states Morality arose first, and modern religion latched onto it. Instead of giving us the moral law, the large religions were invented to bolster it. We are only just beginning to explore how religion does so by binding people together and enforcing good behavior. It is far from my intention to minimize this role, which was vital in the past and may remain so in the foreseeable future, but the wellspring of morality it is not.In fact he sees the evolutionary development of this bottom up morality that has allowed us to develop to where we are today.So why not give this a higher rating?Firstly, the continual referral to the Bosch painting “The Garden” which seemed a stretch at times to illustrate a point he was making. We can no more know why Bosch painted it the way he did than know what Bonobos are actually thinking.Sure, studying them in the wild and conducting experiments can demonstrate that they have recognisable emotions, but in one section he has Bonobos thinking about what atheists would be thinking. So that was my second star off.The third star off is for his dodgy logic in many sections. Take for example his dismissal of the Golden Rule of Christianity (Do unto others as you would have them do unto you).To give a rather crude example, if at a conference I follow an attractive woman whom I barely know to her hotel room and jump into her bed uninvited, I can pretty well guess how she’d react. If I explain that I am just doing to her what I would love her to do to me, I’m afraid my appeal to the golden rule won’t fly. Or, let’s assume that I knowingly serve pork sausages to a vegan. Liking meat myself, I am just following the golden rule, but the vegan will consider my behavior obnoxious, perhaps even immoral.In both cases he has only looked at the physical side of the equation, not the effects of those acts. Would he like someone to rape him or insult his beliefs? You can’t divorce the act from the motive or consequence of the act. If all three are taken into account, the Golden Rule still applies.Chapter 7 particularly had some lazy logic. Whereas in previous chapters I’d been highlighting very well presented arguments, this one is full of my exasperation at the arguments used to justify the need for religion in society. Take this one for example.We humans were plenty moral when we still roamed the savanna in small bands. Only when the scale of society began to grow and rules of reciprocity and reputation began to falter did a moralizing God become necessary.But perhaps the “necessity” for this moralising God and his acolytes comes about because the chances of having a psychopath or control freak who wants this power (in the form of a controlling religion) has increased because of the larger population? He had already acknowledged that personalities varied within animal groups, so the ‘need’ for religion could just as easily be attributed to statistics producing people who wanted power for power’s sake.Interestingly when you look at early Greek and Roman religion, the gods just existed. They were used to explain the unexplainable. It was only later that the gods started telling people how to behave. I’m pretty sure the population of Ancient Greeks and Romans was not insignificant.But let’s look at another lazy analogy The whole purpose of God is to do the latter (loving moral actions). We endowed him with the capacity to keep us on the same straight and narrow that we’d been following ever since we lived in small bands.How different is this from the concept of Santa Claus being used to make children behave? Adults understand that rewards that are achievable are the best ways to control children. Likewise those who perceive the need to control large numbers of adults do so by playing up to the fears that adults have (as evidenced previously in this chapter) - a fear of death and hence the need for an afterlife.While I can see his point that a focusing deity that encourages people to be good is not bad, but the dogma that accompanies it and the divisions this creates makes me question whether this need could be better met in other ways or at least recognised for what is really happening. Perhaps the need is more that many individuals are not going to take orders from one of their own, but prefer that order to come from some unquestionably alpha figure.So my final verdict? Animals follow their own form of moral code developed in response to the betterment of their community. While some humans are still capable of doing this, others through laziness, unwillingness to kowtow to one of their own issuing instructions or fear of their mortality need some sort of mystical religion to guide their actions. I added another star back in because he made a good case for respecting that animals at times are better socialised than many humans."
138,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5889085-h-wesselius,4,"The title is somewhat misleading. De Waal is not writing a tight coherent account of morality and humanism among the primates. He is instead writing meandering thought provoking but far more personal account of humanism and science. His constant reference to the Bosch painting which he uses as a metaphor is an irritant. From this and his forays into philosophical discussions on the nature of God and morality, its obvious he's writing more of a personal discussion which he's entitled to after years of work. One of the frequent arguments for the existence of God is the cited need for moral law. Its the existence of God and his instruction to man that sets us apart, apparently. De Waal successful challenges that assumption citing evidence of moral behavior in not only primates but in other larger social animals such as dolphins and elephants. From this he proposes that morality is derived from the social nature of animals and has an bottoms up origins as opposed to the top down model proposed by various religions. Pulling it all together, he makes a compelling argument that morality is the basis for religion and a belief in God and not the other way around. An excellent read with a good and interesting argument. "
139,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/119364-melee-farr,3,"The premise of the book was right up my alley - examining the roots of morality (and ultimately religion) from a larger mammalian perspective. And I think it was effective on that front. de Waal is a primatologist, first and foremost, and there were countless examples from his and others' research, observations, and publications of moral behavior existing consistently in the animal world, with sound evolutionary reasoning for pro-social behaviors being retained throughout mammalian phylogeny. I flew through the first half of the book. He uses Bosch's triptych painting ""Garden of Earthly Delights"" as a recurring metaphor throughout the book, and honestly, he lost me with it. I mean, I understood the metaphor, but, to use another, it was kind of beating a dead horse. This may reveal the fact that I'm not particularly well-versed in the visual arts. He also is rather dismissive of atheism as often aggressive and exclusionary, and permissive of religion because he sees it as inevitable and having some consistently positive societal traits. Both points are well-made, but may whitewash the good done by skepticism and the evil done by dogmatism. But that perspective may also just reveal my bias. "
140,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6664778-andrea,3,"Tracing the beginning of morality may be as close as our fellow primates the Bonobos, as de Waal explains in this book. I am interested in the topic of the origins of morality and the book has a flow that kept me reading. I do think de Waal has a little Richard Dawkins envy though. Richard Dawkins is simply a better writer. This author makes the point that although morality predates religion there is no point in egging on the religious majority by calling such religious beliefs delusional, which in fact Dawkins does. I agree it is pointless and may be even counter productive however I feel the author fails to give due the bias that atheists face, bias that denies us jobs, social status and even basic human rights. Try getting into high political positions as an outed atheist. Frans does a disservice to human rights when he says that there is no reason to state an atheist agenda, and I agree, but what about a human agenda? Frans doesn't take the biases seriously enough. This being said the book is worth a read to remind us of our roots, to connect with fellow primates and to learn more about the origins of morality."
141,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5318025-nina,3,"Frans de Waal's research is impressive, and I found his insights into primate behaviors, including those of humans, very interesting. However, if the purpose of his study had to do with religion and morality, then he failed to connect the two sides of the book (primatology and religion). By the time I finished the book, my big questions were, What does religion have to do with this study? and What does Bosch have to do with primatology? Personal admiration for the painter does not constitute expertise, and while interesting, the bursts of art history did not in any way advance de Waal's argument, especially because they did not rely on art history so much as on the author's personal responses to The Garden of Earthly Delights. Sadly, de Waal does not really understand atheists either, neither old-school nor the ones he refers to as ""neo-atheists."" Personal opinions rather than data dominate this book, and opinions do not prove very much. The lack of hard evidence for the arguments on morality is only part of the problem, though. The author's attempts at wit are offensive to many readers, and together with speculation rather than evidence hurt the book's message. "
142,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11200007-douglas-cosby,1,"1.5 stars (the extra half point is for the narrator): Not my bag. I read the first third of this book, but couldn't get any further. Franz de Waal's point is simple: morality is a result of evolution, not imposed by religion or ""invented"" by humans. A very good point, and I sympathize with de Waal's frustration with biologists/scientists that fall prey to the rampant anthropomorphism we humans tend to overlay on the way we see other animals. He uses a few scientific studies, but mainly just anecdotes and cute stories, to justify his position, and this book feels more like a feel-good article in O magazine than something that would be in Scientific American or Nature. Additionally, while de Waal harshly criticizes recent atheist authors, it doesn't seem like he has really read them. For instance, his criticism of Sam Harris's The Moral Landscape, seems like it came from the back-of-the-book summary, not the actual details of the book. If you are in the mood for a bunch of touching ape stories, then this book might be for you. If you are looking for a book on the scientific basis of prehuman morality supported by scientific evidence and logical conclusions, look elsewhere."
143,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5078550-robert-bor,4,"I got this book from my friends, who appreciate my interest in evolution, politics and society. Frans de Waal weaves two different threads in this book. On the one hand, he proceeds to show clearly how animals (the Bonobo primate in particular) have an extremely good sense of moralistic behavior. This undermines the argument that moralistic behavior is one of the primary consequences of religion. No, not just undermines, evaporates. This is where he weaves in the other thread, where he distances himself from the Atheist camp (Dawkins et al) and states that religion should not just be abandoned if we cannot replace it with something else. He understands the need of humans for spirituality and does not just wish this away. In the dual aspect, a bit of a weird combination, but understandable, since being seen in the Atheist camp, pretty much shuts you out from dialogue with the religious one. Is Mr de Waal aiming for a diplomatic role in bringing the two camps closer together? On another note, if you like the work of Hiëronymus Bosch, know that it features prominently in this book."
144,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7349461-cody,3,"This book had its ups and downs. de Waal's argument for morality emerging from bottom-up processes is convincing, and I really enjoyed when he would dive into the details of primate research, as well his many anecdotes. This alone makes the book worth reading. I do, however, think he was quite off the mark with his criticism of the ""neo-Atheists"" (i.e., the New Atheists). On top of the misguided attacks (A.C. Grayling addresses some of these in a review in Prospect Magazine http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/mag...), at times he comes across as patronizing. He stresses the need for religion to help secure ethics among the masses (at least at present), while apparently considering himself fully capable of living morally without religion. That said, I think the book drives home some good points (especially in the final chapters), and will get both believers and non-believers thinking about some of these issues."
145,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8076824-geoff,3,"I have a soft spot for primates, and books on morality are catching my attention at the moment so I thought I would have enjoyed this book more than I did. I also recently read The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt, so I can't help but compare the two. While I did enjoy this book more than The Righteous Mind, I still gave both books three stars. Frans de Waal's writing style is much more enjoyable and conversational than Haidt's. However, there seemed to be less science involved in this book. I know there are countless endnotes and references at the back of the book, but somehow the observations came across as purely anecdotal. While I agree with de Waal's bottom up approach to morality, rather than from top down, I didn't find that the strength of his arguments would convince anyone who don't already believe as he does."
146,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6323134-darcey,3,"I found this an interesting read, though perhaps one with more extraneous information than I wanted. I enjoyed de Waal's anecdotes and commentary about Bosch and how that was related to humanity, symbolism, and the growth of ideas - however, there was more of it than necessary (including recounting experiences of being at the Prado in Madrid). The linkage between the fact that primates (and other animals) exhibit traits which we as humans consider ""moral"" - and that animals do not follow religion - is clear, leaving us with no way to avoid the conclusion de Waal sets out to prove: morality is not something encoded purely by religion, and those who believe that without religion humans will descend to immoral madness have a significant amount of evidence to overcome to prove their position. "
147,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5777523-jami,4,"This was a well researched, informative book. I was not familiar with Frans de Waal's work before this book, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I thought there would be more focus on the Bonobo anecdotes, but there were enough to keep me entertained and interested. This book looks at the issue of what the source of morality and other behaviors is; it combines many areas of study, including religion, philosophy, science, sociology, psychology, and history. While parts of the book dragged a little, overall it was well done. There were some parts of the book that fascinated me and that I had never considered before, such as the yawn response in relation to empathy; I also particularly enjoyed the passages about specific behaviors usually only attributed to humans that are found in bonobos and other species. The narration was very good and easy to listen to."
148,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/906313-diane,3,"This was a surprisingly interesting argument on the origin of morality. In a spiritual context, morality is something that is imposed by God with commandments and injunctions, etc. deWaal, however, draws from his many years as a primatologist to suggest that morality is an internal motivator, something that is inherent within us and those species most closely related to us. The bonobo is his primary example of a primate that clearly demonstrates moral qualities such as empathy. I found it very interesting to listen to, but kind of disorganized. And since de Waal frequently mentions the Hieronymus Bosch painting, ""Garden of Earthly Delight,"" I wished I had that image on hand. Nevertheless, I enjoyed de Waal's ideas and his intelligent presentation."

The author's work with primates, and less frequently with other social mammals, provides convincing evidence for a continuity of development of consciousness and empathetic/moral behavior between humankind and other animals. It successfully combats the idea that humans and other social animals are at the core selfish, with altruism as a thin, self-serving veneer; that without top-down religious mandates, such as the 10 commandments, people would live in a nightmare Hobbesian world; and that ""selfish gene"" theories are a adequate way of understanding and interpreting an organism's behavior and motivations. An enjoyable read."
150,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41590197-yani,5,A refreshing book which discusses morality from a perspective I had bever heard before. It gives a neat alternative which I think is indeed much more plausible and not as polarised as apparently everything is nowadays.

151,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33852158-halli-lauren,3,"I read and enjoyed De Waal’s “Are we smart enough to know how smart animals are”, so when I saw this book was written by him, I was pretty intrigued! As a baby atheist myself, and someone who is interested in studying bonobos, this seemed like the perfect book for me. Unfortunately, De Waal spent way more time talking about chimpanzees than bonobos. He also spent way more time talking about Heironymus Bosch than was necessary. What was the point of that?? I was pretty on board with the author’s broader points about religion:1. Trying to “convert people to atheism” is a waste of energy 2. Religion isn’t going away any time soon, and if it did, we’d need to find something to replace it because of all the important things it does for us as humans (ie: community building)But here are my qualms:1. Why did he spend so much time condemning Neo-Atheists and so little time condemning the abuse and manipulation in so many religions? Toward the beginning, De Waal pointed out that he came from a much more casual religious background, so leaving his religion wasn’t as big of a deal. But the thing is, so many religions are extremely dogmatic which can lead to much more harm than good. De Waal definitely condemned dogmatism, which I agree with, but he didn’t seem to realize how inescapable dogmatism can be. Maybe that’s just my point of view coming from a high demand, very dogmatic religion. 2. So yeah, religion is important and isn’t going away any time soon. Then what should atheists do? De Waal spent so much time saying how important religion is, and even though he is an atheist himself, he didn’t share any of his ideas of how to get the benefits of religion elsewhere. I guess that’s what I wanted out of the book, and I didn’t get it. Then of course there’s the main subject matter of the book: the evolution of morality and altruism. This was all well and good, but while reading I didn’t have any “Aha!” moments- nothing felt very fresh to me. Overall a disappointing read. Not good, not bad. Just meh. Oh also I’m just sick of reading books by old white men… if anyone has recommendations of nonfiction science books by women or people of color?? Definitely would love to hear those."
152,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15812925-adrian-undrea,4,"Frans de Waal is probably best known for his appearances on TED Talks. Having seen his presentations on animal morality I have to admit I have started reading his book being biased. I consider myself an atheist and somehow I had been looking at this book to reinforce this view. But The Bonobo and the Atheist shouldn't be read for that as Frans de Waal looks to explore the origins of morality and debunk the myth, so deeply ingrained in most of us, that morality is the trademark of humanity. And while sometimes it jumps too fast from one idea to the other, reading The Bonobo and the Atheist with an open mind might change the way you view morality. Far from being a hallmark of mankind, morality is a product of evolution, shaping the interactions of all social animals. By the use of countless experiments Frans de Waal argues morality is a mere tool of the highly evolved animals that makes living in groups possible. It is one more nail in the coffin of the idea that somehow we are special from the rest of the biological world. And while Frans de Waal thinks letting go of religion might not be possible for humanity, he favors the optimistic idea that our moral compass is an inner one (a bottom-up approach) instead of having its origins in religion (a top-down view)."
153,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18494756-olivia,5,"This is probably the second book I've read this year that I think everyone should read. (The other was SO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT RACE by Ijeoma Oluo.)A fascinating look into the moral universe of our closest genetic relatives, and an examination of the ought vs is of their world without religion (as we would recognize it. Frans de Waal is a very engaging writer, and considerably more knowledgeable about the topic than the most well-intended science reporter. (I've read some non fiction by people who write layman's overviews of science topics by interviewing researchers, and they also serve a purpose, but this book combines a depth of understanding of the topic with an engaging readability that is sometimes lacking in non fiction written by academics.

154,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13162061-amirography,3,"Hmmm. It is hard to give a review for this book. It is full of great arguements against conventional thinking. and deWaal is certainly well read about science and morality. But he is mostly driven by arguing against skeptics (skeptics of animal-cognition, not in general) so he is great at giving counter examples. But he is not that great at proposing new ideas. So I might be wrong. Basically, from what I understood, bottom-up morality is descriptive to prescriptive morality with emphasis on socially enforced ones. I might be wrong because he was not that clear -to me- about it. Which is, underwhelming. Both because intuitive morality is at the end a prescriptive morality, however he wants to say that they are not that different. The arguments against different schools of normative thinking was also weak because from a utilitarian point of view, he was arguing a straw-man, as a utilitarian (like me) wouldn't exactly argue as he did in the place of a utilitarian. Though I have to say, it may have been not because if an intentional effort, but because he probably did not check his argument with a utilitarian. Overall, I don't think this book-essay was a ""great-read"" type, but it is certainly better than reading a fiction in search of meaning."

If there is a short-coming here, it is that the balance between these elements will be a little unsatisfactory for anyone who is mainly interested in the science. Compared to Frans de Waal's Primates and Philosophers—which features commentary from Robert Wright, Christine Korsgaard, Philip Kitcher and Peter Singer—The Bonobo and the Atheist also lacks the clarity that comes from having de Waal's most ambitious ideas reigned in by more cautious thinkers."

157,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15731711-samantha,4,"I am totally on the fence when it comes to Frans de Waal. Sometimes I find myself underlining sentences in this book in agreement, and other times I find myself scribbling frustrated notes of disagreement in the side margins. For example, on page 184 de Waal practically ridicules Peter Singer for not taking his view that we should have ""special loyalty"" to our own species while excluding other species from our moral equations. He basically argues that we should determine our morals (in some cases) based on loyalty to our own group - in this case, our own species. It's terribly reminiscent of people from history who argued the same way - substituting ""species"" for ""race"" or ""sex"". I assume that some time in the future, people will read this and think ""Wow, de Waal was a good primatologist, it's a shame he was such a speciesist"" as we now say about 18th and 19th century writers. In the margins on page 184 I wrote ""But sometimes fierce loyalty to one's own group is immoral - it would be immoral for me to say a black person is not equal to a white person merely out of loyalty to my own race."" This morality based on loyalty to one's own group is rather small-minded, if you ask me.Another rather bad part of de Waal's book was on page 204, where he writes, ""Neo-atheists are like people standing outside a movie theater telling us that Leonardo DiCaprio didn't really go down with the Titanic. How shocking! Mostly of us are perfectly comfortable with the duality."" The flaw in his argument is this: no one ridicules Titanic watchers because no Titanic watcher actually believes that Leo went down with the famous ship. But atheists ridicule theists because they ACTUALLY believe ridiculous things like wine turning into blood or demons in the form of talking snakes tempting people to eat some fruit. He argues that atheists who criticize religion are advocating the elimination of imagination. But the key difference between people with active imaginations and theists is that imaginative people ultimately recognize that their fantasies aren't part of reality. Theists make no such recognition; they actually believe, metaphorically, that Leonardo DiCaprio was on the Titanic. Or anything else equally absurd. This is why they are ridiculed and the imagination is not. Imagination is beautiful and beneficial in many ways. I'm a fiction writer, I have a very deep appreciation of imagination, but I recognize it as just that - imagination. Unlike imagination, I consider most religious claims ridiculously illogical because the theist seriously believes in these fantasies. I would have not the slightest problem with religion if this was not the case (but then it wouldn't really be religion, would it?). The weakness in de Waal's analogy (criticizing theists to criticizing moviegoers) is so obvious that I can't help thinking de Waal might not completely understand religion or what it means to condemn it.There are other ways in which I strongly disagreed with de Waal, particularly when he talked about religion (I write in a margin, ""Can we go back to the apes now?"") but overall I tended to agree with what he said. It was a good book and I learned a lot from it about chimps and bonobos. The parts about the apes were very interesting, but the parts where de Waal starts talking religion and philosophy were out of touch with how I feel about those matters. Overall, it was a good book and worth reading for anyone interested in the origins of morality."
158,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9716384-vivify-m,5,"I very much enjoyed this book. Primatology enthralls me - learning about our primate cousins, and how researchers work with them is a joy. But, the resulting insights into our own psychology, is the highlight. I also, enjoyed understanding how the experiments were constructed and the challenges the researchers faced.On the downside, I was put off by the authors attitude towards other disciplines. I found his criticism of biologists unnecessary, in particular his misrepresentation of geneticists as calling prosocial behaviour a mistake. I’m no expert, but I also questioned his representation of evolution. At times I thought he was confusing selfish genes with selfish individuals. Possibly, the most significant contribution of the book, is the idea that key to our salvation is in understanding our natural selves. I love this sentiment, but I also get nervous of overly naturalistic thinking, and I’m not convinced by the arguments against utilitarianism. Ultimately, this was a deeply thought provoking and enjoyable book."
159,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57079482-chuck-kollars,4,"The author has kept and done research with Chimpanzees and Bonobos (formerly known as Pygmy Chimps) for decades, is top of his field, and has written many books. The main theme of this book is an observation and bit of reasoning. The observation is that our animal relatives routinely display a fairly strong sense of morality (focused on maintaining good relations within the group). The obvious reasoning from this is that our current morality -often embedded in ""religion""- comes not from anything external like religion but rather from something internal that predates religion. He makes this case pretty strongly, but without placing it in a larger hypothetical framework. The book mentions, but doesn't even try to answer larger questions such as how did our morality come to be deposited in religion?, how does a morality focused on good group relations work with much larger groups (tribe, nation, globe, etc.)?, how much can we deviate from our unthinking inborn sense of morality before everything falls apart?, and how will we know when we don't need religion at all any more?He does several other things in this same book: He responds to the ""four horsemen of atheism"" that made such a splash a few years ago. He presents many interesting anecdotes from his subjects, some of which are closely tied to a sense of morality and some that illustrate more intelligence/forethought/non-aggression than we typically credit our close relative animals with. And he tries his hand at an explication of the painting ""The Garden"" by ""Heironymus Bosch"". He draws some interesting parallels between these topics, but in my opinion not enough, so the book seems less focused than it could be. There are indeed connections between these strands (even though they're not as strong as I'd like). For example, the author thinks the ""four horsemen of atheism"" give too much credit to religion in accusing it of being the root of horrible wars and genocides. Such abominable behavior is also displayed by chimps in certain circumstances. Humans must have gotten it from the same place, and our common ancestor predates religion. Also, chimp society is clearly uninfluenced by any human religion ...or any religion at all. So for the wars and genocides, despite its claims, religion was really more ""cover story"" than ""cause"". In a way the whole book is a plea for humble moderation rather than conspicuous ideology. We're asked to actually look at the evidence in front of our faces and to not completely throw out religion until we understand it a little better and so forth. This is his critique of the atheists too: most scientists are rather dubious about religion, but why is it so important to you that other people think exactly the same way you do? He describes the seemingly contradictory combination of a lackluster subject with passionate advocacy as ""sleeping furiously""."

Back to some serious reading nowIn all honesty, I chose to read this book to learn about Bonobos and didn't want to fully enter into any religious debate. That part of the book I really enjoyed. However. since this book is titled 'The Bonobo and the Atheist', I will make a few comments.I will say that I enjoyed reading about Veneer theory. Unfortunately, I am not so sure that I agree with Frans de Waal's notion that this theory is no longer valid with the overwhelming evidence of innate altruism. Perhaps I'm a skeptic but I still feel that people do in fact weigh up the possible benefits of their actions and not just in business and with acquaintances but also with family and friends; which is not what he believes. He believes we are altruistic with those closest to us and that is not always the case. What I will say is that I don't argue that there is something innate within us that gives us our moral compass but one could argue that it is a higher being that gives us that moral compass in the first place. Nonetheless, what I do respect is that at no point does he belittle other religions or in fact hail atheism as the one true faith. I respect that he is not a militant atheist like Dawkins. He even mentions that for him - when considering that it was wrongly believed Darwin agreed with 'the expulsion of morality from the natural domain'-""the height of absurdity was reached when Dawkins explicitly disavowed Darwin, telling an interviewer in 1997 that 'in our political and social life we are entitled to throw out Darwinism.'"" He doesn't appreciate Dawkin's ability to be so dismissive of other beliefs.This is a good read but, as mentioned in some other reviews that I've read, I also feel that Frans de Waal is mixing two ideas that needn't be discussed together. When he does discuss some points, I often feel like saying, 'just get to the point'. He spends over a page using various works of art to comment on how we react to them and how it shows our bodily empathy.It felt like he introduced this list of art to fill a few pages. There can often be much speculation based on what he observes in the bonobos and humans themselves. There are often times when I feel he speculates too much. Though I will say that I was pleased to hear another one of his many examples that'humans most prone to yawn contagion also have the most empathy'. That is pleasing to know since simply reading the word yawn sets me off :).I have enjoyed reading this book but when he stated 'My first book on this topic, Good Natured (1996), barely mentioned religion' I almost wish I had read that instead."
161,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196037-jrobertus,5,"De Waal is a primatologist with a philosophical bent. I have read several of his books; they are not only interesting but important. He shows from his experimental work the basis for morality in our simian ancestors. They have empathy and an innate sense of fairness, required for communal living an hunting, that sets the basis for a moral code. (His experiments showing a sense of fairness in monkeys is fmous and the subject of a terrific TED tak). Region, or other social institutions, build on this inherent bent. De Waal describes morality as bottom up and not top down. Although he is atheist himself, he takes issue with the “neo atheists” like Hitchins and Dawkins who are aggressive in attacking religion. He urges tolerance and open mindedness and to not be as dogmatic as relious fundamentalists. He feels religion plays an important role in the social structure of close knit groups, it is robust (whereas science is new, difficult, “unnatural” and therefore fragile in an all out battle with religion). He feels northern Europe is carrying out a large scale gradual experiment in secularism. Can education and the state take over the amalgamating role of relion and make a strong, moral society without religion? We'll see eventually. Certainty efforts to remove religion by force, like the communists and Khmer rouge, have been horrible failures, worse than the superstition and dogmatism they wanted to replace. The animal work, an observations of behaviour, that De Waal uses to support his arguments are interesting in their own right. This is a most worthwhile read for its science and for the way science can inform philosophy and politics.De Waal is a hero of mine; he is an imaginative scientist, and a mature reviewer of the biological basis of empathy, altruism, and morality. In this book he continues his eye-opening work on the behavior of primates, especially our nearest relatives, the chimps and bonobos. His careful monitoring of their behavior in laboratories and in the wild, points out the ancient foundation of moral behavior among animals living in interdependent societies. In this book he also addresses the ongoing debate between religion, particularly fundamentalists, and science. Although he is an atheist he sees the value in religious practice and bonding, if not in the dogma. He takes aim at the “new atheists”, like Hitchens and Dawkins, and chides them for a combative and often insulting tone that does not help bridge the social gap. The tone of this book is so mature and thoughtful it is quite humbling. I wish I could be more like him."
162,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71935584-ben-zimmerman,3,"As a book about fascinating and well-told narratives about animal behavior and cognition, I would give this book a better rating (as I would rate many of Frans De Waal’s books). However, the purpose of this book seemed to be more about a reflection of religion and a bit of a criticism of the “new atheists”. I thought that the religious reflections weren’t very interesting and often wrong in the way that he characterized the views of both many atheists and many religious people. Some of his reflections and connections seemed disconnected and not well thought out. I would definitely recommend reading Frans de Waal, but maybe a different book. "
163,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10397934-erich,3,"Somewhat meandering in its approach, this book does make some convincing and enlightening arguments that I am happy to ponder. Frans de Waal's obvious expertise in primate prosocial behavior gives him an excellent vantage point to show that morality certainly evolved well before any religious institutions were established, especially as we know them today. The anecdotes are enticing and revealing, and really make the thesis very compelling. Primatology sounds even more fascinating when we see ourselves so vividly reflected in his vignettes. Some of the digressions into how we are to deal with morality and religion in the face of scientific progress are less persuasive. I did not find de Waal's writing to be particularly cohesive or share the logical argumentative power of a Dawkins or Hitchens. Towards the end of the book I finally began to grasp his viewpoint, and mostly embraced it, but there was no feeling of real enlightenment. I think the book overall, and some of its arguments, could have been better organized. The book did serve a good counterpoint to what de Waal calls ""neo-Atheists"" such as Sam Harris, Dawkins, and Hitchens (well, ""Marxist"" for him), though I happen to love these authors. If you are looking for that, it has its moments. I have to admit that I had problems with de Waal's recommendation to give modern religion so much leeway and to dispense with the heated ""anti-religious"" rhetoric of those mentioned above. While humans may be naturally predisposed to accepting religion as a form of social normalizing (which I agree has had its place in our civilizing process), this doesn't mean it we should accept it as necessary today. Its stranglehold on truth in the face of scientific evidence does nothing to enforce our common morality. If anything, it holds us back from truly understanding our place in the universe and extending a moral code to everyone. I see a need for more strong voices opposed to this willful ignorance and dogma, not fewer. All in all, a good read with some nice points. And bonobos!"
164,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13928228-sortal,1,"Muddy thinking, misrepresentation (or ignorance?) of atheist arguments, and lots of irrelevant passages on Hieronymus Bosch. I've really enjoyed other books by Frans de Waal, but this is an unsuccessful departure from his areas of expertise. Insofar as I can figure out what de Waal is arguing for, I agree with most of his premises: 1. Moral conduct exists on a continuum, including the behaviours of other animals.2. Dogmatism is terrible and should be avoided. 3. Religion is superfluous to morality. 4. Hardline atheism is unlikely to persuade the devoutly religious to give up their faith.But then things go wrong. 5. De Waal never addresses whether religion is inherently dogmatic. (Insofar as it's faith-based, where faith is belief without evidence, it certainly seems that way.) 6. De Waal never addresses the harm done by religion (a crucial point made by the thinkers he so blithely dismisses, such as Dawkins and Harris). 7. De Waal claims (without any supporting argument) that religion will always exist.If you replaced the passages on Bosch with a fair representation of the atheists de Waal is arguing against, you'd have a wonderful book. Better still would be a book using de Waal's research to build on the project of Harris' Moral Landscape, helping to create an alternative to religion (the logical next step from premises 2-4 once you accept 5 and 6 and dismiss 7). Instead, you get an infuriatingly murky read of jumbled ideas with just enough interesting anecdotes about primates to keep you reading through the rambling about Bosch.   "
165,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"The book really should have been titled ""The Bonobo and Human Empathy"". The two pillars of all philosophy are empathy and reciprocity. He completely examines the first pillar, empathy, by illustrating empathetic behavior in Bonobos (and other animals) and linking it to our behavior.He's such a good writer even when he wrote about things I completely disagreed with I would find the book thought provoking. I thought he trivialized the arguments of Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens and John Stuart Mill. But, I'm not bothered. I believe what I believe and I appreciated the different perspective.The narrator did a perfect job.The book is much better than most pop science books I have listened to and I'm much richer for having listened to this highly entertaining book and can definitely say because of this book I'm much closer to my goal of understanding our place in the universe. He does talk about philosophy but I enjoyed those parts as much as I did about bonobos.(P.S. Matt Ridley's book, ""The Rational Optimist"", fully covers the second pillar of human philosophy, reciprocity. Also, my personal take on the author he seemed like an apologetic atheist and he didn't want to offend anyone. But as I say, I wasn't bothered by this, but I disagreed with him regarding those sections. Also, he seemed to characterized the utilitarianism of John Stuart Mill in a comic book fashion. Once again I wasn't bothered but I don't want to leave the impression that I agreed with him on those two points)."
166,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51675760-mark-james,3,"I really enjoyed learning about the idiosyncrasies of many of the primates, as well as having a better sense of the differences between bonobos and chimps. Choosing Bosch's ""The Garden of Earthly Delights"" as a focal point was interesting on de Waal's part. I couldn't help but feel the book could have been better organized, as the topic shifts from bonobos to religion to morality to art without any obvious structure. Finally, there were several points made about atheism that don't hold up to scrutiny. For instance, he writes, ""Everything humans have accomplished anywhere - from architecture to music, from art to science - developed hand in hand with religion, never separately."" Do you mean, de Waal, that religion has existed at the same time that these wonderful things were created, or that all people who created these things were religious? Certainly neither is true. In fact, most examples of human achievement come in spite of religion, not because of it.Elsewhere, de Waal faults Christopher Hitchens for shifting loyalties several times before landing on an antitheist stance. To me, this only means that Hitchens was tireless in his pursuit of truth.I detected countless other examples of unfair judgments, but overall, the author tends to take the safe middle ground when failing to acknowledge that anything we can do without belief in the supernatural, we can do without it, and then some."
167,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3050574-a-b-gayle,3,"Humanism and the BonoboI struggled to get through this book while I was totally immersed in another of his, questioning whether humans were smart enough to understand animals. I think part of my alienation arose because of his obsession with Heironymous Bosch’s art. (I thought he was an LAPD detective, lol!)Basically, I totally agree with the main premise of this book. Best summed up in the final chapter.Thank God, if I may, we share with other primates a background as group animals, which makes us value social connections. Absent this background, religion could be preaching about virtue and vice until it became blue in the face, we’d never get its point. We are receptive only because of our evolved grasp of the value of relationships, the benefits of cooperation, the need for trust and honesty, and so on. Even our sense of fairness derives from this background.In other words, we are receptive to religion (some might say vulnerable) simply because we like other mammals have empathy and value relationships, the benefits of cooperation, the need for trust and honesty, and so on. Even our sense of fairness derives from this background. But just because something is possible doesn’t mean it is necessary.Throughout the preceding chapters, he has shown different ways this morality manifests itself within the animal kingdom. He refutes the notion that if it weren’t for religion, humans would be no better than animals. In fact he states Morality arose first, and modern religion latched onto it. Instead of giving us the moral law, the large religions were invented to bolster it. We are only just beginning to explore how religion does so by binding people together and enforcing good behavior. It is far from my intention to minimize this role, which was vital in the past and may remain so in the foreseeable future, but the wellspring of morality it is not.In fact he sees the evolutionary development of this bottom up morality that has allowed us to develop to where we are today.So why not give this a higher rating?Firstly, the continual referral to the Bosch painting “The Garden” which seemed a stretch at times to illustrate a point he was making. We can no more know why Bosch painted it the way he did than know what Bonobos are actually thinking.Sure, studying them in the wild and conducting experiments can demonstrate that they have recognisable emotions, but in one section he has Bonobos thinking about what atheists would be thinking. So that was my second star off.The third star off is for his dodgy logic in many sections. Take for example his dismissal of the Golden Rule of Christianity (Do unto others as you would have them do unto you).To give a rather crude example, if at a conference I follow an attractive woman whom I barely know to her hotel room and jump into her bed uninvited, I can pretty well guess how she’d react. If I explain that I am just doing to her what I would love her to do to me, I’m afraid my appeal to the golden rule won’t fly. Or, let’s assume that I knowingly serve pork sausages to a vegan. Liking meat myself, I am just following the golden rule, but the vegan will consider my behavior obnoxious, perhaps even immoral.In both cases he has only looked at the physical side of the equation, not the effects of those acts. Would he like someone to rape him or insult his beliefs? You can’t divorce the act from the motive or consequence of the act. If all three are taken into account, the Golden Rule still applies.Chapter 7 particularly had some lazy logic. Whereas in previous chapters I’d been highlighting very well presented arguments, this one is full of my exasperation at the arguments used to justify the need for religion in society. Take this one for example.We humans were plenty moral when we still roamed the savanna in small bands. Only when the scale of society began to grow and rules of reciprocity and reputation began to falter did a moralizing God become necessary.But perhaps the “necessity” for this moralising God and his acolytes comes about because the chances of having a psychopath or control freak who wants this power (in the form of a controlling religion) has increased because of the larger population? He had already acknowledged that personalities varied within animal groups, so the ‘need’ for religion could just as easily be attributed to statistics producing people who wanted power for power’s sake.Interestingly when you look at early Greek and Roman religion, the gods just existed. They were used to explain the unexplainable. It was only later that the gods started telling people how to behave. I’m pretty sure the population of Ancient Greeks and Romans was not insignificant.But let’s look at another lazy analogy The whole purpose of God is to do the latter (loving moral actions). We endowed him with the capacity to keep us on the same straight and narrow that we’d been following ever since we lived in small bands.How different is this from the concept of Santa Claus being used to make children behave? Adults understand that rewards that are achievable are the best ways to control children. Likewise those who perceive the need to control large numbers of adults do so by playing up to the fears that adults have (as evidenced previously in this chapter) - a fear of death and hence the need for an afterlife.While I can see his point that a focusing deity that encourages people to be good is not bad, but the dogma that accompanies it and the divisions this creates makes me question whether this need could be better met in other ways or at least recognised for what is really happening. Perhaps the need is more that many individuals are not going to take orders from one of their own, but prefer that order to come from some unquestionably alpha figure.So my final verdict? Animals follow their own form of moral code developed in response to the betterment of their community. While some humans are still capable of doing this, others through laziness, unwillingness to kowtow to one of their own issuing instructions or fear of their mortality need some sort of mystical religion to guide their actions. I added another star back in because he made a good case for respecting that animals at times are better socialised than many humans."
168,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5889085-h-wesselius,4,"The title is somewhat misleading. De Waal is not writing a tight coherent account of morality and humanism among the primates. He is instead writing meandering thought provoking but far more personal account of humanism and science. His constant reference to the Bosch painting which he uses as a metaphor is an irritant. From this and his forays into philosophical discussions on the nature of God and morality, its obvious he's writing more of a personal discussion which he's entitled to after years of work. One of the frequent arguments for the existence of God is the cited need for moral law. Its the existence of God and his instruction to man that sets us apart, apparently. De Waal successful challenges that assumption citing evidence of moral behavior in not only primates but in other larger social animals such as dolphins and elephants. From this he proposes that morality is derived from the social nature of animals and has an bottoms up origins as opposed to the top down model proposed by various religions. Pulling it all together, he makes a compelling argument that morality is the basis for religion and a belief in God and not the other way around. An excellent read with a good and interesting argument. "
169,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/119364-melee-farr,3,"The premise of the book was right up my alley - examining the roots of morality (and ultimately religion) from a larger mammalian perspective. And I think it was effective on that front. de Waal is a primatologist, first and foremost, and there were countless examples from his and others' research, observations, and publications of moral behavior existing consistently in the animal world, with sound evolutionary reasoning for pro-social behaviors being retained throughout mammalian phylogeny. I flew through the first half of the book. He uses Bosch's triptych painting ""Garden of Earthly Delights"" as a recurring metaphor throughout the book, and honestly, he lost me with it. I mean, I understood the metaphor, but, to use another, it was kind of beating a dead horse. This may reveal the fact that I'm not particularly well-versed in the visual arts. He also is rather dismissive of atheism as often aggressive and exclusionary, and permissive of religion because he sees it as inevitable and having some consistently positive societal traits. Both points are well-made, but may whitewash the good done by skepticism and the evil done by dogmatism. But that perspective may also just reveal my bias. "
170,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6664778-andrea,3,"Tracing the beginning of morality may be as close as our fellow primates the Bonobos, as de Waal explains in this book. I am interested in the topic of the origins of morality and the book has a flow that kept me reading. I do think de Waal has a little Richard Dawkins envy though. Richard Dawkins is simply a better writer. This author makes the point that although morality predates religion there is no point in egging on the religious majority by calling such religious beliefs delusional, which in fact Dawkins does. I agree it is pointless and may be even counter productive however I feel the author fails to give due the bias that atheists face, bias that denies us jobs, social status and even basic human rights. Try getting into high political positions as an outed atheist. Frans does a disservice to human rights when he says that there is no reason to state an atheist agenda, and I agree, but what about a human agenda? Frans doesn't take the biases seriously enough. This being said the book is worth a read to remind us of our roots, to connect with fellow primates and to learn more about the origins of morality."
171,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5318025-nina,3,"Frans de Waal's research is impressive, and I found his insights into primate behaviors, including those of humans, very interesting. However, if the purpose of his study had to do with religion and morality, then he failed to connect the two sides of the book (primatology and religion). By the time I finished the book, my big questions were, What does religion have to do with this study? and What does Bosch have to do with primatology? Personal admiration for the painter does not constitute expertise, and while interesting, the bursts of art history did not in any way advance de Waal's argument, especially because they did not rely on art history so much as on the author's personal responses to The Garden of Earthly Delights. Sadly, de Waal does not really understand atheists either, neither old-school nor the ones he refers to as ""neo-atheists."" Personal opinions rather than data dominate this book, and opinions do not prove very much. The lack of hard evidence for the arguments on morality is only part of the problem, though. The author's attempts at wit are offensive to many readers, and together with speculation rather than evidence hurt the book's message. "
172,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11200007-douglas-cosby,1,"1.5 stars (the extra half point is for the narrator): Not my bag. I read the first third of this book, but couldn't get any further. Franz de Waal's point is simple: morality is a result of evolution, not imposed by religion or ""invented"" by humans. A very good point, and I sympathize with de Waal's frustration with biologists/scientists that fall prey to the rampant anthropomorphism we humans tend to overlay on the way we see other animals. He uses a few scientific studies, but mainly just anecdotes and cute stories, to justify his position, and this book feels more like a feel-good article in O magazine than something that would be in Scientific American or Nature. Additionally, while de Waal harshly criticizes recent atheist authors, it doesn't seem like he has really read them. For instance, his criticism of Sam Harris's The Moral Landscape, seems like it came from the back-of-the-book summary, not the actual details of the book. If you are in the mood for a bunch of touching ape stories, then this book might be for you. If you are looking for a book on the scientific basis of prehuman morality supported by scientific evidence and logical conclusions, look elsewhere."
173,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5078550-robert-bor,4,"I got this book from my friends, who appreciate my interest in evolution, politics and society. Frans de Waal weaves two different threads in this book. On the one hand, he proceeds to show clearly how animals (the Bonobo primate in particular) have an extremely good sense of moralistic behavior. This undermines the argument that moralistic behavior is one of the primary consequences of religion. No, not just undermines, evaporates. This is where he weaves in the other thread, where he distances himself from the Atheist camp (Dawkins et al) and states that religion should not just be abandoned if we cannot replace it with something else. He understands the need of humans for spirituality and does not just wish this away. In the dual aspect, a bit of a weird combination, but understandable, since being seen in the Atheist camp, pretty much shuts you out from dialogue with the religious one. Is Mr de Waal aiming for a diplomatic role in bringing the two camps closer together? On another note, if you like the work of Hiëronymus Bosch, know that it features prominently in this book."
174,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7349461-cody,3,"This book had its ups and downs. de Waal's argument for morality emerging from bottom-up processes is convincing, and I really enjoyed when he would dive into the details of primate research, as well his many anecdotes. This alone makes the book worth reading. I do, however, think he was quite off the mark with his criticism of the ""neo-Atheists"" (i.e., the New Atheists). On top of the misguided attacks (A.C. Grayling addresses some of these in a review in Prospect Magazine http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/mag...), at times he comes across as patronizing. He stresses the need for religion to help secure ethics among the masses (at least at present), while apparently considering himself fully capable of living morally without religion. That said, I think the book drives home some good points (especially in the final chapters), and will get both believers and non-believers thinking about some of these issues."
175,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8076824-geoff,3,"I have a soft spot for primates, and books on morality are catching my attention at the moment so I thought I would have enjoyed this book more than I did. I also recently read The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt, so I can't help but compare the two. While I did enjoy this book more than The Righteous Mind, I still gave both books three stars. Frans de Waal's writing style is much more enjoyable and conversational than Haidt's. However, there seemed to be less science involved in this book. I know there are countless endnotes and references at the back of the book, but somehow the observations came across as purely anecdotal. While I agree with de Waal's bottom up approach to morality, rather than from top down, I didn't find that the strength of his arguments would convince anyone who don't already believe as he does."

I enjoyed de Waal's anecdotes and commentary about Bosch and how that was related to humanity, symbolism, and the growth of ideas - however, there was more of it than necessary (including recounting experiences of being at the Prado in Madrid). The linkage between the fact that primates (and other animals) exhibit traits which we as humans consider ""moral"" - and that animals do not follow religion - is clear, leaving us with no way to avoid the conclusion de Waal sets out to prove: morality is not something encoded purely by religion, and those who believe that without religion humans will descend to immoral madness have a significant amount of evidence to overcome to prove their position.

I was not familiar with Frans de Waal's work before this book, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I thought there would be more focus on the Bonobo anecdotes, but there were enough to keep me entertained and interested. This book looks at the issue of what the source of morality and other behaviors is; it combines many areas of study, including religion, philosophy, science, sociology, psychology, and history. While parts of the book dragged a little, overall it was well done. There were some parts of the book that fascinated me and that I had never considered before, such as the yawn response in relation to empathy; I also particularly enjoyed the passages about specific behaviors usually only attributed to humans that are found in bonobos and other species. The narration was very good and easy to listen to."
178,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/906313-diane,3,"This was a surprisingly interesting argument on the origin of morality. In a spiritual context, morality is something that is imposed by God with commandments and injunctions, etc. deWaal, however, draws from his many years as a primatologist to suggest that morality is an internal motivator, something that is inherent within us and those species most closely related to us. The bonobo is his primary example of a primate that clearly demonstrates moral qualities such as empathy. I found it very interesting to listen to, but kind of disorganized. And since de Waal frequently mentions the Hieronymus Bosch painting, ""Garden of Earthly Delight,"" I wished I had that image on hand. Nevertheless, I enjoyed de Waal's ideas and his intelligent presentation."

The author's work with primates, and less frequently with other social mammals, provides convincing evidence for a continuity of development of consciousness and empathetic/moral behavior between humankind and other animals. It successfully combats the idea that humans and other social animals are at the core selfish, with altruism as a thin, self-serving veneer; that without top-down religious mandates, such as the 10 commandments, people would live in a nightmare Hobbesian world; and that ""selfish gene"" theories are a adequate way of understanding and interpreting an organism's behavior and motivations.

181,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33852158-halli-lauren,3,"I read and enjoyed De Waal’s “Are we smart enough to know how smart animals are”, so when I saw this book was written by him, I was pretty intrigued! As a baby atheist myself, and someone who is interested in studying bonobos, this seemed like the perfect book for me. Unfortunately, De Waal spent way more time talking about chimpanzees than bonobos. He also spent way more time talking about Heironymus Bosch than was necessary. What was the point of that?? I was pretty on board with the author’s broader points about religion:1. Trying to “convert people to atheism” is a waste of energy 2. Religion isn’t going away any time soon, and if it did, we’d need to find something to replace it because of all the important things it does for us as humans (ie: community building)But here are my qualms:1. Why did he spend so much time condemning Neo-Atheists and so little time condemning the abuse and manipulation in so many religions? Toward the beginning, De Waal pointed out that he came from a much more casual religious background, so leaving his religion wasn’t as big of a deal. But the thing is, so many religions are extremely dogmatic which can lead to much more harm than good. De Waal definitely condemned dogmatism, which I agree with, but he didn’t seem to realize how inescapable dogmatism can be. Maybe that’s just my point of view coming from a high demand, very dogmatic religion. 2. So yeah, religion is important and isn’t going away any time soon. Then what should atheists do? De Waal spent so much time saying how important religion is, and even though he is an atheist himself, he didn’t share any of his ideas of how to get the benefits of religion elsewhere. I guess that’s what I wanted out of the book, and I didn’t get it. Then of course there’s the main subject matter of the book: the evolution of morality and altruism. This was all well and good, but while reading I didn’t have any “Aha!” moments- nothing felt very fresh to me. Overall a disappointing read. Not good, not bad. Just meh. Oh also I’m just sick of reading books by old white men… if anyone has recommendations of nonfiction science books by women or people of color?? Definitely would love to hear those."
182,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15812925-adrian-undrea,4,"Frans de Waal is probably best known for his appearances on TED Talks. Having seen his presentations on animal morality I have to admit I have started reading his book being biased. I consider myself an atheist and somehow I had been looking at this book to reinforce this view. But The Bonobo and the Atheist shouldn't be read for that as Frans de Waal looks to explore the origins of morality and debunk the myth, so deeply ingrained in most of us, that morality is the trademark of humanity. And while sometimes it jumps too fast from one idea to the other, reading The Bonobo and the Atheist with an open mind might change the way you view morality. Far from being a hallmark of mankind, morality is a product of evolution, shaping the interactions of all social animals. By the use of countless experiments Frans de Waal argues morality is a mere tool of the highly evolved animals that makes living in groups possible. It is one more nail in the coffin of the idea that somehow we are special from the rest of the biological world. And while Frans de Waal thinks letting go of religion might not be possible for humanity, he favors the optimistic idea that our moral compass is an inner one (a bottom-up approach) instead of having its origins in religion (a top-down view)."
183,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18494756-olivia,5,"This is probably the second book I've read this year that I think everyone should read. (The other was SO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT RACE by Ijeoma Oluo.)A fascinating look into the moral universe of our closest genetic relatives, and an examination of the ought vs is of their world without religion (as we would recognize it. Frans de Waal is a very engaging writer, and considerably more knowledgeable about the topic than the most well-intended science reporter. (I've read some non fiction by people who write layman's overviews of science topics by interviewing researchers, and they also serve a purpose, but this book combines a depth of understanding of the topic with an engaging readability that is sometimes lacking in non fiction written by academics. I'm already seeking out more of his work.Atheist, believer, or.those of us in between will find much of interest here."
184,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13162061-amirography,3,"Hmmm. It is hard to give a review for this book. It is full of great arguements against conventional thinking. and deWaal is certainly well read about science and morality. But he is mostly driven by arguing against skeptics (skeptics of animal-cognition, not in general) so he is great at giving counter examples. But he is not that great at proposing new ideas. So I might be wrong. Basically, from what I understood, bottom-up morality is descriptive to prescriptive morality with emphasis on socially enforced ones. I might be wrong because he was not that clear -to me- about it. Which is, underwhelming. Both because intuitive morality is at the end a prescriptive morality, however he wants to say that they are not that different. The arguments against different schools of normative thinking was also weak because from a utilitarian point of view, he was arguing a straw-man, as a utilitarian (like me) wouldn't exactly argue as he did in the place of a utilitarian. Though I have to say, it may have been not because if an intentional effort, but because he probably did not check his argument with a utilitarian. Overall, I don't think this book-essay was a ""great-read"" type, but it is certainly better than reading a fiction in search of meaning."

If there is a short-coming here, it is that the balance between these elements will be a little unsatisfactory for anyone who is mainly interested in the science. Compared to Frans de Waal's Primates and Philosophers—which features commentary from Robert Wright, Christine Korsgaard, Philip Kitcher and Peter Singer—The Bonobo and the Atheist also lacks the clarity that comes from having de Waal's most ambitious ideas reigned in by more cautious thinkers."

187,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15731711-samantha,4,"I am totally on the fence when it comes to Frans de Waal. Sometimes I find myself underlining sentences in this book in agreement, and other times I find myself scribbling frustrated notes of disagreement in the side margins. For example, on page 184 de Waal practically ridicules Peter Singer for not taking his view that we should have ""special loyalty"" to our own species while excluding other species from our moral equations. He basically argues that we should determine our morals (in some cases) based on loyalty to our own group - in this case, our own species. It's terribly reminiscent of people from history who argued the same way - substituting ""species"" for ""race"" or ""sex"". I assume that some time in the future, people will read this and think ""Wow, de Waal was a good primatologist, it's a shame he was such a speciesist"" as we now say about 18th and 19th century writers. In the margins on page 184 I wrote ""But sometimes fierce loyalty to one's own group is immoral - it would be immoral for me to say a black person is not equal to a white person merely out of loyalty to my own race."" This morality based on loyalty to one's own group is rather small-minded, if you ask me.Another rather bad part of de Waal's book was on page 204, where he writes, ""Neo-atheists are like people standing outside a movie theater telling us that Leonardo DiCaprio didn't really go down with the Titanic. How shocking! Mostly of us are perfectly comfortable with the duality."" The flaw in his argument is this: no one ridicules Titanic watchers because no Titanic watcher actually believes that Leo went down with the famous ship. But atheists ridicule theists because they ACTUALLY believe ridiculous things like wine turning into blood or demons in the form of talking snakes tempting people to eat some fruit. He argues that atheists who criticize religion are advocating the elimination of imagination. But the key difference between people with active imaginations and theists is that imaginative people ultimately recognize that their fantasies aren't part of reality. Theists make no such recognition; they actually believe, metaphorically, that Leonardo DiCaprio was on the Titanic. Or anything else equally absurd. This is why they are ridiculed and the imagination is not. Imagination is beautiful and beneficial in many ways. I'm a fiction writer, I have a very deep appreciation of imagination, but I recognize it as just that - imagination. Unlike imagination, I consider most religious claims ridiculously illogical because the theist seriously believes in these fantasies. I would have not the slightest problem with religion if this was not the case (but then it wouldn't really be religion, would it?). The weakness in de Waal's analogy (criticizing theists to criticizing moviegoers) is so obvious that I can't help thinking de Waal might not completely understand religion or what it means to condemn it.There are other ways in which I strongly disagreed with de Waal, particularly when he talked about religion (I write in a margin, ""Can we go back to the apes now?"") but overall I tended to agree with what he said. It was a good book and I learned a lot from it about chimps and bonobos. The parts about the apes were very interesting, but the parts where de Waal starts talking religion and philosophy were out of touch with how I feel about those matters. Overall, it was a good book and worth reading for anyone interested in the origins of morality."
188,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9716384-vivify-m,5,"I very much enjoyed this book. Primatology enthralls me - learning about our primate cousins, and how researchers work with them is a joy. But, the resulting insights into our own psychology, is the highlight. I also, enjoyed understanding how the experiments were constructed and the challenges the researchers faced.On the downside, I was put off by the authors attitude towards other disciplines. I found his criticism of biologists unnecessary, in particular his misrepresentation of geneticists as calling prosocial behaviour a mistake. I’m no expert, but I also questioned his representation of evolution. At times I thought he was confusing selfish genes with selfish individuals. Possibly, the most significant contribution of the book, is the idea that key to our salvation is in understanding our natural selves. I love this sentiment, but I also get nervous of overly naturalistic thinking, and I’m not convinced by the arguments against utilitarianism. Ultimately, this was a deeply thought provoking and enjoyable book."
189,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57079482-chuck-kollars,4,"The author has kept and done research with Chimpanzees and Bonobos (formerly known as Pygmy Chimps) for decades, is top of his field, and has written many books. The main theme of this book is an observation and bit of reasoning. The observation is that our animal relatives routinely display a fairly strong sense of morality (focused on maintaining good relations within the group). The obvious reasoning from this is that our current morality -often embedded in ""religion""- comes not from anything external like religion but rather from something internal that predates religion. He makes this case pretty strongly, but without placing it in a larger hypothetical framework. The book mentions, but doesn't even try to answer larger questions such as how did our morality come to be deposited in religion?, how does a morality focused on good group relations work with much larger groups (tribe, nation, globe, etc.)?, how much can we deviate from our unthinking inborn sense of morality before everything falls apart?, and how will we know when we don't need religion at all any more?He does several other things in this same book: He responds to the ""four horsemen of atheism"" that made such a splash a few years ago. He presents many interesting anecdotes from his subjects, some of which are closely tied to a sense of morality and some that illustrate more intelligence/forethought/non-aggression than we typically credit our close relative animals with. And he tries his hand at an explication of the painting ""The Garden"" by ""Heironymus Bosch"". He draws some interesting parallels between these topics, but in my opinion not enough, so the book seems less focused than it could be. There are indeed connections between these strands (even though they're not as strong as I'd like). For example, the author thinks the ""four horsemen of atheism"" give too much credit to religion in accusing it of being the root of horrible wars and genocides. Such abominable behavior is also displayed by chimps in certain circumstances. Humans must have gotten it from the same place, and our common ancestor predates religion. Also, chimp society is clearly uninfluenced by any human religion ...or any religion at all. So for the wars and genocides, despite its claims, religion was really more ""cover story"" than ""cause"". In a way the whole book is a plea for humble moderation rather than conspicuous ideology. We're asked to actually look at the evidence in front of our faces and to not completely throw out religion until we understand it a little better and so forth. This is his critique of the atheists too: most scientists are rather dubious about religion, but why is it so important to you that other people think exactly the same way you do? He describes the seemingly contradictory combination of a lackluster subject with passionate advocacy as ""sleeping furiously""."
190,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12402305-hanan-elsharif,3,"In her 1985 book Sex and Friendship in Baboons, Barbara Smuts was the first to apply the term “friendship” to animals,ha ha. her name is Smuts. um. Back to some serious reading nowIn all honesty, I chose to read this book to learn about Bonobos and didn't want to fully enter into any religious debate. That part of the book I really enjoyed. However. since this book is titled 'The Bonobo and the Atheist', I will make a few comments.I will say that I enjoyed reading about Veneer theory. Unfortunately, I am not so sure that I agree with Frans de Waal's notion that this theory is no longer valid with the overwhelming evidence of innate altruism. Perhaps I'm a skeptic but I still feel that people do in fact weigh up the possible benefits of their actions and not just in business and with acquaintances but also with family and friends; which is not what he believes. He believes we are altruistic with those closest to us and that is not always the case. What I will say is that I don't argue that there is something innate within us that gives us our moral compass but one could argue that it is a higher being that gives us that moral compass in the first place. Nonetheless, what I do respect is that at no point does he belittle other religions or in fact hail atheism as the one true faith. I respect that he is not a militant atheist like Dawkins. He even mentions that for him - when considering that it was wrongly believed Darwin agreed with 'the expulsion of morality from the natural domain'-""the height of absurdity was reached when Dawkins explicitly disavowed Darwin, telling an interviewer in 1997 that 'in our political and social life we are entitled to throw out Darwinism.'"" He doesn't appreciate Dawkin's ability to be so dismissive of other beliefs.This is a good read but, as mentioned in some other reviews that I've read, I also feel that Frans de Waal is mixing two ideas that needn't be discussed together. When he does discuss some points, I often feel like saying, 'just get to the point'. He spends over a page using various works of art to comment on how we react to them and how it shows our bodily empathy.It felt like he introduced this list of art to fill a few pages. There can often be much speculation based on what he observes in the bonobos and humans themselves. There are often times when I feel he speculates too much. Though I will say that I was pleased to hear another one of his many examples that'humans most prone to yawn contagion also have the most empathy'. That is pleasing to know since simply reading the word yawn sets me off :).I have enjoyed reading this book but when he stated 'My first book on this topic, Good Natured (1996), barely mentioned religion' I almost wish I had read that instead."
191,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196037-jrobertus,5,"De Waal is a primatologist with a philosophical bent. I have read several of his books; they are not only interesting but important. He shows from his experimental work the basis for morality in our simian ancestors. They have empathy and an innate sense of fairness, required for communal living an hunting, that sets the basis for a moral code. (His experiments showing a sense of fairness in monkeys is fmous and the subject of a terrific TED tak). Region, or other social institutions, build on this inherent bent. De Waal describes morality as bottom up and not top down. Although he is atheist himself, he takes issue with the “neo atheists” like Hitchins and Dawkins who are aggressive in attacking religion. He urges tolerance and open mindedness and to not be as dogmatic as relious fundamentalists. He feels religion plays an important role in the social structure of close knit groups, it is robust (whereas science is new, difficult, “unnatural” and therefore fragile in an all out battle with religion). He feels northern Europe is carrying out a large scale gradual experiment in secularism. Can education and the state take over the amalgamating role of relion and make a strong, moral society without religion? We'll see eventually. Certainty efforts to remove religion by force, like the communists and Khmer rouge, have been horrible failures, worse than the superstition and dogmatism they wanted to replace. The animal work, an observations of behaviour, that De Waal uses to support his arguments are interesting in their own right. This is a most worthwhile read for its science and for the way science can inform philosophy and politics.De Waal is a hero of mine; he is an imaginative scientist, and a mature reviewer of the biological basis of empathy, altruism, and morality. In this book he continues his eye-opening work on the behavior of primates, especially our nearest relatives, the chimps and bonobos. His careful monitoring of their behavior in laboratories and in the wild, points out the ancient foundation of moral behavior among animals living in interdependent societies. In this book he also addresses the ongoing debate between religion, particularly fundamentalists, and science. Although he is an atheist he sees the value in religious practice and bonding, if not in the dogma. He takes aim at the “new atheists”, like Hitchens and Dawkins, and chides them for a combative and often insulting tone that does not help bridge the social gap. The tone of this book is so mature and thoughtful it is quite humbling. I wish I could be more like him."
192,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71935584-ben-zimmerman,3,"As a book about fascinating and well-told narratives about animal behavior and cognition, I would give this book a better rating (as I would rate many of Frans De Waal’s books). However, the purpose of this book seemed to be more about a reflection of religion and a bit of a criticism of the “new atheists”. I thought that the religious reflections weren’t very interesting and often wrong in the way that he characterized the views of both many atheists and many religious people. Some of his reflections and connections seemed disconnected and not well thought out. I would definitely recommend reading Frans de Waal, but maybe a different book. "
193,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10397934-erich,3,"Somewhat meandering in its approach, this book does make some convincing and enlightening arguments that I am happy to ponder. Frans de Waal's obvious expertise in primate prosocial behavior gives him an excellent vantage point to show that morality certainly evolved well before any religious institutions were established, especially as we know them today. The anecdotes are enticing and revealing, and really make the thesis very compelling. Primatology sounds even more fascinating when we see ourselves so vividly reflected in his vignettes. Some of the digressions into how we are to deal with morality and religion in the face of scientific progress are less persuasive. I did not find de Waal's writing to be particularly cohesive or share the logical argumentative power of a Dawkins or Hitchens. Towards the end of the book I finally began to grasp his viewpoint, and mostly embraced it, but there was no feeling of real enlightenment. I think the book overall, and some of its arguments, could have been better organized. The book did serve a good counterpoint to what de Waal calls ""neo-Atheists"" such as Sam Harris, Dawkins, and Hitchens (well, ""Marxist"" for him), though I happen to love these authors. If you are looking for that, it has its moments. I have to admit that I had problems with de Waal's recommendation to give modern religion so much leeway and to dispense with the heated ""anti-religious"" rhetoric of those mentioned above. While humans may be naturally predisposed to accepting religion as a form of social normalizing (which I agree has had its place in our civilizing process), this doesn't mean it we should accept it as necessary today. Its stranglehold on truth in the face of scientific evidence does nothing to enforce our common morality. If anything, it holds us back from truly understanding our place in the universe and extending a moral code to everyone. I see a need for more strong voices opposed to this willful ignorance and dogma, not fewer. All in all, a good read with some nice points. And bonobos!"
194,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13928228-sortal,1,"Muddy thinking, misrepresentation (or ignorance?) of atheist arguments, and lots of irrelevant passages on Hieronymus Bosch. I've really enjoyed other books by Frans de Waal, but this is an unsuccessful departure from his areas of expertise. Insofar as I can figure out what de Waal is arguing for, I agree with most of his premises: 1. Moral conduct exists on a continuum, including the behaviours of other animals.2. Dogmatism is terrible and should be avoided. 3. Religion is superfluous to morality. 4. Hardline atheism is unlikely to persuade the devoutly religious to give up their faith.But then things go wrong. 5. De Waal never addresses whether religion is inherently dogmatic. (Insofar as it's faith-based, where faith is belief without evidence, it certainly seems that way.) 6. De Waal never addresses the harm done by religion (a crucial point made by the thinkers he so blithely dismisses, such as Dawkins and Harris). 7. De Waal claims (without any supporting argument) that religion will always exist.If you replaced the passages on Bosch with a fair representation of the atheists de Waal is arguing against, you'd have a wonderful book. Better still would be a book using de Waal's research to build on the project of Harris' Moral Landscape, helping to create an alternative to religion (the logical next step from premises 2-4 once you accept 5 and 6 and dismiss 7). Instead, you get an infuriatingly murky read of jumbled ideas with just enough interesting anecdotes about primates to keep you reading through the rambling about Bosch.   "
195,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"The book really should have been titled ""The Bonobo and Human Empathy"". The two pillars of all philosophy are empathy and reciprocity. He completely examines the first pillar, empathy, by illustrating empathetic behavior in Bonobos (and other animals) and linking it to our behavior.He's such a good writer even when he wrote about things I completely disagreed with I would find the book thought provoking. I thought he trivialized the arguments of Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens and John Stuart Mill. But, I'm not bothered. I believe what I believe and I appreciated the different perspective.The narrator did a perfect job.The book is much better than most pop science books I have listened to and I'm much richer for having listened to this highly entertaining book and can definitely say because of this book I'm much closer to my goal of understanding our place in the universe. He does talk about philosophy but I enjoyed those parts as much as I did about bonobos.(P.S. Matt Ridley's book, ""The Rational Optimist"", fully covers the second pillar of human philosophy, reciprocity. Also, my personal take on the author he seemed like an apologetic atheist and he didn't want to offend anyone. But as I say, I wasn't bothered by this, but I disagreed with him regarding those sections. Also, he seemed to characterized the utilitarianism of John Stuart Mill in a comic book fashion. Once again I wasn't bothered but I don't want to leave the impression that I agreed with him on those two points)."
196,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51675760-mark-james,3,"I really enjoyed learning about the idiosyncrasies of many of the primates, as well as having a better sense of the differences between bonobos and chimps. Choosing Bosch's ""The Garden of Earthly Delights"" as a focal point was interesting on de Waal's part. I couldn't help but feel the book could have been better organized, as the topic shifts from bonobos to religion to morality to art without any obvious structure. Finally, there were several points made about atheism that don't hold up to scrutiny. For instance, he writes, ""Everything humans have accomplished anywhere - from architecture to music, from art to science - developed hand in hand with religion, never separately."" Do you mean, de Waal, that religion has existed at the same time that these wonderful things were created, or that all people who created these things were religious? Certainly neither is true. In fact, most examples of human achievement come in spite of religion, not because of it.Elsewhere, de Waal faults Christopher Hitchens for shifting loyalties several times before landing on an antitheist stance. To me, this only means that Hitchens was tireless in his pursuit of truth.I detected countless other examples of unfair judgments, but overall, the author tends to take the safe middle ground when failing to acknowledge that anything we can do without belief in the supernatural, we can do without it, and then some."
197,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3050574-a-b-gayle,3,"Humanism and the BonoboI struggled to get through this book while I was totally immersed in another of his, questioning whether humans were smart enough to understand animals. I think part of my alienation arose because of his obsession with Heironymous Bosch’s art. (I thought he was an LAPD detective, lol!)Basically, I totally agree with the main premise of this book. Best summed up in the final chapter.Thank God, if I may, we share with other primates a background as group animals, which makes us value social connections. Absent this background, religion could be preaching about virtue and vice until it became blue in the face, we’d never get its point. We are receptive only because of our evolved grasp of the value of relationships, the benefits of cooperation, the need for trust and honesty, and so on. Even our sense of fairness derives from this background.In other words, we are receptive to religion (some might say vulnerable) simply because we like other mammals have empathy and value relationships, the benefits of cooperation, the need for trust and honesty, and so on. Even our sense of fairness derives from this background. But just because something is possible doesn’t mean it is necessary.Throughout the preceding chapters, he has shown different ways this morality manifests itself within the animal kingdom. He refutes the notion that if it weren’t for religion, humans would be no better than animals. In fact he states Morality arose first, and modern religion latched onto it. Instead of giving us the moral law, the large religions were invented to bolster it. We are only just beginning to explore how religion does so by binding people together and enforcing good behavior. It is far from my intention to minimize this role, which was vital in the past and may remain so in the foreseeable future, but the wellspring of morality it is not.In fact he sees the evolutionary development of this bottom up morality that has allowed us to develop to where we are today.So why not give this a higher rating?Firstly, the continual referral to the Bosch painting “The Garden” which seemed a stretch at times to illustrate a point he was making. We can no more know why Bosch painted it the way he did than know what Bonobos are actually thinking.Sure, studying them in the wild and conducting experiments can demonstrate that they have recognisable emotions, but in one section he has Bonobos thinking about what atheists would be thinking. So that was my second star off.The third star off is for his dodgy logic in many sections. Take for example his dismissal of the Golden Rule of Christianity (Do unto others as you would have them do unto you).To give a rather crude example, if at a conference I follow an attractive woman whom I barely know to her hotel room and jump into her bed uninvited, I can pretty well guess how she’d react. If I explain that I am just doing to her what I would love her to do to me, I’m afraid my appeal to the golden rule won’t fly. Or, let’s assume that I knowingly serve pork sausages to a vegan. Liking meat myself, I am just following the golden rule, but the vegan will consider my behavior obnoxious, perhaps even immoral.In both cases he has only looked at the physical side of the equation, not the effects of those acts. Would he like someone to rape him or insult his beliefs? You can’t divorce the act from the motive or consequence of the act. If all three are taken into account, the Golden Rule still applies.Chapter 7 particularly had some lazy logic. Whereas in previous chapters I’d been highlighting very well presented arguments, this one is full of my exasperation at the arguments used to justify the need for religion in society. Take this one for example.We humans were plenty moral when we still roamed the savanna in small bands. Only when the scale of society began to grow and rules of reciprocity and reputation began to falter did a moralizing God become necessary.But perhaps the “necessity” for this moralising God and his acolytes comes about because the chances of having a psychopath or control freak who wants this power (in the form of a controlling religion) has increased because of the larger population? He had already acknowledged that personalities varied within animal groups, so the ‘need’ for religion could just as easily be attributed to statistics producing people who wanted power for power’s sake.Interestingly when you look at early Greek and Roman religion, the gods just existed. They were used to explain the unexplainable. It was only later that the gods started telling people how to behave. I’m pretty sure the population of Ancient Greeks and Romans was not insignificant.But let’s look at another lazy analogy The whole purpose of God is to do the latter (loving moral actions). We endowed him with the capacity to keep us on the same straight and narrow that we’d been following ever since we lived in small bands.How different is this from the concept of Santa Claus being used to make children behave? Adults understand that rewards that are achievable are the best ways to control children. Likewise those who perceive the need to control large numbers of adults do so by playing up to the fears that adults have (as evidenced previously in this chapter) - a fear of death and hence the need for an afterlife.While I can see his point that a focusing deity that encourages people to be good is not bad, but the dogma that accompanies it and the divisions this creates makes me question whether this need could be better met in other ways or at least recognised for what is really happening. Perhaps the need is more that many individuals are not going to take orders from one of their own, but prefer that order to come from some unquestionably alpha figure.So my final verdict? Animals follow their own form of moral code developed in response to the betterment of their community. While some humans are still capable of doing this, others through laziness, unwillingness to kowtow to one of their own issuing instructions or fear of their mortality need some sort of mystical religion to guide their actions. I added another star back in because he made a good case for respecting that animals at times are better socialised than many humans."
198,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5889085-h-wesselius,4,"The title is somewhat misleading. De Waal is not writing a tight coherent account of morality and humanism among the primates. He is instead writing meandering thought provoking but far more personal account of humanism and science. His constant reference to the Bosch painting which he uses as a metaphor is an irritant. From this and his forays into philosophical discussions on the nature of God and morality, its obvious he's writing more of a personal discussion which he's entitled to after years of work. One of the frequent arguments for the existence of God is the cited need for moral law. Its the existence of God and his instruction to man that sets us apart, apparently. De Waal successful challenges that assumption citing evidence of moral behavior in not only primates but in other larger social animals such as dolphins and elephants. From this he proposes that morality is derived from the social nature of animals and has an bottoms up origins as opposed to the top down model proposed by various religions. Pulling it all together, he makes a compelling argument that morality is the basis for religion and a belief in God and not the other way around. An excellent read with a good and interesting argument. "
199,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/119364-melee-farr,3,"The premise of the book was right up my alley - examining the roots of morality (and ultimately religion) from a larger mammalian perspective. And I think it was effective on that front. de Waal is a primatologist, first and foremost, and there were countless examples from his and others' research, observations, and publications of moral behavior existing consistently in the animal world, with sound evolutionary reasoning for pro-social behaviors being retained throughout mammalian phylogeny. I flew through the first half of the book. He uses Bosch's triptych painting ""Garden of Earthly Delights"" as a recurring metaphor throughout the book, and honestly, he lost me with it. I mean, I understood the metaphor, but, to use another, it was kind of beating a dead horse. This may reveal the fact that I'm not particularly well-versed in the visual arts. He also is rather dismissive of atheism as often aggressive and exclusionary, and permissive of religion because he sees it as inevitable and having some consistently positive societal traits. Both points are well-made, but may whitewash the good done by skepticism and the evil done by dogmatism. But that perspective may also just reveal my bias. "
200,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6664778-andrea,3,"Tracing the beginning of morality may be as close as our fellow primates the Bonobos, as de Waal explains in this book. I am interested in the topic of the origins of morality and the book has a flow that kept me reading. I do think de Waal has a little Richard Dawkins envy though. Richard Dawkins is simply a better writer. This author makes the point that although morality predates religion there is no point in egging on the religious majority by calling such religious beliefs delusional, which in fact Dawkins does. I agree it is pointless and may be even counter productive however I feel the author fails to give due the bias that atheists face, bias that denies us jobs, social status and even basic human rights. Try getting into high political positions as an outed atheist. Frans does a disservice to human rights when he says that there is no reason to state an atheist agenda, and I agree, but what about a human agenda? Frans doesn't take the biases seriously enough. This being said the book is worth a read to remind us of our roots, to connect with fellow primates and to learn more about the origins of morality."
201,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5318025-nina,3,"Frans de Waal's research is impressive, and I found his insights into primate behaviors, including those of humans, very interesting. However, if the purpose of his study had to do with religion and morality, then he failed to connect the two sides of the book (primatology and religion). By the time I finished the book, my big questions were, What does religion have to do with this study? and What does Bosch have to do with primatology? Personal admiration for the painter does not constitute expertise, and while interesting, the bursts of art history did not in any way advance de Waal's argument, especially because they did not rely on art history so much as on the author's personal responses to The Garden of Earthly Delights. Sadly, de Waal does not really understand atheists either, neither old-school nor the ones he refers to as ""neo-atheists."" Personal opinions rather than data dominate this book, and opinions do not prove very much. The lack of hard evidence for the arguments on morality is only part of the problem, though. The author's attempts at wit are offensive to many readers, and together with speculation rather than evidence hurt the book's message. "
202,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11200007-douglas-cosby,1,"1.5 stars (the extra half point is for the narrator): Not my bag. I read the first third of this book, but couldn't get any further. Franz de Waal's point is simple: morality is a result of evolution, not imposed by religion or ""invented"" by humans. A very good point, and I sympathize with de Waal's frustration with biologists/scientists that fall prey to the rampant anthropomorphism we humans tend to overlay on the way we see other animals. He uses a few scientific studies, but mainly just anecdotes and cute stories, to justify his position, and this book feels more like a feel-good article in O magazine than something that would be in Scientific American or Nature. Additionally, while de Waal harshly criticizes recent atheist authors, it doesn't seem like he has really read them. For instance, his criticism of Sam Harris's The Moral Landscape, seems like it came from the back-of-the-book summary, not the actual details of the book. If you are in the mood for a bunch of touching ape stories, then this book might be for you. If you are looking for a book on the scientific basis of prehuman morality supported by scientific evidence and logical conclusions, look elsewhere."
203,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5078550-robert-bor,4,"I got this book from my friends, who appreciate my interest in evolution, politics and society. Frans de Waal weaves two different threads in this book. On the one hand, he proceeds to show clearly how animals (the Bonobo primate in particular) have an extremely good sense of moralistic behavior. This undermines the argument that moralistic behavior is one of the primary consequences of religion. No, not just undermines, evaporates. This is where he weaves in the other thread, where he distances himself from the Atheist camp (Dawkins et al) and states that religion should not just be abandoned if we cannot replace it with something else. He understands the need of humans for spirituality and does not just wish this away. In the dual aspect, a bit of a weird combination, but understandable, since being seen in the Atheist camp, pretty much shuts you out from dialogue with the religious one. Is Mr de Waal aiming for a diplomatic role in bringing the two camps closer together? On another note, if you like the work of Hiëronymus Bosch, know that it features prominently in this book."
204,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7349461-cody,3,"This book had its ups and downs. de Waal's argument for morality emerging from bottom-up processes is convincing, and I really enjoyed when he would dive into the details of primate research, as well his many anecdotes. This alone makes the book worth reading. I do, however, think he was quite off the mark with his criticism of the ""neo-Atheists"" (i.e., the New Atheists). On top of the misguided attacks (A.C. Grayling addresses some of these in a review in Prospect Magazine http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/mag...), at times he comes across as patronizing. He stresses the need for religion to help secure ethics among the masses (at least at present), while apparently considering himself fully capable of living morally without religion. That said, I think the book drives home some good points (especially in the final chapters), and will get both believers and non-believers thinking about some of these issues."
205,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8076824-geoff,3,"I have a soft spot for primates, and books on morality are catching my attention at the moment so I thought I would have enjoyed this book more than I did. I also recently read The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt, so I can't help but compare the two. While I did enjoy this book more than The Righteous Mind, I still gave both books three stars. Frans de Waal's writing style is much more enjoyable and conversational than Haidt's. However, there seemed to be less science involved in this book. I know there are countless endnotes and references at the back of the book, but somehow the observations came across as purely anecdotal. While I agree with de Waal's bottom up approach to morality, rather than from top down, I didn't find that the strength of his arguments would convince anyone who don't already believe as he does."
206,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6323134-darcey,3,"I found this an interesting read, though perhaps one with more extraneous information than I wanted. I enjoyed de Waal's anecdotes and commentary about Bosch and how that was related to humanity, symbolism, and the growth of ideas - however, there was more of it than necessary (including recounting experiences of being at the Prado in Madrid). The linkage between the fact that primates (and other animals) exhibit traits which we as humans consider ""moral"" - and that animals do not follow religion - is clear, leaving us with no way to avoid the conclusion de Waal sets out to prove: morality is not something encoded purely by religion, and those who believe that without religion humans will descend to immoral madness have a significant amount of evidence to overcome to prove their position. "
207,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5777523-jami,4,"This was a well researched, informative book. I was not familiar with Frans de Waal's work before this book, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I thought there would be more focus on the Bonobo anecdotes, but there were enough to keep me entertained and interested. This book looks at the issue of what the source of morality and other behaviors is; it combines many areas of study, including religion, philosophy, science, sociology, psychology, and history. While parts of the book dragged a little, overall it was well done. There were some parts of the book that fascinated me and that I had never considered before, such as the yawn response in relation to empathy; I also particularly enjoyed the passages about specific behaviors usually only attributed to humans that are found in bonobos and other species. The narration was very good and easy to listen to."
208,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/906313-diane,3,"This was a surprisingly interesting argument on the origin of morality. In a spiritual context, morality is something that is imposed by God with commandments and injunctions, etc. deWaal, however, draws from his many years as a primatologist to suggest that morality is an internal motivator, something that is inherent within us and those species most closely related to us. The bonobo is his primary example of a primate that clearly demonstrates moral qualities such as empathy. I found it very interesting to listen to, but kind of disorganized. And since de Waal frequently mentions the Hieronymus Bosch painting, ""Garden of Earthly Delight,"" I wished I had that image on hand. Nevertheless, I enjoyed de Waal's ideas and his intelligent presentation."
209,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/746637-sally,4,"A thoughtful consideration of the origins of morality in humanity's evolutionary past. The author's work with primates, and less frequently with other social mammals, provides convincing evidence for a continuity of development of consciousness and empathetic/moral behavior between humankind and other animals. It successfully combats the idea that humans and other social animals are at the core selfish, with altruism as a thin, self-serving veneer; that without top-down religious mandates, such as the 10 commandments, people would live in a nightmare Hobbesian world; and that ""selfish gene"" theories are a adequate way of understanding and interpreting an organism's behavior and motivations. An enjoyable read."
210,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41590197-yani,5,A refreshing book which discusses morality from a perspective I had bever heard before. It gives a neat alternative which I think is indeed much more plausible and not as polarised as apparently everything is nowadays. It is written in a compelling style and Frans de Waal clearly explains his arguments and conclisions.
211,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33852158-halli-lauren,3,"I read and enjoyed De Waal’s “Are we smart enough to know how smart animals are”, so when I saw this book was written by him, I was pretty intrigued! As a baby atheist myself, and someone who is interested in studying bonobos, this seemed like the perfect book for me. Unfortunately, De Waal spent way more time talking about chimpanzees than bonobos. He also spent way more time talking about Heironymus Bosch than was necessary. What was the point of that?? I was pretty on board with the author’s broader points about religion:1. Trying to “convert people to atheism” is a waste of energy 2. Religion isn’t going away any time soon, and if it did, we’d need to find something to replace it because of all the important things it does for us as humans (ie: community building)But here are my qualms:1. Why did he spend so much time condemning Neo-Atheists and so little time condemning the abuse and manipulation in so many religions? Toward the beginning, De Waal pointed out that he came from a much more casual religious background, so leaving his religion wasn’t as big of a deal. But the thing is, so many religions are extremely dogmatic which can lead to much more harm than good. De Waal definitely condemned dogmatism, which I agree with, but he didn’t seem to realize how inescapable dogmatism can be. Maybe that’s just my point of view coming from a high demand, very dogmatic religion. 2. So yeah, religion is important and isn’t going away any time soon. Then what should atheists do? De Waal spent so much time saying how important religion is, and even though he is an atheist himself, he didn’t share any of his ideas of how to get the benefits of religion elsewhere. I guess that’s what I wanted out of the book, and I didn’t get it. Then of course there’s the main subject matter of the book: the evolution of morality and altruism. This was all well and good, but while reading I didn’t have any “Aha!” moments- nothing felt very fresh to me. Overall a disappointing read. Not good, not bad. Just meh. Oh also I’m just sick of reading books by old white men… if anyone has recommendations of nonfiction science books by women or people of color?? Definitely would love to hear those."
212,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15812925-adrian-undrea,4,"Frans de Waal is probably best known for his appearances on TED Talks. Having seen his presentations on animal morality I have to admit I have started reading his book being biased. I consider myself an atheist and somehow I had been looking at this book to reinforce this view. But The Bonobo and the Atheist shouldn't be read for that as Frans de Waal looks to explore the origins of morality and debunk the myth, so deeply ingrained in most of us, that morality is the trademark of humanity. And while sometimes it jumps too fast from one idea to the other, reading The Bonobo and the Atheist with an open mind might change the way you view morality. Far from being a hallmark of mankind, morality is a product of evolution, shaping the interactions of all social animals. By the use of countless experiments Frans de Waal argues morality is a mere tool of the highly evolved animals that makes living in groups possible. It is one more nail in the coffin of the idea that somehow we are special from the rest of the biological world. And while Frans de Waal thinks letting go of religion might not be possible for humanity, he favors the optimistic idea that our moral compass is an inner one (a bottom-up approach) instead of having its origins in religion (a top-down view)."
213,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18494756-olivia,5,"This is probably the second book I've read this year that I think everyone should read. (The other was SO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT RACE by Ijeoma Oluo.)A fascinating look into the moral universe of our closest genetic relatives, and an examination of the ought vs is of their world without religion (as we would recognize it. Frans de Waal is a very engaging writer, and considerably more knowledgeable about the topic than the most well-intended science reporter. (I've read some non fiction by people who write layman's overviews of science topics by interviewing researchers, and they also serve a purpose, but this book combines a depth of understanding of the topic with an engaging readability that is sometimes lacking in non fiction written by academics.

214,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13162061-amirography,3,"Hmmm. It is hard to give a review for this book. It is full of great arguements against conventional thinking. and deWaal is certainly well read about science and morality. But he is mostly driven by arguing against skeptics (skeptics of animal-cognition, not in general) so he is great at giving counter examples. But he is not that great at proposing new ideas. So I might be wrong. Basically, from what I understood, bottom-up morality is descriptive to prescriptive morality with emphasis on socially enforced ones. I might be wrong because he was not that clear -to me- about it. Which is, underwhelming. Both because intuitive morality is at the end a prescriptive morality, however he wants to say that they are not that different. The arguments against different schools of normative thinking was also weak because from a utilitarian point of view, he was arguing a straw-man, as a utilitarian (like me) wouldn't exactly argue as he did in the place of a utilitarian. Though I have to say, it may have been not because if an intentional effort, but because he probably did not check his argument with a utilitarian. Overall, I don't think this book-essay was a ""great-read"" type, but it is certainly better than reading a fiction in search of meaning."

If there is a short-coming here, it is that the balance between these elements will be a little unsatisfactory for anyone who is mainly interested in the science. Compared to Frans de Waal's Primates and Philosophers—which features commentary from Robert Wright, Christine Korsgaard, Philip Kitcher and Peter Singer—The Bonobo and the Atheist also lacks the clarity that comes from having de Waal's most ambitious ideas reigned in by more cautious thinkers."

217,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15731711-samantha,4,"I am totally on the fence when it comes to Frans de Waal. Sometimes I find myself underlining sentences in this book in agreement, and other times I find myself scribbling frustrated notes of disagreement in the side margins. For example, on page 184 de Waal practically ridicules Peter Singer for not taking his view that we should have ""special loyalty"" to our own species while excluding other species from our moral equations. He basically argues that we should determine our morals (in some cases) based on loyalty to our own group - in this case, our own species. It's terribly reminiscent of people from history who argued the same way - substituting ""species"" for ""race"" or ""sex"". I assume that some time in the future, people will read this and think ""Wow, de Waal was a good primatologist, it's a shame he was such a speciesist"" as we now say about 18th and 19th century writers. In the margins on page 184 I wrote ""But sometimes fierce loyalty to one's own group is immoral - it would be immoral for me to say a black person is not equal to a white person merely out of loyalty to my own race."" This morality based on loyalty to one's own group is rather small-minded, if you ask me.Another rather bad part of de Waal's book was on page 204, where he writes, ""Neo-atheists are like people standing outside a movie theater telling us that Leonardo DiCaprio didn't really go down with the Titanic. How shocking! Mostly of us are perfectly comfortable with the duality."" The flaw in his argument is this: no one ridicules Titanic watchers because no Titanic watcher actually believes that Leo went down with the famous ship. But atheists ridicule theists because they ACTUALLY believe ridiculous things like wine turning into blood or demons in the form of talking snakes tempting people to eat some fruit. He argues that atheists who criticize religion are advocating the elimination of imagination. But the key difference between people with active imaginations and theists is that imaginative people ultimately recognize that their fantasies aren't part of reality. Theists make no such recognition; they actually believe, metaphorically, that Leonardo DiCaprio was on the Titanic. Or anything else equally absurd. This is why they are ridiculed and the imagination is not. Imagination is beautiful and beneficial in many ways. I'm a fiction writer, I have a very deep appreciation of imagination, but I recognize it as just that - imagination. Unlike imagination, I consider most religious claims ridiculously illogical because the theist seriously believes in these fantasies. I would have not the slightest problem with religion if this was not the case (but then it wouldn't really be religion, would it?). The weakness in de Waal's analogy (criticizing theists to criticizing moviegoers) is so obvious that I can't help thinking de Waal might not completely understand religion or what it means to condemn it.There are other ways in which I strongly disagreed with de Waal, particularly when he talked about religion (I write in a margin, ""Can we go back to the apes now?"") but overall I tended to agree with what he said. It was a good book and I learned a lot from it about chimps and bonobos. The parts about the apes were very interesting, but the parts where de Waal starts talking religion and philosophy were out of touch with how I feel about those matters. Overall, it was a good book and worth reading for anyone interested in the origins of morality."
218,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9716384-vivify-m,5,"I very much enjoyed this book. Primatology enthralls me - learning about our primate cousins, and how researchers work with them is a joy. But, the resulting insights into our own psychology, is the highlight. I also, enjoyed understanding how the experiments were constructed and the challenges the researchers faced.On the downside, I was put off by the authors attitude towards other disciplines. I found his criticism of biologists unnecessary, in particular his misrepresentation of geneticists as calling prosocial behaviour a mistake. I’m no expert, but I also questioned his representation of evolution. At times I thought he was confusing selfish genes with selfish individuals. Possibly, the most significant contribution of the book, is the idea that key to our salvation is in understanding our natural selves. I love this sentiment, but I also get nervous of overly naturalistic thinking, and I’m not convinced by the arguments against utilitarianism. Ultimately, this was a deeply thought provoking and enjoyable book."
219,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57079482-chuck-kollars,4,"The author has kept and done research with Chimpanzees and Bonobos (formerly known as Pygmy Chimps) for decades, is top of his field, and has written many books. The main theme of this book is an observation and bit of reasoning. The observation is that our animal relatives routinely display a fairly strong sense of morality (focused on maintaining good relations within the group). The obvious reasoning from this is that our current morality -often embedded in ""religion""- comes not from anything external like religion but rather from something internal that predates religion. He makes this case pretty strongly, but without placing it in a larger hypothetical framework. The book mentions, but doesn't even try to answer larger questions such as how did our morality come to be deposited in religion?, how does a morality focused on good group relations work with much larger groups (tribe, nation, globe, etc.)?, how much can we deviate from our unthinking inborn sense of morality before everything falls apart?, and how will we know when we don't need religion at all any more?He does several other things in this same book: He responds to the ""four horsemen of atheism"" that made such a splash a few years ago. He presents many interesting anecdotes from his subjects, some of which are closely tied to a sense of morality and some that illustrate more intelligence/forethought/non-aggression than we typically credit our close relative animals with. And he tries his hand at an explication of the painting ""The Garden"" by ""Heironymus Bosch"". He draws some interesting parallels between these topics, but in my opinion not enough, so the book seems less focused than it could be. There are indeed connections between these strands (even though they're not as strong as I'd like). For example, the author thinks the ""four horsemen of atheism"" give too much credit to religion in accusing it of being the root of horrible wars and genocides. Such abominable behavior is also displayed by chimps in certain circumstances. Humans must have gotten it from the same place, and our common ancestor predates religion. Also, chimp society is clearly uninfluenced by any human religion ...or any religion at all. So for the wars and genocides, despite its claims, religion was really more ""cover story"" than ""cause"". In a way the whole book is a plea for humble moderation rather than conspicuous ideology. We're asked to actually look at the evidence in front of our faces and to not completely throw out religion until we understand it a little better and so forth. This is his critique of the atheists too: most scientists are rather dubious about religion, but why is it so important to you that other people think exactly the same way you do? He describes the seemingly contradictory combination of a lackluster subject with passionate advocacy as ""sleeping furiously""."
220,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12402305-hanan-elsharif,3,"In her 1985 book Sex and Friendship in Baboons, Barbara Smuts was the first to apply the term “friendship” to animals,ha ha. her name is Smuts. um. Back to some serious reading nowIn all honesty, I chose to read this book to learn about Bonobos and didn't want to fully enter into any religious debate. That part of the book I really enjoyed. However. since this book is titled 'The Bonobo and the Atheist', I will make a few comments.I will say that I enjoyed reading about Veneer theory. Unfortunately, I am not so sure that I agree with Frans de Waal's notion that this theory is no longer valid with the overwhelming evidence of innate altruism. Perhaps I'm a skeptic but I still feel that people do in fact weigh up the possible benefits of their actions and not just in business and with acquaintances but also with family and friends; which is not what he believes. He believes we are altruistic with those closest to us and that is not always the case. What I will say is that I don't argue that there is something innate within us that gives us our moral compass but one could argue that it is a higher being that gives us that moral compass in the first place. Nonetheless, what I do respect is that at no point does he belittle other religions or in fact hail atheism as the one true faith. I respect that he is not a militant atheist like Dawkins. He even mentions that for him - when considering that it was wrongly believed Darwin agreed with 'the expulsion of morality from the natural domain'-""the height of absurdity was reached when Dawkins explicitly disavowed Darwin, telling an interviewer in 1997 that 'in our political and social life we are entitled to throw out Darwinism.'"" He doesn't appreciate Dawkin's ability to be so dismissive of other beliefs.This is a good read but, as mentioned in some other reviews that I've read, I also feel that Frans de Waal is mixing two ideas that needn't be discussed together. When he does discuss some points, I often feel like saying, 'just get to the point'. He spends over a page using various works of art to comment on how we react to them and how it shows our bodily empathy.It felt like he introduced this list of art to fill a few pages. There can often be much speculation based on what he observes in the bonobos and humans themselves. There are often times when I feel he speculates too much. Though I will say that I was pleased to hear another one of his many examples that'humans most prone to yawn contagion also have the most empathy'. That is pleasing to know since simply reading the word yawn sets me off :).I have enjoyed reading this book but when he stated 'My first book on this topic, Good Natured (1996), barely mentioned religion' I almost wish I had read that instead."
221,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196037-jrobertus,5,"De Waal is a primatologist with a philosophical bent. I have read several of his books; they are not only interesting but important. He shows from his experimental work the basis for morality in our simian ancestors. They have empathy and an innate sense of fairness, required for communal living an hunting, that sets the basis for a moral code. (His experiments showing a sense of fairness in monkeys is fmous and the subject of a terrific TED tak). Region, or other social institutions, build on this inherent bent. De Waal describes morality as bottom up and not top down. Although he is atheist himself, he takes issue with the “neo atheists” like Hitchins and Dawkins who are aggressive in attacking religion. He urges tolerance and open mindedness and to not be as dogmatic as relious fundamentalists. He feels religion plays an important role in the social structure of close knit groups, it is robust (whereas science is new, difficult, “unnatural” and therefore fragile in an all out battle with religion). He feels northern Europe is carrying out a large scale gradual experiment in secularism. Can education and the state take over the amalgamating role of relion and make a strong, moral society without religion? We'll see eventually. Certainty efforts to remove religion by force, like the communists and Khmer rouge, have been horrible failures, worse than the superstition and dogmatism they wanted to replace. The animal work, an observations of behaviour, that De Waal uses to support his arguments are interesting in their own right. This is a most worthwhile read for its science and for the way science can inform philosophy and politics.De Waal is a hero of mine; he is an imaginative scientist, and a mature reviewer of the biological basis of empathy, altruism, and morality. In this book he continues his eye-opening work on the behavior of primates, especially our nearest relatives, the chimps and bonobos. His careful monitoring of their behavior in laboratories and in the wild, points out the ancient foundation of moral behavior among animals living in interdependent societies. In this book he also addresses the ongoing debate between religion, particularly fundamentalists, and science. Although he is an atheist he sees the value in religious practice and bonding, if not in the dogma. He takes aim at the “new atheists”, like Hitchens and Dawkins, and chides them for a combative and often insulting tone that does not help bridge the social gap. The tone of this book is so mature and thoughtful it is quite humbling. I wish I could be more like him."
222,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71935584-ben-zimmerman,3,"As a book about fascinating and well-told narratives about animal behavior and cognition, I would give this book a better rating (as I would rate many of Frans De Waal’s books). However, the purpose of this book seemed to be more about a reflection of religion and a bit of a criticism of the “new atheists”. I thought that the religious reflections weren’t very interesting and often wrong in the way that he characterized the views of both many atheists and many religious people. Some of his reflections and connections seemed disconnected and not well thought out. I would definitely recommend reading Frans de Waal, but maybe a different book. "
223,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10397934-erich,3,"Somewhat meandering in its approach, this book does make some convincing and enlightening arguments that I am happy to ponder. Frans de Waal's obvious expertise in primate prosocial behavior gives him an excellent vantage point to show that morality certainly evolved well before any religious institutions were established, especially as we know them today. The anecdotes are enticing and revealing, and really make the thesis very compelling. Primatology sounds even more fascinating when we see ourselves so vividly reflected in his vignettes. Some of the digressions into how we are to deal with morality and religion in the face of scientific progress are less persuasive. I did not find de Waal's writing to be particularly cohesive or share the logical argumentative power of a Dawkins or Hitchens. Towards the end of the book I finally began to grasp his viewpoint, and mostly embraced it, but there was no feeling of real enlightenment. I think the book overall, and some of its arguments, could have been better organized. The book did serve a good counterpoint to what de Waal calls ""neo-Atheists"" such as Sam Harris, Dawkins, and Hitchens (well, ""Marxist"" for him), though I happen to love these authors. If you are looking for that, it has its moments. I have to admit that I had problems with de Waal's recommendation to give modern religion so much leeway and to dispense with the heated ""anti-religious"" rhetoric of those mentioned above. While humans may be naturally predisposed to accepting religion as a form of social normalizing (which I agree has had its place in our civilizing process), this doesn't mean it we should accept it as necessary today. Its stranglehold on truth in the face of scientific evidence does nothing to enforce our common morality. If anything, it holds us back from truly understanding our place in the universe and extending a moral code to everyone. I see a need for more strong voices opposed to this willful ignorance and dogma, not fewer. All in all, a good read with some nice points. And bonobos!"
224,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13928228-sortal,1,"Muddy thinking, misrepresentation (or ignorance?) of atheist arguments, and lots of irrelevant passages on Hieronymus Bosch. I've really enjoyed other books by Frans de Waal, but this is an unsuccessful departure from his areas of expertise. Insofar as I can figure out what de Waal is arguing for, I agree with most of his premises: 1. Moral conduct exists on a continuum, including the behaviours of other animals.2. Dogmatism is terrible and should be avoided. 3. Religion is superfluous to morality. 4. Hardline atheism is unlikely to persuade the devoutly religious to give up their faith.But then things go wrong. 5. De Waal never addresses whether religion is inherently dogmatic. (Insofar as it's faith-based, where faith is belief without evidence, it certainly seems that way.) 6. De Waal never addresses the harm done by religion (a crucial point made by the thinkers he so blithely dismisses, such as Dawkins and Harris). 7. De Waal claims (without any supporting argument) that religion will always exist.If you replaced the passages on Bosch with a fair representation of the atheists de Waal is arguing against, you'd have a wonderful book. Better still would be a book using de Waal's research to build on the project of Harris' Moral Landscape, helping to create an alternative to religion (the logical next step from premises 2-4 once you accept 5 and 6 and dismiss 7). Instead, you get an infuriatingly murky read of jumbled ideas with just enough interesting anecdotes about primates to keep you reading through the rambling about Bosch.   "
225,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"The book really should have been titled ""The Bonobo and Human Empathy"". The two pillars of all philosophy are empathy and reciprocity. He completely examines the first pillar, empathy, by illustrating empathetic behavior in Bonobos (and other animals) and linking it to our behavior.He's such a good writer even when he wrote about things I completely disagreed with I would find the book thought provoking. I thought he trivialized the arguments of Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens and John Stuart Mill. But, I'm not bothered. I believe what I believe and I appreciated the different perspective.The narrator did a perfect job.The book is much better than most pop science books I have listened to and I'm much richer for having listened to this highly entertaining book and can definitely say because of this book I'm much closer to my goal of understanding our place in the universe. He does talk about philosophy but I enjoyed those parts as much as I did about bonobos.(P.S. Matt Ridley's book, ""The Rational Optimist"", fully covers the second pillar of human philosophy, reciprocity. Also, my personal take on the author he seemed like an apologetic atheist and he didn't want to offend anyone. But as I say, I wasn't bothered by this, but I disagreed with him regarding those sections. Also, he seemed to characterized the utilitarianism of John Stuart Mill in a comic book fashion. Once again I wasn't bothered but I don't want to leave the impression that I agreed with him on those two points)."
226,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51675760-mark-james,3,"I really enjoyed learning about the idiosyncrasies of many of the primates, as well as having a better sense of the differences between bonobos and chimps. Choosing Bosch's ""The Garden of Earthly Delights"" as a focal point was interesting on de Waal's part. I couldn't help but feel the book could have been better organized, as the topic shifts from bonobos to religion to morality to art without any obvious structure. Finally, there were several points made about atheism that don't hold up to scrutiny. For instance, he writes, ""Everything humans have accomplished anywhere - from architecture to music, from art to science - developed hand in hand with religion, never separately."" Do you mean, de Waal, that religion has existed at the same time that these wonderful things were created, or that all people who created these things were religious? Certainly neither is true. In fact, most examples of human achievement come in spite of religion, not because of it.Elsewhere, de Waal faults Christopher Hitchens for shifting loyalties several times before landing on an antitheist stance. To me, this only means that Hitchens was tireless in his pursuit of truth.I detected countless other examples of unfair judgments, but overall, the author tends to take the safe middle ground when failing to acknowledge that anything we can do without belief in the supernatural, we can do without it, and then some."
227,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3050574-a-b-gayle,3,"Humanism and the BonoboI struggled to get through this book while I was totally immersed in another of his, questioning whether humans were smart enough to understand animals. I think part of my alienation arose because of his obsession with Heironymous Bosch’s art. (I thought he was an LAPD detective, lol!)Basically, I totally agree with the main premise of this book. Best summed up in the final chapter.Thank God, if I may, we share with other primates a background as group animals, which makes us value social connections. Absent this background, religion could be preaching about virtue and vice until it became blue in the face, we’d never get its point. We are receptive only because of our evolved grasp of the value of relationships, the benefits of cooperation, the need for trust and honesty, and so on. Even our sense of fairness derives from this background.In other words, we are receptive to religion (some might say vulnerable) simply because we like other mammals have empathy and value relationships, the benefits of cooperation, the need for trust and honesty, and so on. Even our sense of fairness derives from this background. But just because something is possible doesn’t mean it is necessary.Throughout the preceding chapters, he has shown different ways this morality manifests itself within the animal kingdom. He refutes the notion that if it weren’t for religion, humans would be no better than animals. In fact he states Morality arose first, and modern religion latched onto it. Instead of giving us the moral law, the large religions were invented to bolster it. We are only just beginning to explore how religion does so by binding people together and enforcing good behavior. It is far from my intention to minimize this role, which was vital in the past and may remain so in the foreseeable future, but the wellspring of morality it is not.In fact he sees the evolutionary development of this bottom up morality that has allowed us to develop to where we are today.So why not give this a higher rating?Firstly, the continual referral to the Bosch painting “The Garden” which seemed a stretch at times to illustrate a point he was making. We can no more know why Bosch painted it the way he did than know what Bonobos are actually thinking.Sure, studying them in the wild and conducting experiments can demonstrate that they have recognisable emotions, but in one section he has Bonobos thinking about what atheists would be thinking. So that was my second star off.The third star off is for his dodgy logic in many sections. Take for example his dismissal of the Golden Rule of Christianity (Do unto others as you would have them do unto you).To give a rather crude example, if at a conference I follow an attractive woman whom I barely know to her hotel room and jump into her bed uninvited, I can pretty well guess how she’d react. If I explain that I am just doing to her what I would love her to do to me, I’m afraid my appeal to the golden rule won’t fly. Or, let’s assume that I knowingly serve pork sausages to a vegan. Liking meat myself, I am just following the golden rule, but the vegan will consider my behavior obnoxious, perhaps even immoral.In both cases he has only looked at the physical side of the equation, not the effects of those acts. Would he like someone to rape him or insult his beliefs? You can’t divorce the act from the motive or consequence of the act. If all three are taken into account, the Golden Rule still applies.Chapter 7 particularly had some lazy logic. Whereas in previous chapters I’d been highlighting very well presented arguments, this one is full of my exasperation at the arguments used to justify the need for religion in society. Take this one for example.We humans were plenty moral when we still roamed the savanna in small bands. Only when the scale of society began to grow and rules of reciprocity and reputation began to falter did a moralizing God become necessary.But perhaps the “necessity” for this moralising God and his acolytes comes about because the chances of having a psychopath or control freak who wants this power (in the form of a controlling religion) has increased because of the larger population? He had already acknowledged that personalities varied within animal groups, so the ‘need’ for religion could just as easily be attributed to statistics producing people who wanted power for power’s sake.Interestingly when you look at early Greek and Roman religion, the gods just existed. They were used to explain the unexplainable. It was only later that the gods started telling people how to behave. I’m pretty sure the population of Ancient Greeks and Romans was not insignificant.But let’s look at another lazy analogy The whole purpose of God is to do the latter (loving moral actions). We endowed him with the capacity to keep us on the same straight and narrow that we’d been following ever since we lived in small bands.How different is this from the concept of Santa Claus being used to make children behave? Adults understand that rewards that are achievable are the best ways to control children. Likewise those who perceive the need to control large numbers of adults do so by playing up to the fears that adults have (as evidenced previously in this chapter) - a fear of death and hence the need for an afterlife.While I can see his point that a focusing deity that encourages people to be good is not bad, but the dogma that accompanies it and the divisions this creates makes me question whether this need could be better met in other ways or at least recognised for what is really happening. Perhaps the need is more that many individuals are not going to take orders from one of their own, but prefer that order to come from some unquestionably alpha figure.So my final verdict? Animals follow their own form of moral code developed in response to the betterment of their community. While some humans are still capable of doing this, others through laziness, unwillingness to kowtow to one of their own issuing instructions or fear of their mortality need some sort of mystical religion to guide their actions. I added another star back in because he made a good case for respecting that animals at times are better socialised than many humans."
228,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5889085-h-wesselius,4,"The title is somewhat misleading. De Waal is not writing a tight coherent account of morality and humanism among the primates. He is instead writing meandering thought provoking but far more personal account of humanism and science. His constant reference to the Bosch painting which he uses as a metaphor is an irritant. From this and his forays into philosophical discussions on the nature of God and morality, its obvious he's writing more of a personal discussion which he's entitled to after years of work. One of the frequent arguments for the existence of God is the cited need for moral law. Its the existence of God and his instruction to man that sets us apart, apparently. De Waal successful challenges that assumption citing evidence of moral behavior in not only primates but in other larger social animals such as dolphins and elephants. From this he proposes that morality is derived from the social nature of animals and has an bottoms up origins as opposed to the top down model proposed by various religions. Pulling it all together, he makes a compelling argument that morality is the basis for religion and a belief in God and not the other way around. An excellent read with a good and interesting argument. "
229,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/119364-melee-farr,3,"The premise of the book was right up my alley - examining the roots of morality (and ultimately religion) from a larger mammalian perspective. And I think it was effective on that front. de Waal is a primatologist, first and foremost, and there were countless examples from his and others' research, observations, and publications of moral behavior existing consistently in the animal world, with sound evolutionary reasoning for pro-social behaviors being retained throughout mammalian phylogeny. I flew through the first half of the book. He uses Bosch's triptych painting ""Garden of Earthly Delights"" as a recurring metaphor throughout the book, and honestly, he lost me with it. I mean, I understood the metaphor, but, to use another, it was kind of beating a dead horse. This may reveal the fact that I'm not particularly well-versed in the visual arts. He also is rather dismissive of atheism as often aggressive and exclusionary, and permissive of religion because he sees it as inevitable and having some consistently positive societal traits. Both points are well-made, but may whitewash the good done by skepticism and the evil done by dogmatism. But that perspective may also just reveal my bias. "
230,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6664778-andrea,3,"Tracing the beginning of morality may be as close as our fellow primates the Bonobos, as de Waal explains in this book. I am interested in the topic of the origins of morality and the book has a flow that kept me reading. I do think de Waal has a little Richard Dawkins envy though. Richard Dawkins is simply a better writer. This author makes the point that although morality predates religion there is no point in egging on the religious majority by calling such religious beliefs delusional, which in fact Dawkins does. I agree it is pointless and may be even counter productive however I feel the author fails to give due the bias that atheists face, bias that denies us jobs, social status and even basic human rights. Try getting into high political positions as an outed atheist. Frans does a disservice to human rights when he says that there is no reason to state an atheist agenda, and I agree, but what about a human agenda? Frans doesn't take the biases seriously enough. This being said the book is worth a read to remind us of our roots, to connect with fellow primates and to learn more about the origins of morality."
231,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5318025-nina,3,"Frans de Waal's research is impressive, and I found his insights into primate behaviors, including those of humans, very interesting. However, if the purpose of his study had to do with religion and morality, then he failed to connect the two sides of the book (primatology and religion). By the time I finished the book, my big questions were, What does religion have to do with this study? and What does Bosch have to do with primatology? Personal admiration for the painter does not constitute expertise, and while interesting, the bursts of art history did not in any way advance de Waal's argument, especially because they did not rely on art history so much as on the author's personal responses to The Garden of Earthly Delights. Sadly, de Waal does not really understand atheists either, neither old-school nor the ones he refers to as ""neo-atheists."" Personal opinions rather than data dominate this book, and opinions do not prove very much. The lack of hard evidence for the arguments on morality is only part of the problem, though. The author's attempts at wit are offensive to many readers, and together with speculation rather than evidence hurt the book's message. "
232,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11200007-douglas-cosby,1,"1.5 stars (the extra half point is for the narrator): Not my bag. I read the first third of this book, but couldn't get any further. Franz de Waal's point is simple: morality is a result of evolution, not imposed by religion or ""invented"" by humans. A very good point, and I sympathize with de Waal's frustration with biologists/scientists that fall prey to the rampant anthropomorphism we humans tend to overlay on the way we see other animals. He uses a few scientific studies, but mainly just anecdotes and cute stories, to justify his position, and this book feels more like a feel-good article in O magazine than something that would be in Scientific American or Nature. Additionally, while de Waal harshly criticizes recent atheist authors, it doesn't seem like he has really read them. For instance, his criticism of Sam Harris's The Moral Landscape, seems like it came from the back-of-the-book summary, not the actual details of the book. If you are in the mood for a bunch of touching ape stories, then this book might be for you. If you are looking for a book on the scientific basis of prehuman morality supported by scientific evidence and logical conclusions, look elsewhere."
233,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5078550-robert-bor,4,"I got this book from my friends, who appreciate my interest in evolution, politics and society. Frans de Waal weaves two different threads in this book. On the one hand, he proceeds to show clearly how animals (the Bonobo primate in particular) have an extremely good sense of moralistic behavior. This undermines the argument that moralistic behavior is one of the primary consequences of religion. No, not just undermines, evaporates. This is where he weaves in the other thread, where he distances himself from the Atheist camp (Dawkins et al) and states that religion should not just be abandoned if we cannot replace it with something else. He understands the need of humans for spirituality and does not just wish this away. In the dual aspect, a bit of a weird combination, but understandable, since being seen in the Atheist camp, pretty much shuts you out from dialogue with the religious one. Is Mr de Waal aiming for a diplomatic role in bringing the two camps closer together? On another note, if you like the work of Hiëronymus Bosch, know that it features prominently in this book."
234,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7349461-cody,3,"This book had its ups and downs. de Waal's argument for morality emerging from bottom-up processes is convincing, and I really enjoyed when he would dive into the details of primate research, as well his many anecdotes. This alone makes the book worth reading. I do, however, think he was quite off the mark with his criticism of the ""neo-Atheists"" (i.e., the New Atheists). On top of the misguided attacks (A.C. Grayling addresses some of these in a review in Prospect Magazine http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/mag...), at times he comes across as patronizing. He stresses the need for religion to help secure ethics among the masses (at least at present), while apparently considering himself fully capable of living morally without religion. That said, I think the book drives home some good points (especially in the final chapters), and will get both believers and non-believers thinking about some of these issues."
235,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8076824-geoff,3,"I have a soft spot for primates, and books on morality are catching my attention at the moment so I thought I would have enjoyed this book more than I did. I also recently read The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt, so I can't help but compare the two. While I did enjoy this book more than The Righteous Mind, I still gave both books three stars. Frans de Waal's writing style is much more enjoyable and conversational than Haidt's. However, there seemed to be less science involved in this book. I know there are countless endnotes and references at the back of the book, but somehow the observations came across as purely anecdotal. While I agree with de Waal's bottom up approach to morality, rather than from top down, I didn't find that the strength of his arguments would convince anyone who don't already believe as he does."
236,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6323134-darcey,3,"I found this an interesting read, though perhaps one with more extraneous information than I wanted. I enjoyed de Waal's anecdotes and commentary about Bosch and how that was related to humanity, symbolism, and the growth of ideas - however, there was more of it than necessary (including recounting experiences of being at the Prado in Madrid). The linkage between the fact that primates (and other animals) exhibit traits which we as humans consider ""moral"" - and that animals do not follow religion - is clear, leaving us with no way to avoid the conclusion de Waal sets out to prove: morality is not something encoded purely by religion, and those who believe that without religion humans will descend to immoral madness have a significant amount of evidence to overcome to prove their position. "
237,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5777523-jami,4,"This was a well researched, informative book. I was not familiar with Frans de Waal's work before this book, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I thought there would be more focus on the Bonobo anecdotes, but there were enough to keep me entertained and interested. This book looks at the issue of what the source of morality and other behaviors is; it combines many areas of study, including religion, philosophy, science, sociology, psychology, and history. While parts of the book dragged a little, overall it was well done. There were some parts of the book that fascinated me and that I had never considered before, such as the yawn response in relation to empathy; I also particularly enjoyed the passages about specific behaviors usually only attributed to humans that are found in bonobos and other species. The narration was very good and easy to listen to."
238,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/906313-diane,3,"This was a surprisingly interesting argument on the origin of morality. In a spiritual context, morality is something that is imposed by God with commandments and injunctions, etc. deWaal, however, draws from his many years as a primatologist to suggest that morality is an internal motivator, something that is inherent within us and those species most closely related to us. The bonobo is his primary example of a primate that clearly demonstrates moral qualities such as empathy. I found it very interesting to listen to, but kind of disorganized. And since de Waal frequently mentions the Hieronymus Bosch painting, ""Garden of Earthly Delight,"" I wished I had that image on hand. Nevertheless, I enjoyed de Waal's ideas and his intelligent presentation."

The author's work with primates, and less frequently with other social mammals, provides convincing evidence for a continuity of development of consciousness and empathetic/moral behavior between humankind and other animals. It successfully combats the idea that humans and other social animals are at the core selfish, with altruism as a thin, self-serving veneer; that without top-down religious mandates, such as the 10 commandments, people would live in a nightmare Hobbesian world; and that ""selfish gene"" theories are a adequate way of understanding and interpreting an organism's behavior and motivations. An enjoyable read."

241,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33852158-halli-lauren,3,"I read and enjoyed De Waal’s “Are we smart enough to know how smart animals are”, so when I saw this book was written by him, I was pretty intrigued! As a baby atheist myself, and someone who is interested in studying bonobos, this seemed like the perfect book for me. Unfortunately, De Waal spent way more time talking about chimpanzees than bonobos. He also spent way more time talking about Heironymus Bosch than was necessary. What was the point of that?? I was pretty on board with the author’s broader points about religion:1. Trying to “convert people to atheism” is a waste of energy 2. Religion isn’t going away any time soon, and if it did, we’d need to find something to replace it because of all the important things it does for us as humans (ie: community building)But here are my qualms:1. Why did he spend so much time condemning Neo-Atheists and so little time condemning the abuse and manipulation in so many religions? Toward the beginning, De Waal pointed out that he came from a much more casual religious background, so leaving his religion wasn’t as big of a deal. But the thing is, so many religions are extremely dogmatic which can lead to much more harm than good. De Waal definitely condemned dogmatism, which I agree with, but he didn’t seem to realize how inescapable dogmatism can be. Maybe that’s just my point of view coming from a high demand, very dogmatic religion. 2. So yeah, religion is important and isn’t going away any time soon. Then what should atheists do? De Waal spent so much time saying how important religion is, and even though he is an atheist himself, he didn’t share any of his ideas of how to get the benefits of religion elsewhere. I guess that’s what I wanted out of the book, and I didn’t get it. Then of course there’s the main subject matter of the book: the evolution of morality and altruism. This was all well and good, but while reading I didn’t have any “Aha!” moments- nothing felt very fresh to me. Overall a disappointing read. Not good, not bad. Just meh. Oh also I’m just sick of reading books by old white men… if anyone has recommendations of nonfiction science books by women or people of color?? Definitely would love to hear those."
242,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15812925-adrian-undrea,4,"Frans de Waal is probably best known for his appearances on TED Talks. Having seen his presentations on animal morality I have to admit I have started reading his book being biased. I consider myself an atheist and somehow I had been looking at this book to reinforce this view. But The Bonobo and the Atheist shouldn't be read for that as Frans de Waal looks to explore the origins of morality and debunk the myth, so deeply ingrained in most of us, that morality is the trademark of humanity. And while sometimes it jumps too fast from one idea to the other, reading The Bonobo and the Atheist with an open mind might change the way you view morality. Far from being a hallmark of mankind, morality is a product of evolution, shaping the interactions of all social animals. By the use of countless experiments Frans de Waal argues morality is a mere tool of the highly evolved animals that makes living in groups possible. It is one more nail in the coffin of the idea that somehow we are special from the rest of the biological world. And while Frans de Waal thinks letting go of religion might not be possible for humanity, he favors the optimistic idea that our moral compass is an inner one (a bottom-up approach) instead of having its origins in religion (a top-down view)."
243,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18494756-olivia,5,"This is probably the second book I've read this year that I think everyone should read.

Frans de Waal is a very engaging writer, and considerably more knowledgeable about the topic than the most well-intended science reporter.

It is full of great arguements against conventional thinking. and deWaal is certainly well read about science and morality. But he is mostly driven by arguing against skeptics (skeptics of animal-cognition, not in general) so he is great at giving counter examples. But he is not that great at proposing new ideas. So I might be wrong. Basically, from what I understood, bottom-up morality is descriptive to prescriptive morality with emphasis on socially enforced ones. I might be wrong because he was not that clear -to me- about it. Which is, underwhelming. Both because intuitive morality is at the end a prescriptive morality, however he wants to say that they are not that different. The arguments against different schools of normative thinking was also weak because from a utilitarian point of view, he was arguing a straw-man, as a utilitarian (like me) wouldn't exactly argue as he did in the place of a utilitarian. Though I have to say, it may have been not because if an intentional effort, but because he probably did not check his argument with a utilitarian. Overall, I don't think this book-essay was a ""great-read"" type, but it is certainly better than reading a fiction in search of meaning."

If there is a short-coming here, it is that the balance between these elements will be a little unsatisfactory for anyone who is mainly interested in the science.

247,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15731711-samantha,4,"I am totally on the fence when it comes to Frans de Waal. Sometimes I find myself underlining sentences in this book in agreement, and other times I find myself scribbling frustrated notes of disagreement in the side margins. For example, on page 184 de Waal practically ridicules Peter Singer for not taking his view that we should have ""special loyalty"" to our own species while excluding other species from our moral equations. He basically argues that we should determine our morals (in some cases) based on loyalty to our own group - in this case, our own species. It's terribly reminiscent of people from history who argued the same way - substituting ""species"" for ""race"" or ""sex"". I assume that some time in the future, people will read this and think ""Wow, de Waal was a good primatologist, it's a shame he was such a speciesist"" as we now say about 18th and 19th century writers. In the margins on page 184 I wrote ""But sometimes fierce loyalty to one's own group is immoral - it would be immoral for me to say a black person is not equal to a white person merely out of loyalty to my own race."" This morality based on loyalty to one's own group is rather small-minded, if you ask me.Another rather bad part of de Waal's book was on page 204, where he writes, ""Neo-atheists are like people standing outside a movie theater telling us that Leonardo DiCaprio didn't really go down with the Titanic. How shocking! Mostly of us are perfectly comfortable with the duality."" The flaw in his argument is this: no one ridicules Titanic watchers because no Titanic watcher actually believes that Leo went down with the famous ship. But atheists ridicule theists because they ACTUALLY believe ridiculous things like wine turning into blood or demons in the form of talking snakes tempting people to eat some fruit. He argues that atheists who criticize religion are advocating the elimination of imagination. But the key difference between people with active imaginations and theists is that imaginative people ultimately recognize that their fantasies aren't part of reality. Theists make no such recognition; they actually believe, metaphorically, that Leonardo DiCaprio was on the Titanic. Or anything else equally absurd. This is why they are ridiculed and the imagination is not. Imagination is beautiful and beneficial in many ways. I'm a fiction writer, I have a very deep appreciation of imagination, but I recognize it as just that - imagination. Unlike imagination, I consider most religious claims ridiculously illogical because the theist seriously believes in these fantasies. I would have not the slightest problem with religion if this was not the case (but then it wouldn't really be religion, would it?). The weakness in de Waal's analogy (criticizing theists to criticizing moviegoers) is so obvious that I can't help thinking de Waal might not completely understand religion or what it means to condemn it.There are other ways in which I strongly disagreed with de Waal, particularly when he talked about religion (I write in a margin, ""Can we go back to the apes now?"") but overall I tended to agree with what he said. It was a good book and I learned a lot from it about chimps and bonobos. The parts about the apes were very interesting, but the parts where de Waal starts talking religion and philosophy were out of touch with how I feel about those matters. Overall, it was a good book and worth reading for anyone interested in the origins of morality."
248,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9716384-vivify-m,5,"I very much enjoyed this book. Primatology enthralls me - learning about our primate cousins, and how researchers work with them is a joy. But, the resulting insights into our own psychology, is the highlight. I also, enjoyed understanding how the experiments were constructed and the challenges the researchers faced.On the downside, I was put off by the authors attitude towards other disciplines. I found his criticism of biologists unnecessary, in particular his misrepresentation of geneticists as calling prosocial behaviour a mistake. I’m no expert, but I also questioned his representation of evolution. At times I thought he was confusing selfish genes with selfish individuals. Possibly, the most significant contribution of the book, is the idea that key to our salvation is in understanding our natural selves. I love this sentiment, but I also get nervous of overly naturalistic thinking, and I’m not convinced by the arguments against utilitarianism. Ultimately, this was a deeply thought provoking and enjoyable book."
249,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57079482-chuck-kollars,4,"The author has kept and done research with Chimpanzees and Bonobos (formerly known as Pygmy Chimps) for decades, is top of his field, and has written many books. The main theme of this book is an observation and bit of reasoning. The observation is that our animal relatives routinely display a fairly strong sense of morality (focused on maintaining good relations within the group). The obvious reasoning from this is that our current morality -often embedded in ""religion""- comes not from anything external like religion but rather from something internal that predates religion. He makes this case pretty strongly, but without placing it in a larger hypothetical framework. The book mentions, but doesn't even try to answer larger questions such as how did our morality come to be deposited in religion?, how does a morality focused on good group relations work with much larger groups (tribe, nation, globe, etc.)?, how much can we deviate from our unthinking inborn sense of morality before everything falls apart?, and how will we know when we don't need religion at all any more?He does several other things in this same book: He responds to the ""four horsemen of atheism"" that made such a splash a few years ago. He presents many interesting anecdotes from his subjects, some of which are closely tied to a sense of morality and some that illustrate more intelligence/forethought/non-aggression than we typically credit our close relative animals with. And he tries his hand at an explication of the painting ""The Garden"" by ""Heironymus Bosch"". He draws some interesting parallels between these topics, but in my opinion not enough, so the book seems less focused than it could be. There are indeed connections between these strands (even though they're not as strong as I'd like). For example, the author thinks the ""four horsemen of atheism"" give too much credit to religion in accusing it of being the root of horrible wars and genocides. Such abominable behavior is also displayed by chimps in certain circumstances. Humans must have gotten it from the same place, and our common ancestor predates religion. Also, chimp society is clearly uninfluenced by any human religion ...or any religion at all. So for the wars and genocides, despite its claims, religion was really more ""cover story"" than ""cause"". In a way the whole book is a plea for humble moderation rather than conspicuous ideology. We're asked to actually look at the evidence in front of our faces and to not completely throw out religion until we understand it a little better and so forth. This is his critique of the atheists too: most scientists are rather dubious about religion, but why is it so important to you that other people think exactly the same way you do? He describes the seemingly contradictory combination of a lackluster subject with passionate advocacy as ""sleeping furiously""."

Back to some serious reading nowIn all honesty, I chose to read this book to learn about Bonobos and didn't want to fully enter into any religious debate. That part of the book I really enjoyed. However. since this book is titled 'The Bonobo and the Atheist', I will make a few comments.I will say that I enjoyed reading about Veneer theory. Unfortunately, I am not so sure that I agree with Frans de Waal's notion that this theory is no longer valid with the overwhelming evidence of innate altruism. Perhaps I'm a skeptic but I still feel that people do in fact weigh up the possible benefits of their actions and not just in business and with acquaintances but also with family and friends; which is not what he believes. He believes we are altruistic with those closest to us and that is not always the case. What I will say is that I don't argue that there is something innate within us that gives us our moral compass but one could argue that it is a higher being that gives us that moral compass in the first place. Nonetheless, what I do respect is that at no point does he belittle other religions or in fact hail atheism as the one true faith. I respect that he is not a militant atheist like Dawkins. He even mentions that for him - when considering that it was wrongly believed Darwin agreed with 'the expulsion of morality from the natural domain'-""the height of absurdity was reached when Dawkins explicitly disavowed Darwin, telling an interviewer in 1997 that 'in our political and social life we are entitled to throw out Darwinism.'"" He doesn't appreciate Dawkin's ability to be so dismissive of other beliefs.This is a good read but, as mentioned in some other reviews that I've read, I also feel that Frans de Waal is mixing two ideas that needn't be discussed together. When he does discuss some points, I often feel like saying, 'just get to the point'. He spends over a page using various works of art to comment on how we react to them and how it shows our bodily empathy.It felt like he introduced this list of art to fill a few pages. There can often be much speculation based on what he observes in the bonobos and humans themselves. There are often times when I feel he speculates too much. Though I will say that I was pleased to hear another one of his many examples that'humans most prone to yawn contagion also have the most empathy'. That is pleasing to know since simply reading the word yawn sets me off :).I have enjoyed reading this book but when he stated 'My first book on this topic, Good Natured (1996), barely mentioned religion' I almost wish I had read that instead."
251,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196037-jrobertus,5,"De Waal is a primatologist with a philosophical bent. I have read several of his books; they are not only interesting but important. He shows from his experimental work the basis for morality in our simian ancestors. They have empathy and an innate sense of fairness, required for communal living an hunting, that sets the basis for a moral code. (His experiments showing a sense of fairness in monkeys is fmous and the subject of a terrific TED tak). Region, or other social institutions, build on this inherent bent. De Waal describes morality as bottom up and not top down. Although he is atheist himself, he takes issue with the “neo atheists” like Hitchins and Dawkins who are aggressive in attacking religion. He urges tolerance and open mindedness and to not be as dogmatic as relious fundamentalists. He feels religion plays an important role in the social structure of close knit groups, it is robust (whereas science is new, difficult, “unnatural” and therefore fragile in an all out battle with religion). He feels northern Europe is carrying out a large scale gradual experiment in secularism. Can education and the state take over the amalgamating role of relion and make a strong, moral society without religion? We'll see eventually. Certainty efforts to remove religion by force, like the communists and Khmer rouge, have been horrible failures, worse than the superstition and dogmatism they wanted to replace. The animal work, an observations of behaviour, that De Waal uses to support his arguments are interesting in their own right. This is a most worthwhile read for its science and for the way science can inform philosophy and politics.De Waal is a hero of mine; he is an imaginative scientist, and a mature reviewer of the biological basis of empathy, altruism, and morality. In this book he continues his eye-opening work on the behavior of primates, especially our nearest relatives, the chimps and bonobos. His careful monitoring of their behavior in laboratories and in the wild, points out the ancient foundation of moral behavior among animals living in interdependent societies. In this book he also addresses the ongoing debate between religion, particularly fundamentalists, and science. Although he is an atheist he sees the value in religious practice and bonding, if not in the dogma. He takes aim at the “new atheists”, like Hitchens and Dawkins, and chides them for a combative and often insulting tone that does not help bridge the social gap. The tone of this book is so mature and thoughtful it is quite humbling. I wish I could be more like him."
252,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71935584-ben-zimmerman,3,"As a book about fascinating and well-told narratives about animal behavior and cognition, I would give this book a better rating (as I would rate many of Frans De Waal’s books). However, the purpose of this book seemed to be more about a reflection of religion and a bit of a criticism of the “new atheists”. I thought that the religious reflections weren’t very interesting and often wrong in the way that he characterized the views of both many atheists and many religious people. Some of his reflections and connections seemed disconnected and not well thought out. I would definitely recommend reading Frans de Waal, but maybe a different book. "
253,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10397934-erich,3,"Somewhat meandering in its approach, this book does make some convincing and enlightening arguments that I am happy to ponder. Frans de Waal's obvious expertise in primate prosocial behavior gives him an excellent vantage point to show that morality certainly evolved well before any religious institutions were established, especially as we know them today. The anecdotes are enticing and revealing, and really make the thesis very compelling. Primatology sounds even more fascinating when we see ourselves so vividly reflected in his vignettes. Some of the digressions into how we are to deal with morality and religion in the face of scientific progress are less persuasive. I did not find de Waal's writing to be particularly cohesive or share the logical argumentative power of a Dawkins or Hitchens. Towards the end of the book I finally began to grasp his viewpoint, and mostly embraced it, but there was no feeling of real enlightenment. I think the book overall, and some of its arguments, could have been better organized. The book did serve a good counterpoint to what de Waal calls ""neo-Atheists"" such as Sam Harris, Dawkins, and Hitchens (well, ""Marxist"" for him), though I happen to love these authors. If you are looking for that, it has its moments. I have to admit that I had problems with de Waal's recommendation to give modern religion so much leeway and to dispense with the heated ""anti-religious"" rhetoric of those mentioned above. While humans may be naturally predisposed to accepting religion as a form of social normalizing (which I agree has had its place in our civilizing process), this doesn't mean it we should accept it as necessary today. Its stranglehold on truth in the face of scientific evidence does nothing to enforce our common morality. If anything, it holds us back from truly understanding our place in the universe and extending a moral code to everyone. I see a need for more strong voices opposed to this willful ignorance and dogma, not fewer. All in all, a good read with some nice points. And bonobos!"
254,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13928228-sortal,1,"Muddy thinking, misrepresentation (or ignorance?) of atheist arguments, and lots of irrelevant passages on Hieronymus Bosch. I've really enjoyed other books by Frans de Waal, but this is an unsuccessful departure from his areas of expertise. Insofar as I can figure out what de Waal is arguing for, I agree with most of his premises: 1. Moral conduct exists on a continuum, including the behaviours of other animals.2. Dogmatism is terrible and should be avoided. 3. Religion is superfluous to morality. 4. Hardline atheism is unlikely to persuade the devoutly religious to give up their faith.But then things go wrong. 5. De Waal never addresses whether religion is inherently dogmatic. (Insofar as it's faith-based, where faith is belief without evidence, it certainly seems that way.) 6. De Waal never addresses the harm done by religion (a crucial point made by the thinkers he so blithely dismisses, such as Dawkins and Harris). 7. De Waal claims (without any supporting argument) that religion will always exist.If you replaced the passages on Bosch with a fair representation of the atheists de Waal is arguing against, you'd have a wonderful book. Better still would be a book using de Waal's research to build on the project of Harris' Moral Landscape, helping to create an alternative to religion (the logical next step from premises 2-4 once you accept 5 and 6 and dismiss 7). Instead, you get an infuriatingly murky read of jumbled ideas with just enough interesting anecdotes about primates to keep you reading through the rambling about Bosch.   "
255,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"The book really should have been titled ""The Bonobo and Human Empathy"". The two pillars of all philosophy are empathy and reciprocity. He completely examines the first pillar, empathy, by illustrating empathetic behavior in Bonobos (and other animals) and linking it to our behavior.He's such a good writer even when he wrote about things I completely disagreed with I would find the book thought provoking. I thought he trivialized the arguments of Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens and John Stuart Mill. But, I'm not bothered. I believe what I believe and I appreciated the different perspective.The narrator did a perfect job.The book is much better than most pop science books I have listened to and I'm much richer for having listened to this highly entertaining book and can definitely say because of this book I'm much closer to my goal of understanding our place in the universe. He does talk about philosophy but I enjoyed those parts as much as I did about bonobos.(P.S. Matt Ridley's book, ""The Rational Optimist"", fully covers the second pillar of human philosophy, reciprocity. Also, my personal take on the author he seemed like an apologetic atheist and he didn't want to offend anyone. But as I say, I wasn't bothered by this, but I disagreed with him regarding those sections. Also, he seemed to characterized the utilitarianism of John Stuart Mill in a comic book fashion. Once again I wasn't bothered but I don't want to leave the impression that I agreed with him on those two points)."
256,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51675760-mark-james,3,"I really enjoyed learning about the idiosyncrasies of many of the primates, as well as having a better sense of the differences between bonobos and chimps. Choosing Bosch's ""The Garden of Earthly Delights"" as a focal point was interesting on de Waal's part. I couldn't help but feel the book could have been better organized, as the topic shifts from bonobos to religion to morality to art without any obvious structure. Finally, there were several points made about atheism that don't hold up to scrutiny. For instance, he writes, ""Everything humans have accomplished anywhere - from architecture to music, from art to science - developed hand in hand with religion, never separately."" Do you mean, de Waal, that religion has existed at the same time that these wonderful things were created, or that all people who created these things were religious? Certainly neither is true. In fact, most examples of human achievement come in spite of religion, not because of it.Elsewhere, de Waal faults Christopher Hitchens for shifting loyalties several times before landing on an antitheist stance. To me, this only means that Hitchens was tireless in his pursuit of truth.I detected countless other examples of unfair judgments, but overall, the author tends to take the safe middle ground when failing to acknowledge that anything we can do without belief in the supernatural, we can do without it, and then some."
257,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3050574-a-b-gayle,3,"Humanism and the BonoboI struggled to get through this book while I was totally immersed in another of his, questioning whether humans were smart enough to understand animals. I think part of my alienation arose because of his obsession with Heironymous Bosch’s art. (I thought he was an LAPD detective, lol!)Basically, I totally agree with the main premise of this book. Best summed up in the final chapter.Thank God, if I may, we share with other primates a background as group animals, which makes us value social connections. Absent this background, religion could be preaching about virtue and vice until it became blue in the face, we’d never get its point. We are receptive only because of our evolved grasp of the value of relationships, the benefits of cooperation, the need for trust and honesty, and so on. Even our sense of fairness derives from this background.In other words, we are receptive to religion (some might say vulnerable) simply because we like other mammals have empathy and value relationships, the benefits of cooperation, the need for trust and honesty, and so on. Even our sense of fairness derives from this background. But just because something is possible doesn’t mean it is necessary.Throughout the preceding chapters, he has shown different ways this morality manifests itself within the animal kingdom. He refutes the notion that if it weren’t for religion, humans would be no better than animals. In fact he states Morality arose first, and modern religion latched onto it. Instead of giving us the moral law, the large religions were invented to bolster it. We are only just beginning to explore how religion does so by binding people together and enforcing good behavior. It is far from my intention to minimize this role, which was vital in the past and may remain so in the foreseeable future, but the wellspring of morality it is not.In fact he sees the evolutionary development of this bottom up morality that has allowed us to develop to where we are today.So why not give this a higher rating?Firstly, the continual referral to the Bosch painting “The Garden” which seemed a stretch at times to illustrate a point he was making. We can no more know why Bosch painted it the way he did than know what Bonobos are actually thinking.Sure, studying them in the wild and conducting experiments can demonstrate that they have recognisable emotions, but in one section he has Bonobos thinking about what atheists would be thinking. So that was my second star off.The third star off is for his dodgy logic in many sections. Take for example his dismissal of the Golden Rule of Christianity (Do unto others as you would have them do unto you).To give a rather crude example, if at a conference I follow an attractive woman whom I barely know to her hotel room and jump into her bed uninvited, I can pretty well guess how she’d react. If I explain that I am just doing to her what I would love her to do to me, I’m afraid my appeal to the golden rule won’t fly. Or, let’s assume that I knowingly serve pork sausages to a vegan. Liking meat myself, I am just following the golden rule, but the vegan will consider my behavior obnoxious, perhaps even immoral.In both cases he has only looked at the physical side of the equation, not the effects of those acts. Would he like someone to rape him or insult his beliefs? You can’t divorce the act from the motive or consequence of the act. If all three are taken into account, the Golden Rule still applies.Chapter 7 particularly had some lazy logic. Whereas in previous chapters I’d been highlighting very well presented arguments, this one is full of my exasperation at the arguments used to justify the need for religion in society. Take this one for example.We humans were plenty moral when we still roamed the savanna in small bands. Only when the scale of society began to grow and rules of reciprocity and reputation began to falter did a moralizing God become necessary.But perhaps the “necessity” for this moralising God and his acolytes comes about because the chances of having a psychopath or control freak who wants this power (in the form of a controlling religion) has increased because of the larger population? He had already acknowledged that personalities varied within animal groups, so the ‘need’ for religion could just as easily be attributed to statistics producing people who wanted power for power’s sake.Interestingly when you look at early Greek and Roman religion, the gods just existed. They were used to explain the unexplainable. It was only later that the gods started telling people how to behave. I’m pretty sure the population of Ancient Greeks and Romans was not insignificant.But let’s look at another lazy analogy The whole purpose of God is to do the latter (loving moral actions). We endowed him with the capacity to keep us on the same straight and narrow that we’d been following ever since we lived in small bands.How different is this from the concept of Santa Claus being used to make children behave? Adults understand that rewards that are achievable are the best ways to control children. Likewise those who perceive the need to control large numbers of adults do so by playing up to the fears that adults have (as evidenced previously in this chapter) - a fear of death and hence the need for an afterlife.While I can see his point that a focusing deity that encourages people to be good is not bad, but the dogma that accompanies it and the divisions this creates makes me question whether this need could be better met in other ways or at least recognised for what is really happening. Perhaps the need is more that many individuals are not going to take orders from one of their own, but prefer that order to come from some unquestionably alpha figure.So my final verdict? Animals follow their own form of moral code developed in response to the betterment of their community. While some humans are still capable of doing this, others through laziness, unwillingness to kowtow to one of their own issuing instructions or fear of their mortality need some sort of mystical religion to guide their actions. I added another star back in because he made a good case for respecting that animals at times are better socialised than many humans."
258,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5889085-h-wesselius,4,"The title is somewhat misleading. De Waal is not writing a tight coherent account of morality and humanism among the primates. He is instead writing meandering thought provoking but far more personal account of humanism and science. His constant reference to the Bosch painting which he uses as a metaphor is an irritant. From this and his forays into philosophical discussions on the nature of God and morality, its obvious he's writing more of a personal discussion which he's entitled to after years of work. One of the frequent arguments for the existence of God is the cited need for moral law. Its the existence of God and his instruction to man that sets us apart, apparently. De Waal successful challenges that assumption citing evidence of moral behavior in not only primates but in other larger social animals such as dolphins and elephants. From this he proposes that morality is derived from the social nature of animals and has an bottoms up origins as opposed to the top down model proposed by various religions. Pulling it all together, he makes a compelling argument that morality is the basis for religion and a belief in God and not the other way around. An excellent read with a good and interesting argument. "
259,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/119364-melee-farr,3,"The premise of the book was right up my alley - examining the roots of morality (and ultimately religion) from a larger mammalian perspective. And I think it was effective on that front. de Waal is a primatologist, first and foremost, and there were countless examples from his and others' research, observations, and publications of moral behavior existing consistently in the animal world, with sound evolutionary reasoning for pro-social behaviors being retained throughout mammalian phylogeny. I flew through the first half of the book. He uses Bosch's triptych painting ""Garden of Earthly Delights"" as a recurring metaphor throughout the book, and honestly, he lost me with it. I mean, I understood the metaphor, but, to use another, it was kind of beating a dead horse. This may reveal the fact that I'm not particularly well-versed in the visual arts. He also is rather dismissive of atheism as often aggressive and exclusionary, and permissive of religion because he sees it as inevitable and having some consistently positive societal traits. Both points are well-made, but may whitewash the good done by skepticism and the evil done by dogmatism. But that perspective may also just reveal my bias. "
260,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6664778-andrea,3,"Tracing the beginning of morality may be as close as our fellow primates the Bonobos, as de Waal explains in this book. I am interested in the topic of the origins of morality and the book has a flow that kept me reading. I do think de Waal has a little Richard Dawkins envy though. Richard Dawkins is simply a better writer. This author makes the point that although morality predates religion there is no point in egging on the religious majority by calling such religious beliefs delusional, which in fact Dawkins does. I agree it is pointless and may be even counter productive however I feel the author fails to give due the bias that atheists face, bias that denies us jobs, social status and even basic human rights. Try getting into high political positions as an outed atheist. Frans does a disservice to human rights when he says that there is no reason to state an atheist agenda, and I agree, but what about a human agenda? Frans doesn't take the biases seriously enough. This being said the book is worth a read to remind us of our roots, to connect with fellow primates and to learn more about the origins of morality."
261,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5318025-nina,3,"Frans de Waal's research is impressive, and I found his insights into primate behaviors, including those of humans, very interesting. However, if the purpose of his study had to do with religion and morality, then he failed to connect the two sides of the book (primatology and religion). By the time I finished the book, my big questions were, What does religion have to do with this study? and What does Bosch have to do with primatology? Personal admiration for the painter does not constitute expertise, and while interesting, the bursts of art history did not in any way advance de Waal's argument, especially because they did not rely on art history so much as on the author's personal responses to The Garden of Earthly Delights. Sadly, de Waal does not really understand atheists either, neither old-school nor the ones he refers to as ""neo-atheists."" Personal opinions rather than data dominate this book, and opinions do not prove very much. The lack of hard evidence for the arguments on morality is only part of the problem, though. The author's attempts at wit are offensive to many readers, and together with speculation rather than evidence hurt the book's message. "
262,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11200007-douglas-cosby,1,"1.5 stars (the extra half point is for the narrator): Not my bag. I read the first third of this book, but couldn't get any further. Franz de Waal's point is simple: morality is a result of evolution, not imposed by religion or ""invented"" by humans. A very good point, and I sympathize with de Waal's frustration with biologists/scientists that fall prey to the rampant anthropomorphism we humans tend to overlay on the way we see other animals. He uses a few scientific studies, but mainly just anecdotes and cute stories, to justify his position, and this book feels more like a feel-good article in O magazine than something that would be in Scientific American or Nature. Additionally, while de Waal harshly criticizes recent atheist authors, it doesn't seem like he has really read them. For instance, his criticism of Sam Harris's The Moral Landscape, seems like it came from the back-of-the-book summary, not the actual details of the book. If you are in the mood for a bunch of touching ape stories, then this book might be for you. If you are looking for a book on the scientific basis of prehuman morality supported by scientific evidence and logical conclusions, look elsewhere."
263,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5078550-robert-bor,4,"I got this book from my friends, who appreciate my interest in evolution, politics and society. Frans de Waal weaves two different threads in this book. On the one hand, he proceeds to show clearly how animals (the Bonobo primate in particular) have an extremely good sense of moralistic behavior. This undermines the argument that moralistic behavior is one of the primary consequences of religion. No, not just undermines, evaporates. This is where he weaves in the other thread, where he distances himself from the Atheist camp (Dawkins et al) and states that religion should not just be abandoned if we cannot replace it with something else. He understands the need of humans for spirituality and does not just wish this away. In the dual aspect, a bit of a weird combination, but understandable, since being seen in the Atheist camp, pretty much shuts you out from dialogue with the religious one. Is Mr de Waal aiming for a diplomatic role in bringing the two camps closer together? On another note, if you like the work of Hiëronymus Bosch, know that it features prominently in this book."
264,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7349461-cody,3,"This book had its ups and downs. de Waal's argument for morality emerging from bottom-up processes is convincing, and I really enjoyed when he would dive into the details of primate research, as well his many anecdotes. This alone makes the book worth reading. I do, however, think he was quite off the mark with his criticism of the ""neo-Atheists"" (i.e., the New Atheists). On top of the misguided attacks (A.C. Grayling addresses some of these in a review in Prospect Magazine http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/mag...), at times he comes across as patronizing. He stresses the need for religion to help secure ethics among the masses (at least at present), while apparently considering himself fully capable of living morally without religion. That said, I think the book drives home some good points (especially in the final chapters), and will get both believers and non-believers thinking about some of these issues."
265,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8076824-geoff,3,"I have a soft spot for primates, and books on morality are catching my attention at the moment so I thought I would have enjoyed this book more than I did. I also recently read The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt, so I can't help but compare the two. While I did enjoy this book more than The Righteous Mind, I still gave both books three stars. Frans de Waal's writing style is much more enjoyable and conversational than Haidt's. However, there seemed to be less science involved in this book. I know there are countless endnotes and references at the back of the book, but somehow the observations came across as purely anecdotal. While I agree with de Waal's bottom up approach to morality, rather than from top down, I didn't find that the strength of his arguments would convince anyone who don't already believe as he does."

I enjoyed de Waal's anecdotes and commentary about Bosch and how that was related to humanity, symbolism, and the growth of ideas - however, there was more of it than necessary (including recounting experiences of being at the Prado in Madrid). The linkage between the fact that primates (and other animals) exhibit traits which we as humans consider ""moral"" - and that animals do not follow religion - is clear, leaving us with no way to avoid the conclusion de Waal sets out to prove: morality is not something encoded purely by religion, and those who believe that without religion humans will descend to immoral madness have a significant amount of evidence to overcome to prove their position.

I was not familiar with Frans de Waal's work before this book, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I thought there would be more focus on the Bonobo anecdotes, but there were enough to keep me entertained and interested. This book looks at the issue of what the source of morality and other behaviors is; it combines many areas of study, including religion, philosophy, science, sociology, psychology, and history. While parts of the book dragged a little, overall it was well done. There were some parts of the book that fascinated me and that I had never considered before, such as the yawn response in relation to empathy; I also particularly enjoyed the passages about specific behaviors usually only attributed to humans that are found in bonobos and other species. The narration was very good and easy to listen to."
268,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/906313-diane,3,"This was a surprisingly interesting argument on the origin of morality. In a spiritual context, morality is something that is imposed by God with commandments and injunctions, etc. deWaal, however, draws from his many years as a primatologist to suggest that morality is an internal motivator, something that is inherent within us and those species most closely related to us. The bonobo is his primary example of a primate that clearly demonstrates moral qualities such as empathy. I found it very interesting to listen to, but kind of disorganized. And since de Waal frequently mentions the Hieronymus Bosch painting, ""Garden of Earthly Delight,"" I wished I had that image on hand. Nevertheless, I enjoyed de Waal's ideas and his intelligent presentation."
269,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/746637-sally,4,"A thoughtful consideration of the origins of morality in humanity's evolutionary past. The author's work with primates, and less frequently with other social mammals, provides convincing evidence for a continuity of development of consciousness and empathetic/moral behavior between humankind and other animals. It successfully combats the idea that humans and other social animals are at the core selfish, with altruism as a thin, self-serving veneer; that without top-down religious mandates, such as the 10 commandments, people would live in a nightmare Hobbesian world; and that ""selfish gene"" theories are a adequate way of understanding and interpreting an organism's behavior and motivations. An enjoyable read."
270,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41590197-yani,5,A refreshing book which discusses morality from a perspective I had bever heard before. It gives a neat alternative which I think is indeed much more plausible and not as polarised as apparently everything is nowadays. It is written in a compelling style and Frans de Waal clearly explains his arguments and conclisions.
271,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33852158-halli-lauren,3,"I read and enjoyed De Waal’s “Are we smart enough to know how smart animals are”, so when I saw this book was written by him, I was pretty intrigued! As a baby atheist myself, and someone who is interested in studying bonobos, this seemed like the perfect book for me. Unfortunately, De Waal spent way more time talking about chimpanzees than bonobos. He also spent way more time talking about Heironymus Bosch than was necessary. What was the point of that?? I was pretty on board with the author’s broader points about religion:1. Trying to “convert people to atheism” is a waste of energy 2. Religion isn’t going away any time soon, and if it did, we’d need to find something to replace it because of all the important things it does for us as humans (ie: community building)But here are my qualms:1. Why did he spend so much time condemning Neo-Atheists and so little time condemning the abuse and manipulation in so many religions? Toward the beginning, De Waal pointed out that he came from a much more casual religious background, so leaving his religion wasn’t as big of a deal. But the thing is, so many religions are extremely dogmatic which can lead to much more harm than good. De Waal definitely condemned dogmatism, which I agree with, but he didn’t seem to realize how inescapable dogmatism can be. Maybe that’s just my point of view coming from a high demand, very dogmatic religion. 2. So yeah, religion is important and isn’t going away any time soon. Then what should atheists do? De Waal spent so much time saying how important religion is, and even though he is an atheist himself, he didn’t share any of his ideas of how to get the benefits of religion elsewhere. I guess that’s what I wanted out of the book, and I didn’t get it. Then of course there’s the main subject matter of the book: the evolution of morality and altruism. This was all well and good, but while reading I didn’t have any “Aha!” moments- nothing felt very fresh to me. Overall a disappointing read. Not good, not bad. Just meh. Oh also I’m just sick of reading books by old white men… if anyone has recommendations of nonfiction science books by women or people of color?? Definitely would love to hear those."
272,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15812925-adrian-undrea,4,"Frans de Waal is probably best known for his appearances on TED Talks. Having seen his presentations on animal morality I have to admit I have started reading his book being biased. I consider myself an atheist and somehow I had been looking at this book to reinforce this view. But The Bonobo and the Atheist shouldn't be read for that as Frans de Waal looks to explore the origins of morality and debunk the myth, so deeply ingrained in most of us, that morality is the trademark of humanity. And while sometimes it jumps too fast from one idea to the other, reading The Bonobo and the Atheist with an open mind might change the way you view morality. Far from being a hallmark of mankind, morality is a product of evolution, shaping the interactions of all social animals. By the use of countless experiments Frans de Waal argues morality is a mere tool of the highly evolved animals that makes living in groups possible. It is one more nail in the coffin of the idea that somehow we are special from the rest of the biological world. And while Frans de Waal thinks letting go of religion might not be possible for humanity, he favors the optimistic idea that our moral compass is an inner one (a bottom-up approach) instead of having its origins in religion (a top-down view)."
273,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18494756-olivia,5,"This is probably the second book I've read this year that I think everyone should read. (The other was SO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT RACE by Ijeoma Oluo.)A fascinating look into the moral universe of our closest genetic relatives, and an examination of the ought vs is of their world without religion (as we would recognize it. Frans de Waal is a very engaging writer, and considerably more knowledgeable about the topic than the most well-intended science reporter. (I've read some non fiction by people who write layman's overviews of science topics by interviewing researchers, and they also serve a purpose, but this book combines a depth of understanding of the topic with an engaging readability that is sometimes lacking in non fiction written by academics. I'm already seeking out more of his work.Atheist, believer, or.those of us in between will find much of interest here."
274,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13162061-amirography,3,"Hmmm. It is hard to give a review for this book. It is full of great arguements against conventional thinking. and deWaal is certainly well read about science and morality. But he is mostly driven by arguing against skeptics (skeptics of animal-cognition, not in general) so he is great at giving counter examples. But he is not that great at proposing new ideas. So I might be wrong. Basically, from what I understood, bottom-up morality is descriptive to prescriptive morality with emphasis on socially enforced ones. I might be wrong because he was not that clear -to me- about it. Which is, underwhelming. Both because intuitive morality is at the end a prescriptive morality, however he wants to say that they are not that different. The arguments against different schools of normative thinking was also weak because from a utilitarian point of view, he was arguing a straw-man, as a utilitarian (like me) wouldn't exactly argue as he did in the place of a utilitarian. Though I have to say, it may have been not because if an intentional effort, but because he probably did not check his argument with a utilitarian. Overall, I don't think this book-essay was a ""great-read"" type, but it is certainly better than reading a fiction in search of meaning."

The Bonobo and the Atheist explores the evolution of morality and the place of religion in our lives, seamlessly blending science, speculation, storytelling, and⁠ (yes, even⁠) art criticism. If there is a short-coming here, it is that the balance between these elements will be a little unsatisfactory for anyone who is mainly interested in the science. Compared to Frans de Waal's Primates and Philosophers—which features commentary from Robert Wright, Christine Korsgaard, Philip Kitcher and Peter Singer—The Bonobo and the Atheist also lacks the clarity that comes from having de Waal's most ambitious ideas reigned in by more cautious thinkers."

277,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15731711-samantha,4,"I am totally on the fence when it comes to Frans de Waal. Sometimes I find myself underlining sentences in this book in agreement, and other times I find myself scribbling frustrated notes of disagreement in the side margins. For example, on page 184 de Waal practically ridicules Peter Singer for not taking his view that we should have ""special loyalty"" to our own species while excluding other species from our moral equations. He basically argues that we should determine our morals (in some cases) based on loyalty to our own group - in this case, our own species. It's terribly reminiscent of people from history who argued the same way - substituting ""species"" for ""race"" or ""sex"". I assume that some time in the future, people will read this and think ""Wow, de Waal was a good primatologist, it's a shame he was such a speciesist"" as we now say about 18th and 19th century writers. In the margins on page 184 I wrote ""But sometimes fierce loyalty to one's own group is immoral - it would be immoral for me to say a black person is not equal to a white person merely out of loyalty to my own race."" This morality based on loyalty to one's own group is rather small-minded, if you ask me.Another rather bad part of de Waal's book was on page 204, where he writes, ""Neo-atheists are like people standing outside a movie theater telling us that Leonardo DiCaprio didn't really go down with the Titanic. How shocking! Mostly of us are perfectly comfortable with the duality."" The flaw in his argument is this: no one ridicules Titanic watchers because no Titanic watcher actually believes that Leo went down with the famous ship. But atheists ridicule theists because they ACTUALLY believe ridiculous things like wine turning into blood or demons in the form of talking snakes tempting people to eat some fruit. He argues that atheists who criticize religion are advocating the elimination of imagination. But the key difference between people with active imaginations and theists is that imaginative people ultimately recognize that their fantasies aren't part of reality. Theists make no such recognition; they actually believe, metaphorically, that Leonardo DiCaprio was on the Titanic. Or anything else equally absurd. This is why they are ridiculed and the imagination is not. Imagination is beautiful and beneficial in many ways. I'm a fiction writer, I have a very deep appreciation of imagination, but I recognize it as just that - imagination. Unlike imagination, I consider most religious claims ridiculously illogical because the theist seriously believes in these fantasies. I would have not the slightest problem with religion if this was not the case (but then it wouldn't really be religion, would it?). The weakness in de Waal's analogy (criticizing theists to criticizing moviegoers) is so obvious that I can't help thinking de Waal might not completely understand religion or what it means to condemn it.There are other ways in which I strongly disagreed with de Waal, particularly when he talked about religion (I write in a margin, ""Can we go back to the apes now?"") but overall I tended to agree with what he said. It was a good book and I learned a lot from it about chimps and bonobos. The parts about the apes were very interesting, but the parts where de Waal starts talking religion and philosophy were out of touch with how I feel about those matters. Overall, it was a good book and worth reading for anyone interested in the origins of morality."
278,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9716384-vivify-m,5,"I very much enjoyed this book. Primatology enthralls me - learning about our primate cousins, and how researchers work with them is a joy. But, the resulting insights into our own psychology, is the highlight. I also, enjoyed understanding how the experiments were constructed and the challenges the researchers faced.On the downside, I was put off by the authors attitude towards other disciplines. I found his criticism of biologists unnecessary, in particular his misrepresentation of geneticists as calling prosocial behaviour a mistake. I’m no expert, but I also questioned his representation of evolution. At times I thought he was confusing selfish genes with selfish individuals. Possibly, the most significant contribution of the book, is the idea that key to our salvation is in understanding our natural selves. I love this sentiment, but I also get nervous of overly naturalistic thinking, and I’m not convinced by the arguments against utilitarianism. Ultimately, this was a deeply thought provoking and enjoyable book."
279,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57079482-chuck-kollars,4,"The author has kept and done research with Chimpanzees and Bonobos (formerly known as Pygmy Chimps) for decades, is top of his field, and has written many books. The main theme of this book is an observation and bit of reasoning. The observation is that our animal relatives routinely display a fairly strong sense of morality (focused on maintaining good relations within the group). The obvious reasoning from this is that our current morality -often embedded in ""religion""- comes not from anything external like religion but rather from something internal that predates religion. He makes this case pretty strongly, but without placing it in a larger hypothetical framework. The book mentions, but doesn't even try to answer larger questions such as how did our morality come to be deposited in religion?, how does a morality focused on good group relations work with much larger groups (tribe, nation, globe, etc.)?, how much can we deviate from our unthinking inborn sense of morality before everything falls apart?, and how will we know when we don't need religion at all any more?He does several other things in this same book: He responds to the ""four horsemen of atheism"" that made such a splash a few years ago. He presents many interesting anecdotes from his subjects, some of which are closely tied to a sense of morality and some that illustrate more intelligence/forethought/non-aggression than we typically credit our close relative animals with. And he tries his hand at an explication of the painting ""The Garden"" by ""Heironymus Bosch"". He draws some interesting parallels between these topics, but in my opinion not enough, so the book seems less focused than it could be. There are indeed connections between these strands (even though they're not as strong as I'd like). For example, the author thinks the ""four horsemen of atheism"" give too much credit to religion in accusing it of being the root of horrible wars and genocides. Such abominable behavior is also displayed by chimps in certain circumstances. Humans must have gotten it from the same place, and our common ancestor predates religion. Also, chimp society is clearly uninfluenced by any human religion ...or any religion at all. So for the wars and genocides, despite its claims, religion was really more ""cover story"" than ""cause"". In a way the whole book is a plea for humble moderation rather than conspicuous ideology. We're asked to actually look at the evidence in front of our faces and to not completely throw out religion until we understand it a little better and so forth. This is his critique of the atheists too: most scientists are rather dubious about religion, but why is it so important to you that other people think exactly the same way you do? He describes the seemingly contradictory combination of a lackluster subject with passionate advocacy as ""sleeping furiously""."
280,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12402305-hanan-elsharif,3,"In her 1985 book Sex and Friendship in Baboons, Barbara Smuts was the first to apply the term “friendship” to animals,ha ha. her name is Smuts. um. Back to some serious reading nowIn all honesty, I chose to read this book to learn about Bonobos and didn't want to fully enter into any religious debate. That part of the book I really enjoyed. However. since this book is titled 'The Bonobo and the Atheist', I will make a few comments.I will say that I enjoyed reading about Veneer theory. Unfortunately, I am not so sure that I agree with Frans de Waal's notion that this theory is no longer valid with the overwhelming evidence of innate altruism. Perhaps I'm a skeptic but I still feel that people do in fact weigh up the possible benefits of their actions and not just in business and with acquaintances but also with family and friends; which is not what he believes. He believes we are altruistic with those closest to us and that is not always the case. What I will say is that I don't argue that there is something innate within us that gives us our moral compass but one could argue that it is a higher being that gives us that moral compass in the first place. Nonetheless, what I do respect is that at no point does he belittle other religions or in fact hail atheism as the one true faith. I respect that he is not a militant atheist like Dawkins. He even mentions that for him - when considering that it was wrongly believed Darwin agreed with 'the expulsion of morality from the natural domain'-""the height of absurdity was reached when Dawkins explicitly disavowed Darwin, telling an interviewer in 1997 that 'in our political and social life we are entitled to throw out Darwinism.'"" He doesn't appreciate Dawkin's ability to be so dismissive of other beliefs.This is a good read but, as mentioned in some other reviews that I've read, I also feel that Frans de Waal is mixing two ideas that needn't be discussed together. When he does discuss some points, I often feel like saying, 'just get to the point'. He spends over a page using various works of art to comment on how we react to them and how it shows our bodily empathy.It felt like he introduced this list of art to fill a few pages. There can often be much speculation based on what he observes in the bonobos and humans themselves. There are often times when I feel he speculates too much. Though I will say that I was pleased to hear another one of his many examples that'humans most prone to yawn contagion also have the most empathy'. That is pleasing to know since simply reading the word yawn sets me off :).I have enjoyed reading this book but when he stated 'My first book on this topic, Good Natured (1996), barely mentioned religion' I almost wish I had read that instead."
281,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/196037-jrobertus,5,"De Waal is a primatologist with a philosophical bent. I have read several of his books; they are not only interesting but important. He shows from his experimental work the basis for morality in our simian ancestors. They have empathy and an innate sense of fairness, required for communal living an hunting, that sets the basis for a moral code. (His experiments showing a sense of fairness in monkeys is fmous and the subject of a terrific TED tak). Region, or other social institutions, build on this inherent bent. De Waal describes morality as bottom up and not top down. Although he is atheist himself, he takes issue with the “neo atheists” like Hitchins and Dawkins who are aggressive in attacking religion. He urges tolerance and open mindedness and to not be as dogmatic as relious fundamentalists. He feels religion plays an important role in the social structure of close knit groups, it is robust (whereas science is new, difficult, “unnatural” and therefore fragile in an all out battle with religion). He feels northern Europe is carrying out a large scale gradual experiment in secularism. Can education and the state take over the amalgamating role of relion and make a strong, moral society without religion? We'll see eventually. Certainty efforts to remove religion by force, like the communists and Khmer rouge, have been horrible failures, worse than the superstition and dogmatism they wanted to replace. The animal work, an observations of behaviour, that De Waal uses to support his arguments are interesting in their own right. This is a most worthwhile read for its science and for the way science can inform philosophy and politics.De Waal is a hero of mine; he is an imaginative scientist, and a mature reviewer of the biological basis of empathy, altruism, and morality. In this book he continues his eye-opening work on the behavior of primates, especially our nearest relatives, the chimps and bonobos. His careful monitoring of their behavior in laboratories and in the wild, points out the ancient foundation of moral behavior among animals living in interdependent societies. In this book he also addresses the ongoing debate between religion, particularly fundamentalists, and science. Although he is an atheist he sees the value in religious practice and bonding, if not in the dogma. He takes aim at the “new atheists”, like Hitchens and Dawkins, and chides them for a combative and often insulting tone that does not help bridge the social gap. The tone of this book is so mature and thoughtful it is quite humbling. I wish I could be more like him."
282,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71935584-ben-zimmerman,3,"As a book about fascinating and well-told narratives about animal behavior and cognition, I would give this book a better rating (as I would rate many of Frans De Waal’s books). However, the purpose of this book seemed to be more about a reflection of religion and a bit of a criticism of the “new atheists”. I thought that the religious reflections weren’t very interesting and often wrong in the way that he characterized the views of both many atheists and many religious people. Some of his reflections and connections seemed disconnected and not well thought out. I would definitely recommend reading Frans de Waal, but maybe a different book. "
283,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10397934-erich,3,"Somewhat meandering in its approach, this book does make some convincing and enlightening arguments that I am happy to ponder. Frans de Waal's obvious expertise in primate prosocial behavior gives him an excellent vantage point to show that morality certainly evolved well before any religious institutions were established, especially as we know them today. The anecdotes are enticing and revealing, and really make the thesis very compelling. Primatology sounds even more fascinating when we see ourselves so vividly reflected in his vignettes. Some of the digressions into how we are to deal with morality and religion in the face of scientific progress are less persuasive. I did not find de Waal's writing to be particularly cohesive or share the logical argumentative power of a Dawkins or Hitchens. Towards the end of the book I finally began to grasp his viewpoint, and mostly embraced it, but there was no feeling of real enlightenment. I think the book overall, and some of its arguments, could have been better organized. The book did serve a good counterpoint to what de Waal calls ""neo-Atheists"" such as Sam Harris, Dawkins, and Hitchens (well, ""Marxist"" for him), though I happen to love these authors. If you are looking for that, it has its moments. I have to admit that I had problems with de Waal's recommendation to give modern religion so much leeway and to dispense with the heated ""anti-religious"" rhetoric of those mentioned above. While humans may be naturally predisposed to accepting religion as a form of social normalizing (which I agree has had its place in our civilizing process), this doesn't mean it we should accept it as necessary today. Its stranglehold on truth in the face of scientific evidence does nothing to enforce our common morality. If anything, it holds us back from truly understanding our place in the universe and extending a moral code to everyone. I see a need for more strong voices opposed to this willful ignorance and dogma, not fewer. All in all, a good read with some nice points. And bonobos!"
284,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13928228-sortal,1,"Muddy thinking, misrepresentation (or ignorance?) of atheist arguments, and lots of irrelevant passages on Hieronymus Bosch. I've really enjoyed other books by Frans de Waal, but this is an unsuccessful departure from his areas of expertise. Insofar as I can figure out what de Waal is arguing for, I agree with most of his premises: 1. Moral conduct exists on a continuum, including the behaviours of other animals.2. Dogmatism is terrible and should be avoided. 3. Religion is superfluous to morality. 4. Hardline atheism is unlikely to persuade the devoutly religious to give up their faith.But then things go wrong. 5. De Waal never addresses whether religion is inherently dogmatic. (Insofar as it's faith-based, where faith is belief without evidence, it certainly seems that way.) 6. De Waal never addresses the harm done by religion (a crucial point made by the thinkers he so blithely dismisses, such as Dawkins and Harris). 7. De Waal claims (without any supporting argument) that religion will always exist.If you replaced the passages on Bosch with a fair representation of the atheists de Waal is arguing against, you'd have a wonderful book. Better still would be a book using de Waal's research to build on the project of Harris' Moral Landscape, helping to create an alternative to religion (the logical next step from premises 2-4 once you accept 5 and 6 and dismiss 7). Instead, you get an infuriatingly murky read of jumbled ideas with just enough interesting anecdotes about primates to keep you reading through the rambling about Bosch.   "
285,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,5,"The book really should have been titled ""The Bonobo and Human Empathy"". The two pillars of all philosophy are empathy and reciprocity. He completely examines the first pillar, empathy, by illustrating empathetic behavior in Bonobos (and other animals) and linking it to our behavior.He's such a good writer even when he wrote about things I completely disagreed with I would find the book thought provoking. I thought he trivialized the arguments of Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens and John Stuart Mill. But, I'm not bothered. I believe what I believe and I appreciated the different perspective.The narrator did a perfect job.The book is much better than most pop science books I have listened to and I'm much richer for having listened to this highly entertaining book and can definitely say because of this book I'm much closer to my goal of understanding our place in the universe. He does talk about philosophy but I enjoyed those parts as much as I did about bonobos.(P.S. Matt Ridley's book, ""The Rational Optimist"", fully covers the second pillar of human philosophy, reciprocity. Also, my personal take on the author he seemed like an apologetic atheist and he didn't want to offend anyone. But as I say, I wasn't bothered by this, but I disagreed with him regarding those sections. Also, he seemed to characterized the utilitarianism of John Stuart Mill in a comic book fashion. Once again I wasn't bothered but I don't want to leave the impression that I agreed with him on those two points)."
286,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51675760-mark-james,3,"I really enjoyed learning about the idiosyncrasies of many of the primates, as well as having a better sense of the differences between bonobos and chimps. Choosing Bosch's ""The Garden of Earthly Delights"" as a focal point was interesting on de Waal's part. I couldn't help but feel the book could have been better organized, as the topic shifts from bonobos to religion to morality to art without any obvious structure. Finally, there were several points made about atheism that don't hold up to scrutiny. For instance, he writes, ""Everything humans have accomplished anywhere - from architecture to music, from art to science - developed hand in hand with religion, never separately."" Do you mean, de Waal, that religion has existed at the same time that these wonderful things were created, or that all people who created these things were religious? Certainly neither is true. In fact, most examples of human achievement come in spite of religion, not because of it.Elsewhere, de Waal faults Christopher Hitchens for shifting loyalties several times before landing on an antitheist stance. To me, this only means that Hitchens was tireless in his pursuit of truth.I detected countless other examples of unfair judgments, but overall, the author tends to take the safe middle ground when failing to acknowledge that anything we can do without belief in the supernatural, we can do without it, and then some."
287,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3050574-a-b-gayle,3,"Humanism and the BonoboI struggled to get through this book while I was totally immersed in another of his, questioning whether humans were smart enough to understand animals. I think part of my alienation arose because of his obsession with Heironymous Bosch’s art. (I thought he was an LAPD detective, lol!)Basically, I totally agree with the main premise of this book. Best summed up in the final chapter.Thank God, if I may, we share with other primates a background as group animals, which makes us value social connections. Absent this background, religion could be preaching about virtue and vice until it became blue in the face, we’d never get its point. We are receptive only because of our evolved grasp of the value of relationships, the benefits of cooperation, the need for trust and honesty, and so on. Even our sense of fairness derives from this background.In other words, we are receptive to religion (some might say vulnerable) simply because we like other mammals have empathy and value relationships, the benefits of cooperation, the need for trust and honesty, and so on. Even our sense of fairness derives from this background. But just because something is possible doesn’t mean it is necessary.Throughout the preceding chapters, he has shown different ways this morality manifests itself within the animal kingdom. He refutes the notion that if it weren’t for religion, humans would be no better than animals. In fact he states Morality arose first, and modern religion latched onto it. Instead of giving us the moral law, the large religions were invented to bolster it. We are only just beginning to explore how religion does so by binding people together and enforcing good behavior. It is far from my intention to minimize this role, which was vital in the past and may remain so in the foreseeable future, but the wellspring of morality it is not.In fact he sees the evolutionary development of this bottom up morality that has allowed us to develop to where we are today.So why not give this a higher rating?Firstly, the continual referral to the Bosch painting “The Garden” which seemed a stretch at times to illustrate a point he was making. We can no more know why Bosch painted it the way he did than know what Bonobos are actually thinking.Sure, studying them in the wild and conducting experiments can demonstrate that they have recognisable emotions, but in one section he has Bonobos thinking about what atheists would be thinking. So that was my second star off.The third star off is for his dodgy logic in many sections. Take for example his dismissal of the Golden Rule of Christianity (Do unto others as you would have them do unto you).To give a rather crude example, if at a conference I follow an attractive woman whom I barely know to her hotel room and jump into her bed uninvited, I can pretty well guess how she’d react. If I explain that I am just doing to her what I would love her to do to me, I’m afraid my appeal to the golden rule won’t fly. Or, let’s assume that I knowingly serve pork sausages to a vegan. Liking meat myself, I am just following the golden rule, but the vegan will consider my behavior obnoxious, perhaps even immoral.In both cases he has only looked at the physical side of the equation, not the effects of those acts. Would he like someone to rape him or insult his beliefs? You can’t divorce the act from the motive or consequence of the act. If all three are taken into account, the Golden Rule still applies.Chapter 7 particularly had some lazy logic. Whereas in previous chapters I’d been highlighting very well presented arguments, this one is full of my exasperation at the arguments used to justify the need for religion in society. Take this one for example.We humans were plenty moral when we still roamed the savanna in small bands. Only when the scale of society began to grow and rules of reciprocity and reputation began to falter did a moralizing God become necessary.But perhaps the “necessity” for this moralising God and his acolytes comes about because the chances of having a psychopath or control freak who wants this power (in the form of a controlling religion) has increased because of the larger population? He had already acknowledged that personalities varied within animal groups, so the ‘need’ for religion could just as easily be attributed to statistics producing people who wanted power for power’s sake.Interestingly when you look at early Greek and Roman religion, the gods just existed. They were used to explain the unexplainable. It was only later that the gods started telling people how to behave. I’m pretty sure the population of Ancient Greeks and Romans was not insignificant.But let’s look at another lazy analogy The whole purpose of God is to do the latter (loving moral actions). We endowed him with the capacity to keep us on the same straight and narrow that we’d been following ever since we lived in small bands.How different is this from the concept of Santa Claus being used to make children behave? Adults understand that rewards that are achievable are the best ways to control children. Likewise those who perceive the need to control large numbers of adults do so by playing up to the fears that adults have (as evidenced previously in this chapter) - a fear of death and hence the need for an afterlife.While I can see his point that a focusing deity that encourages people to be good is not bad, but the dogma that accompanies it and the divisions this creates makes me question whether this need could be better met in other ways or at least recognised for what is really happening. Perhaps the need is more that many individuals are not going to take orders from one of their own, but prefer that order to come from some unquestionably alpha figure.So my final verdict? Animals follow their own form of moral code developed in response to the betterment of their community. While some humans are still capable of doing this, others through laziness, unwillingness to kowtow to one of their own issuing instructions or fear of their mortality need some sort of mystical religion to guide their actions. I added another star back in because he made a good case for respecting that animals at times are better socialised than many humans."

He is instead writing meandering thought provoking but far more personal account of humanism and science. His constant reference to the Bosch painting which he uses as a metaphor is an irritant. From this and his forays into philosophical discussions on the nature of God and morality, its obvious he's writing more of a personal discussion which he's entitled to after years of work. One of the frequent arguments for the existence of God is the cited need for moral law. Its the existence of God and his instruction to man that sets us apart, apparently. De Waal successful challenges that assumption citing evidence of moral behavior in not only primates but in other larger social animals such as dolphins and elephants. From this he proposes that morality is derived from the social nature of animals and has an bottoms up origins as opposed to the top down model proposed by various religions. Pulling it all together, he makes a compelling argument that morality is the basis for religion and a belief in God and not the other way around. An excellent read with a good and interesting argument. "
289,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/119364-melee-farr,3,"The premise of the book was right up my alley - examining the roots of morality (and ultimately religion) from a larger mammalian perspective. And I think it was effective on that front. de Waal is a primatologist, first and foremost, and there were countless examples from his and others' research, observations, and publications of moral behavior existing consistently in the animal world, with sound evolutionary reasoning for pro-social behaviors being retained throughout mammalian phylogeny. I flew through the first half of the book. He uses Bosch's triptych painting ""Garden of Earthly Delights"" as a recurring metaphor throughout the book, and honestly, he lost me with it. I mean, I understood the metaphor, but, to use another, it was kind of beating a dead horse. This may reveal the fact that I'm not particularly well-versed in the visual arts. He also is rather dismissive of atheism as often aggressive and exclusionary, and permissive of religion because he sees it as inevitable and having some consistently positive societal traits. Both points are well-made, but may whitewash the good done by skepticism and the evil done by dogmatism. But that perspective may also just reveal my bias. "
290,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6664778-andrea,3,"Tracing the beginning of morality may be as close as our fellow primates the Bonobos, as de Waal explains in this book. I am interested in the topic of the origins of morality and the book has a flow that kept me reading. I do think de Waal has a little Richard Dawkins envy though. Richard Dawkins is simply a better writer. This author makes the point that although morality predates religion there is no point in egging on the religious majority by calling such religious beliefs delusional, which in fact Dawkins does. I agree it is pointless and may be even counter productive however I feel the author fails to give due the bias that atheists face, bias that denies us jobs, social status and even basic human rights. Try getting into high political positions as an outed atheist. Frans does a disservice to human rights when he says that there is no reason to state an atheist agenda, and I agree, but what about a human agenda? Frans doesn't take the biases seriously enough. This being said the book is worth a read to remind us of our roots, to connect with fellow primates and to learn more about the origins of morality."
291,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5318025-nina,3,"Frans de Waal's research is impressive, and I found his insights into primate behaviors, including those of humans, very interesting. However, if the purpose of his study had to do with religion and morality, then he failed to connect the two sides of the book (primatology and religion). By the time I finished the book, my big questions were, What does religion have to do with this study? and What does Bosch have to do with primatology? Personal admiration for the painter does not constitute expertise, and while interesting, the bursts of art history did not in any way advance de Waal's argument, especially because they did not rely on art history so much as on the author's personal responses to The Garden of Earthly Delights. Sadly, de Waal does not really understand atheists either, neither old-school nor the ones he refers to as ""neo-atheists."" Personal opinions rather than data dominate this book, and opinions do not prove very much. The lack of hard evidence for the arguments on morality is only part of the problem, though. The author's attempts at wit are offensive to many readers, and together with speculation rather than evidence hurt the book's message. "
292,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11200007-douglas-cosby,1,"1.5 stars (the extra half point is for the narrator): Not my bag. I read the first third of this book, but couldn't get any further. Franz de Waal's point is simple: morality is a result of evolution, not imposed by religion or ""invented"" by humans. A very good point, and I sympathize with de Waal's frustration with biologists/scientists that fall prey to the rampant anthropomorphism we humans tend to overlay on the way we see other animals. He uses a few scientific studies, but mainly just anecdotes and cute stories, to justify his position, and this book feels more like a feel-good article in O magazine than something that would be in Scientific American or Nature. Additionally, while de Waal harshly criticizes recent atheist authors, it doesn't seem like he has really read them. For instance, his criticism of Sam Harris's The Moral Landscape, seems like it came from the back-of-the-book summary, not the actual details of the book. If you are in the mood for a bunch of touching ape stories, then this book might be for you. If you are looking for a book on the scientific basis of prehuman morality supported by scientific evidence and logical conclusions, look elsewhere."
293,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5078550-robert-bor,4,"I got this book from my friends, who appreciate my interest in evolution, politics and society. Frans de Waal weaves two different threads in this book. On the one hand, he proceeds to show clearly how animals (the Bonobo primate in particular) have an extremely good sense of moralistic behavior. This undermines the argument that moralistic behavior is one of the primary consequences of religion. No, not just undermines, evaporates. This is where he weaves in the other thread, where he distances himself from the Atheist camp (Dawkins et al) and states that religion should not just be abandoned if we cannot replace it with something else. He understands the need of humans for spirituality and does not just wish this away. In the dual aspect, a bit of a weird combination, but understandable, since being seen in the Atheist camp, pretty much shuts you out from dialogue with the religious one. Is Mr de Waal aiming for a diplomatic role in bringing the two camps closer together? On another note, if you like the work of Hiëronymus Bosch, know that it features prominently in this book."
294,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7349461-cody,3,"This book had its ups and downs. de Waal's argument for morality emerging from bottom-up processes is convincing, and I really enjoyed when he would dive into the details of primate research, as well his many anecdotes. This alone makes the book worth reading. I do, however, think he was quite off the mark with his criticism of the ""neo-Atheists"" (i.e., the New Atheists). On top of the misguided attacks (A.C. Grayling addresses some of these in a review in Prospect Magazine http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/mag...), at times he comes across as patronizing. He stresses the need for religion to help secure ethics among the masses (at least at present), while apparently considering himself fully capable of living morally without religion. That said, I think the book drives home some good points (especially in the final chapters), and will get both believers and non-believers thinking about some of these issues."
295,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8076824-geoff,3,"I have a soft spot for primates, and books on morality are catching my attention at the moment so I thought I would have enjoyed this book more than I did. I also recently read The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt, so I can't help but compare the two. While I did enjoy this book more than The Righteous Mind, I still gave both books three stars. Frans de Waal's writing style is much more enjoyable and conversational than Haidt's. However, there seemed to be less science involved in this book. I know there are countless endnotes and references at the back of the book, but somehow the observations came across as purely anecdotal. While I agree with de Waal's bottom up approach to morality, rather than from top down, I didn't find that the strength of his arguments would convince anyone who don't already believe as he does."
296,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6323134-darcey,3,"I found this an interesting read, though perhaps one with more extraneous information than I wanted. I enjoyed de Waal's anecdotes and commentary about Bosch and how that was related to humanity, symbolism, and the growth of ideas - however, there was more of it than necessary (including recounting experiences of being at the Prado in Madrid). The linkage between the fact that primates (and other animals) exhibit traits which we as humans consider ""moral"" - and that animals do not follow religion - is clear, leaving us with no way to avoid the conclusion de Waal sets out to prove: morality is not something encoded purely by religion, and those who believe that without religion humans will descend to immoral madness have a significant amount of evidence to overcome to prove their position. "
297,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5777523-jami,4,"This was a well researched, informative book. I was not familiar with Frans de Waal's work before this book, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I thought there would be more focus on the Bonobo anecdotes, but there were enough to keep me entertained and interested. This book looks at the issue of what the source of morality and other behaviors is; it combines many areas of study, including religion, philosophy, science, sociology, psychology, and history. While parts of the book dragged a little, overall it was well done. There were some parts of the book that fascinated me and that I had never considered before, such as the yawn response in relation to empathy; I also particularly enjoyed the passages about specific behaviors usually only attributed to humans that are found in bonobos and other species. The narration was very good and easy to listen to."
298,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/906313-diane,3,"This was a surprisingly interesting argument on the origin of morality. In a spiritual context, morality is something that is imposed by God with commandments and injunctions, etc. deWaal, however, draws from his many years as a primatologist to suggest that morality is an internal motivator, something that is inherent within us and those species most closely related to us. The bonobo is his primary example of a primate that clearly demonstrates moral qualities such as empathy. I found it very interesting to listen to, but kind of disorganized. And since de Waal frequently mentions the Hieronymus Bosch painting, ""Garden of Earthly Delight,"" I wished I had that image on hand. Nevertheless, I enjoyed de Waal's ideas and his intelligent presentation."
299,0393073777,http://goodreads.com/user/show/746637-sally,4,"A thoughtful consideration of the origins of morality in humanity's evolutionary past. The author's work with primates, and less frequently with other social mammals, provides convincing evidence for a continuity of development of consciousness and empathetic/moral behavior between humankind and other animals. It successfully combats the idea that humans and other social animals are at the core selfish, with altruism as a thin, self-serving veneer; that without top-down religious mandates, such as the 10 commandments, people would live in a nightmare Hobbesian world; and that ""selfish gene"" theories are a adequate way of understanding and interpreting an organism's behavior and motivations. An enjoyable read."
