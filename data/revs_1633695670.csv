0,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This is a pretty good book about how artificial intelligence (AI) can be applied to businesses. It is not a technical book--you won't find any details about the wide range of technologies being used for machine learning. Instead, you will find many ingenious ways to put AI to use, as well as all the business ramifications. Three professionals from Toronto's Rotman School of management collaborated to write this book. The book is unified, and reads as if it were written by a single person. However, it is not a particularly engaging book. There is no entertainment value here, definitely no humor. It is a no-nonsense book--almost in the style of a textbook, with good summaries at the end of each chapter. But, the book is not dry, and is easy to read. It is filled with interesting stories and anecdotes. The basic premise of the book is that the cost of prediction is dropping. Prediction is at the heart of decision-making, so decisions should, overall improve. And, as decisions improve, so should productivity.The pitfalls of prediction machines are also described. I just love the story about a chess-playing machine during the early days of AI. The machine was fed games from the great grandmasters of chess. The machine successfully analyzed static board positions and suggested good moves. Then, when the machine was programmed to play complete games, something strange happened. Early in its games, it often would sacrifice its queen with no apparent benefit. It turns out the grandmasters occasionally would sacrifice a queen when a masterful quick checkmate could follow. But, the machine could not see that sacrificing a queen without comparable reward was not a good move. "

It paints a picture of a world where the only barrier to self-driving cars is a sufficiently rich training set so that the AI can predict what a driver would do, This is not a world where pesky problems of feature engineering, embodyment, real world resource constraints, or even ethical concerns will make development of many AI solution challenging, if not impossible.On the plus side the book acknowledges the difference between ‘decisions’ and ‘judgement’, though it defines judgement very narrowly, and it realises that jobs will be redefined rather than eliminated in many cases. But then it fails to realise that in a world where prediction is cheap, then managing the unpredictable is where all the value is (i.e. business exceptions), and the more we improve prediction the more valuable the unpredictable becomes, it doesn’t even acknowledge the many things that might limit prediction, and completely ignores the importance of learning by doing at the operational coal face.An overly simplistic and narrowly focused book that will soon be dated."

If you aren't familiar with AI, this is probably a very good introduction, although the examples will date very quickly and some of them are plain incorrect (e.g. face tags now sync across Mac and iOS). The point about prediction being a central part of AI is well-made and important, but like most popular economics books, they take this new insight rather too far and with too much confidence."
3,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak,5,"I've read a lot of book on artificial intelligence--this is by far the best one. The others were good, but mostly focused on defining what it is from a technical standpoint. And they all shared ideas on how to use it. But not until I read this one did I realize that all the others are focused on specific situations. This book is the first I've read that focuses on the principles behind the specifics. For example, they frame AI as a prediction tool, and then discuss the ways that our life and work with change when prediction is ubiquitous and cheap. This leads to a lot of interesting points, including noticing that prediction is only a part of decision making (not the whole decision). And then you can look at jobs and see what parts of the job are prediction parts and what are not (e.g. truck drivers do more than predict how the other cars on the road will react, they also negotiate with people on both ends of the delivery). Absolutely wonderful future/strategy book. If that's your jam, you'll love this one."
4,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18825813-david-veitch,4,"This review originally appeared on my website: https://daveveitch.wordpress.com/2018...Recently I read Prediction Machines by Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans, and Avi Goldfarb, three professors from UofT’s Rotman School of Management. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to go ‘beyond the headlines’ with respect to what impact on the world machine learning & AI will have.Topic“Where others see transformational new innovation, we see a simple fall in price.”The key idea the book revolves around is that machine learning & AI have brought about a dramatic fall in the price of prediction. The authors argue this fall in price will lead to the emergence of new business models (similar to how new business models emerged as Google search became popular), and it will also increase the value of other things (e.g. sensors which accurately capture data will become more valuable).ReviewThis may be the best book yet I have read in the ‘machine learning/AI/robots will transform our world’ genre. Part of the reason why is that Prediction Machines does not try to do too much. The authors focus on a few key ideas (as mentioned above), and then carefully evaluate the ramifications of them. The authors’ writing style is clear (the chapter-by-chapter bullet points help with this), and back their arguments up with numerous real-world examples. The book is similar in some ways to Martin Ford’s Rise of the Robots, and the overall style is reminiscent of Robert Shiller’s Animal Spirits.Two things I was not wild about. I found the section ‘Part 3: Tools’ a bit dry, and wish the authors had gone into a little bit more detail about how machine learning actually works (potentially via an appendix).Best BitsA few sections/arguments/examples I found interesting:- Rating agencies’ models before the financial crisis did not sufficiently incorporate how housing prices are correlated across regions. “Machine learning enables predictions based on unanticipated correlations”, and this feature could have been helpful at the time. (pg. 37)- “The value of substitutes to prediction machines, namely human prediction, will decline. However, the value of complements, such as the human skills associated with data collection, judgment, and actions, will become more valuable.” (pg. 81)- “The recent developments in AI and machine learning have convinced us that this innovation is on par with the great, transformative technologies of the past: electricity, cars, plastics, the microchip, the internet, and the smartphone”. (pg. 155)- The authors cite an interesting example of how in the 1930s a new strain of higher yielding corn took a very long time to become widely used in some states (e.g. Texas, Alabama). Part of the reason for this was that farms in these states were smaller & less profitable, making experimentation on new corn varieties hard to justify. The authors argue that the large profit margins of firms like Google/Facebook are enabling them to experiment broadly with AI techniques, and “reap huge rewards from successful experiments by applying them across a wide range of products operating at large scale”. (pg. 160)"
5,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6200323-david-ball,4,"I was recently asked to organize my company’s strategic offsite. I wanted a keynote speaker who could discuss machine learning and its impact on the investment industry. I came across the name, Ajay Agrawal, the founder of Creative Destruction Labs - a remarkable organization at the forefront of science, data, and technology based in Toronto - and the author Prediction Machines. Agrawal’s premise is fascinating: as predictions get cheaper to make it will change how we use them - similar to how cheaper electric lighting changed our working environment in the 1800s, or how cheaper computing power changed the way we used mathematics in the late twentieth century. Apparently predictions will become so cost effective and accurate that Amazon’s algorithms will eventually get so good at figuring out what we want and when we want it, that the company will change its business model from sending us goods after we order and pay for them to before - an idea I find both intriguing and terrifying. While some of the book’s prophesies may be disconcerting, this is hardly an anxious or dispiriting tome. Agrawal offers a more hopeful note by identifying roles for humans to play when machines take over the world, generally to apply judgement and common sense. There are some drier, more policy based sections, but for the most part this is a compelling, very readable book. If at times it was a little slow-going, it was not because it was overly heavy or badly written; but because there was so much thought-provoking material that I paused often - every other sentence at times - to daydream, ponder and contemplate."
6,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12925436-annie,4,"It is difficult to have a timely and relevant book on such a broad topic as artificial intelligence; some parts will be familiar while other parts are new and fascinating. This book would probably interest knowledge workers or anyone wanting to know how AI is changing our environment and behaviors. For example, we used to review our credit card statements to see if there were any fraudulent charges. Now based on our purchasing habits, credit card companies are flagging possible fraudulent charges and declining those transactions without needing input from us.Some AI stories are familiar, like the driverless car. Some are new and inconceivable, like Amazon's patent for 'ship and shop.' Currently, we decide what we want to buy, click on those items on Amazon, and they're shipped to us ('shop and ship'). In the future, Amazon expects to know its customers so well that it can ship the items to us (before we've thought about buying them) and we return only those items we don't want."
7,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45400893-pravin,3,"The book was a good high level introduction to AI and its implications, especially from a business perspective. It was very repetitive at times but this allows the core message to come across clearly: AI helps with making more accurate and faster predictions. Hence, when you find that the cost of prediction falls, industries are either disrupted or new industries proliferate.Overall, three stars (more likely makes sense as a three-and-a-half) for being informative but not providing a significant number of fresh insights throughout the book."

The authors insightful journey into the topic will leave you surprised by how transformative this technological waves will be and what's the importance of its economics are for how it will unfold."
9,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11302400-marco,4,"The authors provide a good framework for understanding the changes that Artificial Intelligence effect in businesses and the economy. A book that avoids getting excessively technical (either about economics or computer science) while still avoiding the hype and shallowness of most discussions on the theme. A greater attention to the impacts of AI on outside stakeholders could have improved the overall result, but the book still achieves its framing goals."
10,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4623512-yousef-m,4,"Topic:A practical examination of understanding innovations In Artificial Intelligence (specifically Machine Learning) and how commercial applications of AI have already impacted (and will continue to affect) business models, the role of government, and the economic and social relationship between machines and human.Style:The three authors are professors of economics at U of Toronto Rotman School of Management who are also founders of an innovation incubator with investments in AI and deep learning. The book is written in less technical language and clearly aimed at consultants and c-suites on how to unpack the full impact of AI for work flow and business models. If you’re interested in deeper dive on the technical side of machine learning, this is not the book for you. For all practical purposes, this book assumes the relevance of AI/machine learning is increased accuracy and cost-efficiency for making predictions.Organization:The book is divided into five sections addressing (1) the nature of Prediction and how creating a taxonomy to guide the rest of the discussion (known-knowns, known-unknowns, unknown-unknowns are fairly straightforward; unknown-knowns were new to me and are particularly relevant to the discussion of AI), (2) Decision Making, particularly how it is divided and the role of judgment, (3) Tools and how AI will impact work flows, decision-making, and jobs, (4) Strategy, giving sage advice on preparing one's company for the impact of AI and how to mitigate against certain risks, and (5) Society, a larger discussion on how AI will affect the environment in which people and businesses will operate. Takeaway:An accessible introduction to artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), particularly for unpacking the practical effects AI/ML may (or may not) have on commercial ventures. I initially thought the book's lack of any technical aspects would limit insights to dinner party small talk, but was pleasantly surprised that avoiding scientific lectures (that would likely be outdated by publication) in favor of conversational thought-experiments and economic insights forced me to think critically about why any of this matters. A recurring example the authors use is improving the accuracy of predicting shopping habits can radically alter a business like Amazon from a ""shop-then-ship"" to a ""ship-then-shop"" model; that is, if the likelihood of a customer returning a recommended item falls below a certain threshold, then Amazon's costs for returned items (both for processing returns and customer dissatisfaction) will be outweighed by a greater likelihood the customer is satisfied by this automated convenience and will keep (and pay for) an item they may not yet have shopped for or known about. The authors go back to this hypothetical in exploring various ideas, including: -how businesses will feel the impact of AI/ML (the short answer is reduction in cost for certain predictions, which will increase the use and demand for predictions and create downstream opportunities; good historical comparisons are the internet reducing the cost of searching or electrical lighting reducing the cost of reading);-how AI/ML improvements will impact work flows and the division of labor (computers are now better at identifying certain images, e.g., x-rays, than humans are, so the relationship of computers to a human component, e.g., radiologist, may frontload reliance on computers for an initial analysis and shift non-codifiable judgment/decision making to humans to optimize time and error reduction);-how AI/ML improvements will impact allocation of a company's resources (better predictions could mean less investment in capital equipment since you can predict when to contract out specific capital-intensive tasks; certain risk management solutions like biopsies and airport lounges may be utilized more sparingly with better predictions using non-invasive testing or airport commuting);-how AI/ML improvements will impact job training (if AI/ML is meant to accurately predict how humans currently behave, e.g., how doctors identify anomalies in medical imagining, at some point machines may become so much better than humans, the programming will become a victim of its own success if there are not enough model humans to retrain the AI if the old data is no longer reliable);-grappling with when to embrace AI/ML innovation (innovator's dilemma is choosing whether to adopt early to learn from customers and gather data but risk poor performance in the short term OR keep existing customers happy and adopt a more proven model later but risk losing market position to more early-adopter competition; another benefit of early adoption is helping set standards for a nascent technology); and -how risk tolerance for prediction accuracy across different industries influences customer adoption and incentives even incremental AI/ML improvements (think Google Mail proposed responses vs. computer-navigated driverless cars; increasing predication accuracy from 95 to 96% on when to make a right turn may be the deciding factor of when driverless cars are commercially viable and customers feel safe). As an attorney who works with many life sciences and technology companies, the importance of navigating data privacy laws (which have only starting gaining attention over the last five years) cannot be emphasized enough as it impacts every industry (finance, tech, life sciences, education, healthcare, etc.). In an era where data can be collected in innumerable and imperceptible ways and the best data gives a huge competitive advantage , citizens in the US and EU have pushed back to assert greater control over such personal information and tech companies like Apple have listened and dedicated considered PR to allay such customer fears. Nevertheless, the authors astutely recognize the inherent innovative advantage that China and other countries without a data privacy legal regime may have in innovating without legal hurdles. The authors correctly observe the political implications that AI/ML will have on the shift in balance of national income derived from labor vs. capital owners, which we’re already seeing in compensatory policy proposals for “universal basic income” by presidential candidates. But, far from being doomsayers, the authors use historical examples of how innovation has created new opportunities that we could never have predicted. One maxim the author's proffer is how AI/ML actually increases the value of human judgment and decision-making . Certain cognitive tasks, the authors assert, simply cannot be programmed or codified given the inherent limitation of a computer's predictive capacity (think of a ""black swan"" event). This assumes that computers will never be able to accurately mimick human reasoning. Given how much ground AI/ML has covered over the last five years alone that was previously thought impossible and the ability of computers to crunch quadrillions of quantified past human decisions for any imaginable scenario, I wouldn't be surprised if a sequel book is needed to reassess how inimitable or superior human ingenuity is compared to computers."
11,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78089723-joe-flynn,4,"Very good (5* for narrow audience) if niche book on the economics of AI/machine learning. By narrow audience and mean for business leaders, decision makers, and people learning more on the subject, could be students or economists. It is explicitly aimed at them not a lay audience. It is not a computer science book, rather an economics book on the the impact of the new technology of cheap prediction - wonky but not overly complex or jargon filled. Well structured, some may just read for relevent sections of pushed for time. It is very good in avoiding buzz and bluster around these tools, seeing them just as that, though like the computing revolution that made computation cheap, this economic change of scale will push profound changes to our lives.It is also excellent in detailing what won't change and where these technologies have clear weaknesses. In particular better machine prediction will lead to a premium on human judgment in many spaces. That task is often seperated out with good reason - for now!There are many real world examples and stories that enliven the text, the writers run a AI based resource for new companies so have great access. Interesting that so many start ups are predicated on a single application, though the authors explain the real value is in powering change through the entire work flow.Interesting that the big tech companies are ""AI first"" meaning that they prioritize it over even short term customer satisfaction, the big goal is too important to slow development even if that means some of us switch services. Good and balanced on the future, with the new world being changed by AI but making a clear distinction with any possible development of GAI, that would be different gravy. Good sections on privacy, China, and the EU. As with all good books references Taversky and Khaneman :)"
12,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98872916-nish,5,"A good read for anyone with the soul of an economist and an interest in AI. The ideas presented are for the most part basic (perhaps 'foundational' is better) but they are clearly described in economic terms and in a sensible order. The authors begin by looking at the fundamental impact that AI in its current form will have on the production function of various goods/services as well as on the demand for labour, before going on to consider how company leaders might evaluate (and manage) the benefits and risks of using AI. They conclude by briefly touching on potential societal issues related to using AI (including discrimination and existential risks) although there are more comprehensive issues that deal entirely with those."
13,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43122553-masatoshi-nishimura,3,"What's magical about AI and machine learning? They let us predict better and cheaply. That's the premise of the books. Authors talk about what we as humans can do alongside with these predictions but I'd say we are far off from. Being able to perfectly predict the future. We can't even predict the GDP in 2 years. Have we heard of the pandemic coming 1 year ago? We still need to work on a lot more on being able to predict better.  Overall, I didn't find much depth in the book and it was similar to blogs we can find. AI is a popular topic nowadays anyway."
14,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54633229-agust-n-armellini-fischer,5,"”Prediction machines will have their most immediate impact at the decision level. But decisions have six other key elements. When someone (or something) makes a decision, they take input data from the world that enables a prediction. That prediction is possible because training occurred about relationships between different types of data and which data is most closely associated with a situation. Combining the prediction with judgment on what matters, the decision maker can then choose an action. The action leads to an outcome (which has an associated reward or payoff). The outcome is a consequence of the decision. It is needed to provide a complete picture. The outcome may also provide feedback to help improve the next prediction.”As the Canadian rock band Rush used to sing: “If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.”Decision making is at the core of most occupations. From doctors deciding what medicine to prescribe, to truck drivers deciding how to respond to route closures and traffic accidents, we are constantly making decisions in our day to day life.The anatomy of a decision is formed by trying to predict the outcome of the different actions that could be taken given an input. Judgment will decide which is our preferable outcome. For instance, we can predict that it will rain tomorrow and we can decide if given that we want to take an umbrella with us or not. Since we don’t want to carry with the umbrella all day, our judgment will be not to take it even though there is a high probability that it will rain and we might get wet.From predicting if an image contains a cat to predicting what is the answer to “Alexa, what is the capital of France?”, AI has become extremely good at guessing what would humans respond to those questions.Still, AI’s judgment is yet not good enough to substitute us in a lot of cases. In Prediction Machines, three economists look at the future of AI by framing AI as cheap predictions. If predictions suddenly become cheap, how will businesses that rely on them evolve? What will all these humans that work predicting outcomes focus on instead? Will they focus solely on the judgment part of a decision? How will that affect their jobs?Probably one of the best books on the topic of AI that I’ve read so far. This is a must read!"
15,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47111898-daniela-d,5,"The rundown- this is a really good book about the current positioning of machine learning within a socio-economic framework. It is written from the perspective of a few economists, so there is almost no technical jargon. You only need to know in broad terms what ML is or can do. The book is full, although not overflowing with examples, but the ones used are quite good and illustrate the points the authors are trying to make really well. Now a little spoiler alert- the main argument of the book is that ML cannot yet produce artificial intelligence ( at least as fas as multiple basic tasks are concerned), but what it currently does really well is fill in some information gaps in our decision-making process, by providing predictions. The authors argue that it is then up to humans to actually make a judgment based on the presumed impact of each prediction. The value of this judgment is almost impossible to code because the combinations are so mamy and sometimes rare. Ultimately, using AI in the eyes of economists does not mean a new AI economy. All the supply and demand still holds. What changes is the speed of decisions, because predictions are cheaper and faster. This also means, like with amything else that improves in terms of speed and price, that the value of the human employment in that role will decrease, with jobs either focusing on other tasks (the bus driver for a school bus would still be there to supervise the children) or lose considerable income. Additionally, the authors disagree with Nick Bostrom's paperclip AI that will use all of the world's resources. They believe proper in the invisible hand that will lead this AI to trade rather than destroy, i.e. to some sort of an equilibrium. Bottom line, the book is really good, a welcomed and different view about the place of AI from the perspective of economists, with a lot of food for thought and discussion!"

I think I thought it was going to be slow going, but it turns out that I whizzed through it in a day or so. I wasn’t too worried about the subject matter, even though it’s non-fiction about artificial intelligence from the Harvard Business Review press.This was actually recommended to me by a client of mine, Emmanuel Fombu, who specialises in writing and talking about the future of healthcare. It was a good recommendation on his part, especially because there is some stuff here that focusses directly on the impact of artificial intelligence in the healthcare industry. But it’s not just healthcare that’s covered here, and indeed I think the authors did a good job of covering a wide variety of different use cases.It was also interesting to read right now because my current “bedtime book” is The Enigma by Andrew Hodges, a biography of Alan Turing. His work had a huge impact on the development of artificial intelligence and what the authors here call “prediction machines”, and indeed one of the main tests that an AI must pass if it’s to be able to pass as a human is named after Turing: the Turing Test.All in all then, if you have an interest in AI and the way in which it’s changing our society, read this."

It starts from what actually matters in AI, prediction, goes on to talk about how we apply prediction and how multiple fields have changed completely after we decided to go for a prediction approach (like translation, that stopped being something that was trying to be done with linguistics and became a prediction problem) and how this shift in paradigm completely changes how we should look and try to use AI in business.The book then goes on multiple examples of AI usage right now and how it could affect the future (amazon moving to a ship and purchase solution instead of the current purchase and ship) and how companies can make use of this. It doesn't provide recipes, models or magical solutions as to how your company can benefit from AI, this is something you have to figure out yourself, which makes this book even better as it doesn't try to pretend to have a formula for success.It's not very technical and does not talk about algorithms or anything like that, this is a great investment even if you're not in the field and are only looking for learning more about AI."

Steeped in both economics and AI/ML, this book steers clear of hype (or anti-hype), applying standard economic concepts to a rapidly emerging phenomenon. The book is geared to business readers not economists or policymakers but it has a lot to offer to everyone.At the heart of the book is the concept that AI/ML is a ""prediction machine"" that is dramatically lowering the cost of making predictions, which will lead to making it cheaper to engage in existing practices but also will open up new possibilities. The authors mostly focus on what businesses need to do in order to take advantage of those opportunities but with a some broader social/political/policy context.Highly recommended."

That said, this book is great for someone familiar with the concept of AI & curious about how it may (or may not) impact business in general, but doesn’t need a length functional/technical review. I found it really interesting and written simply; it wasn’t formulas or math but a simple cause-and-effect look at how the cost of computer-based prediction (AI) is falling, and what that will mean to other industries. For example the value of data will rise, but the value of human prediction will fall. It used many real-world current examples, which were also enlightening. "

A machine would have a tough time with that.o	Due in part to this discrepancy ^ humans and machines can find synergies to improve the prediction of the machine and the human when working together. Humans can often offer valuable information the machine does not have when faced with unusual or out of the ordinary circumstances. This collaboration is called “prediction by exception”.-	Machine learning science and statistics had different goals.o	Statistics – wants to be correct on averageo	Machine learning – operational effectiveness. Have biases so long as they were gave better predictions. Can accommodate more interaction between variables.Part 2: Decision Making-	While prediction is a key component of any decision, it is not the only component. The other elements of a decision – Judgment, data, and action – remain in the real of humans. They are complements to prediction. They increase in value as prediction becomes cheap (as noted in chapter 1). The value for human prediction decreases, but the demand for human judgment increases.o	An example referenced many times in the book is that of radiologists. A Radiologists main job is to look at an image an determine what the diagnosis is of the individual, then communicate a treatment plan to a doctor. The imaging portion of this job can be done by machines as we teach them to identify the condition in the picture. This will aid radiologists in determining their judgment and action as to what the correct course of action is for the individual.	If there were only a few solutions, judgement would be easy to code into the prediction machine. However, in this case and many others, the decisions could be many and the judgement on which course of action is correct is often more efficient coming from a human counterpart. This is especially true in rare instances where lets say 97% of the time the image would lead to a certain treatment plan, but perhaps the radiologist is able to determine that due to some other factor this is a rare instance where the treatment plan is out of the ordinary. •	Machines are bad at determine correct judgment for rare scenarios. Without a mass of past experience and data, they will fail to come up with the correct answer. Humans on the other hand can use analogies to other examples to come up with worthwhile information for making a judgement call.o	Another example was of Taxi cab drivers. Their advantage to other drivers was their ability to predict the fastest route from point A to point B. Once Google Maps and other GPS software become easily accessible to the masses, the cab drivers no longer had an advantage. The cab drivers did not get worse, everyone else just got a lot better at predicting the best route.-	3 types of datao	Input	The collection of data o	Trainingo	Feedback-	Airport Lounge example. Airport lounges only exist because we cannot accurately predict when we must leave to get to our flight on time. We satisfice by getting to the airport early to ensure we don’t miss our flight. If we could predict perfectly when we would need to arrive to get on our flight, lounges would not exist. They exist as a buffer to improve our experience with poor prediction abilities.-	Tasks most likely to be fully automated first are the ones for which full automation delivers the highest returns. These include tasks where…o	The other elements are already automated except for prediction (mining)o	The returns to speed of action in response to prediction are high (driverless cars)o	The returns to reduced waiting time for predictions are high (Space Exploration)Part 3: Tools-	Tasks need to be broken down and decomposed to determine where the best ROI for prediction and automation would occur. In a large organization, the tasks that will be completed first are the ones with the greatest ROI.-	MBA screening example. A process could become quite good at determine which candidates would make the best MBA students for your program by watching the videos sent in by the candidates and predicting their success. The problem is that you need to teach the machine very specifically what to look for. What constitutes the “best” candidate? Your outcomes and factors must be well defined to train a prediction machine.-	My favorite example of the machine learning incorrectly was of a machine that was trained to play chess. It learned by watching chess champions play and mimicked their decision making. However, in the games it watched, it learned that in many of the matches where the champion one, he sacrificed his queen to win. The machine computed this as “if I sacrifice my queen, I have a better chance of winning” so it would sacrifice its queen early in the game. The algorithm had to be adjusted to only sacrifice the queen in certain scenarios where it would prove beneficial.-	Implementation of AI tools generates four implications for jobs:o	AI tools may augment jobs, helping people do their job bettero	AI tools may contract jobs. Ex: automated fulfillment centerso	AI tools may lead to the reconstitution of jobs with some tasks added and other taken away, as with radiologistso	AI tools may shift the emphasis on the specific skills required for a particular job, as with school bus drivers. They may be needed more to protect and nurture the children than to drive a vehicle.Part 4: Strategy-	AI can lead to strategic change if three factors are presento	There is a core trade off in the business model. Example was about amazon having such good data that they would change from having people shop and then shipping their products, to one where they would ship the item to the individual before they shopped for it, and if they wanted to return it their would be an infrastructure in place that made that incredibly simple.o	The tradeoff is influenced by uncertainty. We don’t know if the higher sales from the ship first method would result in higher costs from the returned items because we are uncertain how many of the items they will keep. We don’t have enough prediction power to be sure.o	An AI tool that reduces uncertainty tips the scales of the trade off so that the optimal strategy changes from one side of the trade to the other. If you did have the prediction power to be sure what people would buy, you would know if it was more cost effective to ship before shopping.-	Shifting to an AI first strategy means downgrading the previous top priority. It’s not a buzz word. It means you are placing greater value on the goal of maximizing prediction accuracy than you are on other tradeoffs like revenue or user growth.-	Risks of AIo	Predictions can lead to discrimination	Example of google searches suggesting an individual may be arrested because their name was more black-sounding name. The ads would show up if they had a higher quality score (people clicked on them more when the name was that of a black person) so the ads ran more often when you searched a black sounding name.	If you encounter your machine is acting discriminatingly, you need to adjust your algorithm. Doing so can be tough. You need to audit machine and figure out what is causing the behavior.	AI relies on correlation, not causation. You need to be able to see what happens when your variable is both present and not present to determine if it was a causal effect.o	AI is ineffective when data is sparse	Ai is bad at predicting rare eventso	Homgeneity of prediction machines can lead to risk of total system failure	If one crop appears to outgrow the others, a farmer might decide to plant only that crop. But if that crop encounters something that destroys it, the entire yield is destroyed. Similarly, say we all used the same prediction machine for a driverless car. Individually this might give us the best experience, but if someone or something were to attack that machine successfully, it would lead to a catastrophic total system failure. To work against this, we should diversify. We should also consider not tethering live updates to the cloud. o	Feedback can be manipulated so that prediction machines learn destructive behaviorPart 5 : Society-	The rise of AI presents trade offs for societyo	Productivity vs distribution (both examples show how wealth inequality can arise)	Economists agree that technological advance makes us better off and enhances productivity, which AI will do. How the created wealth is distributed will be the issue. If AI takes over certain jobs, humans will compete for the others, driving down wages for those jobs, reducing the fraction of income earned by the laborer compared to that earned by the owners of the capital (the machines doing the work). i.e. The owners of the machines will get a bigger cut of the revenues. 	The AI tools may help highly skilled workers more than lower skilled workers. This is how most computer systems work today. Higher skilled, higher educated workers can use technology more effectively and get a better return from the technology than lower skilled workers.o	Innovation vs competition (monopolization due to exponential increase in prediction capability)	As companies innovate their prediction machines to be more accurate, leading to an increase in users, leading to more data, which loops back into more accurate predictions, they may scale to become a monopoly as competitors cannot scale as quickly. Good for the short term, maybe not good in the long run for society.o	Performance vs privacy	Europe has more restrictive laws around data privacy, and as such will most likely not a be an innovation hub for AI. The US, and China especially, are looser on those laws and will undoubtedly have better performing AI, but at the cost of personal data."
31,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72997602-peter-mccluskey,4,"Three economists decided to write about AI. They got excited about AI, and that distracted them enough that they only said a modest amount about the standard economics principles that laymen need to better understand. As a result, the book ended up mostly being simple descriptions of topics on which the authors had limited expertise. I noticed fewer amateurish mistakes than I expected from this strategy, and they mostly end up doing a good job of describing AI in ways that are mildly helpful to laymen who only want a very high-level view.The book's main goal is to advise business on how to adopt current types of AI (""reading this book is almost surely an excellent predictor of being a manager who will use prediction machines""), with a secondary focus on how jobs will be affected by AI.The authors correctly conclude that a modest extrapolation of current trends implies at most some short-term increases in unemployment.One example they use to help us visualize this is the effects of spreadsheets on bookkeepers. Spreadsheets automated the most time consuming parts of bookkeeping, so fewer bookkeepers were needed to do what bookkeepers did before spreadsheets. But by making bookkeepers more powerful, spreadsheets led to bookkeepers calculating many more results than before.The book mentions horses, but then mostly dismisses, without any clear reason, the risk that humans will become as unemployable as horses did. I guess the authors are mainly imagining the kind of incremental increases in AI abilities that are likely in the next 5 or 10 years. But if we extrapolate to when AI exceeds human-level cognitive abilities, then it seems appropriate to worry about human wages becoming inadequate to feed humans, like what happened to horses a century ago.1.The book's advice to business is fairly appropriate, but often borders on common sense.The authors emphasize the distinction between prediction and judgment. Since they are complements, better prediction means that judgment become more valuable.Prediction machines don't provide judgment. Only humans do.For the near-term changes on which the book mostly focuses, I expect this model to work rather well.But many decades from now, what part of judgment will be hard to automate? Judgment generally requires more general-purpose models of human desires than most current AI hopes to achieve. But large increases in data and computing power seem likely to eventually enable automating most judgment, via something like having an AI predict what a human would say if the human analyzed the situation carefully.2.I'll now mention some complaints I have, about areas where the authors seem to be outside their areas of competence. These aren't particularly important aspects of the book, but I found them about as interesting as the book's main points.The discussion of trucking jobs seems a bit strange. They imagine that humans will need to ride with robotrucks to prevent theft. Would an unmanned truck convoy be at greater risk than are current trucks? I can't quite see how. They'll need good cameras for driving, and it seems like those would also serve as effective means to identify thieves. The robotruck industry may well employ plenty of humans for tasks such as loading and unloading, but I predict humans will rarely accompany robotrucks on long trips.The authors ask what should happen when a robocar hands control to the human driver in an emergency, after pointing out related problems that associated with Air France Flight 447. My answer is that a robocar shouldn't require that a human take control. I don't see much reason to expect humans to do better than software in sudden emergencies. Yet the authors indicate that humans in robocars need to know how to drive, without appearing to consider the advantages of relying on software in emergencies. Trains have been run without drivers present, and the book mentions a mine where trucks operate without drivers. Doing that with cars on typical roads is much harder, but the benefits are also much larger, and I predict I'll feel safer as a pedestrian 15 years from now if cars handle emergencies via software.They can't avoid mentioning the Trolley problem:Someone will have to resolve the dilemma and program the appropriate response into the car. The problem cannot be avoided.There are likely to be political and legal reasons why it can't be avoided, but the authors hint that there are ethical reasons. I don't see those reasons. I'd be happy to use a robocar that handled trolley problems roughly the way that humans do, i.e. treat any situation that kills a person as if it's as close to infinitely bad as our minds can understand [1].They note that having lots of data is somewhat important to making good predictions, which lead them to wonder: will China rule the world due to having more data? I see little strength to the idea that having more people means outperforming due to having more data. The parts of the world with European languages likely have more variety of data than China does, and variety of data is at least as important as quantity.The more interesting hypothesis is that EU-style privacy controls might retard the regions that adopt them. But they mention (elsewhere) evidence from comparing Google to Yahoo/Microsoft which shows that such restrictions have had little effect.The authors dismiss Bostrom's Superintelligence in a way that indicates they don't quite understand what Bostrom is claiming.3.I predict that a modest number of readers will benefit from this book, and a larger number will react favorably to it, while quickly forgetting what it says.Footnote[1] - I also endorse Brad Templeton's explanations of why robocar people should pay less attention to this issue, and implement whatever answer puts robocars on roads soon:It turns out the problem has a simple answer which is highly likely to be the one taken. In almost every situation of this sort, the law already specifies who has the right of way, and who doesn't. The vehicles will be programmed to follow the law, which means that when presented with a choice of hitting something in their right-of-way and hitting something else outside the right-of-way, the car will obey the law and stay in its right-of-way.Given a few reasonable assumptions, from a strict standpoint of counting deaths and injuries, almost any delay to the deployment of high-safety robocars costs lots of lives. And not a minor number. Delay it by a year, and anywhere from 10,000-20,000 extra people will die in the USA, a 300,000 to a million around the world. Delay it by a day and you condemn 30-80 unknown future Americans and 1,000 others to death, and many thousands more to horrible injury.Trolley problems provide potentially valuable insights into how different ethical systems handle situations that are very different from what humans have experienced, but robocar designers should focus on situations that resemble what humans have experienced."
32,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105904707-aaron-kalafarski,3,"This book served more to reinforce concepts around AI than it did to open up new ways of thinking about it. Basically, most AI are prediction machines and the cost of prediction has dramatically decreased. While AI can learn to predict situations it lacks the judgement that humans posses. Therefore, when paired with humans can compliment and enhance their work. As the use of AI improves the effectiveness and efficiency of processes, industries, etc. it will change how we think about work. It will make certain work obsolete and create opportunities elsewhere by analyzing and adjusting to customer feedback.The biggest issue outside of the book to me is as lower-level jobs get automated away those individuals out of a job will either need to be retrained to adapt to AI or find new jobs. This is going to increase workplace stratification and the disparity from those who are technologically adept versus those who are more inept. Is will more than likely impact generations and those of different levels of intelligence the most dramatically. Therefore, I believe we should be spending time focusing on anticipating those problems as well as the benefits AI will bring us. "
33,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111501905-bilal,4,"The key lessons in this book are: One, the unpacking of decision making into two primary components: prediction and judgement, that is, decisions are meant to choose the best path forward (i.e., judge) when certain dependencies are unknown, and where one assigns certain likelihoods to the unknowns turning out one way or another. The authors argue that AI is best suited to provide the predictions (assign likelihoods to outcomes) and leave the judgement to human beings. They present several examples to make sense of this point. Two, the break down workflows into sub-components, jobs, where some of these jobs may be given to AI. They present several examples of how this is already done in the industry. I found the book informative on these two topics but stating the obvious on other topics."

Reading this book I had a real lightbulb moment when there was a discussion of separating judgement from prediction of outcomes in decision making. When AI wasn't making the judgement and was just a tool in the decision making process I saw clearly how it could be used in many instances. There's a lot more to the book including how it might affect employment, different strategies that business might use, the value of data for learning (and how the value of historical data drops once the learning is done).This book does not discuss AI at a technical level. I found it quite accessible as someone with an interest in technology."

53,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51896417-frans-sax-n,3,"Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of AI is a primer on using economics to illuminate the consequences of the rise of AI. This is not a book that will scare you using dramatic, persuasive storytelling. Rather, it is a book using some pretty simple economics concepts (think Econ 101) to illuminate the consequences of the rise of AI, by interpreting AI as prediction machines, and their ""rise"" as a fall in the cost of making predictions. When the cost of making predictions fall, more predictions will be made - when the market price declines, more is demanded. And when the price of predictions decline, not only does the demand of predictions increase, but so does the demand of complements. One complement is judgement - when more predictions can be made, more judgements are called for - What is the implication of the AI predicting a 2 point rise in the probability of accidents? The authors use elementary, well established economics to illustrate a number of implications of AI, in the process demonstrating the power of analyzing complex topics thru a simple, but coherent framework. The theoretical analysis is augmented by illustrative case studies. The comparison between AI and the spreadsheet is illuminating. When the first computer spreadsheet was launched, there were fewer accountants employed than today. The ""rise of the spreadsheet"" led to demand for more accountants, and more scenario analysis, as these activities became cheaper. The authors argue that the same will be the case for AI. While the number of management accountants employed increased, their jobs were transformed. The same will happen with AI, as it reconfigures jobs. The authors do not see AI replacing all human work as the most likely scenario - but that does not mean that it would not affect what jobs look like. As any transformative technology shift, getting the most out of it will require a deep reorganizing of work - both individual jobs as well as organizations. Another literary illuminative example includes the ""rise of"" artificial light (the light bulb), a similar general purpose technology enabling wide spread innovation in business practices. While using elementary economics can get you far, the authors do not shy away from going further, looking at practical challenges (what do I need to employ AI to solve my problems), highlighting the need for data, common pitfalls with interpreting data (think of Wald's analysis in WWII of returning aircraft hit by anti-aircraft fire, and the associated bias), etc.The book is written for a wide audience, but is structured as a typical business book. Each chapter is brief enough, and is summarized in the end in a few succinct bullet points. Think of it as an introduction to the business implications of the economics of AI. This is similar to Carl Shapiro's and Hal Varian's classic on the business implications of the economics of Web 1.0 ""Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy."" Another book in the same fashion that comes to mind is Brynjolfson and McAfee's ""Machine, Platform, Crowd: Harnessing Our Digital Future."" While Brynjofson and McAfee touches on some of the same topics as ""Prediction machines,"" the latter is more focused and thus goes deeper into the topic of AI. And similar to the two previously mentioned books, this uses the economist's standard toolkit - no need to invent fancy new theories to understand the basics of this new phenomena. There may be a new economy, but that does not necessarily require new economics."

55,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55071150-arti,4,"The book looks at AI from the viewpoint of economics and interestingly reframes AI as cheap prediction. It sets the context to show that prediction is now becoming a commodity - and there has been a gradual shift from data and insights to predictions - if you sift through the AI hype, most of the products today sit in this space. Prediction is central to decision making - and it means that organisations can make better decisions, and faster. But the bigger opportunity is where improved quality of predictions can motivate organisations to change their strategy - a simple example is a shift from shop-and-ship to ship-and-shop model - which can transform organisations like Amazon if their predictions are accurate and dependable!The authors argue that the economic shift will centre around a drop in the cost of prediction (and an associated increase in the value of judgement) - which will in turn lower the cost of activities that were historically prediction oriented (like inventory managements, demand forecasting), as well as open up opportunities to use prediction as an input for things for which we never previously did (like translation or navigation which now has moved out of the rule based programming framework to a machine learning based prediction framework that predicts human response to changing environmental data). It's a different perspective and got me to think – the technology geek in me was of-course shocked at the over-simplification. And while I accept that the current state of AI is nowhere close to the myth of super intelligent machines, but limiting the view to predictions and keeping judgement or actions ( out of the purview seems like an incomplete and a short sighted view. It is like saying that we will replace bits and pieces of our existing processes by newer technology. Its an oversimplification of AI and risks losing the bigger picture - the opportunity to reimagine processes - not just with digital intelligence - but also self-learning and self-organising workflows.A stimulating read… it opens up the mind to the prevailing (common) view and an insight into its immediate practical applications and introduces a non-tech user to business considerations such as AI-first strategy (maximising prediction accuracy even at the cost of maximising revenue, user numbers or experience), impact of AI on data, labour, capital, tradeoff between data, prediction accuracy and value, division of labour between humans and machines, managing AI risks - quality, security, liability and in some cases the possibility of changing the strategy itself.But for me, the book have me an opportunity (after being provoked by the authors limited view) to develop a holistic perspective and look beyond prediction - to determine the gaps and next steps to taking AI to the next level of true potential. And i see a significant opportunity in integrating AI into the next step of decision process - judgement (relative payoffs of possible outcomes) and automated actions!Note: The book has evolved from a series of articles on HBR e.g. The Simple Economics of Machine Intelligence and honestly the articles are sufficient to get a good understanding of the theory and the arguments put forth by the authors. Its a much easier option to familiarise with the concepts and I don't think that you would miss a lot from not having read the book."

To that extent, the subtitle of the book is very true. However, as they went through a number of examples where algorithms coupled with massive amounts of relevant date--""prediction machines""--could perform defined tasks well, their emphasis on the simple economics involved made more sense. In particular, their focus on basic economics provide a pretty powerful framework for understanding the implications of digitization plus faster (cheaper) computing power coupled with corresponding proliferation of data over the internet (via Google, Amazon, Ali Baba, etc) on human employment and the nature of work. Judgment will become more important, as will innovation (where the lack of past data's ability to predict the future is most apparent). They also do a great job introducing the possible involvement of ""bad actors""--something which is often overlooked in the scare stories of the future of work. Bottom line: there will be inevitable human involvement at levels requiring judgment and innovation. The authors look at driver-less trucks as an example. There have been scare stories about the legions of truck drivers who will be out of work once the driverless truck ""works out"" the bugs. The presence of ""bad actors"" could make the robbery of driverless trucks easy--as presumably the trucks will be programmed not to run over human beings, they would stop, and allow such robbery to take place, unless effectively marshals rode along with the trucks. Other examples abound--whether sophisticated talent needed for the launch of new products (pricing, design, etc will not likely be defined by prediction machines dependent on past data) or relatively menial warehouse ""pickers"" supplement otherwise robotically driven fulfillment centers. One quibble: the authors state that the effect of AI is likely to result in continued reduction of wages to the less skillful. At the same time, however, they state that the effect of AI would be to reduce costs as a result of the improved efficiency. They do not however complete the thought--that even the more menial laborers in society should be expected to benefit in the form of better value for money in their consumption. That is, if the ""cost of living"" is reduced, should not that also be considered as income growth. But such quibbles apart, this book does a pretty good job of framing the implications of artificial intelligence to non-scientists, all through their repetitious and simplistic statements of the basic economic principles behind the growth in AI. Enough so to warrant a 3.7 rating for those interested in the implications of AI. "

For someone who is unsure what AI is and what its impact will be this book provides great, simple non-technical explanation of AI from an economic perspective. For technical people, it provides a way to structure your thoughts on how to approach and see the value of various AI tools, as well as presents a way to explain AI to non-technical people. In essence, it has transformed my way of seeing machine learning/AI into something very easy to explain within a structured framework, which is probably the most valuable asset of this book. And a very important asset. This book won't last very long in terms of the value of its advice, as the ideas expressed in this book will either rapidly start happening soon, so if someone wants to understand AI and what's coming this is a now or never book to read. The neutral, and sometimes almost awed tone, of the book made me queasy. It's probably paranoia, but I'm not sure if I want to wash myself of the paranoia.I found myself writing notes on the margins throughout the book questioning the ethics and what will come of society afterwards. I've been a bit nervous about the future with AI, and after reading this I was left with a dystopic nightmare in my mind of almost half the population out of jobs through elimination of most if not all blue-color jobs as well as many white-collar jobs, the stress one would feel to have to constantly feel like they need to perpetually be the best before AI decides they need to be eliminated from the job, and countries with low human rights records or conversations about the ethics of AI being at the forefront of a new world order. The authors answer all those stressful conversations in a short chapter - I think there was one sentence dedicated to how they believe it's possible for there to be an AI Recession. Along with that, there was very little focus on who is developing the AI and the biases that are inputted into it - there were a few pages dedicated to racism and gender biases, but not enough to make me feel confident that tech world will be able to resolve it.They mention the famous Putin quote about whoever advances AI will rule the world, what happens when that's a company (rather than a country) not subject to laws made and formed over time by people? Anyway, lots of questions, lots of stress I've been left with. "

While it explains how AI works, it does not really give much lead and direction on how to implement it into business and the like; it's one of those situations where one must already vested in high-end programming within a business in order to see how to get there from here. If a reader is already part of or adjacent to the Silicon Valley-type companies, then much of this will make sense but if they sit outside that, they are less likely to find much of this book valuable beyond just learning about AI. Written from the lens of economists, the book also largely whitewashes over the problems that AI may inevitably create. They acknowledge them near the end but largely sweep them under the rug, admitting that many of the problems will be unforseen and not explainable; another way of saying they will cause harm first and then someone may decide to fix them, which seems irresponsible, but then again, social responsibility isn't often a priority for certain types of economists. Ultimately, the book works from the preface of ""Why you should"" and pays lip service to ""What bad things may happen if you do"". It's solid as an introduction to possibilities of AI so long as the reader knows they are likely being sold the sunny side. For more useful and critical understandings of AI, one would be better off reading Automating Inequality: How High-Tech Tools Profile, Police, and Punish the Poor or Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism or The Big Nine: How the Tech Titans and Their Thinking Machines Could Warp Humanity."

Using a self-driving Tesla-car, Google Maps or Alexa or just your credit card everyone has had or will soon have his Artificial Intelligence (AI) moment. Therefore, everybody is speculating about the chances but also the threats by AI. But who gives substantial orientation? After reading „Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence“ by Max Tegmark (a very helpful hint by my former Pixelpark colleague Barbara Daliri Freyduni) I followed the recommendation of serial founder and AI-expert Stephan Uhrenbacher (FLIO.com Digital Airports, Qype, 9flats.com) to read the current Bestseller “Prediction Machines” from Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans and Avi Golfarb. As a fellow at Creative Destruction Lab (CDL), a high profiled accelerator focused on Machine Learning in Toronto, Stephan got in personal touch with these three economists from at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management, who have cofounded CDL, and supported their publication. Based on various empiric studies and their personal insights from working with AI-pioneers at CDL Agrawal, Gans and Golfarb explain why prediction machines makes predictions better, faster and increasingly cheaper and become extremely powerful but as well with specific limitations. They conclude: The combination of humans and machines generates best results by compensating the differing weaknesses of both. How does such a collaboration translate into a business environment? In two ways: (1) The machine provides an initial prediction that humans can combine and use for their own assessment, judgement and decision making or (2) The machines provide parallel or afterwards a second opinion which helps e.g. higher-level managers to ensure high performance of their employees Agrawal, Gans Golfarb reflect extensively also the different types of risks carried by AI, but they inspire in a pragmatic way to think about the new opportunities in an open way. A must-read for everybody who wants to understand the economic logic of AI-power behind the technical development."

64,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/160142-joe,2,"Started out well, but doesn't justify its length. And it's not really that long.The authors seem to have an agenda to promote machine learning algorithms. Part of the book educated the reader about what these algorithms can do. But as a practitioner, I can see some places where they are overstating their case. The biggest example is they state that the 2008 financial crisis could possibly have been avoided by machine learning algorithms because they would not have had the same biases as the analysts who built the regression models. There's no reason to think that this is the case; we've seen that machine learning algorithms succumb to bias just as easily as traditional models. The authors themselves cite the Tay chatbot and racial profiling algorithms. Since this sketchy claim about the 2008 financial crisis came at page 36, I had a skeptic's eye throughout the rest of the book.So it's better to read this book as the case for more machine learning. I was pretty unimpressed. After a while, I felt like I was right in the middle of a machine learning bubble with inflated expectations. The ""hockey stick"" charts on page 159 were a low point: the authors were asserting that machine learning would be picked up by other industries later than tech industries for the same reason that hybrid corn was adopted later by Alabama than it was by earlier states. This was an unconvincing analogy. It made me worry that I should look for a new career because there are likely lots of young students right now trying to learn machine learning algorithms and hoping to compete for the same number of jobs that I am.Despite these complaints, it's still a good introduction to machine learning. The first two chapters are especially good. You might want to stop there; after that, there is a lot of cherry-picking to make machine learning look better than what I've seen in my career."

I found the concepts intriguing. As an IT person, its easy to view AI as the proverbial IF statement. Even though lots of code is object orientated and sensor driven. The concepts discuss talked above how much more important that a machines ability to learn was than predefined algorithms that are not flexible to take input and derive solutions to unforeseen obstacles. It did separate AI from AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). AI being a developed structure of learning versus AGI being self contained structure of learning that extend outside of the predefined learning limits.It talked about the upsides of AI and the extension of the poverty level because of AI destroying jobs, the rich getting richer. It was interesting to hear how Elon Musk, Mister SpaceX, and Mister Microsoft, Bill Gates were against the advancement of AI because of how it would effect the economic welfare of the average person. Some things were some what alarming like a prediction that China would dominate the world in AI merely because of the money, billions, that they are sinking into AI and the inhumane treatment of their people would lead to them using their citizens as guinea pigs for AI analysis. How hackers could hack medical devices and possible real havoc on people. How they could hack self-driving cars.

A few things on why I liked the book: - the reference to Moneyball just makes it much easier to relate to the fact that predictive machine learning is not so intangibile. - I liked the story with the search query “hiybbprqag” that does not actually exist and forced Google engineers to use Bing, which is Microsoft’s search engine. Than after running a new search on Google it actually referenced Bing searches for the same. - I also liked the story with Uber and black cabs, which were very precious for their good knowledge of London’s street, peak hours jams and that were replaced by GPS. Interesting enough this did not left black cabs drivers without a job, it just provided equal chances to non black cab drivers and drive the price down. - I enjoyed the idea with Amazon’s strategy challenge to change from shopping to shipping into shipping to shopping. First deliver and them return what is not useful. This means to have a very good predictive machine learning that would learn user’s preferences and will encourage shopping, hopefully with less returns. - Tim Cook’s statement on Apple’s home page - that shows a commitment to privacy data protection despite of maybe losing the data needed to improve predictions Why did I gave it 3 stars? Because I felt it could be written in more dynamic way, I got a bit bored sometimes and was just looking to jump to a more meaningful information.

This book addresses a critical topic.The name of the book frames the discussion. Rather than use existing terms like artificial intelligence or big data the term ""prediction"" is used to emphasize a particularly significant aspect of recent development likely to have an out-sized impact on society. There are many examples that illustrate transformational improvements in processing capability leading to a discussion of business strategy.Examples are drawn from diverse fields Driving, Radiology, Warehousing, and Airlines.I think it is clever to highlight the productivity challenge of Robert Solow. This encourages us to think critically about the impact and application of the technology. The decomposition of work into tasks likely to be automated and those likely to be enhanced anticipates a massive process that will transform our lives.Here are a few of the ideas I thought were notable:The importance of understanding the reasoning for decisions informed by computer analysis. Implications for business strategy.Limitations and inherent risks of the technology.Impact the technology is likely to have on society.Overall I thought it was a very thoughtful and thought-provoking analysis."
68,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28729037-jaron-dunford,0,"Notes:The current wave of advances in AI doesn't actually bring us intelligence but instead a critical component of intelligence: prediction.Prediction is the process of filling in missing information. Prediction takes information you have, often called data, and uses it to generate information you don't have.We anticipate the rise in human prediction by exception whereby machines generate most predictions because they are predicated on routine, regular data, but when rare events occur the machine recognizes that it is not able to produce a prediction with confidence, and so calls for human assistance. The human provides by exception.While a machine predicts what is likely to happen, humans will still decide what action to take based on the understanding of the objective. In many situations, as with Waze, the machine will give the human a prediction that implies a certain outcome for one dimension (like speed); the human will then decide to overrule that (for example using the bathroom).Enhanced prediction enables decision makers to, whether human or machine, to handle more ifs and more thens. That leads to better outcomes.In the absence of good predictions , we do a lot of satisficing, making decisions that are good enough given the information.Perhaps the skill set of the employee formally known as a school bus driver will change. Drivers may act more like teachers than they do today. But the important point is that automation that eliminates a human from the task does not necessarily eliminate them from a job."

With AI, it is not enough to just be on board, we all owe it to our careers to get educated to understand how our professions will rapidly change over the next few years.I appreciated that this book was written by economists and not technologists. It gave it a Freaknomics type feel, which made the reading more enjoyable, and helped me understand the macro impact of this technology. I'm not a data scientist so I don't know the details on how exactly the technology is evolving, and also I don't really care. I also enjoyed the anecdotes of how much of this technology is already integrated our lives. However, because of those anecdotes, I can see that this book will very quickly become outdated.Overall, interesting read. I think we owe it to ourselves to self enlighten regarding where this world is heading. It's also a little scary to think that, in a few short years, we will actually be concerned about robots outsmarting humans. The authors kept trying to assure us that human judgment will always be needed, but then follow up by saying how judgment can be programmed. It's all a little concerning."

But the perspective communicated in the book is a bit like viewing AI as significantly improved spreadsheets. This is true. And to be fair, the author totally acknowledges and talks about the impact of improved prediction on machine vision and robotics. But the consequent impacts of those changes are not very well explored. A reader of Prediction Machines would not be surprised by improved shopping recommendations, but they would still be quite surprised by the cashierless checkout of Amazon Go.So Prediction Machines is a very good book and will help you with thinking about AI and it's applications.

It was quite interesting, though. It looked, from an economic standpoint, at the impact of the burgeoning use of AI. First it explained that the function of current AI is basically prediction and explained how improved prediction will and might impact business. The book explained why using AI to make predictions was likely to work better than humans and where humans would still be needed. It considered the expected societal issues of increased use of AI (as well as issues already occurring). It also stressed that there are many unknown unknowns that will result form the improving AI, using as an example how the GPS apps on smartphones decreased the need for London taxi drivers as it allowed untrained drivers (think UBER) to accomplish what had taken the traditional London taxi driver years to learn (the city of London and how best to get from one place in the City to another). One section that I found particularly interesting was about the data needed and used to train AI and how it could be flawed or biased."

In their world, AI will always work perfectly for the job and not suffer from any limitations once it has the training data it needs. They barely even consider the possibility that there will be other technical limitations. Their own favorite example, Tesla's Autopilot functionality, points to the flaws in the book. To the authors, Autopilot is a beautiful example of the possibilities of AI, once it has enough real world data to train on. But we have enough news stories about Autopilot failures that we know their version is lacking nuance. It's too bad - they have some good points lurking in the middle of it all, if only they could have tempered their predictions. "

For example, it creates relative scarcity (and thus higher valuation) of some things, like strategic judgment. It will make some kinds of outsourcing easier, though it will create new agent-principal problems around who has control over the interpretation of results. It will create new kinds of blindnesses, especially in people who do not understand the aporias in the data on top of which the prediction engines are being built.

Prediction, however, is not tantamount to judgment, valuation, let alone decision-making. It is far from causation. It is a mere correlation between events.

I should say that some of their facts are also wrong, especially in the history of computers/AI I was hoping to read about ELIZA in that chapter! I understand that this book is being written from an economists point of view and thus my expectations shouldn't be very high on a technical side, but this book just offers a simple overview of the current status in AI and nothing else. At least for me. Full disclosure I got this audiobook on a sale $3.66."
86,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45366873-miku,4,"This book definitely helped me understand AI better. It did not help me feel secure in the future though. I don't have a business, but I was curious about how others thought it would play out in the economy, One critique I have of this book is that they focused on the short term, which makes sense due to its target audience, but I think we all know that many changes will be made and the economy will look very different then. That's probably why they kept it short term though.I liked how it talked about how the strategy will have to change with AI, and what humans could do to supplement it, but like I said earlier who knows how long that will even last. "
87,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95878161-ardon-pillay,4,"A very interesting and multi-layered analysis of how AI might be practically deployed in business. I particularly liked the pyramid approach the authors took for the book - looking at the predictions made, how they were used in decision making, what tools could be used to bring about tangible changes, strategies that could be used, and finally, what the societal implications of AI technology are. That final point was dealt with pretty well - far less rhetoric about possible Skynet-esque futures than a lot of other AI books. Very analytical and evaluative, with a broad base of evidence to support a lot of the claims made. "

Balanced for a diverse audience.If you're an academic or have been studying these concepts for a while, the content will be elementary but the book is still worth reading. The authors offer a lesson in how to communicate what ML & AI can (and can't) do to an executive audience. If you're new to this space, the book guides you through some of the latest thinking, starting with more foundational concepts and working its way up the pyramid to how it all fits tofether strategically."

It also looks at how AI works best in combination with human judgement, and tries to provide a framework for how you can think about AI projects. Clear, and easy to understand."

It uses many examples in its discussions which help you to understand the effects of other disruptions in the past. The book is structured very orderly, and touches on topics such as what 'prediction' really is, how it affects strategy, and how/whether it will replace jobs. "

Could have been a good, meaty, magazine article.Mostly focused on their economist view that AI are prediction machines. The implication is that prediction, which is an important part of decision-making, will become suddenly much cheaper, and so any tasks, processes, or jobs that involve prediction will have to be rethought."

I specially enjoyed all the analogies and practical examples. However, I think the mental model to think of all that AI does as predictions is a helpful start, but hits the limits at times. For instance, the many RL models, take into account things like curiosity and intrinsic motivations for no better reason than it fits some tasks at hand. Also, The way I see it, the economics of AI is isn't quite that 'simple' since AI agents of today aren't all that rational. "
