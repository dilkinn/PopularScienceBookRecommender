0,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This is a pretty good book about how artificial intelligence (AI) can be applied to businesses. It is not a technical book--you won't find any details about the wide range of technologies being used for machine learning. Instead, you will find many ingenious ways to put AI to use, as well as all the business ramifications. Three professionals from Toronto's Rotman School of management collaborated to write this book. The book is unified, and reads as if it were written by a single person. However, it is not a particularly engaging book. There is no entertainment value here, definitely no humor. It is a no-nonsense book--almost in the style of a textbook, with good summaries at the end of each chapter. But, the book is not dry, and is easy to read. It is filled with interesting stories and anecdotes. The basic premise of the book is that the cost of prediction is dropping. Prediction is at the heart of decision-making, so decisions should, overall improve. And, as decisions improve, so should productivity.The pitfalls of prediction machines are also described. I just love the story about a chess-playing machine during the early days of AI. The machine was fed games from the great grandmasters of chess. The machine successfully analyzed static board positions and suggested good moves. Then, when the machine was programmed to play complete games, something strange happened. Early in its games, it often would sacrifice its queen with no apparent benefit. It turns out the grandmasters occasionally would sacrifice a queen when a masterful quick checkmate could follow. But, the machine could not see that sacrificing a queen without comparable reward was not a good move. "
1,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2129509-peter,3,"This book is one of those “assuming a perfectly spherical cow” things.If we reduce AI down to ML and ignore the messy realities of the real world (i.e. assume that the curse of dimensionality isn’t a thing and the only limitation on creating perfect predictions is access to sufficient training data), then we get the analysis in this book. It paints a picture of a world where the only barrier to self-driving cars is a sufficiently rich training set so that the AI can predict what a driver would do, This is not a world where pesky problems of feature engineering, embodyment, real world resource constraints, or even ethical concerns will make development of many AI solution challenging, if not impossible.On the plus side the book acknowledges the difference between ‘decisions’ and ‘judgement’, though it defines judgement very narrowly, and it realises that jobs will be redefined rather than eliminated in many cases. But then it fails to realise that in a world where prediction is cheap, then managing the unpredictable is where all the value is (i.e. business exceptions), and the more we improve prediction the more valuable the unpredictable becomes, it doesn’t even acknowledge the many things that might limit prediction, and completely ignores the importance of learning by doing at the operational coal face.An overly simplistic and narrowly focused book that will soon be dated."

If you aren't familiar with AI, this is probably a very good introduction, although the examples will date very quickly and some of them are plain incorrect (e.g. face tags now sync across Mac and iOS). The point about prediction being a central part of AI is well-made and important, but like most popular economics books, they take this new insight rather too far and with too much confidence."
3,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5185619-scott-wozniak,5,"I've read a lot of book on artificial intelligence--this is by far the best one. The others were good, but mostly focused on defining what it is from a technical standpoint. And they all shared ideas on how to use it. But not until I read this one did I realize that all the others are focused on specific situations. This book is the first I've read that focuses on the principles behind the specifics. For example, they frame AI as a prediction tool, and then discuss the ways that our life and work with change when prediction is ubiquitous and cheap. This leads to a lot of interesting points, including noticing that prediction is only a part of decision making (not the whole decision). And then you can look at jobs and see what parts of the job are prediction parts and what are not (e.g. truck drivers do more than predict how the other cars on the road will react, they also negotiate with people on both ends of the delivery). Absolutely wonderful future/strategy book. If that's your jam, you'll love this one."
4,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18825813-david-veitch,4,"This review originally appeared on my website: https://daveveitch.wordpress.com/2018...Recently I read Prediction Machines by Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans, and Avi Goldfarb, three professors from UofT’s Rotman School of Management. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to go ‘beyond the headlines’ with respect to what impact on the world machine learning & AI will have.Topic“Where others see transformational new innovation, we see a simple fall in price.”The key idea the book revolves around is that machine learning & AI have brought about a dramatic fall in the price of prediction. The authors argue this fall in price will lead to the emergence of new business models (similar to how new business models emerged as Google search became popular), and it will also increase the value of other things (e.g. sensors which accurately capture data will become more valuable).ReviewThis may be the best book yet I have read in the ‘machine learning/AI/robots will transform our world’ genre. Part of the reason why is that Prediction Machines does not try to do too much. The authors focus on a few key ideas (as mentioned above), and then carefully evaluate the ramifications of them. The authors’ writing style is clear (the chapter-by-chapter bullet points help with this), and back their arguments up with numerous real-world examples. The book is similar in some ways to Martin Ford’s Rise of the Robots, and the overall style is reminiscent of Robert Shiller’s Animal Spirits.Two things I was not wild about. I found the section ‘Part 3: Tools’ a bit dry, and wish the authors had gone into a little bit more detail about how machine learning actually works (potentially via an appendix).Best BitsA few sections/arguments/examples I found interesting:- Rating agencies’ models before the financial crisis did not sufficiently incorporate how housing prices are correlated across regions. “Machine learning enables predictions based on unanticipated correlations”, and this feature could have been helpful at the time. (pg. 37)- “The value of substitutes to prediction machines, namely human prediction, will decline. However, the value of complements, such as the human skills associated with data collection, judgment, and actions, will become more valuable.” (pg. 81)- “The recent developments in AI and machine learning have convinced us that this innovation is on par with the great, transformative technologies of the past: electricity, cars, plastics, the microchip, the internet, and the smartphone”. (pg. 155)- The authors cite an interesting example of how in the 1930s a new strain of higher yielding corn took a very long time to become widely used in some states (e.g. Texas, Alabama). Part of the reason for this was that farms in these states were smaller & less profitable, making experimentation on new corn varieties hard to justify. The authors argue that the large profit margins of firms like Google/Facebook are enabling them to experiment broadly with AI techniques, and “reap huge rewards from successful experiments by applying them across a wide range of products operating at large scale”. (pg. 160)"
5,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6200323-david-ball,4,"I was recently asked to organize my company’s strategic offsite. I wanted a keynote speaker who could discuss machine learning and its impact on the investment industry. I came across the name, Ajay Agrawal, the founder of Creative Destruction Labs - a remarkable organization at the forefront of science, data, and technology based in Toronto - and the author Prediction Machines. Agrawal’s premise is fascinating: as predictions get cheaper to make it will change how we use them - similar to how cheaper electric lighting changed our working environment in the 1800s, or how cheaper computing power changed the way we used mathematics in the late twentieth century. Apparently predictions will become so cost effective and accurate that Amazon’s algorithms will eventually get so good at figuring out what we want and when we want it, that the company will change its business model from sending us goods after we order and pay for them to before - an idea I find both intriguing and terrifying. While some of the book’s prophesies may be disconcerting, this is hardly an anxious or dispiriting tome. Agrawal offers a more hopeful note by identifying roles for humans to play when machines take over the world, generally to apply judgement and common sense. There are some drier, more policy based sections, but for the most part this is a compelling, very readable book. If at times it was a little slow-going, it was not because it was overly heavy or badly written; but because there was so much thought-provoking material that I paused often - every other sentence at times - to daydream, ponder and contemplate."
6,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12925436-annie,4,"It is difficult to have a timely and relevant book on such a broad topic as artificial intelligence; some parts will be familiar while other parts are new and fascinating. This book would probably interest knowledge workers or anyone wanting to know how AI is changing our environment and behaviors. For example, we used to review our credit card statements to see if there were any fraudulent charges. Now based on our purchasing habits, credit card companies are flagging possible fraudulent charges and declining those transactions without needing input from us.Some AI stories are familiar, like the driverless car. Some are new and inconceivable, like Amazon's patent for 'ship and shop.' Currently, we decide what we want to buy, click on those items on Amazon, and they're shipped to us ('shop and ship'). In the future, Amazon expects to know its customers so well that it can ship the items to us (before we've thought about buying them) and we return only those items we don't want."
7,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45400893-pravin,3,"The book was a good high level introduction to AI and its implications, especially from a business perspective. It was very repetitive at times but this allows the core message to come across clearly: AI helps with making more accurate and faster predictions. Hence, when you find that the cost of prediction falls, industries are either disrupted or new industries proliferate.Overall, three stars (more likely makes sense as a three-and-a-half) for being informative but not providing a significant number of fresh insights throughout the book."
8,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109369526-kuldeep-charan,3,"Authors, the three economists from university of Toronto, do the great job of demystifing artificial intelligence by examining it through the lens of standard economic theory.but I'm recommends this to you only if you are a business leader, policy maker and try to understand about how artificial intelligence will shaping the world economy, then this book will helpful for you. The authors insightful journey into the topic will leave you surprised by how transformative this technological waves will be and what's the importance of its economics are for how it will unfold."
9,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11302400-marco,4,"The authors provide a good framework for understanding the changes that Artificial Intelligence effect in businesses and the economy. A book that avoids getting excessively technical (either about economics or computer science) while still avoiding the hype and shallowness of most discussions on the theme. A greater attention to the impacts of AI on outside stakeholders could have improved the overall result, but the book still achieves its framing goals."
10,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4623512-yousef-m,4,"Topic:A practical examination of understanding innovations In Artificial Intelligence (specifically Machine Learning) and how commercial applications of AI have already impacted (and will continue to affect) business models, the role of government, and the economic and social relationship between machines and human.Style:The three authors are professors of economics at U of Toronto Rotman School of Management who are also founders of an innovation incubator with investments in AI and deep learning. The book is written in less technical language and clearly aimed at consultants and c-suites on how to unpack the full impact of AI for work flow and business models. If you’re interested in deeper dive on the technical side of machine learning, this is not the book for you. For all practical purposes, this book assumes the relevance of AI/machine learning is increased accuracy and cost-efficiency for making predictions.Organization:The book is divided into five sections addressing (1) the nature of Prediction and how creating a taxonomy to guide the rest of the discussion (known-knowns, known-unknowns, unknown-unknowns are fairly straightforward; unknown-knowns were new to me and are particularly relevant to the discussion of AI), (2) Decision Making, particularly how it is divided and the role of judgment, (3) Tools and how AI will impact work flows, decision-making, and jobs, (4) Strategy, giving sage advice on preparing one's company for the impact of AI and how to mitigate against certain risks, and (5) Society, a larger discussion on how AI will affect the environment in which people and businesses will operate. Takeaway:An accessible introduction to artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), particularly for unpacking the practical effects AI/ML may (or may not) have on commercial ventures. I initially thought the book's lack of any technical aspects would limit insights to dinner party small talk, but was pleasantly surprised that avoiding scientific lectures (that would likely be outdated by publication) in favor of conversational thought-experiments and economic insights forced me to think critically about why any of this matters. A recurring example the authors use is improving the accuracy of predicting shopping habits can radically alter a business like Amazon from a ""shop-then-ship"" to a ""ship-then-shop"" model; that is, if the likelihood of a customer returning a recommended item falls below a certain threshold, then Amazon's costs for returned items (both for processing returns and customer dissatisfaction) will be outweighed by a greater likelihood the customer is satisfied by this automated convenience and will keep (and pay for) an item they may not yet have shopped for or known about. The authors go back to this hypothetical in exploring various ideas, including: -how businesses will feel the impact of AI/ML (the short answer is reduction in cost for certain predictions, which will increase the use and demand for predictions and create downstream opportunities; good historical comparisons are the internet reducing the cost of searching or electrical lighting reducing the cost of reading);-how AI/ML improvements will impact work flows and the division of labor (computers are now better at identifying certain images, e.g., x-rays, than humans are, so the relationship of computers to a human component, e.g., radiologist, may frontload reliance on computers for an initial analysis and shift non-codifiable judgment/decision making to humans to optimize time and error reduction);-how AI/ML improvements will impact allocation of a company's resources (better predictions could mean less investment in capital equipment since you can predict when to contract out specific capital-intensive tasks; certain risk management solutions like biopsies and airport lounges may be utilized more sparingly with better predictions using non-invasive testing or airport commuting);-how AI/ML improvements will impact job training (if AI/ML is meant to accurately predict how humans currently behave, e.g., how doctors identify anomalies in medical imagining, at some point machines may become so much better than humans, the programming will become a victim of its own success if there are not enough model humans to retrain the AI if the old data is no longer reliable);-grappling with when to embrace AI/ML innovation (innovator's dilemma is choosing whether to adopt early to learn from customers and gather data but risk poor performance in the short term OR keep existing customers happy and adopt a more proven model later but risk losing market position to more early-adopter competition; another benefit of early adoption is helping set standards for a nascent technology); and -how risk tolerance for prediction accuracy across different industries influences customer adoption and incentives even incremental AI/ML improvements (think Google Mail proposed responses vs. computer-navigated driverless cars; increasing predication accuracy from 95 to 96% on when to make a right turn may be the deciding factor of when driverless cars are commercially viable and customers feel safe). As an attorney who works with many life sciences and technology companies, the importance of navigating data privacy laws (which have only starting gaining attention over the last five years) cannot be emphasized enough as it impacts every industry (finance, tech, life sciences, education, healthcare, etc.). In an era where data can be collected in innumerable and imperceptible ways and the best data gives a huge competitive advantage , citizens in the US and EU have pushed back to assert greater control over such personal information and tech companies like Apple have listened and dedicated considered PR to allay such customer fears. Nevertheless, the authors astutely recognize the inherent innovative advantage that China and other countries without a data privacy legal regime may have in innovating without legal hurdles. The authors correctly observe the political implications that AI/ML will have on the shift in balance of national income derived from labor vs. capital owners, which we’re already seeing in compensatory policy proposals for “universal basic income” by presidential candidates. But, far from being doomsayers, the authors use historical examples of how innovation has created new opportunities that we could never have predicted. One maxim the author's proffer is how AI/ML actually increases the value of human judgment and decision-making . Certain cognitive tasks, the authors assert, simply cannot be programmed or codified given the inherent limitation of a computer's predictive capacity (think of a ""black swan"" event). This assumes that computers will never be able to accurately mimick human reasoning. Given how much ground AI/ML has covered over the last five years alone that was previously thought impossible and the ability of computers to crunch quadrillions of quantified past human decisions for any imaginable scenario, I wouldn't be surprised if a sequel book is needed to reassess how inimitable or superior human ingenuity is compared to computers."
11,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78089723-joe-flynn,4,"Very good (5* for narrow audience) if niche book on the economics of AI/machine learning. By narrow audience and mean for business leaders, decision makers, and people learning more on the subject, could be students or economists. It is explicitly aimed at them not a lay audience. It is not a computer science book, rather an economics book on the the impact of the new technology of cheap prediction - wonky but not overly complex or jargon filled. Well structured, some may just read for relevent sections of pushed for time. It is very good in avoiding buzz and bluster around these tools, seeing them just as that, though like the computing revolution that made computation cheap, this economic change of scale will push profound changes to our lives.It is also excellent in detailing what won't change and where these technologies have clear weaknesses. In particular better machine prediction will lead to a premium on human judgment in many spaces. That task is often seperated out with good reason - for now!There are many real world examples and stories that enliven the text, the writers run a AI based resource for new companies so have great access. Interesting that so many start ups are predicated on a single application, though the authors explain the real value is in powering change through the entire work flow.Interesting that the big tech companies are ""AI first"" meaning that they prioritize it over even short term customer satisfaction, the big goal is too important to slow development even if that means some of us switch services. Good and balanced on the future, with the new world being changed by AI but making a clear distinction with any possible development of GAI, that would be different gravy. Good sections on privacy, China, and the EU. As with all good books references Taversky and Khaneman :)"
12,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98872916-nish,5,"A good read for anyone with the soul of an economist and an interest in AI. The ideas presented are for the most part basic (perhaps 'foundational' is better) but they are clearly described in economic terms and in a sensible order. The authors begin by looking at the fundamental impact that AI in its current form will have on the production function of various goods/services as well as on the demand for labour, before going on to consider how company leaders might evaluate (and manage) the benefits and risks of using AI. They conclude by briefly touching on potential societal issues related to using AI (including discrimination and existential risks) although there are more comprehensive issues that deal entirely with those."
13,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43122553-masatoshi-nishimura,3,"What's magical about AI and machine learning? They let us predict better and cheaply. That's the premise of the books. Authors talk about what we as humans can do alongside with these predictions but I'd say we are far off from. Being able to perfectly predict the future. We can't even predict the GDP in 2 years. Have we heard of the pandemic coming 1 year ago? We still need to work on a lot more on being able to predict better.  Overall, I didn't find much depth in the book and it was similar to blogs we can find. AI is a popular topic nowadays anyway."
14,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54633229-agust-n-armellini-fischer,5,"”Prediction machines will have their most immediate impact at the decision level. But decisions have six other key elements. When someone (or something) makes a decision, they take input data from the world that enables a prediction. That prediction is possible because training occurred about relationships between different types of data and which data is most closely associated with a situation. Combining the prediction with judgment on what matters, the decision maker can then choose an action. The action leads to an outcome (which has an associated reward or payoff). The outcome is a consequence of the decision. It is needed to provide a complete picture. The outcome may also provide feedback to help improve the next prediction.”As the Canadian rock band Rush used to sing: “If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.”Decision making is at the core of most occupations. From doctors deciding what medicine to prescribe, to truck drivers deciding how to respond to route closures and traffic accidents, we are constantly making decisions in our day to day life.The anatomy of a decision is formed by trying to predict the outcome of the different actions that could be taken given an input. Judgment will decide which is our preferable outcome. For instance, we can predict that it will rain tomorrow and we can decide if given that we want to take an umbrella with us or not. Since we don’t want to carry with the umbrella all day, our judgment will be not to take it even though there is a high probability that it will rain and we might get wet.From predicting if an image contains a cat to predicting what is the answer to “Alexa, what is the capital of France?”, AI has become extremely good at guessing what would humans respond to those questions.Still, AI’s judgment is yet not good enough to substitute us in a lot of cases. In Prediction Machines, three economists look at the future of AI by framing AI as cheap predictions. If predictions suddenly become cheap, how will businesses that rely on them evolve? What will all these humans that work predicting outcomes focus on instead? Will they focus solely on the judgment part of a decision? How will that affect their jobs?Probably one of the best books on the topic of AI that I’ve read so far. This is a must read!"
15,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47111898-daniela-d,5,"The rundown- this is a really good book about the current positioning of machine learning within a socio-economic framework. It is written from the perspective of a few economists, so there is almost no technical jargon. You only need to know in broad terms what ML is or can do. The book is full, although not overflowing with examples, but the ones used are quite good and illustrate the points the authors are trying to make really well. Now a little spoiler alert- the main argument of the book is that ML cannot yet produce artificial intelligence ( at least as fas as multiple basic tasks are concerned), but what it currently does really well is fill in some information gaps in our decision-making process, by providing predictions. The authors argue that it is then up to humans to actually make a judgment based on the presumed impact of each prediction. The value of this judgment is almost impossible to code because the combinations are so mamy and sometimes rare. Ultimately, using AI in the eyes of economists does not mean a new AI economy. All the supply and demand still holds. What changes is the speed of decisions, because predictions are cheaper and faster. This also means, like with amything else that improves in terms of speed and price, that the value of the human employment in that role will decrease, with jobs either focusing on other tasks (the bus driver for a school bus would still be there to supervise the children) or lose considerable income. Additionally, the authors disagree with Nick Bostrom's paperclip AI that will use all of the world's resources. They believe proper in the invisible hand that will lead this AI to trade rather than destroy, i.e. to some sort of an equilibrium. Bottom line, the book is really good, a welcomed and different view about the place of AI from the perspective of economists, with a lot of food for thought and discussion!"
16,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19638210-dane-cobain,4,"I’ve been putting this book off for a little while, and I’m not really sure why. I think I thought it was going to be slow going, but it turns out that I whizzed through it in a day or so. I wasn’t too worried about the subject matter, even though it’s non-fiction about artificial intelligence from the Harvard Business Review press.This was actually recommended to me by a client of mine, Emmanuel Fombu, who specialises in writing and talking about the future of healthcare. It was a good recommendation on his part, especially because there is some stuff here that focusses directly on the impact of artificial intelligence in the healthcare industry. But it’s not just healthcare that’s covered here, and indeed I think the authors did a good job of covering a wide variety of different use cases.It was also interesting to read right now because my current “bedtime book” is The Enigma by Andrew Hodges, a biography of Alan Turing. His work had a huge impact on the development of artificial intelligence and what the authors here call “prediction machines”, and indeed one of the main tests that an AI must pass if it’s to be able to pass as a human is named after Turing: the Turing Test.All in all then, if you have an interest in AI and the way in which it’s changing our society, read this."
17,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48915429-maur-cio-linhares,5,"One of the best books on the possibilities, advantages and disadvantages of using AI, that doesn't focuses solely on buzzwords or useless examples. It starts from what actually matters in AI, prediction, goes on to talk about how we apply prediction and how multiple fields have changed completely after we decided to go for a prediction approach (like translation, that stopped being something that was trying to be done with linguistics and became a prediction problem) and how this shift in paradigm completely changes how we should look and try to use AI in business.The book then goes on multiple examples of AI usage right now and how it could affect the future (amazon moving to a ship and purchase solution instead of the current purchase and ship) and how companies can make use of this. It doesn't provide recipes, models or magical solutions as to how your company can benefit from AI, this is something you have to figure out yourself, which makes this book even better as it doesn't try to pretend to have a formula for success.It's not very technical and does not talk about algorithms or anything like that, this is a great investment even if you're not in the field and are only looking for learning more about AI."
18,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4651295-jason-furman,5,"An excellent book on the economics of Artificial Intelligence. Steeped in both economics and AI/ML, this book steers clear of hype (or anti-hype), applying standard economic concepts to a rapidly emerging phenomenon. The book is geared to business readers not economists or policymakers but it has a lot to offer to everyone.At the heart of the book is the concept that AI/ML is a ""prediction machine"" that is dramatically lowering the cost of making predictions, which will lead to making it cheaper to engage in existing practices but also will open up new possibilities. The authors mostly focus on what businesses need to do in order to take advantage of those opportunities but with a some broader social/political/policy context.Highly recommended."

That said, this book is great for someone familiar with the concept of AI & curious about how it may (or may not) impact business in general, but doesn’t need a length functional/technical review. I found it really interesting and written simply; it wasn’t formulas or math but a simple cause-and-effect look at how the cost of computer-based prediction (AI) is falling, and what that will mean to other industries. For example the value of data will rise, but the value of human prediction will fall. It used many real-world current examples, which were also enlightening. "

It introduces some good ideas here and there (e.g. AI canvas). But they can be derived by the reader herself, too. So nothing revolutionary. The impact of AI on micro and macro level is not discussed in detail I was expecting. The reason I am putting 3 starts is the preface section where top AI guys say very nice (luring?) words about the book. I don’t think they mean the words they say.But anyway, it can be a good starting point to the business of AI. "

31,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91959310-gavin-blasczyk,5,"Title: Prediction MachinesAuthors: Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans, Avi GoldfarbPublish Year: 2018An economists viewpoint on what will occur as our ability to better predict outcomes increases. What will change and what will become more or less valuable?Part 1: Prediction-	Prediction has become cheap, which means more people will utilize it.o	Arithmetic and computing used to be expensive. As it became cheaper, people began experimenting and using arithmetic to solve problems that weren’t typically arithmetic based. Now we use algorithms to produce an immense amount of solutions for an array of problems.o	As prediction machines become cheap, it’s complimentary goods become more expensive. Data, sensors, etc. will be in higher demand and price of those items will increase. While value of substitute goods and services diminish (human prediction)-	Predictive analytics requires data to improve and is very accurate when trained with lots of data. Humans on the other hand are better at recognition and prediction with little data than machines are with little data. I can recognize someone’s face after meeting them once. A machine would have a tough time with that.o	Due in part to this discrepancy ^ humans and machines can find synergies to improve the prediction of the machine and the human when working together. Humans can often offer valuable information the machine does not have when faced with unusual or out of the ordinary circumstances. This collaboration is called “prediction by exception”.-	Machine learning science and statistics had different goals.o	Statistics – wants to be correct on averageo	Machine learning – operational effectiveness. Have biases so long as they were gave better predictions. Can accommodate more interaction between variables.Part 2: Decision Making-	While prediction is a key component of any decision, it is not the only component. The other elements of a decision – Judgment, data, and action – remain in the real of humans. They are complements to prediction. They increase in value as prediction becomes cheap (as noted in chapter 1). The value for human prediction decreases, but the demand for human judgment increases.o	An example referenced many times in the book is that of radiologists. A Radiologists main job is to look at an image an determine what the diagnosis is of the individual, then communicate a treatment plan to a doctor. The imaging portion of this job can be done by machines as we teach them to identify the condition in the picture. This will aid radiologists in determining their judgment and action as to what the correct course of action is for the individual.	If there were only a few solutions, judgement would be easy to code into the prediction machine. However, in this case and many others, the decisions could be many and the judgement on which course of action is correct is often more efficient coming from a human counterpart. This is especially true in rare instances where lets say 97% of the time the image would lead to a certain treatment plan, but perhaps the radiologist is able to determine that due to some other factor this is a rare instance where the treatment plan is out of the ordinary. •	Machines are bad at determine correct judgment for rare scenarios. Without a mass of past experience and data, they will fail to come up with the correct answer. Humans on the other hand can use analogies to other examples to come up with worthwhile information for making a judgement call.o	Another example was of Taxi cab drivers. Their advantage to other drivers was their ability to predict the fastest route from point A to point B. Once Google Maps and other GPS software become easily accessible to the masses, the cab drivers no longer had an advantage. The cab drivers did not get worse, everyone else just got a lot better at predicting the best route.-	3 types of datao	Input	The collection of data o	Trainingo	Feedback-	Airport Lounge example. Airport lounges only exist because we cannot accurately predict when we must leave to get to our flight on time. We satisfice by getting to the airport early to ensure we don’t miss our flight. If we could predict perfectly when we would need to arrive to get on our flight, lounges would not exist. They exist as a buffer to improve our experience with poor prediction abilities.-	Tasks most likely to be fully automated first are the ones for which full automation delivers the highest returns. These include tasks where…o	The other elements are already automated except for prediction (mining)o	The returns to speed of action in response to prediction are high (driverless cars)o	The returns to reduced waiting time for predictions are high (Space Exploration)Part 3: Tools-	Tasks need to be broken down and decomposed to determine where the best ROI for prediction and automation would occur. In a large organization, the tasks that will be completed first are the ones with the greatest ROI.-	MBA screening example. A process could become quite good at determine which candidates would make the best MBA students for your program by watching the videos sent in by the candidates and predicting their success. The problem is that you need to teach the machine very specifically what to look for. What constitutes the “best” candidate? Your outcomes and factors must be well defined to train a prediction machine.-	My favorite example of the machine learning incorrectly was of a machine that was trained to play chess. It learned by watching chess champions play and mimicked their decision making. However, in the games it watched, it learned that in many of the matches where the champion one, he sacrificed his queen to win. The machine computed this as “if I sacrifice my queen, I have a better chance of winning” so it would sacrifice its queen early in the game. The algorithm had to be adjusted to only sacrifice the queen in certain scenarios where it would prove beneficial.-	Implementation of AI tools generates four implications for jobs:o	AI tools may augment jobs, helping people do their job bettero	AI tools may contract jobs. Ex: automated fulfillment centerso	AI tools may lead to the reconstitution of jobs with some tasks added and other taken away, as with radiologistso	AI tools may shift the emphasis on the specific skills required for a particular job, as with school bus drivers. They may be needed more to protect and nurture the children than to drive a vehicle.Part 4: Strategy-	AI can lead to strategic change if three factors are presento	There is a core trade off in the business model. Example was about amazon having such good data that they would change from having people shop and then shipping their products, to one where they would ship the item to the individual before they shopped for it, and if they wanted to return it their would be an infrastructure in place that made that incredibly simple.o	The tradeoff is influenced by uncertainty. We don’t know if the higher sales from the ship first method would result in higher costs from the returned items because we are uncertain how many of the items they will keep. We don’t have enough prediction power to be sure.o	An AI tool that reduces uncertainty tips the scales of the trade off so that the optimal strategy changes from one side of the trade to the other. If you did have the prediction power to be sure what people would buy, you would know if it was more cost effective to ship before shopping.-	Shifting to an AI first strategy means downgrading the previous top priority. It’s not a buzz word. It means you are placing greater value on the goal of maximizing prediction accuracy than you are on other tradeoffs like revenue or user growth.-	Risks of AIo	Predictions can lead to discrimination	Example of google searches suggesting an individual may be arrested because their name was more black-sounding name. The ads would show up if they had a higher quality score (people clicked on them more when the name was that of a black person) so the ads ran more often when you searched a black sounding name.	If you encounter your machine is acting discriminatingly, you need to adjust your algorithm. Doing so can be tough. You need to audit machine and figure out what is causing the behavior.	AI relies on correlation, not causation. You need to be able to see what happens when your variable is both present and not present to determine if it was a causal effect.o	AI is ineffective when data is sparse	Ai is bad at predicting rare eventso	Homgeneity of prediction machines can lead to risk of total system failure	If one crop appears to outgrow the others, a farmer might decide to plant only that crop. But if that crop encounters something that destroys it, the entire yield is destroyed. Similarly, say we all used the same prediction machine for a driverless car. Individually this might give us the best experience, but if someone or something were to attack that machine successfully, it would lead to a catastrophic total system failure. To work against this, we should diversify. We should also consider not tethering live updates to the cloud. o	Feedback can be manipulated so that prediction machines learn destructive behaviorPart 5 : Society-	The rise of AI presents trade offs for societyo	Productivity vs distribution (both examples show how wealth inequality can arise)	Economists agree that technological advance makes us better off and enhances productivity, which AI will do. How the created wealth is distributed will be the issue. If AI takes over certain jobs, humans will compete for the others, driving down wages for those jobs, reducing the fraction of income earned by the laborer compared to that earned by the owners of the capital (the machines doing the work). i.e. The owners of the machines will get a bigger cut of the revenues. 	The AI tools may help highly skilled workers more than lower skilled workers. This is how most computer systems work today. Higher skilled, higher educated workers can use technology more effectively and get a better return from the technology than lower skilled workers.o	Innovation vs competition (monopolization due to exponential increase in prediction capability)	As companies innovate their prediction machines to be more accurate, leading to an increase in users, leading to more data, which loops back into more accurate predictions, they may scale to become a monopoly as competitors cannot scale as quickly. Good for the short term, maybe not good in the long run for society.o	Performance vs privacy	Europe has more restrictive laws around data privacy, and as such will most likely not a be an innovation hub for AI. The US, and China especially, are looser on those laws and will undoubtedly have better performing AI, but at the cost of personal data."
32,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72997602-peter-mccluskey,4,"Three economists decided to write about AI. They got excited about AI, and that distracted them enough that they only said a modest amount about the standard economics principles that laymen need to better understand. As a result, the book ended up mostly being simple descriptions of topics on which the authors had limited expertise. I noticed fewer amateurish mistakes than I expected from this strategy, and they mostly end up doing a good job of describing AI in ways that are mildly helpful to laymen who only want a very high-level view.The book's main goal is to advise business on how to adopt current types of AI (""reading this book is almost surely an excellent predictor of being a manager who will use prediction machines""), with a secondary focus on how jobs will be affected by AI.The authors correctly conclude that a modest extrapolation of current trends implies at most some short-term increases in unemployment.One example they use to help us visualize this is the effects of spreadsheets on bookkeepers. Spreadsheets automated the most time consuming parts of bookkeeping, so fewer bookkeepers were needed to do what bookkeepers did before spreadsheets. But by making bookkeepers more powerful, spreadsheets led to bookkeepers calculating many more results than before.The book mentions horses, but then mostly dismisses, without any clear reason, the risk that humans will become as unemployable as horses did. I guess the authors are mainly imagining the kind of incremental increases in AI abilities that are likely in the next 5 or 10 years. But if we extrapolate to when AI exceeds human-level cognitive abilities, then it seems appropriate to worry about human wages becoming inadequate to feed humans, like what happened to horses a century ago.1.The book's advice to business is fairly appropriate, but often borders on common sense.The authors emphasize the distinction between prediction and judgment. Since they are complements, better prediction means that judgment become more valuable.Prediction machines don't provide judgment. Only humans do.For the near-term changes on which the book mostly focuses, I expect this model to work rather well.But many decades from now, what part of judgment will be hard to automate? Judgment generally requires more general-purpose models of human desires than most current AI hopes to achieve. But large increases in data and computing power seem likely to eventually enable automating most judgment, via something like having an AI predict what a human would say if the human analyzed the situation carefully.2.I'll now mention some complaints I have, about areas where the authors seem to be outside their areas of competence. These aren't particularly important aspects of the book, but I found them about as interesting as the book's main points.The discussion of trucking jobs seems a bit strange. They imagine that humans will need to ride with robotrucks to prevent theft. Would an unmanned truck convoy be at greater risk than are current trucks? I can't quite see how. They'll need good cameras for driving, and it seems like those would also serve as effective means to identify thieves. The robotruck industry may well employ plenty of humans for tasks such as loading and unloading, but I predict humans will rarely accompany robotrucks on long trips.The authors ask what should happen when a robocar hands control to the human driver in an emergency, after pointing out related problems that associated with Air France Flight 447. My answer is that a robocar shouldn't require that a human take control. I don't see much reason to expect humans to do better than software in sudden emergencies. Yet the authors indicate that humans in robocars need to know how to drive, without appearing to consider the advantages of relying on software in emergencies. Trains have been run without drivers present, and the book mentions a mine where trucks operate without drivers. Doing that with cars on typical roads is much harder, but the benefits are also much larger, and I predict I'll feel safer as a pedestrian 15 years from now if cars handle emergencies via software.They can't avoid mentioning the Trolley problem:Someone will have to resolve the dilemma and program the appropriate response into the car. The problem cannot be avoided.There are likely to be political and legal reasons why it can't be avoided, but the authors hint that there are ethical reasons. I don't see those reasons. I'd be happy to use a robocar that handled trolley problems roughly the way that humans do, i.e. treat any situation that kills a person as if it's as close to infinitely bad as our minds can understand [1].They note that having lots of data is somewhat important to making good predictions, which lead them to wonder: will China rule the world due to having more data? I see little strength to the idea that having more people means outperforming due to having more data. The parts of the world with European languages likely have more variety of data than China does, and variety of data is at least as important as quantity.The more interesting hypothesis is that EU-style privacy controls might retard the regions that adopt them. But they mention (elsewhere) evidence from comparing Google to Yahoo/Microsoft which shows that such restrictions have had little effect.The authors dismiss Bostrom's Superintelligence in a way that indicates they don't quite understand what Bostrom is claiming.3.I predict that a modest number of readers will benefit from this book, and a larger number will react favorably to it, while quickly forgetting what it says.Footnote[1] - I also endorse Brad Templeton's explanations of why robocar people should pay less attention to this issue, and implement whatever answer puts robocars on roads soon:It turns out the problem has a simple answer which is highly likely to be the one taken. In almost every situation of this sort, the law already specifies who has the right of way, and who doesn't. The vehicles will be programmed to follow the law, which means that when presented with a choice of hitting something in their right-of-way and hitting something else outside the right-of-way, the car will obey the law and stay in its right-of-way.Given a few reasonable assumptions, from a strict standpoint of counting deaths and injuries, almost any delay to the deployment of high-safety robocars costs lots of lives. And not a minor number. Delay it by a year, and anywhere from 10,000-20,000 extra people will die in the USA, a 300,000 to a million around the world. Delay it by a day and you condemn 30-80 unknown future Americans and 1,000 others to death, and many thousands more to horrible injury.Trolley problems provide potentially valuable insights into how different ethical systems handle situations that are very different from what humans have experienced, but robocar designers should focus on situations that resemble what humans have experienced."
33,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105904707-aaron-kalafarski,3,"This book served more to reinforce concepts around AI than it did to open up new ways of thinking about it. Basically, most AI are prediction machines and the cost of prediction has dramatically decreased. While AI can learn to predict situations it lacks the judgement that humans posses. Therefore, when paired with humans can compliment and enhance their work. As the use of AI improves the effectiveness and efficiency of processes, industries, etc. it will change how we think about work. It will make certain work obsolete and create opportunities elsewhere by analyzing and adjusting to customer feedback.The biggest issue outside of the book to me is as lower-level jobs get automated away those individuals out of a job will either need to be retrained to adapt to AI or find new jobs. This is going to increase workplace stratification and the disparity from those who are technologically adept versus those who are more inept. Is will more than likely impact generations and those of different levels of intelligence the most dramatically. Therefore, I believe we should be spending time focusing on anticipating those problems as well as the benefits AI will bring us. "
34,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107729408-kevin-krom,5,"Key Learns:1. AI is an economic problem (we've had artificial neural nets since the 1950's). The cost of running prediction machines is now obtainable for companies of various sizes2. I liked how the authors split up the various components (prediction, decision making, tools strategy, society).Criticism: Obviously, this is my own issue I have with any book on AI and the corresponding societal impacts but I think most books downplays the impact that prediction machines. It's hard to see books like this say something to the effect of, ""we don't see terminator murder robots running around town so things are pretty good!""... seems wildly myopic. Look at the impact of social media, credit scoring models, advertising campaigns for predatory loan companies, or for-profit colleges... are people getting murdered? no. Are people losing their rights, freedoms, and chance to build a better life for themselves? yes. "
35,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111501905-bilal,4,"The key lessons in this book are: One, the unpacking of decision making into two primary components: prediction and judgement, that is, decisions are meant to choose the best path forward (i.e., judge) when certain dependencies are unknown, and where one assigns certain likelihoods to the unknowns turning out one way or another. The authors argue that AI is best suited to provide the predictions (assign likelihoods to outcomes) and leave the judgement to human beings. They present several examples to make sense of this point. Two, the break down workflows into sub-components, jobs, where some of these jobs may be given to AI. They present several examples of how this is already done in the industry. I found the book informative on these two topics but stating the obvious on other topics."
36,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5938533-byron-wright,4,"This is a great business level book that discusses artificial intelligence. Reading this book I had a real lightbulb moment when there was a discussion of separating judgement from prediction of outcomes in decision making. When AI wasn't making the judgement and was just a tool in the decision making process I saw clearly how it could be used in many instances. There's a lot more to the book including how it might affect employment, different strategies that business might use, the value of data for learning (and how the value of historical data drops once the learning is done).This book does not discuss AI at a technical level. I found it quite accessible as someone with an interest in technology."

The idea that organisations should not position AI in their IT departments seemed obvious, but shifted my thinking and contextualise the business value of AI/ML for me."
39,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7467905-d,3,A good look at the trade offs that come with using AI and between improving AI and other priorities.

55,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51896417-frans-sax-n,3,"Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of AI is a primer on using economics to illuminate the consequences of the rise of AI. This is not a book that will scare you using dramatic, persuasive storytelling. Rather, it is a book using some pretty simple economics concepts (think Econ 101) to illuminate the consequences of the rise of AI, by interpreting AI as prediction machines, and their ""rise"" as a fall in the cost of making predictions. When the cost of making predictions fall, more predictions will be made - when the market price declines, more is demanded. And when the price of predictions decline, not only does the demand of predictions increase, but so does the demand of complements. One complement is judgement - when more predictions can be made, more judgements are called for - What is the implication of the AI predicting a 2 point rise in the probability of accidents? The authors use elementary, well established economics to illustrate a number of implications of AI, in the process demonstrating the power of analyzing complex topics thru a simple, but coherent framework. The theoretical analysis is augmented by illustrative case studies. The comparison between AI and the spreadsheet is illuminating. When the first computer spreadsheet was launched, there were fewer accountants employed than today. The ""rise of the spreadsheet"" led to demand for more accountants, and more scenario analysis, as these activities became cheaper. The authors argue that the same will be the case for AI. While the number of management accountants employed increased, their jobs were transformed. The same will happen with AI, as it reconfigures jobs. The authors do not see AI replacing all human work as the most likely scenario - but that does not mean that it would not affect what jobs look like. As any transformative technology shift, getting the most out of it will require a deep reorganizing of work - both individual jobs as well as organizations. Another literary illuminative example includes the ""rise of"" artificial light (the light bulb), a similar general purpose technology enabling wide spread innovation in business practices. While using elementary economics can get you far, the authors do not shy away from going further, looking at practical challenges (what do I need to employ AI to solve my problems), highlighting the need for data, common pitfalls with interpreting data (think of Wald's analysis in WWII of returning aircraft hit by anti-aircraft fire, and the associated bias), etc.The book is written for a wide audience, but is structured as a typical business book. Each chapter is brief enough, and is summarized in the end in a few succinct bullet points. Think of it as an introduction to the business implications of the economics of AI. This is similar to Carl Shapiro's and Hal Varian's classic on the business implications of the economics of Web 1.0 ""Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy."" Another book in the same fashion that comes to mind is Brynjolfson and McAfee's ""Machine, Platform, Crowd: Harnessing Our Digital Future."" While Brynjofson and McAfee touches on some of the same topics as ""Prediction machines,"" the latter is more focused and thus goes deeper into the topic of AI. And similar to the two previously mentioned books, this uses the economist's standard toolkit - no need to invent fancy new theories to understand the basics of this new phenomena. There may be a new economy, but that does not necessarily require new economics."

57,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55071150-arti,4,"The book looks at AI from the viewpoint of economics and interestingly reframes AI as cheap prediction. It sets the context to show that prediction is now becoming a commodity - and there has been a gradual shift from data and insights to predictions - if you sift through the AI hype, most of the products today sit in this space. Prediction is central to decision making - and it means that organisations can make better decisions, and faster. But the bigger opportunity is where improved quality of predictions can motivate organisations to change their strategy - a simple example is a shift from shop-and-ship to ship-and-shop model - which can transform organisations like Amazon if their predictions are accurate and dependable!The authors argue that the economic shift will centre around a drop in the cost of prediction (and an associated increase in the value of judgement) - which will in turn lower the cost of activities that were historically prediction oriented (like inventory managements, demand forecasting), as well as open up opportunities to use prediction as an input for things for which we never previously did (like translation or navigation which now has moved out of the rule based programming framework to a machine learning based prediction framework that predicts human response to changing environmental data). It's a different perspective and got me to think – the technology geek in me was of-course shocked at the over-simplification. And while I accept that the current state of AI is nowhere close to the myth of super intelligent machines, but limiting the view to predictions and keeping judgement or actions ( out of the purview seems like an incomplete and a short sighted view. It is like saying that we will replace bits and pieces of our existing processes by newer technology. Its an oversimplification of AI and risks losing the bigger picture - the opportunity to reimagine processes - not just with digital intelligence - but also self-learning and self-organising workflows.A stimulating read… it opens up the mind to the prevailing (common) view and an insight into its immediate practical applications and introduces a non-tech user to business considerations such as AI-first strategy (maximising prediction accuracy even at the cost of maximising revenue, user numbers or experience), impact of AI on data, labour, capital, tradeoff between data, prediction accuracy and value, division of labour between humans and machines, managing AI risks - quality, security, liability and in some cases the possibility of changing the strategy itself.But for me, the book have me an opportunity (after being provoked by the authors limited view) to develop a holistic perspective and look beyond prediction - to determine the gaps and next steps to taking AI to the next level of true potential. And i see a significant opportunity in integrating AI into the next step of decision process - judgement (relative payoffs of possible outcomes) and automated actions!Note: The book has evolved from a series of articles on HBR e.g. The Simple Economics of Machine Intelligence and honestly the articles are sufficient to get a good understanding of the theory and the arguments put forth by the authors. Its a much easier option to familiarise with the concepts and I don't think that you would miss a lot from not having read the book."

61,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91959310-gavin-blasczyk,5,"Title: Prediction MachinesAuthors: Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans, Avi GoldfarbPublish Year: 2018An economists viewpoint on what will occur as our ability to better predict outcomes increases. What will change and what will become more or less valuable?Part 1: Prediction-	Prediction has become cheap, which means more people will utilize it.o	Arithmetic and computing used to be expensive. As it became cheaper, people began experimenting and using arithmetic to solve problems that weren’t typically arithmetic based. Now we use algorithms to produce an immense amount of solutions for an array of problems.o	As prediction machines become cheap, it’s complimentary goods become more expensive. Data, sensors, etc. will be in higher demand and price of those items will increase. While value of substitute goods and services diminish (human prediction)-	Predictive analytics requires data to improve and is very accurate when trained with lots of data. Humans on the other hand are better at recognition and prediction with little data than machines are with little data. I can recognize someone’s face after meeting them once. A machine would have a tough time with that.o	Due in part to this discrepancy ^ humans and machines can find synergies to improve the prediction of the machine and the human when working together. Humans can often offer valuable information the machine does not have when faced with unusual or out of the ordinary circumstances. This collaboration is called “prediction by exception”.-	Machine learning science and statistics had different goals.o	Statistics – wants to be correct on averageo	Machine learning – operational effectiveness. Have biases so long as they were gave better predictions. Can accommodate more interaction between variables.Part 2: Decision Making-	While prediction is a key component of any decision, it is not the only component. The other elements of a decision – Judgment, data, and action – remain in the real of humans. They are complements to prediction. They increase in value as prediction becomes cheap (as noted in chapter 1). The value for human prediction decreases, but the demand for human judgment increases.o	An example referenced many times in the book is that of radiologists. A Radiologists main job is to look at an image an determine what the diagnosis is of the individual, then communicate a treatment plan to a doctor. The imaging portion of this job can be done by machines as we teach them to identify the condition in the picture. This will aid radiologists in determining their judgment and action as to what the correct course of action is for the individual.	If there were only a few solutions, judgement would be easy to code into the prediction machine. However, in this case and many others, the decisions could be many and the judgement on which course of action is correct is often more efficient coming from a human counterpart. This is especially true in rare instances where lets say 97% of the time the image would lead to a certain treatment plan, but perhaps the radiologist is able to determine that due to some other factor this is a rare instance where the treatment plan is out of the ordinary. •	Machines are bad at determine correct judgment for rare scenarios. Without a mass of past experience and data, they will fail to come up with the correct answer. Humans on the other hand can use analogies to other examples to come up with worthwhile information for making a judgement call.o	Another example was of Taxi cab drivers. Their advantage to other drivers was their ability to predict the fastest route from point A to point B. Once Google Maps and other GPS software become easily accessible to the masses, the cab drivers no longer had an advantage. The cab drivers did not get worse, everyone else just got a lot better at predicting the best route.-	3 types of datao	Input	The collection of data o	Trainingo	Feedback-	Airport Lounge example. Airport lounges only exist because we cannot accurately predict when we must leave to get to our flight on time. We satisfice by getting to the airport early to ensure we don’t miss our flight. If we could predict perfectly when we would need to arrive to get on our flight, lounges would not exist. They exist as a buffer to improve our experience with poor prediction abilities.-	Tasks most likely to be fully automated first are the ones for which full automation delivers the highest returns. These include tasks where…o	The other elements are already automated except for prediction (mining)o	The returns to speed of action in response to prediction are high (driverless cars)o	The returns to reduced waiting time for predictions are high (Space Exploration)Part 3: Tools-	Tasks need to be broken down and decomposed to determine where the best ROI for prediction and automation would occur. In a large organization, the tasks that will be completed first are the ones with the greatest ROI.-	MBA screening example. A process could become quite good at determine which candidates would make the best MBA students for your program by watching the videos sent in by the candidates and predicting their success. The problem is that you need to teach the machine very specifically what to look for. What constitutes the “best” candidate? Your outcomes and factors must be well defined to train a prediction machine.-	My favorite example of the machine learning incorrectly was of a machine that was trained to play chess. It learned by watching chess champions play and mimicked their decision making. However, in the games it watched, it learned that in many of the matches where the champion one, he sacrificed his queen to win. The machine computed this as “if I sacrifice my queen, I have a better chance of winning” so it would sacrifice its queen early in the game. The algorithm had to be adjusted to only sacrifice the queen in certain scenarios where it would prove beneficial.-	Implementation of AI tools generates four implications for jobs:o	AI tools may augment jobs, helping people do their job bettero	AI tools may contract jobs. Ex: automated fulfillment centerso	AI tools may lead to the reconstitution of jobs with some tasks added and other taken away, as with radiologistso	AI tools may shift the emphasis on the specific skills required for a particular job, as with school bus drivers. They may be needed more to protect and nurture the children than to drive a vehicle.Part 4: Strategy-	AI can lead to strategic change if three factors are presento	There is a core trade off in the business model. Example was about amazon having such good data that they would change from having people shop and then shipping their products, to one where they would ship the item to the individual before they shopped for it, and if they wanted to return it their would be an infrastructure in place that made that incredibly simple.o	The tradeoff is influenced by uncertainty. We don’t know if the higher sales from the ship first method would result in higher costs from the returned items because we are uncertain how many of the items they will keep. We don’t have enough prediction power to be sure.o	An AI tool that reduces uncertainty tips the scales of the trade off so that the optimal strategy changes from one side of the trade to the other. If you did have the prediction power to be sure what people would buy, you would know if it was more cost effective to ship before shopping.-	Shifting to an AI first strategy means downgrading the previous top priority. It’s not a buzz word. It means you are placing greater value on the goal of maximizing prediction accuracy than you are on other tradeoffs like revenue or user growth.-	Risks of AIo	Predictions can lead to discrimination	Example of google searches suggesting an individual may be arrested because their name was more black-sounding name. The ads would show up if they had a higher quality score (people clicked on them more when the name was that of a black person) so the ads ran more often when you searched a black sounding name.	If you encounter your machine is acting discriminatingly, you need to adjust your algorithm. Doing so can be tough. You need to audit machine and figure out what is causing the behavior.	AI relies on correlation, not causation. You need to be able to see what happens when your variable is both present and not present to determine if it was a causal effect.o	AI is ineffective when data is sparse	Ai is bad at predicting rare eventso	Homgeneity of prediction machines can lead to risk of total system failure	If one crop appears to outgrow the others, a farmer might decide to plant only that crop. But if that crop encounters something that destroys it, the entire yield is destroyed. Similarly, say we all used the same prediction machine for a driverless car. Individually this might give us the best experience, but if someone or something were to attack that machine successfully, it would lead to a catastrophic total system failure. To work against this, we should diversify. We should also consider not tethering live updates to the cloud. o	Feedback can be manipulated so that prediction machines learn destructive behaviorPart 5 : Society-	The rise of AI presents trade offs for societyo	Productivity vs distribution (both examples show how wealth inequality can arise)	Economists agree that technological advance makes us better off and enhances productivity, which AI will do. How the created wealth is distributed will be the issue. If AI takes over certain jobs, humans will compete for the others, driving down wages for those jobs, reducing the fraction of income earned by the laborer compared to that earned by the owners of the capital (the machines doing the work). i.e. The owners of the machines will get a bigger cut of the revenues. 	The AI tools may help highly skilled workers more than lower skilled workers. This is how most computer systems work today. Higher skilled, higher educated workers can use technology more effectively and get a better return from the technology than lower skilled workers.o	Innovation vs competition (monopolization due to exponential increase in prediction capability)	As companies innovate their prediction machines to be more accurate, leading to an increase in users, leading to more data, which loops back into more accurate predictions, they may scale to become a monopoly as competitors cannot scale as quickly. Good for the short term, maybe not good in the long run for society.o	Performance vs privacy	Europe has more restrictive laws around data privacy, and as such will most likely not a be an innovation hub for AI. The US, and China especially, are looser on those laws and will undoubtedly have better performing AI, but at the cost of personal data."
62,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72997602-peter-mccluskey,4,"Three economists decided to write about AI. They got excited about AI, and that distracted them enough that they only said a modest amount about the standard economics principles that laymen need to better understand. As a result, the book ended up mostly being simple descriptions of topics on which the authors had limited expertise. I noticed fewer amateurish mistakes than I expected from this strategy, and they mostly end up doing a good job of describing AI in ways that are mildly helpful to laymen who only want a very high-level view.The book's main goal is to advise business on how to adopt current types of AI (""reading this book is almost surely an excellent predictor of being a manager who will use prediction machines""), with a secondary focus on how jobs will be affected by AI.The authors correctly conclude that a modest extrapolation of current trends implies at most some short-term increases in unemployment.One example they use to help us visualize this is the effects of spreadsheets on bookkeepers. Spreadsheets automated the most time consuming parts of bookkeeping, so fewer bookkeepers were needed to do what bookkeepers did before spreadsheets. But by making bookkeepers more powerful, spreadsheets led to bookkeepers calculating many more results than before.The book mentions horses, but then mostly dismisses, without any clear reason, the risk that humans will become as unemployable as horses did. I guess the authors are mainly imagining the kind of incremental increases in AI abilities that are likely in the next 5 or 10 years. But if we extrapolate to when AI exceeds human-level cognitive abilities, then it seems appropriate to worry about human wages becoming inadequate to feed humans, like what happened to horses a century ago.1.The book's advice to business is fairly appropriate, but often borders on common sense.The authors emphasize the distinction between prediction and judgment. Since they are complements, better prediction means that judgment become more valuable.Prediction machines don't provide judgment. Only humans do.For the near-term changes on which the book mostly focuses, I expect this model to work rather well.But many decades from now, what part of judgment will be hard to automate? Judgment generally requires more general-purpose models of human desires than most current AI hopes to achieve. But large increases in data and computing power seem likely to eventually enable automating most judgment, via something like having an AI predict what a human would say if the human analyzed the situation carefully.2.I'll now mention some complaints I have, about areas where the authors seem to be outside their areas of competence. These aren't particularly important aspects of the book, but I found them about as interesting as the book's main points.The discussion of trucking jobs seems a bit strange. They imagine that humans will need to ride with robotrucks to prevent theft. Would an unmanned truck convoy be at greater risk than are current trucks? I can't quite see how. They'll need good cameras for driving, and it seems like those would also serve as effective means to identify thieves. The robotruck industry may well employ plenty of humans for tasks such as loading and unloading, but I predict humans will rarely accompany robotrucks on long trips.The authors ask what should happen when a robocar hands control to the human driver in an emergency, after pointing out related problems that associated with Air France Flight 447. My answer is that a robocar shouldn't require that a human take control. I don't see much reason to expect humans to do better than software in sudden emergencies. Yet the authors indicate that humans in robocars need to know how to drive, without appearing to consider the advantages of relying on software in emergencies. Trains have been run without drivers present, and the book mentions a mine where trucks operate without drivers. Doing that with cars on typical roads is much harder, but the benefits are also much larger, and I predict I'll feel safer as a pedestrian 15 years from now if cars handle emergencies via software.They can't avoid mentioning the Trolley problem:Someone will have to resolve the dilemma and program the appropriate response into the car. The problem cannot be avoided.There are likely to be political and legal reasons why it can't be avoided, but the authors hint that there are ethical reasons. I don't see those reasons. I'd be happy to use a robocar that handled trolley problems roughly the way that humans do, i.e. treat any situation that kills a person as if it's as close to infinitely bad as our minds can understand [1].They note that having lots of data is somewhat important to making good predictions, which lead them to wonder: will China rule the world due to having more data? I see little strength to the idea that having more people means outperforming due to having more data. The parts of the world with European languages likely have more variety of data than China does, and variety of data is at least as important as quantity.The more interesting hypothesis is that EU-style privacy controls might retard the regions that adopt them. But they mention (elsewhere) evidence from comparing Google to Yahoo/Microsoft which shows that such restrictions have had little effect.The authors dismiss Bostrom's Superintelligence in a way that indicates they don't quite understand what Bostrom is claiming.3.I predict that a modest number of readers will benefit from this book, and a larger number will react favorably to it, while quickly forgetting what it says.Footnote[1] - I also endorse Brad Templeton's explanations of why robocar people should pay less attention to this issue, and implement whatever answer puts robocars on roads soon:It turns out the problem has a simple answer which is highly likely to be the one taken. In almost every situation of this sort, the law already specifies who has the right of way, and who doesn't. The vehicles will be programmed to follow the law, which means that when presented with a choice of hitting something in their right-of-way and hitting something else outside the right-of-way, the car will obey the law and stay in its right-of-way.Given a few reasonable assumptions, from a strict standpoint of counting deaths and injuries, almost any delay to the deployment of high-safety robocars costs lots of lives. And not a minor number. Delay it by a year, and anywhere from 10,000-20,000 extra people will die in the USA, a 300,000 to a million around the world. Delay it by a day and you condemn 30-80 unknown future Americans and 1,000 others to death, and many thousands more to horrible injury.Trolley problems provide potentially valuable insights into how different ethical systems handle situations that are very different from what humans have experienced, but robocar designers should focus on situations that resemble what humans have experienced."
63,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105904707-aaron-kalafarski,3,"This book served more to reinforce concepts around AI than it did to open up new ways of thinking about it. Basically, most AI are prediction machines and the cost of prediction has dramatically decreased. While AI can learn to predict situations it lacks the judgement that humans posses. Therefore, when paired with humans can compliment and enhance their work. As the use of AI improves the effectiveness and efficiency of processes, industries, etc. it will change how we think about work. It will make certain work obsolete and create opportunities elsewhere by analyzing and adjusting to customer feedback.The biggest issue outside of the book to me is as lower-level jobs get automated away those individuals out of a job will either need to be retrained to adapt to AI or find new jobs. This is going to increase workplace stratification and the disparity from those who are technologically adept versus those who are more inept. Is will more than likely impact generations and those of different levels of intelligence the most dramatically. Therefore, I believe we should be spending time focusing on anticipating those problems as well as the benefits AI will bring us. "
64,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107729408-kevin-krom,5,"Key Learns:1. AI is an economic problem (we've had artificial neural nets since the 1950's). The cost of running prediction machines is now obtainable for companies of various sizes2. I liked how the authors split up the various components (prediction, decision making, tools strategy, society).Criticism: Obviously, this is my own issue I have with any book on AI and the corresponding societal impacts but I think most books downplays the impact that prediction machines. It's hard to see books like this say something to the effect of, ""we don't see terminator murder robots running around town so things are pretty good!""... seems wildly myopic. Look at the impact of social media, credit scoring models, advertising campaigns for predatory loan companies, or for-profit colleges... are people getting murdered? no. Are people losing their rights, freedoms, and chance to build a better life for themselves? yes. "
65,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111501905-bilal,4,"The key lessons in this book are: One, the unpacking of decision making into two primary components: prediction and judgement, that is, decisions are meant to choose the best path forward (i.e., judge) when certain dependencies are unknown, and where one assigns certain likelihoods to the unknowns turning out one way or another. The authors argue that AI is best suited to provide the predictions (assign likelihoods to outcomes) and leave the judgement to human beings. They present several examples to make sense of this point. Two, the break down workflows into sub-components, jobs, where some of these jobs may be given to AI. They present several examples of how this is already done in the industry. I found the book informative on these two topics but stating the obvious on other topics."
66,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5938533-byron-wright,4,"This is a great business level book that discusses artificial intelligence. Reading this book I had a real lightbulb moment when there was a discussion of separating judgement from prediction of outcomes in decision making. When AI wasn't making the judgement and was just a tool in the decision making process I saw clearly how it could be used in many instances. There's a lot more to the book including how it might affect employment, different strategies that business might use, the value of data for learning (and how the value of historical data drops once the learning is done).This book does not discuss AI at a technical level. I found it quite accessible as someone with an interest in technology."

85,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51896417-frans-sax-n,3,"Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of AI is a primer on using economics to illuminate the consequences of the rise of AI. This is not a book that will scare you using dramatic, persuasive storytelling. Rather, it is a book using some pretty simple economics concepts (think Econ 101) to illuminate the consequences of the rise of AI, by interpreting AI as prediction machines, and their ""rise"" as a fall in the cost of making predictions. When the cost of making predictions fall, more predictions will be made - when the market price declines, more is demanded. And when the price of predictions decline, not only does the demand of predictions increase, but so does the demand of complements. One complement is judgement - when more predictions can be made, more judgements are called for - What is the implication of the AI predicting a 2 point rise in the probability of accidents? The authors use elementary, well established economics to illustrate a number of implications of AI, in the process demonstrating the power of analyzing complex topics thru a simple, but coherent framework. The theoretical analysis is augmented by illustrative case studies. The comparison between AI and the spreadsheet is illuminating. When the first computer spreadsheet was launched, there were fewer accountants employed than today. The ""rise of the spreadsheet"" led to demand for more accountants, and more scenario analysis, as these activities became cheaper. The authors argue that the same will be the case for AI. While the number of management accountants employed increased, their jobs were transformed. The same will happen with AI, as it reconfigures jobs. The authors do not see AI replacing all human work as the most likely scenario - but that does not mean that it would not affect what jobs look like. As any transformative technology shift, getting the most out of it will require a deep reorganizing of work - both individual jobs as well as organizations. Another literary illuminative example includes the ""rise of"" artificial light (the light bulb), a similar general purpose technology enabling wide spread innovation in business practices. While using elementary economics can get you far, the authors do not shy away from going further, looking at practical challenges (what do I need to employ AI to solve my problems), highlighting the need for data, common pitfalls with interpreting data (think of Wald's analysis in WWII of returning aircraft hit by anti-aircraft fire, and the associated bias), etc.The book is written for a wide audience, but is structured as a typical business book. Each chapter is brief enough, and is summarized in the end in a few succinct bullet points. Think of it as an introduction to the business implications of the economics of AI. This is similar to Carl Shapiro's and Hal Varian's classic on the business implications of the economics of Web 1.0 ""Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy."" Another book in the same fashion that comes to mind is Brynjolfson and McAfee's ""Machine, Platform, Crowd: Harnessing Our Digital Future."" While Brynjofson and McAfee touches on some of the same topics as ""Prediction machines,"" the latter is more focused and thus goes deeper into the topic of AI. And similar to the two previously mentioned books, this uses the economist's standard toolkit - no need to invent fancy new theories to understand the basics of this new phenomena. There may be a new economy, but that does not necessarily require new economics."
86,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81309751-louis-zaltzman,4,Great book to understand the basics on ML combined with an optimistic perspective of the future of AI and humanity.
87,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55071150-arti,4,"The book looks at AI from the viewpoint of economics and interestingly reframes AI as cheap prediction. It sets the context to show that prediction is now becoming a commodity - and there has been a gradual shift from data and insights to predictions - if you sift through the AI hype, most of the products today sit in this space. Prediction is central to decision making - and it means that organisations can make better decisions, and faster. But the bigger opportunity is where improved quality of predictions can motivate organisations to change their strategy - a simple example is a shift from shop-and-ship to ship-and-shop model - which can transform organisations like Amazon if their predictions are accurate and dependable!The authors argue that the economic shift will centre around a drop in the cost of prediction (and an associated increase in the value of judgement) - which will in turn lower the cost of activities that were historically prediction oriented (like inventory managements, demand forecasting), as well as open up opportunities to use prediction as an input for things for which we never previously did (like translation or navigation which now has moved out of the rule based programming framework to a machine learning based prediction framework that predicts human response to changing environmental data). It's a different perspective and got me to think – the technology geek in me was of-course shocked at the over-simplification. And while I accept that the current state of AI is nowhere close to the myth of super intelligent machines, but limiting the view to predictions and keeping judgement or actions ( out of the purview seems like an incomplete and a short sighted view. It is like saying that we will replace bits and pieces of our existing processes by newer technology. Its an oversimplification of AI and risks losing the bigger picture - the opportunity to reimagine processes - not just with digital intelligence - but also self-learning and self-organising workflows.A stimulating read… it opens up the mind to the prevailing (common) view and an insight into its immediate practical applications and introduces a non-tech user to business considerations such as AI-first strategy (maximising prediction accuracy even at the cost of maximising revenue, user numbers or experience), impact of AI on data, labour, capital, tradeoff between data, prediction accuracy and value, division of labour between humans and machines, managing AI risks - quality, security, liability and in some cases the possibility of changing the strategy itself.But for me, the book have me an opportunity (after being provoked by the authors limited view) to develop a holistic perspective and look beyond prediction - to determine the gaps and next steps to taking AI to the next level of true potential. And i see a significant opportunity in integrating AI into the next step of decision process - judgement (relative payoffs of possible outcomes) and automated actions!Note: The book has evolved from a series of articles on HBR e.g. The Simple Economics of Machine Intelligence and honestly the articles are sufficient to get a good understanding of the theory and the arguments put forth by the authors. Its a much easier option to familiarise with the concepts and I don't think that you would miss a lot from not having read the book."

91,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91959310-gavin-blasczyk,5,"Title: Prediction MachinesAuthors: Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans, Avi GoldfarbPublish Year: 2018An economists viewpoint on what will occur as our ability to better predict outcomes increases. What will change and what will become more or less valuable?Part 1: Prediction-	Prediction has become cheap, which means more people will utilize it.o	Arithmetic and computing used to be expensive. As it became cheaper, people began experimenting and using arithmetic to solve problems that weren’t typically arithmetic based. Now we use algorithms to produce an immense amount of solutions for an array of problems.o	As prediction machines become cheap, it’s complimentary goods become more expensive. Data, sensors, etc. will be in higher demand and price of those items will increase. While value of substitute goods and services diminish (human prediction)-	Predictive analytics requires data to improve and is very accurate when trained with lots of data. Humans on the other hand are better at recognition and prediction with little data than machines are with little data. I can recognize someone’s face after meeting them once. A machine would have a tough time with that.o	Due in part to this discrepancy ^ humans and machines can find synergies to improve the prediction of the machine and the human when working together. Humans can often offer valuable information the machine does not have when faced with unusual or out of the ordinary circumstances. This collaboration is called “prediction by exception”.-	Machine learning science and statistics had different goals.o	Statistics – wants to be correct on averageo	Machine learning – operational effectiveness. Have biases so long as they were gave better predictions. Can accommodate more interaction between variables.Part 2: Decision Making-	While prediction is a key component of any decision, it is not the only component. The other elements of a decision – Judgment, data, and action – remain in the real of humans. They are complements to prediction. They increase in value as prediction becomes cheap (as noted in chapter 1). The value for human prediction decreases, but the demand for human judgment increases.o	An example referenced many times in the book is that of radiologists. A Radiologists main job is to look at an image an determine what the diagnosis is of the individual, then communicate a treatment plan to a doctor. The imaging portion of this job can be done by machines as we teach them to identify the condition in the picture. This will aid radiologists in determining their judgment and action as to what the correct course of action is for the individual.	If there were only a few solutions, judgement would be easy to code into the prediction machine. However, in this case and many others, the decisions could be many and the judgement on which course of action is correct is often more efficient coming from a human counterpart. This is especially true in rare instances where lets say 97% of the time the image would lead to a certain treatment plan, but perhaps the radiologist is able to determine that due to some other factor this is a rare instance where the treatment plan is out of the ordinary. •	Machines are bad at determine correct judgment for rare scenarios. Without a mass of past experience and data, they will fail to come up with the correct answer. Humans on the other hand can use analogies to other examples to come up with worthwhile information for making a judgement call.o	Another example was of Taxi cab drivers. Their advantage to other drivers was their ability to predict the fastest route from point A to point B. Once Google Maps and other GPS software become easily accessible to the masses, the cab drivers no longer had an advantage. The cab drivers did not get worse, everyone else just got a lot better at predicting the best route.-	3 types of datao	Input	The collection of data o	Trainingo	Feedback-	Airport Lounge example. Airport lounges only exist because we cannot accurately predict when we must leave to get to our flight on time. We satisfice by getting to the airport early to ensure we don’t miss our flight. If we could predict perfectly when we would need to arrive to get on our flight, lounges would not exist. They exist as a buffer to improve our experience with poor prediction abilities.-	Tasks most likely to be fully automated first are the ones for which full automation delivers the highest returns. These include tasks where…o	The other elements are already automated except for prediction (mining)o	The returns to speed of action in response to prediction are high (driverless cars)o	The returns to reduced waiting time for predictions are high (Space Exploration)Part 3: Tools-	Tasks need to be broken down and decomposed to determine where the best ROI for prediction and automation would occur. In a large organization, the tasks that will be completed first are the ones with the greatest ROI.-	MBA screening example. A process could become quite good at determine which candidates would make the best MBA students for your program by watching the videos sent in by the candidates and predicting their success. The problem is that you need to teach the machine very specifically what to look for. What constitutes the “best” candidate? Your outcomes and factors must be well defined to train a prediction machine.-	My favorite example of the machine learning incorrectly was of a machine that was trained to play chess. It learned by watching chess champions play and mimicked their decision making. However, in the games it watched, it learned that in many of the matches where the champion one, he sacrificed his queen to win. The machine computed this as “if I sacrifice my queen, I have a better chance of winning” so it would sacrifice its queen early in the game. The algorithm had to be adjusted to only sacrifice the queen in certain scenarios where it would prove beneficial.-	Implementation of AI tools generates four implications for jobs:o	AI tools may augment jobs, helping people do their job bettero	AI tools may contract jobs. Ex: automated fulfillment centerso	AI tools may lead to the reconstitution of jobs with some tasks added and other taken away, as with radiologistso	AI tools may shift the emphasis on the specific skills required for a particular job, as with school bus drivers. They may be needed more to protect and nurture the children than to drive a vehicle.Part 4: Strategy-	AI can lead to strategic change if three factors are presento	There is a core trade off in the business model. Example was about amazon having such good data that they would change from having people shop and then shipping their products, to one where they would ship the item to the individual before they shopped for it, and if they wanted to return it their would be an infrastructure in place that made that incredibly simple.o	The tradeoff is influenced by uncertainty. We don’t know if the higher sales from the ship first method would result in higher costs from the returned items because we are uncertain how many of the items they will keep. We don’t have enough prediction power to be sure.o	An AI tool that reduces uncertainty tips the scales of the trade off so that the optimal strategy changes from one side of the trade to the other. If you did have the prediction power to be sure what people would buy, you would know if it was more cost effective to ship before shopping.-	Shifting to an AI first strategy means downgrading the previous top priority. It’s not a buzz word. It means you are placing greater value on the goal of maximizing prediction accuracy than you are on other tradeoffs like revenue or user growth.-	Risks of AIo	Predictions can lead to discrimination	Example of google searches suggesting an individual may be arrested because their name was more black-sounding name. The ads would show up if they had a higher quality score (people clicked on them more when the name was that of a black person) so the ads ran more often when you searched a black sounding name.	If you encounter your machine is acting discriminatingly, you need to adjust your algorithm. Doing so can be tough. You need to audit machine and figure out what is causing the behavior.	AI relies on correlation, not causation. You need to be able to see what happens when your variable is both present and not present to determine if it was a causal effect.o	AI is ineffective when data is sparse	Ai is bad at predicting rare eventso	Homgeneity of prediction machines can lead to risk of total system failure	If one crop appears to outgrow the others, a farmer might decide to plant only that crop. But if that crop encounters something that destroys it, the entire yield is destroyed. Similarly, say we all used the same prediction machine for a driverless car. Individually this might give us the best experience, but if someone or something were to attack that machine successfully, it would lead to a catastrophic total system failure. To work against this, we should diversify. We should also consider not tethering live updates to the cloud. o	Feedback can be manipulated so that prediction machines learn destructive behaviorPart 5 : Society-	The rise of AI presents trade offs for societyo	Productivity vs distribution (both examples show how wealth inequality can arise)	Economists agree that technological advance makes us better off and enhances productivity, which AI will do. How the created wealth is distributed will be the issue. If AI takes over certain jobs, humans will compete for the others, driving down wages for those jobs, reducing the fraction of income earned by the laborer compared to that earned by the owners of the capital (the machines doing the work). i.e. The owners of the machines will get a bigger cut of the revenues. 	The AI tools may help highly skilled workers more than lower skilled workers. This is how most computer systems work today. Higher skilled, higher educated workers can use technology more effectively and get a better return from the technology than lower skilled workers.o	Innovation vs competition (monopolization due to exponential increase in prediction capability)	As companies innovate their prediction machines to be more accurate, leading to an increase in users, leading to more data, which loops back into more accurate predictions, they may scale to become a monopoly as competitors cannot scale as quickly. Good for the short term, maybe not good in the long run for society.o	Performance vs privacy	Europe has more restrictive laws around data privacy, and as such will most likely not a be an innovation hub for AI. The US, and China especially, are looser on those laws and will undoubtedly have better performing AI, but at the cost of personal data."
92,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72997602-peter-mccluskey,4,"Three economists decided to write about AI. They got excited about AI, and that distracted them enough that they only said a modest amount about the standard economics principles that laymen need to better understand. As a result, the book ended up mostly being simple descriptions of topics on which the authors had limited expertise. I noticed fewer amateurish mistakes than I expected from this strategy, and they mostly end up doing a good job of describing AI in ways that are mildly helpful to laymen who only want a very high-level view.The book's main goal is to advise business on how to adopt current types of AI (""reading this book is almost surely an excellent predictor of being a manager who will use prediction machines""), with a secondary focus on how jobs will be affected by AI.The authors correctly conclude that a modest extrapolation of current trends implies at most some short-term increases in unemployment.One example they use to help us visualize this is the effects of spreadsheets on bookkeepers. Spreadsheets automated the most time consuming parts of bookkeeping, so fewer bookkeepers were needed to do what bookkeepers did before spreadsheets. But by making bookkeepers more powerful, spreadsheets led to bookkeepers calculating many more results than before.The book mentions horses, but then mostly dismisses, without any clear reason, the risk that humans will become as unemployable as horses did. I guess the authors are mainly imagining the kind of incremental increases in AI abilities that are likely in the next 5 or 10 years. But if we extrapolate to when AI exceeds human-level cognitive abilities, then it seems appropriate to worry about human wages becoming inadequate to feed humans, like what happened to horses a century ago.1.The book's advice to business is fairly appropriate, but often borders on common sense.The authors emphasize the distinction between prediction and judgment. Since they are complements, better prediction means that judgment become more valuable.Prediction machines don't provide judgment. Only humans do.For the near-term changes on which the book mostly focuses, I expect this model to work rather well.But many decades from now, what part of judgment will be hard to automate? Judgment generally requires more general-purpose models of human desires than most current AI hopes to achieve. But large increases in data and computing power seem likely to eventually enable automating most judgment, via something like having an AI predict what a human would say if the human analyzed the situation carefully.2.I'll now mention some complaints I have, about areas where the authors seem to be outside their areas of competence. These aren't particularly important aspects of the book, but I found them about as interesting as the book's main points.The discussion of trucking jobs seems a bit strange. They imagine that humans will need to ride with robotrucks to prevent theft. Would an unmanned truck convoy be at greater risk than are current trucks? I can't quite see how. They'll need good cameras for driving, and it seems like those would also serve as effective means to identify thieves. The robotruck industry may well employ plenty of humans for tasks such as loading and unloading, but I predict humans will rarely accompany robotrucks on long trips.The authors ask what should happen when a robocar hands control to the human driver in an emergency, after pointing out related problems that associated with Air France Flight 447. My answer is that a robocar shouldn't require that a human take control. I don't see much reason to expect humans to do better than software in sudden emergencies. Yet the authors indicate that humans in robocars need to know how to drive, without appearing to consider the advantages of relying on software in emergencies. Trains have been run without drivers present, and the book mentions a mine where trucks operate without drivers. Doing that with cars on typical roads is much harder, but the benefits are also much larger, and I predict I'll feel safer as a pedestrian 15 years from now if cars handle emergencies via software.They can't avoid mentioning the Trolley problem:Someone will have to resolve the dilemma and program the appropriate response into the car. The problem cannot be avoided.There are likely to be political and legal reasons why it can't be avoided, but the authors hint that there are ethical reasons. I don't see those reasons. I'd be happy to use a robocar that handled trolley problems roughly the way that humans do, i.e. treat any situation that kills a person as if it's as close to infinitely bad as our minds can understand [1].They note that having lots of data is somewhat important to making good predictions, which lead them to wonder: will China rule the world due to having more data? I see little strength to the idea that having more people means outperforming due to having more data. The parts of the world with European languages likely have more variety of data than China does, and variety of data is at least as important as quantity.The more interesting hypothesis is that EU-style privacy controls might retard the regions that adopt them. But they mention (elsewhere) evidence from comparing Google to Yahoo/Microsoft which shows that such restrictions have had little effect.The authors dismiss Bostrom's Superintelligence in a way that indicates they don't quite understand what Bostrom is claiming.3.I predict that a modest number of readers will benefit from this book, and a larger number will react favorably to it, while quickly forgetting what it says.Footnote[1] - I also endorse Brad Templeton's explanations of why robocar people should pay less attention to this issue, and implement whatever answer puts robocars on roads soon:It turns out the problem has a simple answer which is highly likely to be the one taken. In almost every situation of this sort, the law already specifies who has the right of way, and who doesn't. The vehicles will be programmed to follow the law, which means that when presented with a choice of hitting something in their right-of-way and hitting something else outside the right-of-way, the car will obey the law and stay in its right-of-way.Given a few reasonable assumptions, from a strict standpoint of counting deaths and injuries, almost any delay to the deployment of high-safety robocars costs lots of lives. And not a minor number. Delay it by a year, and anywhere from 10,000-20,000 extra people will die in the USA, a 300,000 to a million around the world. Delay it by a day and you condemn 30-80 unknown future Americans and 1,000 others to death, and many thousands more to horrible injury.Trolley problems provide potentially valuable insights into how different ethical systems handle situations that are very different from what humans have experienced, but robocar designers should focus on situations that resemble what humans have experienced."
93,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105904707-aaron-kalafarski,3,"This book served more to reinforce concepts around AI than it did to open up new ways of thinking about it. Basically, most AI are prediction machines and the cost of prediction has dramatically decreased. While AI can learn to predict situations it lacks the judgement that humans posses. Therefore, when paired with humans can compliment and enhance their work. As the use of AI improves the effectiveness and efficiency of processes, industries, etc. it will change how we think about work. It will make certain work obsolete and create opportunities elsewhere by analyzing and adjusting to customer feedback.The biggest issue outside of the book to me is as lower-level jobs get automated away those individuals out of a job will either need to be retrained to adapt to AI or find new jobs. This is going to increase workplace stratification and the disparity from those who are technologically adept versus those who are more inept. Is will more than likely impact generations and those of different levels of intelligence the most dramatically. Therefore, I believe we should be spending time focusing on anticipating those problems as well as the benefits AI will bring us. "
94,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107729408-kevin-krom,5,"Key Learns:1. AI is an economic problem (we've had artificial neural nets since the 1950's). The cost of running prediction machines is now obtainable for companies of various sizes2. I liked how the authors split up the various components (prediction, decision making, tools strategy, society).Criticism: Obviously, this is my own issue I have with any book on AI and the corresponding societal impacts but I think most books downplays the impact that prediction machines. It's hard to see books like this say something to the effect of, ""we don't see terminator murder robots running around town so things are pretty good!""... seems wildly myopic. Look at the impact of social media, credit scoring models, advertising campaigns for predatory loan companies, or for-profit colleges... are people getting murdered? no. Are people losing their rights, freedoms, and chance to build a better life for themselves? yes. "
95,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111501905-bilal,4,"The key lessons in this book are: One, the unpacking of decision making into two primary components: prediction and judgement, that is, decisions are meant to choose the best path forward (i.e., judge) when certain dependencies are unknown, and where one assigns certain likelihoods to the unknowns turning out one way or another. The authors argue that AI is best suited to provide the predictions (assign likelihoods to outcomes) and leave the judgement to human beings. They present several examples to make sense of this point. Two, the break down workflows into sub-components, jobs, where some of these jobs may be given to AI. They present several examples of how this is already done in the industry. I found the book informative on these two topics but stating the obvious on other topics."

Reading this book I had a real lightbulb moment when there was a discussion of separating judgement from prediction of outcomes in decision making. When AI wasn't making the judgement and was just a tool in the decision making process I saw clearly how it could be used in many instances. There's a lot more to the book including how it might affect employment, different strategies that business might use, the value of data for learning (and how the value of historical data drops once the learning is done).This book does not discuss AI at a technical level. I found it quite accessible as someone with an interest in technology."

115,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51896417-frans-sax-n,3,"Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of AI is a primer on using economics to illuminate the consequences of the rise of AI. This is not a book that will scare you using dramatic, persuasive storytelling. Rather, it is a book using some pretty simple economics concepts (think Econ 101) to illuminate the consequences of the rise of AI, by interpreting AI as prediction machines, and their ""rise"" as a fall in the cost of making predictions. When the cost of making predictions fall, more predictions will be made - when the market price declines, more is demanded. And when the price of predictions decline, not only does the demand of predictions increase, but so does the demand of complements. One complement is judgement - when more predictions can be made, more judgements are called for - What is the implication of the AI predicting a 2 point rise in the probability of accidents? The authors use elementary, well established economics to illustrate a number of implications of AI, in the process demonstrating the power of analyzing complex topics thru a simple, but coherent framework. The theoretical analysis is augmented by illustrative case studies. The comparison between AI and the spreadsheet is illuminating. When the first computer spreadsheet was launched, there were fewer accountants employed than today. The ""rise of the spreadsheet"" led to demand for more accountants, and more scenario analysis, as these activities became cheaper. The authors argue that the same will be the case for AI. While the number of management accountants employed increased, their jobs were transformed. The same will happen with AI, as it reconfigures jobs. The authors do not see AI replacing all human work as the most likely scenario - but that does not mean that it would not affect what jobs look like. As any transformative technology shift, getting the most out of it will require a deep reorganizing of work - both individual jobs as well as organizations. Another literary illuminative example includes the ""rise of"" artificial light (the light bulb), a similar general purpose technology enabling wide spread innovation in business practices. While using elementary economics can get you far, the authors do not shy away from going further, looking at practical challenges (what do I need to employ AI to solve my problems), highlighting the need for data, common pitfalls with interpreting data (think of Wald's analysis in WWII of returning aircraft hit by anti-aircraft fire, and the associated bias), etc.The book is written for a wide audience, but is structured as a typical business book. Each chapter is brief enough, and is summarized in the end in a few succinct bullet points. Think of it as an introduction to the business implications of the economics of AI. This is similar to Carl Shapiro's and Hal Varian's classic on the business implications of the economics of Web 1.0 ""Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy."" Another book in the same fashion that comes to mind is Brynjolfson and McAfee's ""Machine, Platform, Crowd: Harnessing Our Digital Future."" While Brynjofson and McAfee touches on some of the same topics as ""Prediction machines,"" the latter is more focused and thus goes deeper into the topic of AI. And similar to the two previously mentioned books, this uses the economist's standard toolkit - no need to invent fancy new theories to understand the basics of this new phenomena. There may be a new economy, but that does not necessarily require new economics."
116,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81309751-louis-zaltzman,4,Great book to understand the basics on ML combined with an optimistic perspective of the future of AI and humanity.
117,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55071150-arti,4,"The book looks at AI from the viewpoint of economics and interestingly reframes AI as cheap prediction. It sets the context to show that prediction is now becoming a commodity - and there has been a gradual shift from data and insights to predictions - if you sift through the AI hype, most of the products today sit in this space. Prediction is central to decision making - and it means that organisations can make better decisions, and faster. But the bigger opportunity is where improved quality of predictions can motivate organisations to change their strategy - a simple example is a shift from shop-and-ship to ship-and-shop model - which can transform organisations like Amazon if their predictions are accurate and dependable!The authors argue that the economic shift will centre around a drop in the cost of prediction (and an associated increase in the value of judgement) - which will in turn lower the cost of activities that were historically prediction oriented (like inventory managements, demand forecasting), as well as open up opportunities to use prediction as an input for things for which we never previously did (like translation or navigation which now has moved out of the rule based programming framework to a machine learning based prediction framework that predicts human response to changing environmental data). It's a different perspective and got me to think – the technology geek in me was of-course shocked at the over-simplification. And while I accept that the current state of AI is nowhere close to the myth of super intelligent machines, but limiting the view to predictions and keeping judgement or actions ( out of the purview seems like an incomplete and a short sighted view. It is like saying that we will replace bits and pieces of our existing processes by newer technology. Its an oversimplification of AI and risks losing the bigger picture - the opportunity to reimagine processes - not just with digital intelligence - but also self-learning and self-organising workflows.A stimulating read… it opens up the mind to the prevailing (common) view and an insight into its immediate practical applications and introduces a non-tech user to business considerations such as AI-first strategy (maximising prediction accuracy even at the cost of maximising revenue, user numbers or experience), impact of AI on data, labour, capital, tradeoff between data, prediction accuracy and value, division of labour between humans and machines, managing AI risks - quality, security, liability and in some cases the possibility of changing the strategy itself.But for me, the book have me an opportunity (after being provoked by the authors limited view) to develop a holistic perspective and look beyond prediction - to determine the gaps and next steps to taking AI to the next level of true potential. And i see a significant opportunity in integrating AI into the next step of decision process - judgement (relative payoffs of possible outcomes) and automated actions!Note: The book has evolved from a series of articles on HBR e.g. The Simple Economics of Machine Intelligence and honestly the articles are sufficient to get a good understanding of the theory and the arguments put forth by the authors. Its a much easier option to familiarise with the concepts and I don't think that you would miss a lot from not having read the book."

121,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91959310-gavin-blasczyk,5,"Title: Prediction MachinesAuthors: Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans, Avi GoldfarbPublish Year: 2018An economists viewpoint on what will occur as our ability to better predict outcomes increases. What will change and what will become more or less valuable?Part 1: Prediction-	Prediction has become cheap, which means more people will utilize it.o	Arithmetic and computing used to be expensive. As it became cheaper, people began experimenting and using arithmetic to solve problems that weren’t typically arithmetic based. Now we use algorithms to produce an immense amount of solutions for an array of problems.o	As prediction machines become cheap, it’s complimentary goods become more expensive. Data, sensors, etc. will be in higher demand and price of those items will increase. While value of substitute goods and services diminish (human prediction)-	Predictive analytics requires data to improve and is very accurate when trained with lots of data. Humans on the other hand are better at recognition and prediction with little data than machines are with little data. I can recognize someone’s face after meeting them once. A machine would have a tough time with that.o	Due in part to this discrepancy ^ humans and machines can find synergies to improve the prediction of the machine and the human when working together. Humans can often offer valuable information the machine does not have when faced with unusual or out of the ordinary circumstances. This collaboration is called “prediction by exception”.-	Machine learning science and statistics had different goals.o	Statistics – wants to be correct on averageo	Machine learning – operational effectiveness. Have biases so long as they were gave better predictions. Can accommodate more interaction between variables.Part 2: Decision Making-	While prediction is a key component of any decision, it is not the only component. The other elements of a decision – Judgment, data, and action – remain in the real of humans. They are complements to prediction. They increase in value as prediction becomes cheap (as noted in chapter 1). The value for human prediction decreases, but the demand for human judgment increases.o	An example referenced many times in the book is that of radiologists. A Radiologists main job is to look at an image an determine what the diagnosis is of the individual, then communicate a treatment plan to a doctor. The imaging portion of this job can be done by machines as we teach them to identify the condition in the picture. This will aid radiologists in determining their judgment and action as to what the correct course of action is for the individual.	If there were only a few solutions, judgement would be easy to code into the prediction machine. However, in this case and many others, the decisions could be many and the judgement on which course of action is correct is often more efficient coming from a human counterpart. This is especially true in rare instances where lets say 97% of the time the image would lead to a certain treatment plan, but perhaps the radiologist is able to determine that due to some other factor this is a rare instance where the treatment plan is out of the ordinary. •	Machines are bad at determine correct judgment for rare scenarios. Without a mass of past experience and data, they will fail to come up with the correct answer. Humans on the other hand can use analogies to other examples to come up with worthwhile information for making a judgement call.o	Another example was of Taxi cab drivers. Their advantage to other drivers was their ability to predict the fastest route from point A to point B. Once Google Maps and other GPS software become easily accessible to the masses, the cab drivers no longer had an advantage. The cab drivers did not get worse, everyone else just got a lot better at predicting the best route.-	3 types of datao	Input	The collection of data o	Trainingo	Feedback-	Airport Lounge example. Airport lounges only exist because we cannot accurately predict when we must leave to get to our flight on time. We satisfice by getting to the airport early to ensure we don’t miss our flight. If we could predict perfectly when we would need to arrive to get on our flight, lounges would not exist. They exist as a buffer to improve our experience with poor prediction abilities.-	Tasks most likely to be fully automated first are the ones for which full automation delivers the highest returns. These include tasks where…o	The other elements are already automated except for prediction (mining)o	The returns to speed of action in response to prediction are high (driverless cars)o	The returns to reduced waiting time for predictions are high (Space Exploration)Part 3: Tools-	Tasks need to be broken down and decomposed to determine where the best ROI for prediction and automation would occur. In a large organization, the tasks that will be completed first are the ones with the greatest ROI.-	MBA screening example. A process could become quite good at determine which candidates would make the best MBA students for your program by watching the videos sent in by the candidates and predicting their success. The problem is that you need to teach the machine very specifically what to look for. What constitutes the “best” candidate? Your outcomes and factors must be well defined to train a prediction machine.-	My favorite example of the machine learning incorrectly was of a machine that was trained to play chess. It learned by watching chess champions play and mimicked their decision making. However, in the games it watched, it learned that in many of the matches where the champion one, he sacrificed his queen to win. The machine computed this as “if I sacrifice my queen, I have a better chance of winning” so it would sacrifice its queen early in the game. The algorithm had to be adjusted to only sacrifice the queen in certain scenarios where it would prove beneficial.-	Implementation of AI tools generates four implications for jobs:o	AI tools may augment jobs, helping people do their job bettero	AI tools may contract jobs. Ex: automated fulfillment centerso	AI tools may lead to the reconstitution of jobs with some tasks added and other taken away, as with radiologistso	AI tools may shift the emphasis on the specific skills required for a particular job, as with school bus drivers. They may be needed more to protect and nurture the children than to drive a vehicle.Part 4: Strategy-	AI can lead to strategic change if three factors are presento	There is a core trade off in the business model. Example was about amazon having such good data that they would change from having people shop and then shipping their products, to one where they would ship the item to the individual before they shopped for it, and if they wanted to return it their would be an infrastructure in place that made that incredibly simple.o	The tradeoff is influenced by uncertainty. We don’t know if the higher sales from the ship first method would result in higher costs from the returned items because we are uncertain how many of the items they will keep. We don’t have enough prediction power to be sure.o	An AI tool that reduces uncertainty tips the scales of the trade off so that the optimal strategy changes from one side of the trade to the other. If you did have the prediction power to be sure what people would buy, you would know if it was more cost effective to ship before shopping.-	Shifting to an AI first strategy means downgrading the previous top priority. It’s not a buzz word. It means you are placing greater value on the goal of maximizing prediction accuracy than you are on other tradeoffs like revenue or user growth.-	Risks of AIo	Predictions can lead to discrimination	Example of google searches suggesting an individual may be arrested because their name was more black-sounding name. The ads would show up if they had a higher quality score (people clicked on them more when the name was that of a black person) so the ads ran more often when you searched a black sounding name.	If you encounter your machine is acting discriminatingly, you need to adjust your algorithm. Doing so can be tough. You need to audit machine and figure out what is causing the behavior.	AI relies on correlation, not causation. You need to be able to see what happens when your variable is both present and not present to determine if it was a causal effect.o	AI is ineffective when data is sparse	Ai is bad at predicting rare eventso	Homgeneity of prediction machines can lead to risk of total system failure	If one crop appears to outgrow the others, a farmer might decide to plant only that crop. But if that crop encounters something that destroys it, the entire yield is destroyed. Similarly, say we all used the same prediction machine for a driverless car. Individually this might give us the best experience, but if someone or something were to attack that machine successfully, it would lead to a catastrophic total system failure. To work against this, we should diversify. We should also consider not tethering live updates to the cloud. o	Feedback can be manipulated so that prediction machines learn destructive behaviorPart 5 : Society-	The rise of AI presents trade offs for societyo	Productivity vs distribution (both examples show how wealth inequality can arise)	Economists agree that technological advance makes us better off and enhances productivity, which AI will do. How the created wealth is distributed will be the issue. If AI takes over certain jobs, humans will compete for the others, driving down wages for those jobs, reducing the fraction of income earned by the laborer compared to that earned by the owners of the capital (the machines doing the work). i.e. The owners of the machines will get a bigger cut of the revenues. 	The AI tools may help highly skilled workers more than lower skilled workers. This is how most computer systems work today. Higher skilled, higher educated workers can use technology more effectively and get a better return from the technology than lower skilled workers.o	Innovation vs competition (monopolization due to exponential increase in prediction capability)	As companies innovate their prediction machines to be more accurate, leading to an increase in users, leading to more data, which loops back into more accurate predictions, they may scale to become a monopoly as competitors cannot scale as quickly. Good for the short term, maybe not good in the long run for society.o	Performance vs privacy	Europe has more restrictive laws around data privacy, and as such will most likely not a be an innovation hub for AI. The US, and China especially, are looser on those laws and will undoubtedly have better performing AI, but at the cost of personal data."
122,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72997602-peter-mccluskey,4,"Three economists decided to write about AI. They got excited about AI, and that distracted them enough that they only said a modest amount about the standard economics principles that laymen need to better understand. As a result, the book ended up mostly being simple descriptions of topics on which the authors had limited expertise. I noticed fewer amateurish mistakes than I expected from this strategy, and they mostly end up doing a good job of describing AI in ways that are mildly helpful to laymen who only want a very high-level view.The book's main goal is to advise business on how to adopt current types of AI (""reading this book is almost surely an excellent predictor of being a manager who will use prediction machines""), with a secondary focus on how jobs will be affected by AI.The authors correctly conclude that a modest extrapolation of current trends implies at most some short-term increases in unemployment.One example they use to help us visualize this is the effects of spreadsheets on bookkeepers. Spreadsheets automated the most time consuming parts of bookkeeping, so fewer bookkeepers were needed to do what bookkeepers did before spreadsheets. But by making bookkeepers more powerful, spreadsheets led to bookkeepers calculating many more results than before.The book mentions horses, but then mostly dismisses, without any clear reason, the risk that humans will become as unemployable as horses did. I guess the authors are mainly imagining the kind of incremental increases in AI abilities that are likely in the next 5 or 10 years. But if we extrapolate to when AI exceeds human-level cognitive abilities, then it seems appropriate to worry about human wages becoming inadequate to feed humans, like what happened to horses a century ago.1.The book's advice to business is fairly appropriate, but often borders on common sense.The authors emphasize the distinction between prediction and judgment. Since they are complements, better prediction means that judgment become more valuable.Prediction machines don't provide judgment. Only humans do.For the near-term changes on which the book mostly focuses, I expect this model to work rather well.But many decades from now, what part of judgment will be hard to automate? Judgment generally requires more general-purpose models of human desires than most current AI hopes to achieve. But large increases in data and computing power seem likely to eventually enable automating most judgment, via something like having an AI predict what a human would say if the human analyzed the situation carefully.2.I'll now mention some complaints I have, about areas where the authors seem to be outside their areas of competence. These aren't particularly important aspects of the book, but I found them about as interesting as the book's main points.The discussion of trucking jobs seems a bit strange. They imagine that humans will need to ride with robotrucks to prevent theft. Would an unmanned truck convoy be at greater risk than are current trucks? I can't quite see how. They'll need good cameras for driving, and it seems like those would also serve as effective means to identify thieves. The robotruck industry may well employ plenty of humans for tasks such as loading and unloading, but I predict humans will rarely accompany robotrucks on long trips.The authors ask what should happen when a robocar hands control to the human driver in an emergency, after pointing out related problems that associated with Air France Flight 447. My answer is that a robocar shouldn't require that a human take control. I don't see much reason to expect humans to do better than software in sudden emergencies. Yet the authors indicate that humans in robocars need to know how to drive, without appearing to consider the advantages of relying on software in emergencies. Trains have been run without drivers present, and the book mentions a mine where trucks operate without drivers. Doing that with cars on typical roads is much harder, but the benefits are also much larger, and I predict I'll feel safer as a pedestrian 15 years from now if cars handle emergencies via software.They can't avoid mentioning the Trolley problem:Someone will have to resolve the dilemma and program the appropriate response into the car. The problem cannot be avoided.There are likely to be political and legal reasons why it can't be avoided, but the authors hint that there are ethical reasons. I don't see those reasons. I'd be happy to use a robocar that handled trolley problems roughly the way that humans do, i.e. treat any situation that kills a person as if it's as close to infinitely bad as our minds can understand [1].They note that having lots of data is somewhat important to making good predictions, which lead them to wonder: will China rule the world due to having more data? I see little strength to the idea that having more people means outperforming due to having more data. The parts of the world with European languages likely have more variety of data than China does, and variety of data is at least as important as quantity.The more interesting hypothesis is that EU-style privacy controls might retard the regions that adopt them. But they mention (elsewhere) evidence from comparing Google to Yahoo/Microsoft which shows that such restrictions have had little effect.The authors dismiss Bostrom's Superintelligence in a way that indicates they don't quite understand what Bostrom is claiming.3.I predict that a modest number of readers will benefit from this book, and a larger number will react favorably to it, while quickly forgetting what it says.Footnote[1] - I also endorse Brad Templeton's explanations of why robocar people should pay less attention to this issue, and implement whatever answer puts robocars on roads soon:It turns out the problem has a simple answer which is highly likely to be the one taken. In almost every situation of this sort, the law already specifies who has the right of way, and who doesn't. The vehicles will be programmed to follow the law, which means that when presented with a choice of hitting something in their right-of-way and hitting something else outside the right-of-way, the car will obey the law and stay in its right-of-way.Given a few reasonable assumptions, from a strict standpoint of counting deaths and injuries, almost any delay to the deployment of high-safety robocars costs lots of lives. And not a minor number. Delay it by a year, and anywhere from 10,000-20,000 extra people will die in the USA, a 300,000 to a million around the world. Delay it by a day and you condemn 30-80 unknown future Americans and 1,000 others to death, and many thousands more to horrible injury.Trolley problems provide potentially valuable insights into how different ethical systems handle situations that are very different from what humans have experienced, but robocar designers should focus on situations that resemble what humans have experienced."
123,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105904707-aaron-kalafarski,3,"This book served more to reinforce concepts around AI than it did to open up new ways of thinking about it. Basically, most AI are prediction machines and the cost of prediction has dramatically decreased. While AI can learn to predict situations it lacks the judgement that humans posses. Therefore, when paired with humans can compliment and enhance their work. As the use of AI improves the effectiveness and efficiency of processes, industries, etc. it will change how we think about work. It will make certain work obsolete and create opportunities elsewhere by analyzing and adjusting to customer feedback.The biggest issue outside of the book to me is as lower-level jobs get automated away those individuals out of a job will either need to be retrained to adapt to AI or find new jobs. This is going to increase workplace stratification and the disparity from those who are technologically adept versus those who are more inept. Is will more than likely impact generations and those of different levels of intelligence the most dramatically. Therefore, I believe we should be spending time focusing on anticipating those problems as well as the benefits AI will bring us. "
124,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107729408-kevin-krom,5,"Key Learns:1. AI is an economic problem (we've had artificial neural nets since the 1950's). The cost of running prediction machines is now obtainable for companies of various sizes2. I liked how the authors split up the various components (prediction, decision making, tools strategy, society).Criticism: Obviously, this is my own issue I have with any book on AI and the corresponding societal impacts but I think most books downplays the impact that prediction machines. It's hard to see books like this say something to the effect of, ""we don't see terminator murder robots running around town so things are pretty good!""... seems wildly myopic. Look at the impact of social media, credit scoring models, advertising campaigns for predatory loan companies, or for-profit colleges... are people getting murdered? no. Are people losing their rights, freedoms, and chance to build a better life for themselves? yes. "
125,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111501905-bilal,4,"The key lessons in this book are: One, the unpacking of decision making into two primary components: prediction and judgement, that is, decisions are meant to choose the best path forward (i.e., judge) when certain dependencies are unknown, and where one assigns certain likelihoods to the unknowns turning out one way or another. The authors argue that AI is best suited to provide the predictions (assign likelihoods to outcomes) and leave the judgement to human beings. They present several examples to make sense of this point. Two, the break down workflows into sub-components, jobs, where some of these jobs may be given to AI. They present several examples of how this is already done in the industry. I found the book informative on these two topics but stating the obvious on other topics."

Reading this book I had a real lightbulb moment when there was a discussion of separating judgement from prediction of outcomes in decision making. When AI wasn't making the judgement and was just a tool in the decision making process I saw clearly how it could be used in many instances. There's a lot more to the book including how it might affect employment, different strategies that business might use, the value of data for learning (and how the value of historical data drops once the learning is done).This book does not discuss AI at a technical level. I found it quite accessible as someone with an interest in technology."

It’s quick and the chapter summaries are very crisp and there the focus on AI = cheap, plentiful, accurate predictions *is* an interesting and useful frame for AI within business in the next 5 years. There’s also some useful first principles stuff on prediction - “prediction requires a specificity not found in mission statements.” (An under-appreciated part of facebook’s success and why they are now coming unstuck is their leadership’s ability to be specific in what they want - sharing, likes, engagement etc)“Companies often find themselves having to go back to basics to realign on their objectives and sharpen their mission statement as a first step in their AI strategy”“prediction and judgement are complements so better prediction [AI] increases the demand for judgement, meaning that your employees’ main role will be to exercise judgement in decision making.” Good summary on the final page of the trade offs for society around AI:* Productivity vs (wealth/power) distribution* Innovation vs competition * Performance vs privacy"

The focused clear definitions helped delineate the scope of the book, and allowed me to build usable mental models rather than generalised feelings. The idea that organisations should not position AI in their IT departments seemed obvious, but shifted my thinking and contextualise the business value of AI/ML for me."
129,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7467905-d,3,A good look at the trade offs that come with using AI and between improving AI and other priorities. I liked the point that when the IPhone was launched no one said this is the end of the taxi companies. We can't predict where even the limited version of A.I. available now will lead but we can start thinking about all the current trade offs we make because prediction is imprecise and how they would change if precision became cheap and accurate.

145,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51896417-frans-sax-n,3,"Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of AI is a primer on using economics to illuminate the consequences of the rise of AI. This is not a book that will scare you using dramatic, persuasive storytelling. Rather, it is a book using some pretty simple economics concepts (think Econ 101) to illuminate the consequences of the rise of AI, by interpreting AI as prediction machines, and their ""rise"" as a fall in the cost of making predictions. When the cost of making predictions fall, more predictions will be made - when the market price declines, more is demanded. And when the price of predictions decline, not only does the demand of predictions increase, but so does the demand of complements. One complement is judgement - when more predictions can be made, more judgements are called for - What is the implication of the AI predicting a 2 point rise in the probability of accidents? The authors use elementary, well established economics to illustrate a number of implications of AI, in the process demonstrating the power of analyzing complex topics thru a simple, but coherent framework. The theoretical analysis is augmented by illustrative case studies. The comparison between AI and the spreadsheet is illuminating. When the first computer spreadsheet was launched, there were fewer accountants employed than today. The ""rise of the spreadsheet"" led to demand for more accountants, and more scenario analysis, as these activities became cheaper. The authors argue that the same will be the case for AI. While the number of management accountants employed increased, their jobs were transformed. The same will happen with AI, as it reconfigures jobs. The authors do not see AI replacing all human work as the most likely scenario - but that does not mean that it would not affect what jobs look like. As any transformative technology shift, getting the most out of it will require a deep reorganizing of work - both individual jobs as well as organizations. Another literary illuminative example includes the ""rise of"" artificial light (the light bulb), a similar general purpose technology enabling wide spread innovation in business practices. While using elementary economics can get you far, the authors do not shy away from going further, looking at practical challenges (what do I need to employ AI to solve my problems), highlighting the need for data, common pitfalls with interpreting data (think of Wald's analysis in WWII of returning aircraft hit by anti-aircraft fire, and the associated bias), etc.The book is written for a wide audience, but is structured as a typical business book. Each chapter is brief enough, and is summarized in the end in a few succinct bullet points. Think of it as an introduction to the business implications of the economics of AI. This is similar to Carl Shapiro's and Hal Varian's classic on the business implications of the economics of Web 1.0 ""Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy."" Another book in the same fashion that comes to mind is Brynjolfson and McAfee's ""Machine, Platform, Crowd: Harnessing Our Digital Future."" While Brynjofson and McAfee touches on some of the same topics as ""Prediction machines,"" the latter is more focused and thus goes deeper into the topic of AI. And similar to the two previously mentioned books, this uses the economist's standard toolkit - no need to invent fancy new theories to understand the basics of this new phenomena. There may be a new economy, but that does not necessarily require new economics."
146,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81309751-louis-zaltzman,4,Great book to understand the basics on ML combined with an optimistic perspective of the future of AI and humanity.
147,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55071150-arti,4,"The book looks at AI from the viewpoint of economics and interestingly reframes AI as cheap prediction. It sets the context to show that prediction is now becoming a commodity - and there has been a gradual shift from data and insights to predictions - if you sift through the AI hype, most of the products today sit in this space. Prediction is central to decision making - and it means that organisations can make better decisions, and faster. But the bigger opportunity is where improved quality of predictions can motivate organisations to change their strategy - a simple example is a shift from shop-and-ship to ship-and-shop model - which can transform organisations like Amazon if their predictions are accurate and dependable!The authors argue that the economic shift will centre around a drop in the cost of prediction (and an associated increase in the value of judgement) - which will in turn lower the cost of activities that were historically prediction oriented (like inventory managements, demand forecasting), as well as open up opportunities to use prediction as an input for things for which we never previously did (like translation or navigation which now has moved out of the rule based programming framework to a machine learning based prediction framework that predicts human response to changing environmental data). It's a different perspective and got me to think – the technology geek in me was of-course shocked at the over-simplification. And while I accept that the current state of AI is nowhere close to the myth of super intelligent machines, but limiting the view to predictions and keeping judgement or actions ( out of the purview seems like an incomplete and a short sighted view. It is like saying that we will replace bits and pieces of our existing processes by newer technology. Its an oversimplification of AI and risks losing the bigger picture - the opportunity to reimagine processes - not just with digital intelligence - but also self-learning and self-organising workflows.A stimulating read… it opens up the mind to the prevailing (common) view and an insight into its immediate practical applications and introduces a non-tech user to business considerations such as AI-first strategy (maximising prediction accuracy even at the cost of maximising revenue, user numbers or experience), impact of AI on data, labour, capital, tradeoff between data, prediction accuracy and value, division of labour between humans and machines, managing AI risks - quality, security, liability and in some cases the possibility of changing the strategy itself.But for me, the book have me an opportunity (after being provoked by the authors limited view) to develop a holistic perspective and look beyond prediction - to determine the gaps and next steps to taking AI to the next level of true potential. And i see a significant opportunity in integrating AI into the next step of decision process - judgement (relative payoffs of possible outcomes) and automated actions!Note: The book has evolved from a series of articles on HBR e.g. The Simple Economics of Machine Intelligence and honestly the articles are sufficient to get a good understanding of the theory and the arguments put forth by the authors. Its a much easier option to familiarise with the concepts and I don't think that you would miss a lot from not having read the book."

151,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91959310-gavin-blasczyk,5,"Title: Prediction MachinesAuthors: Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans, Avi GoldfarbPublish Year: 2018An economists viewpoint on what will occur as our ability to better predict outcomes increases. What will change and what will become more or less valuable?Part 1: Prediction-	Prediction has become cheap, which means more people will utilize it.o	Arithmetic and computing used to be expensive. As it became cheaper, people began experimenting and using arithmetic to solve problems that weren’t typically arithmetic based. Now we use algorithms to produce an immense amount of solutions for an array of problems.o	As prediction machines become cheap, it’s complimentary goods become more expensive. Data, sensors, etc. will be in higher demand and price of those items will increase. While value of substitute goods and services diminish (human prediction)-	Predictive analytics requires data to improve and is very accurate when trained with lots of data. Humans on the other hand are better at recognition and prediction with little data than machines are with little data. I can recognize someone’s face after meeting them once. A machine would have a tough time with that.o	Due in part to this discrepancy ^ humans and machines can find synergies to improve the prediction of the machine and the human when working together. Humans can often offer valuable information the machine does not have when faced with unusual or out of the ordinary circumstances. This collaboration is called “prediction by exception”.-	Machine learning science and statistics had different goals.o	Statistics – wants to be correct on averageo	Machine learning – operational effectiveness. Have biases so long as they were gave better predictions. Can accommodate more interaction between variables.Part 2: Decision Making-	While prediction is a key component of any decision, it is not the only component. The other elements of a decision – Judgment, data, and action – remain in the real of humans. They are complements to prediction. They increase in value as prediction becomes cheap (as noted in chapter 1). The value for human prediction decreases, but the demand for human judgment increases.o	An example referenced many times in the book is that of radiologists. A Radiologists main job is to look at an image an determine what the diagnosis is of the individual, then communicate a treatment plan to a doctor. The imaging portion of this job can be done by machines as we teach them to identify the condition in the picture. This will aid radiologists in determining their judgment and action as to what the correct course of action is for the individual.	If there were only a few solutions, judgement would be easy to code into the prediction machine. However, in this case and many others, the decisions could be many and the judgement on which course of action is correct is often more efficient coming from a human counterpart. This is especially true in rare instances where lets say 97% of the time the image would lead to a certain treatment plan, but perhaps the radiologist is able to determine that due to some other factor this is a rare instance where the treatment plan is out of the ordinary. •	Machines are bad at determine correct judgment for rare scenarios. Without a mass of past experience and data, they will fail to come up with the correct answer. Humans on the other hand can use analogies to other examples to come up with worthwhile information for making a judgement call.o	Another example was of Taxi cab drivers. Their advantage to other drivers was their ability to predict the fastest route from point A to point B. Once Google Maps and other GPS software become easily accessible to the masses, the cab drivers no longer had an advantage. The cab drivers did not get worse, everyone else just got a lot better at predicting the best route.-	3 types of datao	Input	The collection of data o	Trainingo	Feedback-	Airport Lounge example. Airport lounges only exist because we cannot accurately predict when we must leave to get to our flight on time. We satisfice by getting to the airport early to ensure we don’t miss our flight. If we could predict perfectly when we would need to arrive to get on our flight, lounges would not exist. They exist as a buffer to improve our experience with poor prediction abilities.-	Tasks most likely to be fully automated first are the ones for which full automation delivers the highest returns. These include tasks where…o	The other elements are already automated except for prediction (mining)o	The returns to speed of action in response to prediction are high (driverless cars)o	The returns to reduced waiting time for predictions are high (Space Exploration)Part 3: Tools-	Tasks need to be broken down and decomposed to determine where the best ROI for prediction and automation would occur. In a large organization, the tasks that will be completed first are the ones with the greatest ROI.-	MBA screening example. A process could become quite good at determine which candidates would make the best MBA students for your program by watching the videos sent in by the candidates and predicting their success. The problem is that you need to teach the machine very specifically what to look for. What constitutes the “best” candidate? Your outcomes and factors must be well defined to train a prediction machine.-	My favorite example of the machine learning incorrectly was of a machine that was trained to play chess. It learned by watching chess champions play and mimicked their decision making. However, in the games it watched, it learned that in many of the matches where the champion one, he sacrificed his queen to win. The machine computed this as “if I sacrifice my queen, I have a better chance of winning” so it would sacrifice its queen early in the game. The algorithm had to be adjusted to only sacrifice the queen in certain scenarios where it would prove beneficial.-	Implementation of AI tools generates four implications for jobs:o	AI tools may augment jobs, helping people do their job bettero	AI tools may contract jobs. Ex: automated fulfillment centerso	AI tools may lead to the reconstitution of jobs with some tasks added and other taken away, as with radiologistso	AI tools may shift the emphasis on the specific skills required for a particular job, as with school bus drivers. They may be needed more to protect and nurture the children than to drive a vehicle.Part 4: Strategy-	AI can lead to strategic change if three factors are presento	There is a core trade off in the business model. Example was about amazon having such good data that they would change from having people shop and then shipping their products, to one where they would ship the item to the individual before they shopped for it, and if they wanted to return it their would be an infrastructure in place that made that incredibly simple.o	The tradeoff is influenced by uncertainty. We don’t know if the higher sales from the ship first method would result in higher costs from the returned items because we are uncertain how many of the items they will keep. We don’t have enough prediction power to be sure.o	An AI tool that reduces uncertainty tips the scales of the trade off so that the optimal strategy changes from one side of the trade to the other. If you did have the prediction power to be sure what people would buy, you would know if it was more cost effective to ship before shopping.-	Shifting to an AI first strategy means downgrading the previous top priority. It’s not a buzz word. It means you are placing greater value on the goal of maximizing prediction accuracy than you are on other tradeoffs like revenue or user growth.-	Risks of AIo	Predictions can lead to discrimination	Example of google searches suggesting an individual may be arrested because their name was more black-sounding name. The ads would show up if they had a higher quality score (people clicked on them more when the name was that of a black person) so the ads ran more often when you searched a black sounding name.	If you encounter your machine is acting discriminatingly, you need to adjust your algorithm. Doing so can be tough. You need to audit machine and figure out what is causing the behavior.	AI relies on correlation, not causation. You need to be able to see what happens when your variable is both present and not present to determine if it was a causal effect.o	AI is ineffective when data is sparse	Ai is bad at predicting rare eventso	Homgeneity of prediction machines can lead to risk of total system failure	If one crop appears to outgrow the others, a farmer might decide to plant only that crop. But if that crop encounters something that destroys it, the entire yield is destroyed. Similarly, say we all used the same prediction machine for a driverless car. Individually this might give us the best experience, but if someone or something were to attack that machine successfully, it would lead to a catastrophic total system failure. To work against this, we should diversify. We should also consider not tethering live updates to the cloud. o	Feedback can be manipulated so that prediction machines learn destructive behaviorPart 5 : Society-	The rise of AI presents trade offs for societyo	Productivity vs distribution (both examples show how wealth inequality can arise)	Economists agree that technological advance makes us better off and enhances productivity, which AI will do. How the created wealth is distributed will be the issue. If AI takes over certain jobs, humans will compete for the others, driving down wages for those jobs, reducing the fraction of income earned by the laborer compared to that earned by the owners of the capital (the machines doing the work). i.e. The owners of the machines will get a bigger cut of the revenues. 	The AI tools may help highly skilled workers more than lower skilled workers. This is how most computer systems work today. Higher skilled, higher educated workers can use technology more effectively and get a better return from the technology than lower skilled workers.o	Innovation vs competition (monopolization due to exponential increase in prediction capability)	As companies innovate their prediction machines to be more accurate, leading to an increase in users, leading to more data, which loops back into more accurate predictions, they may scale to become a monopoly as competitors cannot scale as quickly. Good for the short term, maybe not good in the long run for society.o	Performance vs privacy	Europe has more restrictive laws around data privacy, and as such will most likely not a be an innovation hub for AI. The US, and China especially, are looser on those laws and will undoubtedly have better performing AI, but at the cost of personal data."
152,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72997602-peter-mccluskey,4,"Three economists decided to write about AI. They got excited about AI, and that distracted them enough that they only said a modest amount about the standard economics principles that laymen need to better understand. As a result, the book ended up mostly being simple descriptions of topics on which the authors had limited expertise. I noticed fewer amateurish mistakes than I expected from this strategy, and they mostly end up doing a good job of describing AI in ways that are mildly helpful to laymen who only want a very high-level view.The book's main goal is to advise business on how to adopt current types of AI (""reading this book is almost surely an excellent predictor of being a manager who will use prediction machines""), with a secondary focus on how jobs will be affected by AI.The authors correctly conclude that a modest extrapolation of current trends implies at most some short-term increases in unemployment.One example they use to help us visualize this is the effects of spreadsheets on bookkeepers. Spreadsheets automated the most time consuming parts of bookkeeping, so fewer bookkeepers were needed to do what bookkeepers did before spreadsheets. But by making bookkeepers more powerful, spreadsheets led to bookkeepers calculating many more results than before.The book mentions horses, but then mostly dismisses, without any clear reason, the risk that humans will become as unemployable as horses did. I guess the authors are mainly imagining the kind of incremental increases in AI abilities that are likely in the next 5 or 10 years. But if we extrapolate to when AI exceeds human-level cognitive abilities, then it seems appropriate to worry about human wages becoming inadequate to feed humans, like what happened to horses a century ago.1.The book's advice to business is fairly appropriate, but often borders on common sense.The authors emphasize the distinction between prediction and judgment. Since they are complements, better prediction means that judgment become more valuable.Prediction machines don't provide judgment. Only humans do.For the near-term changes on which the book mostly focuses, I expect this model to work rather well.But many decades from now, what part of judgment will be hard to automate? Judgment generally requires more general-purpose models of human desires than most current AI hopes to achieve. But large increases in data and computing power seem likely to eventually enable automating most judgment, via something like having an AI predict what a human would say if the human analyzed the situation carefully.2.I'll now mention some complaints I have, about areas where the authors seem to be outside their areas of competence. These aren't particularly important aspects of the book, but I found them about as interesting as the book's main points.The discussion of trucking jobs seems a bit strange. They imagine that humans will need to ride with robotrucks to prevent theft. Would an unmanned truck convoy be at greater risk than are current trucks? I can't quite see how. They'll need good cameras for driving, and it seems like those would also serve as effective means to identify thieves. The robotruck industry may well employ plenty of humans for tasks such as loading and unloading, but I predict humans will rarely accompany robotrucks on long trips.The authors ask what should happen when a robocar hands control to the human driver in an emergency, after pointing out related problems that associated with Air France Flight 447. My answer is that a robocar shouldn't require that a human take control. I don't see much reason to expect humans to do better than software in sudden emergencies. Yet the authors indicate that humans in robocars need to know how to drive, without appearing to consider the advantages of relying on software in emergencies. Trains have been run without drivers present, and the book mentions a mine where trucks operate without drivers. Doing that with cars on typical roads is much harder, but the benefits are also much larger, and I predict I'll feel safer as a pedestrian 15 years from now if cars handle emergencies via software.They can't avoid mentioning the Trolley problem:Someone will have to resolve the dilemma and program the appropriate response into the car. The problem cannot be avoided.There are likely to be political and legal reasons why it can't be avoided, but the authors hint that there are ethical reasons. I don't see those reasons. I'd be happy to use a robocar that handled trolley problems roughly the way that humans do, i.e. treat any situation that kills a person as if it's as close to infinitely bad as our minds can understand [1].They note that having lots of data is somewhat important to making good predictions, which lead them to wonder: will China rule the world due to having more data? I see little strength to the idea that having more people means outperforming due to having more data. The parts of the world with European languages likely have more variety of data than China does, and variety of data is at least as important as quantity.The more interesting hypothesis is that EU-style privacy controls might retard the regions that adopt them. But they mention (elsewhere) evidence from comparing Google to Yahoo/Microsoft which shows that such restrictions have had little effect.The authors dismiss Bostrom's Superintelligence in a way that indicates they don't quite understand what Bostrom is claiming.3.I predict that a modest number of readers will benefit from this book, and a larger number will react favorably to it, while quickly forgetting what it says.Footnote[1] - I also endorse Brad Templeton's explanations of why robocar people should pay less attention to this issue, and implement whatever answer puts robocars on roads soon:It turns out the problem has a simple answer which is highly likely to be the one taken. In almost every situation of this sort, the law already specifies who has the right of way, and who doesn't. The vehicles will be programmed to follow the law, which means that when presented with a choice of hitting something in their right-of-way and hitting something else outside the right-of-way, the car will obey the law and stay in its right-of-way.Given a few reasonable assumptions, from a strict standpoint of counting deaths and injuries, almost any delay to the deployment of high-safety robocars costs lots of lives. And not a minor number. Delay it by a year, and anywhere from 10,000-20,000 extra people will die in the USA, a 300,000 to a million around the world. Delay it by a day and you condemn 30-80 unknown future Americans and 1,000 others to death, and many thousands more to horrible injury.Trolley problems provide potentially valuable insights into how different ethical systems handle situations that are very different from what humans have experienced, but robocar designers should focus on situations that resemble what humans have experienced."
153,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105904707-aaron-kalafarski,3,"This book served more to reinforce concepts around AI than it did to open up new ways of thinking about it. Basically, most AI are prediction machines and the cost of prediction has dramatically decreased. While AI can learn to predict situations it lacks the judgement that humans posses. Therefore, when paired with humans can compliment and enhance their work. As the use of AI improves the effectiveness and efficiency of processes, industries, etc. it will change how we think about work. It will make certain work obsolete and create opportunities elsewhere by analyzing and adjusting to customer feedback.The biggest issue outside of the book to me is as lower-level jobs get automated away those individuals out of a job will either need to be retrained to adapt to AI or find new jobs. This is going to increase workplace stratification and the disparity from those who are technologically adept versus those who are more inept. Is will more than likely impact generations and those of different levels of intelligence the most dramatically. Therefore, I believe we should be spending time focusing on anticipating those problems as well as the benefits AI will bring us. "
154,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107729408-kevin-krom,5,"Key Learns:1. AI is an economic problem (we've had artificial neural nets since the 1950's). The cost of running prediction machines is now obtainable for companies of various sizes2. I liked how the authors split up the various components (prediction, decision making, tools strategy, society).Criticism: Obviously, this is my own issue I have with any book on AI and the corresponding societal impacts but I think most books downplays the impact that prediction machines. It's hard to see books like this say something to the effect of, ""we don't see terminator murder robots running around town so things are pretty good!""... seems wildly myopic.

155,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111501905-bilal,4,"The key lessons in this book are: One, the unpacking of decision making into two primary components: prediction and judgement, that is, decisions are meant to choose the best path forward (i.e., judge) when certain dependencies are unknown, and where one assigns certain likelihoods to the unknowns turning out one way or another. The authors argue that AI is best suited to provide the predictions (assign likelihoods to outcomes) and leave the judgement to human beings. They present several examples to make sense of this point. Two, the break down workflows into sub-components, jobs, where some of these jobs may be given to AI. They present several examples of how this is already done in the industry. I found the book informative on these two topics but stating the obvious on other topics."

Reading this book I had a real lightbulb moment when there was a discussion of separating judgement from prediction of outcomes in decision making. When AI wasn't making the judgement and was just a tool in the decision making process I saw clearly how it could be used in many instances. There's a lot more to the book including how it might affect employment, different strategies that business might use, the value of data for learning (and how the value of historical data drops once the learning is done).This book does not discuss AI at a technical level. I found it quite accessible as someone with an interest in technology."

175,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51896417-frans-sax-n,3,"Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of AI is a primer on using economics to illuminate the consequences of the rise of AI. This is not a book that will scare you using dramatic, persuasive storytelling. Rather, it is a book using some pretty simple economics concepts (think Econ 101) to illuminate the consequences of the rise of AI, by interpreting AI as prediction machines, and their ""rise"" as a fall in the cost of making predictions. When the cost of making predictions fall, more predictions will be made - when the market price declines, more is demanded. And when the price of predictions decline, not only does the demand of predictions increase, but so does the demand of complements. One complement is judgement - when more predictions can be made, more judgements are called for - What is the implication of the AI predicting a 2 point rise in the probability of accidents? The authors use elementary, well established economics to illustrate a number of implications of AI, in the process demonstrating the power of analyzing complex topics thru a simple, but coherent framework. The theoretical analysis is augmented by illustrative case studies. The comparison between AI and the spreadsheet is illuminating. When the first computer spreadsheet was launched, there were fewer accountants employed than today. The ""rise of the spreadsheet"" led to demand for more accountants, and more scenario analysis, as these activities became cheaper. The authors argue that the same will be the case for AI. While the number of management accountants employed increased, their jobs were transformed. The same will happen with AI, as it reconfigures jobs. The authors do not see AI replacing all human work as the most likely scenario - but that does not mean that it would not affect what jobs look like. As any transformative technology shift, getting the most out of it will require a deep reorganizing of work - both individual jobs as well as organizations. Another literary illuminative example includes the ""rise of"" artificial light (the light bulb), a similar general purpose technology enabling wide spread innovation in business practices. While using elementary economics can get you far, the authors do not shy away from going further, looking at practical challenges (what do I need to employ AI to solve my problems), highlighting the need for data, common pitfalls with interpreting data (think of Wald's analysis in WWII of returning aircraft hit by anti-aircraft fire, and the associated bias), etc.The book is written for a wide audience, but is structured as a typical business book. Each chapter is brief enough, and is summarized in the end in a few succinct bullet points. Think of it as an introduction to the business implications of the economics of AI. This is similar to Carl Shapiro's and Hal Varian's classic on the business implications of the economics of Web 1.0 ""Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy."" Another book in the same fashion that comes to mind is Brynjolfson and McAfee's ""Machine, Platform, Crowd: Harnessing Our Digital Future."" While Brynjofson and McAfee touches on some of the same topics as ""Prediction machines,"" the latter is more focused and thus goes deeper into the topic of AI. And similar to the two previously mentioned books, this uses the economist's standard toolkit - no need to invent fancy new theories to understand the basics of this new phenomena. There may be a new economy, but that does not necessarily require new economics."
176,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81309751-louis-zaltzman,4,Great book to understand the basics on ML combined with an optimistic perspective of the future of AI and humanity.
177,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55071150-arti,4,"The book looks at AI from the viewpoint of economics and interestingly reframes AI as cheap prediction. It sets the context to show that prediction is now becoming a commodity - and there has been a gradual shift from data and insights to predictions - if you sift through the AI hype, most of the products today sit in this space. Prediction is central to decision making - and it means that organisations can make better decisions, and faster. But the bigger opportunity is where improved quality of predictions can motivate organisations to change their strategy - a simple example is a shift from shop-and-ship to ship-and-shop model - which can transform organisations like Amazon if their predictions are accurate and dependable!The authors argue that the economic shift will centre around a drop in the cost of prediction (and an associated increase in the value of judgement) - which will in turn lower the cost of activities that were historically prediction oriented (like inventory managements, demand forecasting), as well as open up opportunities to use prediction as an input for things for which we never previously did (like translation or navigation which now has moved out of the rule based programming framework to a machine learning based prediction framework that predicts human response to changing environmental data). It's a different perspective and got me to think – the technology geek in me was of-course shocked at the over-simplification. And while I accept that the current state of AI is nowhere close to the myth of super intelligent machines, but limiting the view to predictions and keeping judgement or actions ( out of the purview seems like an incomplete and a short sighted view. It is like saying that we will replace bits and pieces of our existing processes by newer technology. Its an oversimplification of AI and risks losing the bigger picture - the opportunity to reimagine processes - not just with digital intelligence - but also self-learning and self-organising workflows.A stimulating read… it opens up the mind to the prevailing (common) view and an insight into its immediate practical applications and introduces a non-tech user to business considerations such as AI-first strategy (maximising prediction accuracy even at the cost of maximising revenue, user numbers or experience), impact of AI on data, labour, capital, tradeoff between data, prediction accuracy and value, division of labour between humans and machines, managing AI risks - quality, security, liability and in some cases the possibility of changing the strategy itself.But for me, the book have me an opportunity (after being provoked by the authors limited view) to develop a holistic perspective and look beyond prediction - to determine the gaps and next steps to taking AI to the next level of true potential. And i see a significant opportunity in integrating AI into the next step of decision process - judgement (relative payoffs of possible outcomes) and automated actions!Note: The book has evolved from a series of articles on HBR e.g. The Simple Economics of Machine Intelligence and honestly the articles are sufficient to get a good understanding of the theory and the arguments put forth by the authors. Its a much easier option to familiarise with the concepts and I don't think that you would miss a lot from not having read the book."

181,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91959310-gavin-blasczyk,5,"Title: Prediction MachinesAuthors: Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans, Avi GoldfarbPublish Year: 2018An economists viewpoint on what will occur as our ability to better predict outcomes increases. What will change and what will become more or less valuable?Part 1: Prediction-	Prediction has become cheap, which means more people will utilize it.o	Arithmetic and computing used to be expensive. As it became cheaper, people began experimenting and using arithmetic to solve problems that weren’t typically arithmetic based. Now we use algorithms to produce an immense amount of solutions for an array of problems.o	As prediction machines become cheap, it’s complimentary goods become more expensive. Data, sensors, etc. will be in higher demand and price of those items will increase. While value of substitute goods and services diminish (human prediction)-	Predictive analytics requires data to improve and is very accurate when trained with lots of data. Humans on the other hand are better at recognition and prediction with little data than machines are with little data. I can recognize someone’s face after meeting them once. A machine would have a tough time with that.o	Due in part to this discrepancy ^ humans and machines can find synergies to improve the prediction of the machine and the human when working together. Humans can often offer valuable information the machine does not have when faced with unusual or out of the ordinary circumstances. This collaboration is called “prediction by exception”.-	Machine learning science and statistics had different goals.o	Statistics – wants to be correct on averageo	Machine learning – operational effectiveness. Have biases so long as they were gave better predictions. Can accommodate more interaction between variables.Part 2: Decision Making-	While prediction is a key component of any decision, it is not the only component. The other elements of a decision – Judgment, data, and action – remain in the real of humans. They are complements to prediction. They increase in value as prediction becomes cheap (as noted in chapter 1). The value for human prediction decreases, but the demand for human judgment increases.o	An example referenced many times in the book is that of radiologists. A Radiologists main job is to look at an image an determine what the diagnosis is of the individual, then communicate a treatment plan to a doctor. The imaging portion of this job can be done by machines as we teach them to identify the condition in the picture. This will aid radiologists in determining their judgment and action as to what the correct course of action is for the individual.	If there were only a few solutions, judgement would be easy to code into the prediction machine. However, in this case and many others, the decisions could be many and the judgement on which course of action is correct is often more efficient coming from a human counterpart. This is especially true in rare instances where lets say 97% of the time the image would lead to a certain treatment plan, but perhaps the radiologist is able to determine that due to some other factor this is a rare instance where the treatment plan is out of the ordinary. •	Machines are bad at determine correct judgment for rare scenarios. Without a mass of past experience and data, they will fail to come up with the correct answer. Humans on the other hand can use analogies to other examples to come up with worthwhile information for making a judgement call.o	Another example was of Taxi cab drivers. Their advantage to other drivers was their ability to predict the fastest route from point A to point B. Once Google Maps and other GPS software become easily accessible to the masses, the cab drivers no longer had an advantage. The cab drivers did not get worse, everyone else just got a lot better at predicting the best route.-	3 types of datao	Input	The collection of data o	Trainingo	Feedback-	Airport Lounge example. Airport lounges only exist because we cannot accurately predict when we must leave to get to our flight on time. We satisfice by getting to the airport early to ensure we don’t miss our flight. If we could predict perfectly when we would need to arrive to get on our flight, lounges would not exist. They exist as a buffer to improve our experience with poor prediction abilities.-	Tasks most likely to be fully automated first are the ones for which full automation delivers the highest returns. These include tasks where…o	The other elements are already automated except for prediction (mining)o	The returns to speed of action in response to prediction are high (driverless cars)o	The returns to reduced waiting time for predictions are high (Space Exploration)Part 3: Tools-	Tasks need to be broken down and decomposed to determine where the best ROI for prediction and automation would occur. In a large organization, the tasks that will be completed first are the ones with the greatest ROI.-	MBA screening example. A process could become quite good at determine which candidates would make the best MBA students for your program by watching the videos sent in by the candidates and predicting their success. The problem is that you need to teach the machine very specifically what to look for. What constitutes the “best” candidate? Your outcomes and factors must be well defined to train a prediction machine.-	My favorite example of the machine learning incorrectly was of a machine that was trained to play chess. It learned by watching chess champions play and mimicked their decision making. However, in the games it watched, it learned that in many of the matches where the champion one, he sacrificed his queen to win. The machine computed this as “if I sacrifice my queen, I have a better chance of winning” so it would sacrifice its queen early in the game. The algorithm had to be adjusted to only sacrifice the queen in certain scenarios where it would prove beneficial.-	Implementation of AI tools generates four implications for jobs:o	AI tools may augment jobs, helping people do their job bettero	AI tools may contract jobs. Ex: automated fulfillment centerso	AI tools may lead to the reconstitution of jobs with some tasks added and other taken away, as with radiologistso	AI tools may shift the emphasis on the specific skills required for a particular job, as with school bus drivers. They may be needed more to protect and nurture the children than to drive a vehicle.Part 4: Strategy-	AI can lead to strategic change if three factors are presento	There is a core trade off in the business model. Example was about amazon having such good data that they would change from having people shop and then shipping their products, to one where they would ship the item to the individual before they shopped for it, and if they wanted to return it their would be an infrastructure in place that made that incredibly simple.o	The tradeoff is influenced by uncertainty. We don’t know if the higher sales from the ship first method would result in higher costs from the returned items because we are uncertain how many of the items they will keep. We don’t have enough prediction power to be sure.o	An AI tool that reduces uncertainty tips the scales of the trade off so that the optimal strategy changes from one side of the trade to the other. If you did have the prediction power to be sure what people would buy, you would know if it was more cost effective to ship before shopping.-	Shifting to an AI first strategy means downgrading the previous top priority. It’s not a buzz word. It means you are placing greater value on the goal of maximizing prediction accuracy than you are on other tradeoffs like revenue or user growth.-	Risks of AIo	Predictions can lead to discrimination	Example of google searches suggesting an individual may be arrested because their name was more black-sounding name. The ads would show up if they had a higher quality score (people clicked on them more when the name was that of a black person) so the ads ran more often when you searched a black sounding name.	If you encounter your machine is acting discriminatingly, you need to adjust your algorithm. Doing so can be tough. You need to audit machine and figure out what is causing the behavior.	AI relies on correlation, not causation. You need to be able to see what happens when your variable is both present and not present to determine if it was a causal effect.o	AI is ineffective when data is sparse	Ai is bad at predicting rare eventso	Homgeneity of prediction machines can lead to risk of total system failure	If one crop appears to outgrow the others, a farmer might decide to plant only that crop. But if that crop encounters something that destroys it, the entire yield is destroyed. Similarly, say we all used the same prediction machine for a driverless car. Individually this might give us the best experience, but if someone or something were to attack that machine successfully, it would lead to a catastrophic total system failure. To work against this, we should diversify. We should also consider not tethering live updates to the cloud. o	Feedback can be manipulated so that prediction machines learn destructive behaviorPart 5 : Society-	The rise of AI presents trade offs for societyo	Productivity vs distribution (both examples show how wealth inequality can arise)	Economists agree that technological advance makes us better off and enhances productivity, which AI will do. How the created wealth is distributed will be the issue. If AI takes over certain jobs, humans will compete for the others, driving down wages for those jobs, reducing the fraction of income earned by the laborer compared to that earned by the owners of the capital (the machines doing the work). i.e. The owners of the machines will get a bigger cut of the revenues. 	The AI tools may help highly skilled workers more than lower skilled workers. This is how most computer systems work today. Higher skilled, higher educated workers can use technology more effectively and get a better return from the technology than lower skilled workers.o	Innovation vs competition (monopolization due to exponential increase in prediction capability)	As companies innovate their prediction machines to be more accurate, leading to an increase in users, leading to more data, which loops back into more accurate predictions, they may scale to become a monopoly as competitors cannot scale as quickly. Good for the short term, maybe not good in the long run for society.o	Performance vs privacy	Europe has more restrictive laws around data privacy, and as such will most likely not a be an innovation hub for AI. The US, and China especially, are looser on those laws and will undoubtedly have better performing AI, but at the cost of personal data."
182,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72997602-peter-mccluskey,4,"Three economists decided to write about AI. They got excited about AI, and that distracted them enough that they only said a modest amount about the standard economics principles that laymen need to better understand. As a result, the book ended up mostly being simple descriptions of topics on which the authors had limited expertise. I noticed fewer amateurish mistakes than I expected from this strategy, and they mostly end up doing a good job of describing AI in ways that are mildly helpful to laymen who only want a very high-level view.The book's main goal is to advise business on how to adopt current types of AI (""reading this book is almost surely an excellent predictor of being a manager who will use prediction machines""), with a secondary focus on how jobs will be affected by AI.The authors correctly conclude that a modest extrapolation of current trends implies at most some short-term increases in unemployment.One example they use to help us visualize this is the effects of spreadsheets on bookkeepers. Spreadsheets automated the most time consuming parts of bookkeeping, so fewer bookkeepers were needed to do what bookkeepers did before spreadsheets. But by making bookkeepers more powerful, spreadsheets led to bookkeepers calculating many more results than before.The book mentions horses, but then mostly dismisses, without any clear reason, the risk that humans will become as unemployable as horses did. I guess the authors are mainly imagining the kind of incremental increases in AI abilities that are likely in the next 5 or 10 years. But if we extrapolate to when AI exceeds human-level cognitive abilities, then it seems appropriate to worry about human wages becoming inadequate to feed humans, like what happened to horses a century ago.1.The book's advice to business is fairly appropriate, but often borders on common sense.The authors emphasize the distinction between prediction and judgment. Since they are complements, better prediction means that judgment become more valuable.Prediction machines don't provide judgment. Only humans do.For the near-term changes on which the book mostly focuses, I expect this model to work rather well.But many decades from now, what part of judgment will be hard to automate? Judgment generally requires more general-purpose models of human desires than most current AI hopes to achieve. But large increases in data and computing power seem likely to eventually enable automating most judgment, via something like having an AI predict what a human would say if the human analyzed the situation carefully.2.I'll now mention some complaints I have, about areas where the authors seem to be outside their areas of competence. These aren't particularly important aspects of the book, but I found them about as interesting as the book's main points.The discussion of trucking jobs seems a bit strange. They imagine that humans will need to ride with robotrucks to prevent theft. Would an unmanned truck convoy be at greater risk than are current trucks? I can't quite see how. They'll need good cameras for driving, and it seems like those would also serve as effective means to identify thieves. The robotruck industry may well employ plenty of humans for tasks such as loading and unloading, but I predict humans will rarely accompany robotrucks on long trips.The authors ask what should happen when a robocar hands control to the human driver in an emergency, after pointing out related problems that associated with Air France Flight 447. My answer is that a robocar shouldn't require that a human take control. I don't see much reason to expect humans to do better than software in sudden emergencies. Yet the authors indicate that humans in robocars need to know how to drive, without appearing to consider the advantages of relying on software in emergencies. Trains have been run without drivers present, and the book mentions a mine where trucks operate without drivers. Doing that with cars on typical roads is much harder, but the benefits are also much larger, and I predict I'll feel safer as a pedestrian 15 years from now if cars handle emergencies via software.They can't avoid mentioning the Trolley problem:Someone will have to resolve the dilemma and program the appropriate response into the car. The problem cannot be avoided.There are likely to be political and legal reasons why it can't be avoided, but the authors hint that there are ethical reasons. I don't see those reasons. I'd be happy to use a robocar that handled trolley problems roughly the way that humans do, i.e. treat any situation that kills a person as if it's as close to infinitely bad as our minds can understand [1].They note that having lots of data is somewhat important to making good predictions, which lead them to wonder: will China rule the world due to having more data? I see little strength to the idea that having more people means outperforming due to having more data. The parts of the world with European languages likely have more variety of data than China does, and variety of data is at least as important as quantity.The more interesting hypothesis is that EU-style privacy controls might retard the regions that adopt them. But they mention (elsewhere) evidence from comparing Google to Yahoo/Microsoft which shows that such restrictions have had little effect.The authors dismiss Bostrom's Superintelligence in a way that indicates they don't quite understand what Bostrom is claiming.3.I predict that a modest number of readers will benefit from this book, and a larger number will react favorably to it, while quickly forgetting what it says.Footnote[1] - I also endorse Brad Templeton's explanations of why robocar people should pay less attention to this issue, and implement whatever answer puts robocars on roads soon:It turns out the problem has a simple answer which is highly likely to be the one taken. In almost every situation of this sort, the law already specifies who has the right of way, and who doesn't. The vehicles will be programmed to follow the law, which means that when presented with a choice of hitting something in their right-of-way and hitting something else outside the right-of-way, the car will obey the law and stay in its right-of-way.Given a few reasonable assumptions, from a strict standpoint of counting deaths and injuries, almost any delay to the deployment of high-safety robocars costs lots of lives. And not a minor number. Delay it by a year, and anywhere from 10,000-20,000 extra people will die in the USA, a 300,000 to a million around the world. Delay it by a day and you condemn 30-80 unknown future Americans and 1,000 others to death, and many thousands more to horrible injury.Trolley problems provide potentially valuable insights into how different ethical systems handle situations that are very different from what humans have experienced, but robocar designers should focus on situations that resemble what humans have experienced."

Basically, most AI are prediction machines and the cost of prediction has dramatically decreased. While AI can learn to predict situations it lacks the judgement that humans posses. Therefore, when paired with humans can compliment and enhance their work. As the use of AI improves the effectiveness and efficiency of processes, industries, etc. it will change how we think about work. It will make certain work obsolete and create opportunities elsewhere by analyzing and adjusting to customer feedback.The biggest issue outside of the book to me is as lower-level jobs get automated away those individuals out of a job will either need to be retrained to adapt to AI or find new jobs. This is going to increase workplace stratification and the disparity from those who are technologically adept versus those who are more inept. Is will more than likely impact generations and those of different levels of intelligence the most dramatically. Therefore, I believe we should be spending time focusing on anticipating those problems as well as the benefits AI will bring us. "

The cost of running prediction machines is now obtainable for companies of various sizes2. I liked how the authors split up the various components (prediction, decision making, tools strategy, society).Criticism: Obviously, this is my own issue I have with any book on AI and the corresponding societal impacts but I think most books downplays the impact that prediction machines. It's hard to see books like this say something to the effect of, ""we don't see terminator murder robots running around town so things are pretty good!""... seems wildly myopic. Look at the impact of social media, credit scoring models, advertising campaigns for predatory loan companies, or for-profit colleges... are people getting murdered? no. Are people losing their rights, freedoms, and chance to build a better life for themselves? yes. "
185,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111501905-bilal,4,"The key lessons in this book are: One, the unpacking of decision making into two primary components: prediction and judgement, that is, decisions are meant to choose the best path forward (i.e., judge) when certain dependencies are unknown, and where one assigns certain likelihoods to the unknowns turning out one way or another. The authors argue that AI is best suited to provide the predictions (assign likelihoods to outcomes) and leave the judgement to human beings. They present several examples to make sense of this point. Two, the break down workflows into sub-components, jobs, where some of these jobs may be given to AI. They present several examples of how this is already done in the industry. I found the book informative on these two topics but stating the obvious on other topics."

Reading this book I had a real lightbulb moment when there was a discussion of separating judgement from prediction of outcomes in decision making. When AI wasn't making the judgement and was just a tool in the decision making process I saw clearly how it could be used in many instances. There's a lot more to the book including how it might affect employment, different strategies that business might use, the value of data for learning (and how the value of historical data drops once the learning is done).This book does not discuss AI at a technical level. I found it quite accessible as someone with an interest in technology."

205,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51896417-frans-sax-n,3,"Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of AI is a primer on using economics to illuminate the consequences of the rise of AI. This is not a book that will scare you using dramatic, persuasive storytelling. Rather, it is a book using some pretty simple economics concepts (think Econ 101) to illuminate the consequences of the rise of AI, by interpreting AI as prediction machines, and their ""rise"" as a fall in the cost of making predictions. When the cost of making predictions fall, more predictions will be made - when the market price declines, more is demanded. And when the price of predictions decline, not only does the demand of predictions increase, but so does the demand of complements. One complement is judgement - when more predictions can be made, more judgements are called for - What is the implication of the AI predicting a 2 point rise in the probability of accidents? The authors use elementary, well established economics to illustrate a number of implications of AI, in the process demonstrating the power of analyzing complex topics thru a simple, but coherent framework. The theoretical analysis is augmented by illustrative case studies. The comparison between AI and the spreadsheet is illuminating. When the first computer spreadsheet was launched, there were fewer accountants employed than today. The ""rise of the spreadsheet"" led to demand for more accountants, and more scenario analysis, as these activities became cheaper. The authors argue that the same will be the case for AI. While the number of management accountants employed increased, their jobs were transformed. The same will happen with AI, as it reconfigures jobs. The authors do not see AI replacing all human work as the most likely scenario - but that does not mean that it would not affect what jobs look like. As any transformative technology shift, getting the most out of it will require a deep reorganizing of work - both individual jobs as well as organizations. Another literary illuminative example includes the ""rise of"" artificial light (the light bulb), a similar general purpose technology enabling wide spread innovation in business practices. While using elementary economics can get you far, the authors do not shy away from going further, looking at practical challenges (what do I need to employ AI to solve my problems), highlighting the need for data, common pitfalls with interpreting data (think of Wald's analysis in WWII of returning aircraft hit by anti-aircraft fire, and the associated bias), etc.The book is written for a wide audience, but is structured as a typical business book. Each chapter is brief enough, and is summarized in the end in a few succinct bullet points. Think of it as an introduction to the business implications of the economics of AI. This is similar to Carl Shapiro's and Hal Varian's classic on the business implications of the economics of Web 1.0 ""Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy."" Another book in the same fashion that comes to mind is Brynjolfson and McAfee's ""Machine, Platform, Crowd: Harnessing Our Digital Future."" While Brynjofson and McAfee touches on some of the same topics as ""Prediction machines,"" the latter is more focused and thus goes deeper into the topic of AI. And similar to the two previously mentioned books, this uses the economist's standard toolkit - no need to invent fancy new theories to understand the basics of this new phenomena. There may be a new economy, but that does not necessarily require new economics."
206,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81309751-louis-zaltzman,4,Great book to understand the basics on ML combined with an optimistic perspective of the future of AI and humanity.
207,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55071150-arti,4,"The book looks at AI from the viewpoint of economics and interestingly reframes AI as cheap prediction. It sets the context to show that prediction is now becoming a commodity - and there has been a gradual shift from data and insights to predictions - if you sift through the AI hype, most of the products today sit in this space. Prediction is central to decision making - and it means that organisations can make better decisions, and faster. But the bigger opportunity is where improved quality of predictions can motivate organisations to change their strategy - a simple example is a shift from shop-and-ship to ship-and-shop model - which can transform organisations like Amazon if their predictions are accurate and dependable!The authors argue that the economic shift will centre around a drop in the cost of prediction (and an associated increase in the value of judgement) - which will in turn lower the cost of activities that were historically prediction oriented (like inventory managements, demand forecasting), as well as open up opportunities to use prediction as an input for things for which we never previously did (like translation or navigation which now has moved out of the rule based programming framework to a machine learning based prediction framework that predicts human response to changing environmental data). It's a different perspective and got me to think – the technology geek in me was of-course shocked at the over-simplification. And while I accept that the current state of AI is nowhere close to the myth of super intelligent machines, but limiting the view to predictions and keeping judgement or actions ( out of the purview seems like an incomplete and a short sighted view. It is like saying that we will replace bits and pieces of our existing processes by newer technology. Its an oversimplification of AI and risks losing the bigger picture - the opportunity to reimagine processes - not just with digital intelligence - but also self-learning and self-organising workflows.A stimulating read… it opens up the mind to the prevailing (common) view and an insight into its immediate practical applications and introduces a non-tech user to business considerations such as AI-first strategy (maximising prediction accuracy even at the cost of maximising revenue, user numbers or experience), impact of AI on data, labour, capital, tradeoff between data, prediction accuracy and value, division of labour between humans and machines, managing AI risks - quality, security, liability and in some cases the possibility of changing the strategy itself.But for me, the book have me an opportunity (after being provoked by the authors limited view) to develop a holistic perspective and look beyond prediction - to determine the gaps and next steps to taking AI to the next level of true potential. And i see a significant opportunity in integrating AI into the next step of decision process - judgement (relative payoffs of possible outcomes) and automated actions!Note: The book has evolved from a series of articles on HBR e.g. The Simple Economics of Machine Intelligence and honestly the articles are sufficient to get a good understanding of the theory and the arguments put forth by the authors. Its a much easier option to familiarise with the concepts and I don't think that you would miss a lot from not having read the book."

211,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91959310-gavin-blasczyk,5,"Title: Prediction MachinesAuthors: Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans, Avi GoldfarbPublish Year: 2018An economists viewpoint on what will occur as our ability to better predict outcomes increases. What will change and what will become more or less valuable?Part 1: Prediction-	Prediction has become cheap, which means more people will utilize it.o	Arithmetic and computing used to be expensive. As it became cheaper, people began experimenting and using arithmetic to solve problems that weren’t typically arithmetic based. Now we use algorithms to produce an immense amount of solutions for an array of problems.o	As prediction machines become cheap, it’s complimentary goods become more expensive. Data, sensors, etc. will be in higher demand and price of those items will increase. While value of substitute goods and services diminish (human prediction)-	Predictive analytics requires data to improve and is very accurate when trained with lots of data. Humans on the other hand are better at recognition and prediction with little data than machines are with little data. I can recognize someone’s face after meeting them once. A machine would have a tough time with that.o	Due in part to this discrepancy ^ humans and machines can find synergies to improve the prediction of the machine and the human when working together. Humans can often offer valuable information the machine does not have when faced with unusual or out of the ordinary circumstances. This collaboration is called “prediction by exception”.-	Machine learning science and statistics had different goals.o	Statistics – wants to be correct on averageo	Machine learning – operational effectiveness. Have biases so long as they were gave better predictions. Can accommodate more interaction between variables.Part 2: Decision Making-	While prediction is a key component of any decision, it is not the only component. The other elements of a decision – Judgment, data, and action – remain in the real of humans. They are complements to prediction. They increase in value as prediction becomes cheap (as noted in chapter 1). The value for human prediction decreases, but the demand for human judgment increases.o	An example referenced many times in the book is that of radiologists. A Radiologists main job is to look at an image an determine what the diagnosis is of the individual, then communicate a treatment plan to a doctor. The imaging portion of this job can be done by machines as we teach them to identify the condition in the picture. This will aid radiologists in determining their judgment and action as to what the correct course of action is for the individual.	If there were only a few solutions, judgement would be easy to code into the prediction machine. However, in this case and many others, the decisions could be many and the judgement on which course of action is correct is often more efficient coming from a human counterpart. This is especially true in rare instances where lets say 97% of the time the image would lead to a certain treatment plan, but perhaps the radiologist is able to determine that due to some other factor this is a rare instance where the treatment plan is out of the ordinary. •	Machines are bad at determine correct judgment for rare scenarios. Without a mass of past experience and data, they will fail to come up with the correct answer. Humans on the other hand can use analogies to other examples to come up with worthwhile information for making a judgement call.o	Another example was of Taxi cab drivers. Their advantage to other drivers was their ability to predict the fastest route from point A to point B. Once Google Maps and other GPS software become easily accessible to the masses, the cab drivers no longer had an advantage. The cab drivers did not get worse, everyone else just got a lot better at predicting the best route.-	3 types of datao	Input	The collection of data o	Trainingo	Feedback-	Airport Lounge example. Airport lounges only exist because we cannot accurately predict when we must leave to get to our flight on time. We satisfice by getting to the airport early to ensure we don’t miss our flight. If we could predict perfectly when we would need to arrive to get on our flight, lounges would not exist. They exist as a buffer to improve our experience with poor prediction abilities.-	Tasks most likely to be fully automated first are the ones for which full automation delivers the highest returns. These include tasks where…o	The other elements are already automated except for prediction (mining)o	The returns to speed of action in response to prediction are high (driverless cars)o	The returns to reduced waiting time for predictions are high (Space Exploration)Part 3: Tools-	Tasks need to be broken down and decomposed to determine where the best ROI for prediction and automation would occur. In a large organization, the tasks that will be completed first are the ones with the greatest ROI.-	MBA screening example. A process could become quite good at determine which candidates would make the best MBA students for your program by watching the videos sent in by the candidates and predicting their success. The problem is that you need to teach the machine very specifically what to look for. What constitutes the “best” candidate? Your outcomes and factors must be well defined to train a prediction machine.-	My favorite example of the machine learning incorrectly was of a machine that was trained to play chess. It learned by watching chess champions play and mimicked their decision making. However, in the games it watched, it learned that in many of the matches where the champion one, he sacrificed his queen to win. The machine computed this as “if I sacrifice my queen, I have a better chance of winning” so it would sacrifice its queen early in the game. The algorithm had to be adjusted to only sacrifice the queen in certain scenarios where it would prove beneficial.-	Implementation of AI tools generates four implications for jobs:o	AI tools may augment jobs, helping people do their job bettero	AI tools may contract jobs. Ex: automated fulfillment centerso	AI tools may lead to the reconstitution of jobs with some tasks added and other taken away, as with radiologistso	AI tools may shift the emphasis on the specific skills required for a particular job, as with school bus drivers. They may be needed more to protect and nurture the children than to drive a vehicle.Part 4: Strategy-	AI can lead to strategic change if three factors are presento	There is a core trade off in the business model. Example was about amazon having such good data that they would change from having people shop and then shipping their products, to one where they would ship the item to the individual before they shopped for it, and if they wanted to return it their would be an infrastructure in place that made that incredibly simple.o	The tradeoff is influenced by uncertainty. We don’t know if the higher sales from the ship first method would result in higher costs from the returned items because we are uncertain how many of the items they will keep. We don’t have enough prediction power to be sure.o	An AI tool that reduces uncertainty tips the scales of the trade off so that the optimal strategy changes from one side of the trade to the other. If you did have the prediction power to be sure what people would buy, you would know if it was more cost effective to ship before shopping.-	Shifting to an AI first strategy means downgrading the previous top priority. It’s not a buzz word. It means you are placing greater value on the goal of maximizing prediction accuracy than you are on other tradeoffs like revenue or user growth.-	Risks of AIo	Predictions can lead to discrimination	Example of google searches suggesting an individual may be arrested because their name was more black-sounding name. The ads would show up if they had a higher quality score (people clicked on them more when the name was that of a black person) so the ads ran more often when you searched a black sounding name.	If you encounter your machine is acting discriminatingly, you need to adjust your algorithm. Doing so can be tough. You need to audit machine and figure out what is causing the behavior.	AI relies on correlation, not causation. You need to be able to see what happens when your variable is both present and not present to determine if it was a causal effect.o	AI is ineffective when data is sparse	Ai is bad at predicting rare eventso	Homgeneity of prediction machines can lead to risk of total system failure	If one crop appears to outgrow the others, a farmer might decide to plant only that crop. But if that crop encounters something that destroys it, the entire yield is destroyed. Similarly, say we all used the same prediction machine for a driverless car. Individually this might give us the best experience, but if someone or something were to attack that machine successfully, it would lead to a catastrophic total system failure. To work against this, we should diversify. We should also consider not tethering live updates to the cloud. o	Feedback can be manipulated so that prediction machines learn destructive behaviorPart 5 : Society-	The rise of AI presents trade offs for societyo	Productivity vs distribution (both examples show how wealth inequality can arise)	Economists agree that technological advance makes us better off and enhances productivity, which AI will do. How the created wealth is distributed will be the issue. If AI takes over certain jobs, humans will compete for the others, driving down wages for those jobs, reducing the fraction of income earned by the laborer compared to that earned by the owners of the capital (the machines doing the work). i.e. The owners of the machines will get a bigger cut of the revenues. 	The AI tools may help highly skilled workers more than lower skilled workers. This is how most computer systems work today. Higher skilled, higher educated workers can use technology more effectively and get a better return from the technology than lower skilled workers.o	Innovation vs competition (monopolization due to exponential increase in prediction capability)	As companies innovate their prediction machines to be more accurate, leading to an increase in users, leading to more data, which loops back into more accurate predictions, they may scale to become a monopoly as competitors cannot scale as quickly. Good for the short term, maybe not good in the long run for society.o	Performance vs privacy	Europe has more restrictive laws around data privacy, and as such will most likely not a be an innovation hub for AI. The US, and China especially, are looser on those laws and will undoubtedly have better performing AI, but at the cost of personal data."
212,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72997602-peter-mccluskey,4,"Three economists decided to write about AI. They got excited about AI, and that distracted them enough that they only said a modest amount about the standard economics principles that laymen need to better understand. As a result, the book ended up mostly being simple descriptions of topics on which the authors had limited expertise. I noticed fewer amateurish mistakes than I expected from this strategy, and they mostly end up doing a good job of describing AI in ways that are mildly helpful to laymen who only want a very high-level view.The book's main goal is to advise business on how to adopt current types of AI (""reading this book is almost surely an excellent predictor of being a manager who will use prediction machines""), with a secondary focus on how jobs will be affected by AI.The authors correctly conclude that a modest extrapolation of current trends implies at most some short-term increases in unemployment.One example they use to help us visualize this is the effects of spreadsheets on bookkeepers. Spreadsheets automated the most time consuming parts of bookkeeping, so fewer bookkeepers were needed to do what bookkeepers did before spreadsheets. But by making bookkeepers more powerful, spreadsheets led to bookkeepers calculating many more results than before.The book mentions horses, but then mostly dismisses, without any clear reason, the risk that humans will become as unemployable as horses did. I guess the authors are mainly imagining the kind of incremental increases in AI abilities that are likely in the next 5 or 10 years. But if we extrapolate to when AI exceeds human-level cognitive abilities, then it seems appropriate to worry about human wages becoming inadequate to feed humans, like what happened to horses a century ago.1.The book's advice to business is fairly appropriate, but often borders on common sense.The authors emphasize the distinction between prediction and judgment. Since they are complements, better prediction means that judgment become more valuable.Prediction machines don't provide judgment. Only humans do.For the near-term changes on which the book mostly focuses, I expect this model to work rather well.But many decades from now, what part of judgment will be hard to automate? Judgment generally requires more general-purpose models of human desires than most current AI hopes to achieve. But large increases in data and computing power seem likely to eventually enable automating most judgment, via something like having an AI predict what a human would say if the human analyzed the situation carefully.2.I'll now mention some complaints I have, about areas where the authors seem to be outside their areas of competence. These aren't particularly important aspects of the book, but I found them about as interesting as the book's main points.The discussion of trucking jobs seems a bit strange. They imagine that humans will need to ride with robotrucks to prevent theft. Would an unmanned truck convoy be at greater risk than are current trucks? I can't quite see how. They'll need good cameras for driving, and it seems like those would also serve as effective means to identify thieves. The robotruck industry may well employ plenty of humans for tasks such as loading and unloading, but I predict humans will rarely accompany robotrucks on long trips.The authors ask what should happen when a robocar hands control to the human driver in an emergency, after pointing out related problems that associated with Air France Flight 447. My answer is that a robocar shouldn't require that a human take control. I don't see much reason to expect humans to do better than software in sudden emergencies. Yet the authors indicate that humans in robocars need to know how to drive, without appearing to consider the advantages of relying on software in emergencies. Trains have been run without drivers present, and the book mentions a mine where trucks operate without drivers. Doing that with cars on typical roads is much harder, but the benefits are also much larger, and I predict I'll feel safer as a pedestrian 15 years from now if cars handle emergencies via software.They can't avoid mentioning the Trolley problem:Someone will have to resolve the dilemma and program the appropriate response into the car. The problem cannot be avoided.There are likely to be political and legal reasons why it can't be avoided, but the authors hint that there are ethical reasons. I don't see those reasons. I'd be happy to use a robocar that handled trolley problems roughly the way that humans do, i.e. treat any situation that kills a person as if it's as close to infinitely bad as our minds can understand [1].They note that having lots of data is somewhat important to making good predictions, which lead them to wonder: will China rule the world due to having more data? I see little strength to the idea that having more people means outperforming due to having more data. The parts of the world with European languages likely have more variety of data than China does, and variety of data is at least as important as quantity.The more interesting hypothesis is that EU-style privacy controls might retard the regions that adopt them. But they mention (elsewhere) evidence from comparing Google to Yahoo/Microsoft which shows that such restrictions have had little effect.The authors dismiss Bostrom's Superintelligence in a way that indicates they don't quite understand what Bostrom is claiming.3.I predict that a modest number of readers will benefit from this book, and a larger number will react favorably to it, while quickly forgetting what it says.Footnote[1] - I also endorse Brad Templeton's explanations of why robocar people should pay less attention to this issue, and implement whatever answer puts robocars on roads soon:It turns out the problem has a simple answer which is highly likely to be the one taken. In almost every situation of this sort, the law already specifies who has the right of way, and who doesn't. The vehicles will be programmed to follow the law, which means that when presented with a choice of hitting something in their right-of-way and hitting something else outside the right-of-way, the car will obey the law and stay in its right-of-way.Given a few reasonable assumptions, from a strict standpoint of counting deaths and injuries, almost any delay to the deployment of high-safety robocars costs lots of lives. And not a minor number. Delay it by a year, and anywhere from 10,000-20,000 extra people will die in the USA, a 300,000 to a million around the world. Delay it by a day and you condemn 30-80 unknown future Americans and 1,000 others to death, and many thousands more to horrible injury.Trolley problems provide potentially valuable insights into how different ethical systems handle situations that are very different from what humans have experienced, but robocar designers should focus on situations that resemble what humans have experienced."
213,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105904707-aaron-kalafarski,3,"This book served more to reinforce concepts around AI than it did to open up new ways of thinking about it. Basically, most AI are prediction machines and the cost of prediction has dramatically decreased. While AI can learn to predict situations it lacks the judgement that humans posses. Therefore, when paired with humans can compliment and enhance their work. As the use of AI improves the effectiveness and efficiency of processes, industries, etc. it will change how we think about work. It will make certain work obsolete and create opportunities elsewhere by analyzing and adjusting to customer feedback.The biggest issue outside of the book to me is as lower-level jobs get automated away those individuals out of a job will either need to be retrained to adapt to AI or find new jobs. This is going to increase workplace stratification and the disparity from those who are technologically adept versus those who are more inept. Is will more than likely impact generations and those of different levels of intelligence the most dramatically. Therefore, I believe we should be spending time focusing on anticipating those problems as well as the benefits AI will bring us. "

The cost of running prediction machines is now obtainable for companies of various sizes2. I liked how the authors split up the various components (prediction, decision making, tools strategy, society).Criticism: Obviously, this is my own issue I have with any book on AI and the corresponding societal impacts but I think most books downplays the impact that prediction machines. It's hard to see books like this say something to the effect of, ""we don't see terminator murder robots running around town so things are pretty good!""... seems wildly myopic. Look at the impact of social media, credit scoring models, advertising campaigns for predatory loan companies, or for-profit colleges... are people getting murdered? no. Are people losing their rights, freedoms, and chance to build a better life for themselves? yes. "
215,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111501905-bilal,4,"The key lessons in this book are: One, the unpacking of decision making into two primary components: prediction and judgement, that is, decisions are meant to choose the best path forward (i.e., judge) when certain dependencies are unknown, and where one assigns certain likelihoods to the unknowns turning out one way or another. The authors argue that AI is best suited to provide the predictions (assign likelihoods to outcomes) and leave the judgement to human beings. They present several examples to make sense of this point. Two, the break down workflows into sub-components, jobs, where some of these jobs may be given to AI. They present several examples of how this is already done in the industry. I found the book informative on these two topics but stating the obvious on other topics."

Reading this book I had a real lightbulb moment when there was a discussion of separating judgement from prediction of outcomes in decision making. When AI wasn't making the judgement and was just a tool in the decision making process I saw clearly how it could be used in many instances. There's a lot more to the book including how it might affect employment, different strategies that business might use, the value of data for learning (and how the value of historical data drops once the learning is done).This book does not discuss AI at a technical level. I found it quite accessible as someone with an interest in technology."

235,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51896417-frans-sax-n,3,"Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of AI is a primer on using economics to illuminate the consequences of the rise of AI. This is not a book that will scare you using dramatic, persuasive storytelling. Rather, it is a book using some pretty simple economics concepts (think Econ 101) to illuminate the consequences of the rise of AI, by interpreting AI as prediction machines, and their ""rise"" as a fall in the cost of making predictions. When the cost of making predictions fall, more predictions will be made - when the market price declines, more is demanded. And when the price of predictions decline, not only does the demand of predictions increase, but so does the demand of complements. One complement is judgement - when more predictions can be made, more judgements are called for - What is the implication of the AI predicting a 2 point rise in the probability of accidents? The authors use elementary, well established economics to illustrate a number of implications of AI, in the process demonstrating the power of analyzing complex topics thru a simple, but coherent framework. The theoretical analysis is augmented by illustrative case studies. The comparison between AI and the spreadsheet is illuminating. When the first computer spreadsheet was launched, there were fewer accountants employed than today. The ""rise of the spreadsheet"" led to demand for more accountants, and more scenario analysis, as these activities became cheaper. The authors argue that the same will be the case for AI. While the number of management accountants employed increased, their jobs were transformed. The same will happen with AI, as it reconfigures jobs. The authors do not see AI replacing all human work as the most likely scenario - but that does not mean that it would not affect what jobs look like. As any transformative technology shift, getting the most out of it will require a deep reorganizing of work - both individual jobs as well as organizations. Another literary illuminative example includes the ""rise of"" artificial light (the light bulb), a similar general purpose technology enabling wide spread innovation in business practices. While using elementary economics can get you far, the authors do not shy away from going further, looking at practical challenges (what do I need to employ AI to solve my problems), highlighting the need for data, common pitfalls with interpreting data (think of Wald's analysis in WWII of returning aircraft hit by anti-aircraft fire, and the associated bias), etc.The book is written for a wide audience, but is structured as a typical business book. Each chapter is brief enough, and is summarized in the end in a few succinct bullet points. Think of it as an introduction to the business implications of the economics of AI. This is similar to Carl Shapiro's and Hal Varian's classic on the business implications of the economics of Web 1.0 ""Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy."" Another book in the same fashion that comes to mind is Brynjolfson and McAfee's ""Machine, Platform, Crowd: Harnessing Our Digital Future."" While Brynjofson and McAfee touches on some of the same topics as ""Prediction machines,"" the latter is more focused and thus goes deeper into the topic of AI. And similar to the two previously mentioned books, this uses the economist's standard toolkit - no need to invent fancy new theories to understand the basics of this new phenomena. There may be a new economy, but that does not necessarily require new economics."

237,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55071150-arti,4,"The book looks at AI from the viewpoint of economics and interestingly reframes AI as cheap prediction. It sets the context to show that prediction is now becoming a commodity - and there has been a gradual shift from data and insights to predictions - if you sift through the AI hype, most of the products today sit in this space. Prediction is central to decision making - and it means that organisations can make better decisions, and faster. But the bigger opportunity is where improved quality of predictions can motivate organisations to change their strategy - a simple example is a shift from shop-and-ship to ship-and-shop model - which can transform organisations like Amazon if their predictions are accurate and dependable!The authors argue that the economic shift will centre around a drop in the cost of prediction (and an associated increase in the value of judgement) - which will in turn lower the cost of activities that were historically prediction oriented (like inventory managements, demand forecasting), as well as open up opportunities to use prediction as an input for things for which we never previously did (like translation or navigation which now has moved out of the rule based programming framework to a machine learning based prediction framework that predicts human response to changing environmental data). It's a different perspective and got me to think – the technology geek in me was of-course shocked at the over-simplification. And while I accept that the current state of AI is nowhere close to the myth of super intelligent machines, but limiting the view to predictions and keeping judgement or actions ( out of the purview seems like an incomplete and a short sighted view. It is like saying that we will replace bits and pieces of our existing processes by newer technology. Its an oversimplification of AI and risks losing the bigger picture - the opportunity to reimagine processes - not just with digital intelligence - but also self-learning and self-organising workflows.A stimulating read… it opens up the mind to the prevailing (common) view and an insight into its immediate practical applications and introduces a non-tech user to business considerations such as AI-first strategy (maximising prediction accuracy even at the cost of maximising revenue, user numbers or experience), impact of AI on data, labour, capital, tradeoff between data, prediction accuracy and value, division of labour between humans and machines, managing AI risks - quality, security, liability and in some cases the possibility of changing the strategy itself.But for me, the book have me an opportunity (after being provoked by the authors limited view) to develop a holistic perspective and look beyond prediction - to determine the gaps and next steps to taking AI to the next level of true potential. And i see a significant opportunity in integrating AI into the next step of decision process - judgement (relative payoffs of possible outcomes) and automated actions!Note: The book has evolved from a series of articles on HBR e.g. The Simple Economics of Machine Intelligence and honestly the articles are sufficient to get a good understanding of the theory and the arguments put forth by the authors. Its a much easier option to familiarise with the concepts and I don't think that you would miss a lot from not having read the book."

241,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91959310-gavin-blasczyk,5,"Title: Prediction MachinesAuthors: Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans, Avi GoldfarbPublish Year: 2018An economists viewpoint on what will occur as our ability to better predict outcomes increases. What will change and what will become more or less valuable?Part 1: Prediction-	Prediction has become cheap, which means more people will utilize it.o	Arithmetic and computing used to be expensive. As it became cheaper, people began experimenting and using arithmetic to solve problems that weren’t typically arithmetic based. Now we use algorithms to produce an immense amount of solutions for an array of problems.o	As prediction machines become cheap, it’s complimentary goods become more expensive. Data, sensors, etc. will be in higher demand and price of those items will increase. While value of substitute goods and services diminish (human prediction)-	Predictive analytics requires data to improve and is very accurate when trained with lots of data. Humans on the other hand are better at recognition and prediction with little data than machines are with little data. I can recognize someone’s face after meeting them once. A machine would have a tough time with that.o	Due in part to this discrepancy ^ humans and machines can find synergies to improve the prediction of the machine and the human when working together. Humans can often offer valuable information the machine does not have when faced with unusual or out of the ordinary circumstances. This collaboration is called “prediction by exception”.-	Machine learning science and statistics had different goals.o	Statistics – wants to be correct on averageo	Machine learning – operational effectiveness. Have biases so long as they were gave better predictions. Can accommodate more interaction between variables.Part 2: Decision Making-	While prediction is a key component of any decision, it is not the only component. The other elements of a decision – Judgment, data, and action – remain in the real of humans. They are complements to prediction. They increase in value as prediction becomes cheap (as noted in chapter 1). The value for human prediction decreases, but the demand for human judgment increases.o	An example referenced many times in the book is that of radiologists. A Radiologists main job is to look at an image an determine what the diagnosis is of the individual, then communicate a treatment plan to a doctor. The imaging portion of this job can be done by machines as we teach them to identify the condition in the picture. This will aid radiologists in determining their judgment and action as to what the correct course of action is for the individual.	If there were only a few solutions, judgement would be easy to code into the prediction machine. However, in this case and many others, the decisions could be many and the judgement on which course of action is correct is often more efficient coming from a human counterpart. This is especially true in rare instances where lets say 97% of the time the image would lead to a certain treatment plan, but perhaps the radiologist is able to determine that due to some other factor this is a rare instance where the treatment plan is out of the ordinary. •	Machines are bad at determine correct judgment for rare scenarios. Without a mass of past experience and data, they will fail to come up with the correct answer. Humans on the other hand can use analogies to other examples to come up with worthwhile information for making a judgement call.o	Another example was of Taxi cab drivers. Their advantage to other drivers was their ability to predict the fastest route from point A to point B. Once Google Maps and other GPS software become easily accessible to the masses, the cab drivers no longer had an advantage. The cab drivers did not get worse, everyone else just got a lot better at predicting the best route.-	3 types of datao	Input	The collection of data o	Trainingo	Feedback-	Airport Lounge example. Airport lounges only exist because we cannot accurately predict when we must leave to get to our flight on time. We satisfice by getting to the airport early to ensure we don’t miss our flight. If we could predict perfectly when we would need to arrive to get on our flight, lounges would not exist. They exist as a buffer to improve our experience with poor prediction abilities.-	Tasks most likely to be fully automated first are the ones for which full automation delivers the highest returns. These include tasks where…o	The other elements are already automated except for prediction (mining)o	The returns to speed of action in response to prediction are high (driverless cars)o	The returns to reduced waiting time for predictions are high (Space Exploration)Part 3: Tools-	Tasks need to be broken down and decomposed to determine where the best ROI for prediction and automation would occur. In a large organization, the tasks that will be completed first are the ones with the greatest ROI.-	MBA screening example. A process could become quite good at determine which candidates would make the best MBA students for your program by watching the videos sent in by the candidates and predicting their success. The problem is that you need to teach the machine very specifically what to look for. What constitutes the “best” candidate? Your outcomes and factors must be well defined to train a prediction machine.-	My favorite example of the machine learning incorrectly was of a machine that was trained to play chess. It learned by watching chess champions play and mimicked their decision making. However, in the games it watched, it learned that in many of the matches where the champion one, he sacrificed his queen to win. The machine computed this as “if I sacrifice my queen, I have a better chance of winning” so it would sacrifice its queen early in the game. The algorithm had to be adjusted to only sacrifice the queen in certain scenarios where it would prove beneficial.-	Implementation of AI tools generates four implications for jobs:o	AI tools may augment jobs, helping people do their job bettero	AI tools may contract jobs. Ex: automated fulfillment centerso	AI tools may lead to the reconstitution of jobs with some tasks added and other taken away, as with radiologistso	AI tools may shift the emphasis on the specific skills required for a particular job, as with school bus drivers. They may be needed more to protect and nurture the children than to drive a vehicle.Part 4: Strategy-	AI can lead to strategic change if three factors are presento	There is a core trade off in the business model. Example was about amazon having such good data that they would change from having people shop and then shipping their products, to one where they would ship the item to the individual before they shopped for it, and if they wanted to return it their would be an infrastructure in place that made that incredibly simple.o	The tradeoff is influenced by uncertainty. We don’t know if the higher sales from the ship first method would result in higher costs from the returned items because we are uncertain how many of the items they will keep. We don’t have enough prediction power to be sure.o	An AI tool that reduces uncertainty tips the scales of the trade off so that the optimal strategy changes from one side of the trade to the other. If you did have the prediction power to be sure what people would buy, you would know if it was more cost effective to ship before shopping.-	Shifting to an AI first strategy means downgrading the previous top priority. It’s not a buzz word. It means you are placing greater value on the goal of maximizing prediction accuracy than you are on other tradeoffs like revenue or user growth.-	Risks of AIo	Predictions can lead to discrimination	Example of google searches suggesting an individual may be arrested because their name was more black-sounding name. The ads would show up if they had a higher quality score (people clicked on them more when the name was that of a black person) so the ads ran more often when you searched a black sounding name.	If you encounter your machine is acting discriminatingly, you need to adjust your algorithm. Doing so can be tough. You need to audit machine and figure out what is causing the behavior.	AI relies on correlation, not causation. You need to be able to see what happens when your variable is both present and not present to determine if it was a causal effect.o	AI is ineffective when data is sparse	Ai is bad at predicting rare eventso	Homgeneity of prediction machines can lead to risk of total system failure	If one crop appears to outgrow the others, a farmer might decide to plant only that crop. But if that crop encounters something that destroys it, the entire yield is destroyed. Similarly, say we all used the same prediction machine for a driverless car. Individually this might give us the best experience, but if someone or something were to attack that machine successfully, it would lead to a catastrophic total system failure. To work against this, we should diversify. We should also consider not tethering live updates to the cloud. o	Feedback can be manipulated so that prediction machines learn destructive behaviorPart 5 : Society-	The rise of AI presents trade offs for societyo	Productivity vs distribution (both examples show how wealth inequality can arise)	Economists agree that technological advance makes us better off and enhances productivity, which AI will do. How the created wealth is distributed will be the issue. If AI takes over certain jobs, humans will compete for the others, driving down wages for those jobs, reducing the fraction of income earned by the laborer compared to that earned by the owners of the capital (the machines doing the work). i.e. The owners of the machines will get a bigger cut of the revenues. 	The AI tools may help highly skilled workers more than lower skilled workers. This is how most computer systems work today. Higher skilled, higher educated workers can use technology more effectively and get a better return from the technology than lower skilled workers.o	Innovation vs competition (monopolization due to exponential increase in prediction capability)	As companies innovate their prediction machines to be more accurate, leading to an increase in users, leading to more data, which loops back into more accurate predictions, they may scale to become a monopoly as competitors cannot scale as quickly. Good for the short term, maybe not good in the long run for society.o	Performance vs privacy	Europe has more restrictive laws around data privacy, and as such will most likely not a be an innovation hub for AI. The US, and China especially, are looser on those laws and will undoubtedly have better performing AI, but at the cost of personal data."
242,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72997602-peter-mccluskey,4,"Three economists decided to write about AI. They got excited about AI, and that distracted them enough that they only said a modest amount about the standard economics principles that laymen need to better understand. As a result, the book ended up mostly being simple descriptions of topics on which the authors had limited expertise. I noticed fewer amateurish mistakes than I expected from this strategy, and they mostly end up doing a good job of describing AI in ways that are mildly helpful to laymen who only want a very high-level view.The book's main goal is to advise business on how to adopt current types of AI (""reading this book is almost surely an excellent predictor of being a manager who will use prediction machines""), with a secondary focus on how jobs will be affected by AI.The authors correctly conclude that a modest extrapolation of current trends implies at most some short-term increases in unemployment.One example they use to help us visualize this is the effects of spreadsheets on bookkeepers. Spreadsheets automated the most time consuming parts of bookkeeping, so fewer bookkeepers were needed to do what bookkeepers did before spreadsheets. But by making bookkeepers more powerful, spreadsheets led to bookkeepers calculating many more results than before.The book mentions horses, but then mostly dismisses, without any clear reason, the risk that humans will become as unemployable as horses did. I guess the authors are mainly imagining the kind of incremental increases in AI abilities that are likely in the next 5 or 10 years. But if we extrapolate to when AI exceeds human-level cognitive abilities, then it seems appropriate to worry about human wages becoming inadequate to feed humans, like what happened to horses a century ago.1.The book's advice to business is fairly appropriate, but often borders on common sense.The authors emphasize the distinction between prediction and judgment. Since they are complements, better prediction means that judgment become more valuable.Prediction machines don't provide judgment. Only humans do.For the near-term changes on which the book mostly focuses, I expect this model to work rather well.But many decades from now, what part of judgment will be hard to automate? Judgment generally requires more general-purpose models of human desires than most current AI hopes to achieve. But large increases in data and computing power seem likely to eventually enable automating most judgment, via something like having an AI predict what a human would say if the human analyzed the situation carefully.2.I'll now mention some complaints I have, about areas where the authors seem to be outside their areas of competence. These aren't particularly important aspects of the book, but I found them about as interesting as the book's main points.The discussion of trucking jobs seems a bit strange. They imagine that humans will need to ride with robotrucks to prevent theft. Would an unmanned truck convoy be at greater risk than are current trucks? I can't quite see how. They'll need good cameras for driving, and it seems like those would also serve as effective means to identify thieves. The robotruck industry may well employ plenty of humans for tasks such as loading and unloading, but I predict humans will rarely accompany robotrucks on long trips.The authors ask what should happen when a robocar hands control to the human driver in an emergency, after pointing out related problems that associated with Air France Flight 447. My answer is that a robocar shouldn't require that a human take control. I don't see much reason to expect humans to do better than software in sudden emergencies. Yet the authors indicate that humans in robocars need to know how to drive, without appearing to consider the advantages of relying on software in emergencies. Trains have been run without drivers present, and the book mentions a mine where trucks operate without drivers. Doing that with cars on typical roads is much harder, but the benefits are also much larger, and I predict I'll feel safer as a pedestrian 15 years from now if cars handle emergencies via software.They can't avoid mentioning the Trolley problem:Someone will have to resolve the dilemma and program the appropriate response into the car. The problem cannot be avoided.There are likely to be political and legal reasons why it can't be avoided, but the authors hint that there are ethical reasons. I don't see those reasons. I'd be happy to use a robocar that handled trolley problems roughly the way that humans do, i.e. treat any situation that kills a person as if it's as close to infinitely bad as our minds can understand [1].They note that having lots of data is somewhat important to making good predictions, which lead them to wonder: will China rule the world due to having more data? I see little strength to the idea that having more people means outperforming due to having more data. The parts of the world with European languages likely have more variety of data than China does, and variety of data is at least as important as quantity.The more interesting hypothesis is that EU-style privacy controls might retard the regions that adopt them. But they mention (elsewhere) evidence from comparing Google to Yahoo/Microsoft which shows that such restrictions have had little effect.The authors dismiss Bostrom's Superintelligence in a way that indicates they don't quite understand what Bostrom is claiming.3.I predict that a modest number of readers will benefit from this book, and a larger number will react favorably to it, while quickly forgetting what it says.Footnote[1] - I also endorse Brad Templeton's explanations of why robocar people should pay less attention to this issue, and implement whatever answer puts robocars on roads soon:It turns out the problem has a simple answer which is highly likely to be the one taken. In almost every situation of this sort, the law already specifies who has the right of way, and who doesn't. The vehicles will be programmed to follow the law, which means that when presented with a choice of hitting something in their right-of-way and hitting something else outside the right-of-way, the car will obey the law and stay in its right-of-way.Given a few reasonable assumptions, from a strict standpoint of counting deaths and injuries, almost any delay to the deployment of high-safety robocars costs lots of lives. And not a minor number. Delay it by a year, and anywhere from 10,000-20,000 extra people will die in the USA, a 300,000 to a million around the world. Delay it by a day and you condemn 30-80 unknown future Americans and 1,000 others to death, and many thousands more to horrible injury.Trolley problems provide potentially valuable insights into how different ethical systems handle situations that are very different from what humans have experienced, but robocar designers should focus on situations that resemble what humans have experienced."
243,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105904707-aaron-kalafarski,3,"This book served more to reinforce concepts around AI than it did to open up new ways of thinking about it. Basically, most AI are prediction machines and the cost of prediction has dramatically decreased. While AI can learn to predict situations it lacks the judgement that humans posses. Therefore, when paired with humans can compliment and enhance their work. As the use of AI improves the effectiveness and efficiency of processes, industries, etc. it will change how we think about work. It will make certain work obsolete and create opportunities elsewhere by analyzing and adjusting to customer feedback.The biggest issue outside of the book to me is as lower-level jobs get automated away those individuals out of a job will either need to be retrained to adapt to AI or find new jobs. This is going to increase workplace stratification and the disparity from those who are technologically adept versus those who are more inept. Is will more than likely impact generations and those of different levels of intelligence the most dramatically. Therefore, I believe we should be spending time focusing on anticipating those problems as well as the benefits AI will bring us. "

The cost of running prediction machines is now obtainable for companies of various sizes2. I liked how the authors split up the various components (prediction, decision making, tools strategy, society).Criticism: Obviously, this is my own issue I have with any book on AI and the corresponding societal impacts but I think most books downplays the impact that prediction machines. It's hard to see books like this say something to the effect of, ""we don't see terminator murder robots running around town so things are pretty good!""... seems wildly myopic. Look at the impact of social media, credit scoring models, advertising campaigns for predatory loan companies, or for-profit colleges... are people getting murdered? no. Are people losing their rights, freedoms, and chance to build a better life for themselves? yes. "
245,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111501905-bilal,4,"The key lessons in this book are: One, the unpacking of decision making into two primary components: prediction and judgement, that is, decisions are meant to choose the best path forward (i.e., judge) when certain dependencies are unknown, and where one assigns certain likelihoods to the unknowns turning out one way or another. The authors argue that AI is best suited to provide the predictions (assign likelihoods to outcomes) and leave the judgement to human beings. They present several examples to make sense of this point. Two, the break down workflows into sub-components, jobs, where some of these jobs may be given to AI. They present several examples of how this is already done in the industry. I found the book informative on these two topics but stating the obvious on other topics."

Reading this book I had a real lightbulb moment when there was a discussion of separating judgement from prediction of outcomes in decision making. When AI wasn't making the judgement and was just a tool in the decision making process I saw clearly how it could be used in many instances. There's a lot more to the book including how it might affect employment, different strategies that business might use, the value of data for learning (and how the value of historical data drops once the learning is done).This book does not discuss AI at a technical level. I found it quite accessible as someone with an interest in technology."

265,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51896417-frans-sax-n,3,"Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of AI is a primer on using economics to illuminate the consequences of the rise of AI. This is not a book that will scare you using dramatic, persuasive storytelling. Rather, it is a book using some pretty simple economics concepts (think Econ 101) to illuminate the consequences of the rise of AI, by interpreting AI as prediction machines, and their ""rise"" as a fall in the cost of making predictions. When the cost of making predictions fall, more predictions will be made - when the market price declines, more is demanded. And when the price of predictions decline, not only does the demand of predictions increase, but so does the demand of complements. One complement is judgement - when more predictions can be made, more judgements are called for - What is the implication of the AI predicting a 2 point rise in the probability of accidents? The authors use elementary, well established economics to illustrate a number of implications of AI, in the process demonstrating the power of analyzing complex topics thru a simple, but coherent framework. The theoretical analysis is augmented by illustrative case studies. The comparison between AI and the spreadsheet is illuminating. When the first computer spreadsheet was launched, there were fewer accountants employed than today. The ""rise of the spreadsheet"" led to demand for more accountants, and more scenario analysis, as these activities became cheaper. The authors argue that the same will be the case for AI. While the number of management accountants employed increased, their jobs were transformed. The same will happen with AI, as it reconfigures jobs. The authors do not see AI replacing all human work as the most likely scenario - but that does not mean that it would not affect what jobs look like. As any transformative technology shift, getting the most out of it will require a deep reorganizing of work - both individual jobs as well as organizations. Another literary illuminative example includes the ""rise of"" artificial light (the light bulb), a similar general purpose technology enabling wide spread innovation in business practices. While using elementary economics can get you far, the authors do not shy away from going further, looking at practical challenges (what do I need to employ AI to solve my problems), highlighting the need for data, common pitfalls with interpreting data (think of Wald's analysis in WWII of returning aircraft hit by anti-aircraft fire, and the associated bias), etc.The book is written for a wide audience, but is structured as a typical business book. Each chapter is brief enough, and is summarized in the end in a few succinct bullet points. Think of it as an introduction to the business implications of the economics of AI. This is similar to Carl Shapiro's and Hal Varian's classic on the business implications of the economics of Web 1.0 ""Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy."" Another book in the same fashion that comes to mind is Brynjolfson and McAfee's ""Machine, Platform, Crowd: Harnessing Our Digital Future."" While Brynjofson and McAfee touches on some of the same topics as ""Prediction machines,"" the latter is more focused and thus goes deeper into the topic of AI. And similar to the two previously mentioned books, this uses the economist's standard toolkit - no need to invent fancy new theories to understand the basics of this new phenomena. There may be a new economy, but that does not necessarily require new economics."

267,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55071150-arti,4,"The book looks at AI from the viewpoint of economics and interestingly reframes AI as cheap prediction. It sets the context to show that prediction is now becoming a commodity - and there has been a gradual shift from data and insights to predictions - if you sift through the AI hype, most of the products today sit in this space. Prediction is central to decision making - and it means that organisations can make better decisions, and faster. But the bigger opportunity is where improved quality of predictions can motivate organisations to change their strategy - a simple example is a shift from shop-and-ship to ship-and-shop model - which can transform organisations like Amazon if their predictions are accurate and dependable!The authors argue that the economic shift will centre around a drop in the cost of prediction (and an associated increase in the value of judgement) - which will in turn lower the cost of activities that were historically prediction oriented (like inventory managements, demand forecasting), as well as open up opportunities to use prediction as an input for things for which we never previously did (like translation or navigation which now has moved out of the rule based programming framework to a machine learning based prediction framework that predicts human response to changing environmental data). It's a different perspective and got me to think – the technology geek in me was of-course shocked at the over-simplification. And while I accept that the current state of AI is nowhere close to the myth of super intelligent machines, but limiting the view to predictions and keeping judgement or actions ( out of the purview seems like an incomplete and a short sighted view. It is like saying that we will replace bits and pieces of our existing processes by newer technology. Its an oversimplification of AI and risks losing the bigger picture - the opportunity to reimagine processes - not just with digital intelligence - but also self-learning and self-organising workflows.A stimulating read… it opens up the mind to the prevailing (common) view and an insight into its immediate practical applications and introduces a non-tech user to business considerations such as AI-first strategy (maximising prediction accuracy even at the cost of maximising revenue, user numbers or experience), impact of AI on data, labour, capital, tradeoff between data, prediction accuracy and value, division of labour between humans and machines, managing AI risks - quality, security, liability and in some cases the possibility of changing the strategy itself.But for me, the book have me an opportunity (after being provoked by the authors limited view) to develop a holistic perspective and look beyond prediction - to determine the gaps and next steps to taking AI to the next level of true potential. And i see a significant opportunity in integrating AI into the next step of decision process - judgement (relative payoffs of possible outcomes) and automated actions!Note: The book has evolved from a series of articles on HBR e.g. The Simple Economics of Machine Intelligence and honestly the articles are sufficient to get a good understanding of the theory and the arguments put forth by the authors. Its a much easier option to familiarise with the concepts and I don't think that you would miss a lot from not having read the book."

What will change and what will become more or less valuable?Part 1: Prediction-	Prediction has become cheap, which means more people will utilize it.o	Arithmetic and computing used to be expensive. As it became cheaper, people began experimenting and using arithmetic to solve problems that weren’t typically arithmetic based. Now we use algorithms to produce an immense amount of solutions for an array of problems.o	As prediction machines become cheap, it’s complimentary goods become more expensive. Data, sensors, etc. will be in higher demand and price of those items will increase. While value of substitute goods and services diminish (human prediction)-	Predictive analytics requires data to improve and is very accurate when trained with lots of data. Humans on the other hand are better at recognition and prediction with little data than machines are with little data. I can recognize someone’s face after meeting them once. A machine would have a tough time with that.o	Due in part to this discrepancy ^ humans and machines can find synergies to improve the prediction of the machine and the human when working together. Humans can often offer valuable information the machine does not have when faced with unusual or out of the ordinary circumstances. This collaboration is called “prediction by exception”.-	Machine learning science and statistics had different goals.o	Statistics – wants to be correct on averageo	Machine learning – operational effectiveness. Have biases so long as they were gave better predictions. Can accommodate more interaction between variables.Part 2: Decision Making-	While prediction is a key component of any decision, it is not the only component. The other elements of a decision – Judgment, data, and action – remain in the real of humans. They are complements to prediction. They increase in value as prediction becomes cheap (as noted in chapter 1). The value for human prediction decreases, but the demand for human judgment increases.o	An example referenced many times in the book is that of radiologists. A Radiologists main job is to look at an image an determine what the diagnosis is of the individual, then communicate a treatment plan to a doctor. The imaging portion of this job can be done by machines as we teach them to identify the condition in the picture. This will aid radiologists in determining their judgment and action as to what the correct course of action is for the individual.	If there were only a few solutions, judgement would be easy to code into the prediction machine. However, in this case and many others, the decisions could be many and the judgement on which course of action is correct is often more efficient coming from a human counterpart. This is especially true in rare instances where lets say 97% of the time the image would lead to a certain treatment plan, but perhaps the radiologist is able to determine that due to some other factor this is a rare instance where the treatment plan is out of the ordinary. •	Machines are bad at determine correct judgment for rare scenarios. Without a mass of past experience and data, they will fail to come up with the correct answer. Humans on the other hand can use analogies to other examples to come up with worthwhile information for making a judgement call.o	Another example was of Taxi cab drivers. Their advantage to other drivers was their ability to predict the fastest route from point A to point B. Once Google Maps and other GPS software become easily accessible to the masses, the cab drivers no longer had an advantage. The cab drivers did not get worse, everyone else just got a lot better at predicting the best route.-	3 types of datao	Input	The collection of data o	Trainingo	Feedback-	Airport Lounge example. Airport lounges only exist because we cannot accurately predict when we must leave to get to our flight on time. We satisfice by getting to the airport early to ensure we don’t miss our flight. If we could predict perfectly when we would need to arrive to get on our flight, lounges would not exist. They exist as a buffer to improve our experience with poor prediction abilities.-	Tasks most likely to be fully automated first are the ones for which full automation delivers the highest returns. These include tasks where…o	The other elements are already automated except for prediction (mining)o	The returns to speed of action in response to prediction are high (driverless cars)o	The returns to reduced waiting time for predictions are high (Space Exploration)Part 3: Tools-	Tasks need to be broken down and decomposed to determine where the best ROI for prediction and automation would occur. In a large organization, the tasks that will be completed first are the ones with the greatest ROI.-	MBA screening example. A process could become quite good at determine which candidates would make the best MBA students for your program by watching the videos sent in by the candidates and predicting their success. The problem is that you need to teach the machine very specifically what to look for. What constitutes the “best” candidate? Your outcomes and factors must be well defined to train a prediction machine.-	My favorite example of the machine learning incorrectly was of a machine that was trained to play chess. It learned by watching chess champions play and mimicked their decision making. However, in the games it watched, it learned that in many of the matches where the champion one, he sacrificed his queen to win. The machine computed this as “if I sacrifice my queen, I have a better chance of winning” so it would sacrifice its queen early in the game. The algorithm had to be adjusted to only sacrifice the queen in certain scenarios where it would prove beneficial.-	Implementation of AI tools generates four implications for jobs:o	AI tools may augment jobs, helping people do their job bettero	AI tools may contract jobs. Ex: automated fulfillment centerso	AI tools may lead to the reconstitution of jobs with some tasks added and other taken away, as with radiologistso	AI tools may shift the emphasis on the specific skills required for a particular job, as with school bus drivers. They may be needed more to protect and nurture the children than to drive a vehicle.Part 4: Strategy-	AI can lead to strategic change if three factors are presento	There is a core trade off in the business model. Example was about amazon having such good data that they would change from having people shop and then shipping their products, to one where they would ship the item to the individual before they shopped for it, and if they wanted to return it their would be an infrastructure in place that made that incredibly simple.o	The tradeoff is influenced by uncertainty. We don’t know if the higher sales from the ship first method would result in higher costs from the returned items because we are uncertain how many of the items they will keep. We don’t have enough prediction power to be sure.o	An AI tool that reduces uncertainty tips the scales of the trade off so that the optimal strategy changes from one side of the trade to the other. If you did have the prediction power to be sure what people would buy, you would know if it was more cost effective to ship before shopping.-	Shifting to an AI first strategy means downgrading the previous top priority. It’s not a buzz word. It means you are placing greater value on the goal of maximizing prediction accuracy than you are on other tradeoffs like revenue or user growth.-	Risks of AIo	Predictions can lead to discrimination	Example of google searches suggesting an individual may be arrested because their name was more black-sounding name. The ads would show up if they had a higher quality score (people clicked on them more when the name was that of a black person) so the ads ran more often when you searched a black sounding name.	If you encounter your machine is acting discriminatingly, you need to adjust your algorithm. Doing so can be tough. You need to audit machine and figure out what is causing the behavior.	AI relies on correlation, not causation. You need to be able to see what happens when your variable is both present and not present to determine if it was a causal effect.o	AI is ineffective when data is sparse	Ai is bad at predicting rare eventso	Homgeneity of prediction machines can lead to risk of total system failure	If one crop appears to outgrow the others, a farmer might decide to plant only that crop. But if that crop encounters something that destroys it, the entire yield is destroyed. Similarly, say we all used the same prediction machine for a driverless car. Individually this might give us the best experience, but if someone or something were to attack that machine successfully, it would lead to a catastrophic total system failure. To work against this, we should diversify. We should also consider not tethering live updates to the cloud. o	Feedback can be manipulated so that prediction machines learn destructive behaviorPart 5 : Society-	The rise of AI presents trade offs for societyo	Productivity vs distribution (both examples show how wealth inequality can arise)	Economists agree that technological advance makes us better off and enhances productivity, which AI will do. How the created wealth is distributed will be the issue. If AI takes over certain jobs, humans will compete for the others, driving down wages for those jobs, reducing the fraction of income earned by the laborer compared to that earned by the owners of the capital (the machines doing the work). i.e. The owners of the machines will get a bigger cut of the revenues. 	The AI tools may help highly skilled workers more than lower skilled workers. This is how most computer systems work today. Higher skilled, higher educated workers can use technology more effectively and get a better return from the technology than lower skilled workers.o	Innovation vs competition (monopolization due to exponential increase in prediction capability)	As companies innovate their prediction machines to be more accurate, leading to an increase in users, leading to more data, which loops back into more accurate predictions, they may scale to become a monopoly as competitors cannot scale as quickly. Good for the short term, maybe not good in the long run for society.o	Performance vs privacy	Europe has more restrictive laws around data privacy, and as such will most likely not a be an innovation hub for AI. The US, and China especially, are looser on those laws and will undoubtedly have better performing AI, but at the cost of personal data."
272,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72997602-peter-mccluskey,4,"Three economists decided to write about AI. They got excited about AI, and that distracted them enough that they only said a modest amount about the standard economics principles that laymen need to better understand. As a result, the book ended up mostly being simple descriptions of topics on which the authors had limited expertise. I noticed fewer amateurish mistakes than I expected from this strategy, and they mostly end up doing a good job of describing AI in ways that are mildly helpful to laymen who only want a very high-level view.The book's main goal is to advise business on how to adopt current types of AI (""reading this book is almost surely an excellent predictor of being a manager who will use prediction machines""), with a secondary focus on how jobs will be affected by AI.The authors correctly conclude that a modest extrapolation of current trends implies at most some short-term increases in unemployment.One example they use to help us visualize this is the effects of spreadsheets on bookkeepers. Spreadsheets automated the most time consuming parts of bookkeeping, so fewer bookkeepers were needed to do what bookkeepers did before spreadsheets. But by making bookkeepers more powerful, spreadsheets led to bookkeepers calculating many more results than before.The book mentions horses, but then mostly dismisses, without any clear reason, the risk that humans will become as unemployable as horses did. I guess the authors are mainly imagining the kind of incremental increases in AI abilities that are likely in the next 5 or 10 years. But if we extrapolate to when AI exceeds human-level cognitive abilities, then it seems appropriate to worry about human wages becoming inadequate to feed humans, like what happened to horses a century ago.1.The book's advice to business is fairly appropriate, but often borders on common sense.The authors emphasize the distinction between prediction and judgment. Since they are complements, better prediction means that judgment become more valuable.Prediction machines don't provide judgment. Only humans do.For the near-term changes on which the book mostly focuses, I expect this model to work rather well.But many decades from now, what part of judgment will be hard to automate? Judgment generally requires more general-purpose models of human desires than most current AI hopes to achieve. But large increases in data and computing power seem likely to eventually enable automating most judgment, via something like having an AI predict what a human would say if the human analyzed the situation carefully.2.I'll now mention some complaints I have, about areas where the authors seem to be outside their areas of competence. These aren't particularly important aspects of the book, but I found them about as interesting as the book's main points.The discussion of trucking jobs seems a bit strange. They imagine that humans will need to ride with robotrucks to prevent theft. Would an unmanned truck convoy be at greater risk than are current trucks? I can't quite see how. They'll need good cameras for driving, and it seems like those would also serve as effective means to identify thieves. The robotruck industry may well employ plenty of humans for tasks such as loading and unloading, but I predict humans will rarely accompany robotrucks on long trips.The authors ask what should happen when a robocar hands control to the human driver in an emergency, after pointing out related problems that associated with Air France Flight 447. My answer is that a robocar shouldn't require that a human take control. I don't see much reason to expect humans to do better than software in sudden emergencies. Yet the authors indicate that humans in robocars need to know how to drive, without appearing to consider the advantages of relying on software in emergencies. Trains have been run without drivers present, and the book mentions a mine where trucks operate without drivers. Doing that with cars on typical roads is much harder, but the benefits are also much larger, and I predict I'll feel safer as a pedestrian 15 years from now if cars handle emergencies via software.They can't avoid mentioning the Trolley problem:Someone will have to resolve the dilemma and program the appropriate response into the car. The problem cannot be avoided.There are likely to be political and legal reasons why it can't be avoided, but the authors hint that there are ethical reasons. I don't see those reasons. I'd be happy to use a robocar that handled trolley problems roughly the way that humans do, i.e. treat any situation that kills a person as if it's as close to infinitely bad as our minds can understand [1].They note that having lots of data is somewhat important to making good predictions, which lead them to wonder: will China rule the world due to having more data? I see little strength to the idea that having more people means outperforming due to having more data. The parts of the world with European languages likely have more variety of data than China does, and variety of data is at least as important as quantity.The more interesting hypothesis is that EU-style privacy controls might retard the regions that adopt them. But they mention (elsewhere) evidence from comparing Google to Yahoo/Microsoft which shows that such restrictions have had little effect.The authors dismiss Bostrom's Superintelligence in a way that indicates they don't quite understand what Bostrom is claiming.3.I predict that a modest number of readers will benefit from this book, and a larger number will react favorably to it, while quickly forgetting what it says.Footnote[1] - I also endorse Brad Templeton's explanations of why robocar people should pay less attention to this issue, and implement whatever answer puts robocars on roads soon:It turns out the problem has a simple answer which is highly likely to be the one taken. In almost every situation of this sort, the law already specifies who has the right of way, and who doesn't. The vehicles will be programmed to follow the law, which means that when presented with a choice of hitting something in their right-of-way and hitting something else outside the right-of-way, the car will obey the law and stay in its right-of-way.Given a few reasonable assumptions, from a strict standpoint of counting deaths and injuries, almost any delay to the deployment of high-safety robocars costs lots of lives. And not a minor number. Delay it by a year, and anywhere from 10,000-20,000 extra people will die in the USA, a 300,000 to a million around the world. Delay it by a day and you condemn 30-80 unknown future Americans and 1,000 others to death, and many thousands more to horrible injury.Trolley problems provide potentially valuable insights into how different ethical systems handle situations that are very different from what humans have experienced, but robocar designers should focus on situations that resemble what humans have experienced."
273,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105904707-aaron-kalafarski,3,"This book served more to reinforce concepts around AI than it did to open up new ways of thinking about it. Basically, most AI are prediction machines and the cost of prediction has dramatically decreased. While AI can learn to predict situations it lacks the judgement that humans posses. Therefore, when paired with humans can compliment and enhance their work. As the use of AI improves the effectiveness and efficiency of processes, industries, etc. it will change how we think about work. It will make certain work obsolete and create opportunities elsewhere by analyzing and adjusting to customer feedback.The biggest issue outside of the book to me is as lower-level jobs get automated away those individuals out of a job will either need to be retrained to adapt to AI or find new jobs. This is going to increase workplace stratification and the disparity from those who are technologically adept versus those who are more inept. Is will more than likely impact generations and those of different levels of intelligence the most dramatically. Therefore, I believe we should be spending time focusing on anticipating those problems as well as the benefits AI will bring us. "
274,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/107729408-kevin-krom,5,"Key Learns:1. AI is an economic problem (we've had artificial neural nets since the 1950's). The cost of running prediction machines is now obtainable for companies of various sizes2. I liked how the authors split up the various components (prediction, decision making, tools strategy, society).Criticism: Obviously, this is my own issue I have with any book on AI and the corresponding societal impacts but I think most books downplays the impact that prediction machines. It's hard to see books like this say something to the effect of, ""we don't see terminator murder robots running around town so things are pretty good!""... seems wildly myopic. Look at the impact of social media, credit scoring models, advertising campaigns for predatory loan companies, or for-profit colleges... are people getting murdered? no. Are people losing their rights, freedoms, and chance to build a better life for themselves? yes. "
275,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111501905-bilal,4,"The key lessons in this book are: One, the unpacking of decision making into two primary components: prediction and judgement, that is, decisions are meant to choose the best path forward (i.e., judge) when certain dependencies are unknown, and where one assigns certain likelihoods to the unknowns turning out one way or another. The authors argue that AI is best suited to provide the predictions (assign likelihoods to outcomes) and leave the judgement to human beings. They present several examples to make sense of this point. Two, the break down workflows into sub-components, jobs, where some of these jobs may be given to AI. They present several examples of how this is already done in the industry. I found the book informative on these two topics but stating the obvious on other topics."

Reading this book I had a real lightbulb moment when there was a discussion of separating judgement from prediction of outcomes in decision making. When AI wasn't making the judgement and was just a tool in the decision making process I saw clearly how it could be used in many instances. There's a lot more to the book including how it might affect employment, different strategies that business might use, the value of data for learning (and how the value of historical data drops once the learning is done).This book does not discuss AI at a technical level. I found it quite accessible as someone with an interest in technology."

295,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51896417-frans-sax-n,3,"Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of AI is a primer on using economics to illuminate the consequences of the rise of AI. This is not a book that will scare you using dramatic, persuasive storytelling. Rather, it is a book using some pretty simple economics concepts (think Econ 101) to illuminate the consequences of the rise of AI, by interpreting AI as prediction machines, and their ""rise"" as a fall in the cost of making predictions. When the cost of making predictions fall, more predictions will be made - when the market price declines, more is demanded. And when the price of predictions decline, not only does the demand of predictions increase, but so does the demand of complements. One complement is judgement - when more predictions can be made, more judgements are called for - What is the implication of the AI predicting a 2 point rise in the probability of accidents? The authors use elementary, well established economics to illustrate a number of implications of AI, in the process demonstrating the power of analyzing complex topics thru a simple, but coherent framework. The theoretical analysis is augmented by illustrative case studies. The comparison between AI and the spreadsheet is illuminating. When the first computer spreadsheet was launched, there were fewer accountants employed than today. The ""rise of the spreadsheet"" led to demand for more accountants, and more scenario analysis, as these activities became cheaper. The authors argue that the same will be the case for AI. While the number of management accountants employed increased, their jobs were transformed. The same will happen with AI, as it reconfigures jobs. The authors do not see AI replacing all human work as the most likely scenario - but that does not mean that it would not affect what jobs look like. As any transformative technology shift, getting the most out of it will require a deep reorganizing of work - both individual jobs as well as organizations. Another literary illuminative example includes the ""rise of"" artificial light (the light bulb), a similar general purpose technology enabling wide spread innovation in business practices. While using elementary economics can get you far, the authors do not shy away from going further, looking at practical challenges (what do I need to employ AI to solve my problems), highlighting the need for data, common pitfalls with interpreting data (think of Wald's analysis in WWII of returning aircraft hit by anti-aircraft fire, and the associated bias), etc.The book is written for a wide audience, but is structured as a typical business book. Each chapter is brief enough, and is summarized in the end in a few succinct bullet points. Think of it as an introduction to the business implications of the economics of AI. This is similar to Carl Shapiro's and Hal Varian's classic on the business implications of the economics of Web 1.0 ""Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy."" Another book in the same fashion that comes to mind is Brynjolfson and McAfee's ""Machine, Platform, Crowd: Harnessing Our Digital Future."" While Brynjofson and McAfee touches on some of the same topics as ""Prediction machines,"" the latter is more focused and thus goes deeper into the topic of AI. And similar to the two previously mentioned books, this uses the economist's standard toolkit - no need to invent fancy new theories to understand the basics of this new phenomena. There may be a new economy, but that does not necessarily require new economics."
296,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81309751-louis-zaltzman,4,Great book to understand the basics on ML combined with an optimistic perspective of the future of AI and humanity.
297,1633695670,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55071150-arti,4,"The book looks at AI from the viewpoint of economics and interestingly reframes AI as cheap prediction. It sets the context to show that prediction is now becoming a commodity - and there has been a gradual shift from data and insights to predictions - if you sift through the AI hype, most of the products today sit in this space. Prediction is central to decision making - and it means that organisations can make better decisions, and faster. But the bigger opportunity is where improved quality of predictions can motivate organisations to change their strategy - a simple example is a shift from shop-and-ship to ship-and-shop model - which can transform organisations like Amazon if their predictions are accurate and dependable!The authors argue that the economic shift will centre around a drop in the cost of prediction (and an associated increase in the value of judgement) - which will in turn lower the cost of activities that were historically prediction oriented (like inventory managements, demand forecasting), as well as open up opportunities to use prediction as an input for things for which we never previously did (like translation or navigation which now has moved out of the rule based programming framework to a machine learning based prediction framework that predicts human response to changing environmental data). It's a different perspective and got me to think – the technology geek in me was of-course shocked at the over-simplification. And while I accept that the current state of AI is nowhere close to the myth of super intelligent machines, but limiting the view to predictions and keeping judgement or actions ( out of the purview seems like an incomplete and a short sighted view. It is like saying that we will replace bits and pieces of our existing processes by newer technology. Its an oversimplification of AI and risks losing the bigger picture - the opportunity to reimagine processes - not just with digital intelligence - but also self-learning and self-organising workflows.A stimulating read… it opens up the mind to the prevailing (common) view and an insight into its immediate practical applications and introduces a non-tech user to business considerations such as AI-first strategy (maximising prediction accuracy even at the cost of maximising revenue, user numbers or experience), impact of AI on data, labour, capital, tradeoff between data, prediction accuracy and value, division of labour between humans and machines, managing AI risks - quality, security, liability and in some cases the possibility of changing the strategy itself.But for me, the book have me an opportunity (after being provoked by the authors limited view) to develop a holistic perspective and look beyond prediction - to determine the gaps and next steps to taking AI to the next level of true potential. And i see a significant opportunity in integrating AI into the next step of decision process - judgement (relative payoffs of possible outcomes) and automated actions!Note: The book has evolved from a series of articles on HBR e.g. The Simple Economics of Machine Intelligence and honestly the articles are sufficient to get a good understanding of the theory and the arguments put forth by the authors. Its a much easier option to familiarise with the concepts and I don't think that you would miss a lot from not having read the book."
