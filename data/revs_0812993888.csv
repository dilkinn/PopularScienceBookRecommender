0,0812993888,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34364-david,4,"According to Benedict Carey, a science reporter, the way we THINK we learn is actually very different from the way we ACTUALLY learn. About 95% of Carey’s book is a historical chronology of the clinical studies and science experiments that led to our current understanding of learning. The remaining 5% contains the useful points and strategies you need to be a better learner. Since I’m guessing almost all of us care very much about the useful 5% and very little of the historical 95%, I’ve boiled down his central and most important points of application below:1. Forgetting actually helps you learn. This is the “Forget to Learn” theory. When we forget something, then try remember it again (“retrieval”), the memory then becomes stronger. Forgetting is critical to the learning of new skills and the preservation of old ones.2. We perform better on exams when we are in the same state of mind as when we studied. People remember more of what they studied when they return to that same study environment. Since we can’t always predict the context in which we will need to perform, we can help our studying and memory by varying the environment where we study. The traditional advice to establish a strict practice routine is not advisable. On the contrary: Try another room altogether. Another time of day. Practice your musical instrument outside, in the park, in the woods. Switch cafes. Each alteration further enriches the skills rehearsed, making them sharper and more accessible for longer.3. People learn and remember more when they space their study time instead of concentrating it. This is called “distributed learning” or “the spacing effect.” The spacing effect is especially useful for memorizing new material. Studying a new concept right after you learn it doesn’t deepen the memory much, if at all. Studying it an hour later, or a day later, does. Cramming works fine in a pinch but doesn’t last. Spacing does. 4. The “fluency illusion” is the belief that because facts are easy to remember RIGHT NOW, they will remain that way tomorrow or the next day. It’s one of the reasons students will bomb a test they thought they would have aced. The best way to overcome this illusion is to consistently engage in self-testing. Instead of memorizing a poem by reading it 20 times, read it ten times, constantly trying to recite it from memory as you go. Testing yourself as you go amplifies the value of your study time. 5. Pre-testing is also an important study tool. Even if you bomb a test on Day 1 of a class, that experience alters how you subsequently take in the material during the rest of the semester. On some kinds of tests, especially multiple choice, we learn from answering incorrectly—especially if given the correct answer soon afterwards. Guessing wrong increases a person’s likelihood of answering correctly on a later test. The act of guessing itself engages your mind in a more demanding way than straight memorization, deepening the imprint of the correct answer.6. Many teachers have said you don’t really know a topic until you have to teach it yourself, until you have to make it clear to someone else. One effective study method is to explain the material either to yourself or to someone you know. 7. The mind works on problems “off-line,” subconsciously, when we’re not aware it’s happening. Sometimes, when we are stuck on a problem requiring insight, distractions can be a valuable weapon rather than a hindrance. However, people do not benefit from such an “incubation break” unless they have first reached an IMPASSE. Knock off and play a videogame too soon and you get nothing. Creative leaps often come during downtown that follows a period of immersion in a story or topic, and they often come piecemeal, not in any particular order, and in varying size and importance. 8. Interruptions are helpful to learning. Interrupting yourself when absorbed in an assignment extends its life in memory and pushes it to the top of your mental to do list. And once a goal is top of mind, we are more focused on accomplishing it. 9. Just starting on a project gives that project the weight of a goal, even if the actual work performed is minimal. We should start work on large projects as soon as possible, without the psychological burden of feeling like the project needs to be completed in one sitting. It’s ok to stop when we get stuck, with the confidence that we are not “quitting” but initiating a percolation period. Quitting before you’re ahead doesn’t actually put a project to sleep, it keeps it awake. 10. Varying your practice and studies, known as “interleaving,” is more effective than concentrating on one skill or subject at a time, because it forces us to be able to adjust and think quicker on the fly. Constant repetition alone is less useful. Mixing up practice with different tasks forces people to make continual adjustments, building a general dexterity that sharpens each specific skill. All that adjusting during mixed practice also enhances our ability to perform each skill regardless of context. Also, since tests themselves are mixed sets of problems, it helps to make homework the same. 11. Over time and with practice, your brain develops “perceptual intuition,” the ability to detect minute differences in sights, sounds, or textures. The brain takes these tiny differences it has detected between similar looking signals and uses those to help decipher new, previously unseen material. Perceptual learning is happening all the time, automatically, and subconsciously. 12. Sleeping improves retention and comprehension of what was studied the day before. What happens during sleep, according to recent theory, is that you open the aperture of memory and are able to see the bigger picture. There is evidence that REM sleep is a creative memory domain, where you build different associations and combine things in different ways. Sleep also improves pattern recognition, creative problem solving, and muscle/motor memory. Napping also provides slow wave deep sleep and REM sleep. Conclusion: Learning is a restless exercise and that restlessness applies not only to the timing of study sessions but also to their content, i.e., the value of mixing up old and new material in a single sitting. Given the dangers of fluency, or misplaced confidence, exposed ignorance is like a cushioned fall. The experience acts as a reminder to check and recheck what you assume you know. The mind is a forager for information, for strategies, for clever ways to foil other species’ defenses and live off the land. That’s the academy where our brains learned to learn, and it defines how we came to be human. Learning is what we do. "

All the information here is original and explained in great detail. Among the techniques Carey offers to improve memory and academic performance is persistent practice, breaking up study time, incubation, and self-testing. The length of the book wasn’t too long or too short either. I’m glad I was recommended this book!"
2,0812993888,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj,4,"Why So SeriousWe all “know” we need to be organized, to develop good, consistent study routines, to find a quiet place and avoid distractions, to focus on one skill at a time, and above all, to concentrate on our work. What’s to question about that?Carey begins this book with the allegation that most of our instincts about learning are misplaced, incomplete, or flat wrong. It goes like this: Want to procrastinate? Good!Can’t focus? Good!No fixed schedule? Good!Can’t study in a fixed place? Good!Forget stuff too easily? Good!Crave distractions? Good!Lazy and sleepy? Good!Our worst habits, the ones we try so hard to overcome, it turns out, are our brains shortcuts to super learning. Yaay!Carey tells us that we need no longer think of these “bad” habits as evidence of laziness, or a waste of time, or, worst of all, a failure of will. You can think of all of them as learning too, with your eyes closed while sleeping, for example! It is when we push against these natural learning mechanisms that we go sub-optimal in our efforts.In short, we misidentify the sources of our frustration: that we get in our own way, unnecessarily, all the time. That is why learning becomes difficult. We just need to learn to get out of our own way more often and let our naturally greedy brain gorge itself on all the learning it needs.Think about it for a second. Distraction, diversion, catnaps, interruptions—these aren’t mere footnotes, mundane details in an otherwise purposeful life. That’s your ten-year-old interrupting, or your dog, or your mom. That restless urge to jump up is hunger or thirst, the diversion a TV show that’s integral to your social group. You took that catnap because you were tired, and that break because you were stuck. These are the stitches that hold together our daily existence; they represent life itself, not random deviations from it. Our study and practice time needs to orient itself around them—not the other way around.Let go of what you feel you should be doing, all that repetitive, over-scheduled, driven, focused ritual. Let go, and watch how the presumed enemies of learning—ignorance, distraction, interruption, restlessness, even quitting—can work in your favor.Get out of your own way, and INDULGE! That is when you will learn best.Learning is, after all, what you do. Learning is Life, and nothing comes more naturally to you! "
3,0812993888,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18276597-jay-williams,5,"Probably the most informative book I have read in years. I was amazed at the information it contains, and how it was written for ready comprehension. It stands the traditional ideas on learning on end, and provides a solid basis for the knowledge it provides. I especially liked the appendix which summarized the information from the entire book into practical guidelines for use. I will make sure many members of my family get a copy of this book. It is valuable for all ages."
4,0812993888,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73783-taka,4,"Another excellent book on learning science--The book covers much of the same ground as Make It Stick: the Science of Successful Learning—desirable difficulty, the necessity of forgetting in learning, testing as a learning technique, illusion of knowing, and spaced & varied practice—but the emphasis is more on the practical side of learning and offers some concepts, studies, and insights not found in Make It Stick. Some of the things I took away from this book and will be applying to my own learning and teaching include:1) Interleaved/varied practice. The book drives home the clear advantage of varied—or random—practice over massed or even serial practice, even though the learners thought otherwise.The reasons for the advantage are not known. The effect may simply come from simulating the real situation: a math problem on the real test where you don't know which equations to apply, or a badminton game where you have to hit the shuttlecock from varied spots. Meaning it might be restricted to those cases where you can expect some degree of randomness (which would, theoretically speaking, counter what Taleb calls ""the ludic fallacy,"" where skills and concepts drawn from a well-ordered environment don't and can't work in a chaotic environment). Or maybe you learn better because your brain has to make more effort and adjustments when dealing with different skills/concepts/problems. Or it might be that the brain learns better from differences than from more of the same thing. Whatever the real reasons, though, I'd like to try applying it to at least two of my learning areas: 1) reading multiple books at the same time; and 2) writing different things—fiction, essay, poetry—in one sitting. For the former, like in the painting studies, I will be reading at least two books from a similar genre (two to three poetry books from different authors, for example) as well as books from different genres (e.g., history, philosophy, fiction).2) Context. While it's true you remember better in the same internal state you were in (e.g. high, caffeine-buzzed, or drunk) when you learned something, one effective way of countering this is to introduce contextual interference, where you vary the location/environment in which you study. By studying in a variety of situations/locations, you become independent of the environment.I'll be experimenting with this and try to read/write at different cafes/libraries.3) Incubation and the importance of distraction when it comes to problems and projects involving ""insights,"" or ""Aha"" moments. Takeaway: when you reach an impasse in some problem (and you have to reach an impasse for this to work), it's actually more productive to take a break and do something else. The kind of activity that's effective in initiating the process of incubation depends on the kind of problem you're dealing with: any activity—relaxing (e.g., lying on the couch), mildly active (e.g., surfing the Internet), and highly engaging (e.g., writing a short essay)—is effective for math or spatial problems, mild activity (video games, solitaire, TV) works best for problems involving language. On the whole, ""longer"" breaks (about 20min) are better than shorter ones (5-10min).I sort of knew this from experience (and from another study on the subconscious), but it's good to know I've been doing the right thing. 4) Percolation. For long-term projects, it's actually good to interrupt your activity because anything interrupted lingers in your mind and you'll be scanning the environment for any hints/clues to solving the problem or improving the project.5) Perceptual learning & immediate feedback. This is sort of an application of deliberate practice involving immediate feedback, but you can learn something subconsciously by studying a bunch of slides and getting the answer right away. Application: being able to distinguish different painting styles without—and this is the fascinating part—knowing exactly why. Would like to try with 20th century paintings myself.6) Sleep. Achieving higher understanding and memory consolidation after a night's sleep. I knew this from another book (Josh Kaufman's The First 20 Hours).7) Spaced practice. Good numbers to remember:  a) when trying to memorize something, spend about 1/3 of the time studying and 2/3 rehearsing (recalling from memory);  b) to memorize vocab or any fact, it's best to review the material 1 or 2 days later, then a week later, and a month later;  c) max interval for lifetime learning is once every 2 months.  d) Optimal study intervals: Time to test: 1 week; first study interval: 1-2 days (meaning: study today, then again tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, and if you want to add a third session, study the day before the test)1 month: today, 1 week from today, then about 3 weeks later, on the day before the test3 months: 2 weeks6 months: 3 weeks1 year: 1 monthOverall, another highly recommended book on learning."

There is a lot of variation in how well things like spaced repetition work, depending on the type of memories being formed. It would have been nice to see an overview of some of the differences.The book is also short on discussion of how to act on the advice. At an individual level, it'd be nice to have better systems for taking advantage of these ideas.Still, a very good introduction to much of this work."

7,0812993888,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66855950-tony,5,"Audible version:Firstly, this was a struggle at times, probably through the frustration of my own powers of learning/recall. If you’re going to use this book for personal/self-improvement, or you want to use its lessons in your own classroom, then an audible version is immensely confounding – as I wanted to make notes and highlights continuously, and walking to and from work whilst listening didn’t allow me to easily do this! I also hated the attempts of the narrator to mimic the Irish accent or when quoting research from a woman, attempt a somewhat high-pitched parody.But… and it’s a big but… this book was outstanding. It collects a wealth of research, personal experience and learning and puts them together in a manner which is easy to understand and logically builds from one concept to another. It is so good, that as soon as I finished, I downloaded the kindle version so I can read it again and this time make notes.In fact, it is so good that when the voice at the end says “we hope you enjoyed this book”, I actually said “Yes!” – out loud!There’s a lot here, and it’s all good!"
8,0812993888,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15527240-leland-beaumont,4,"As soon as we shift focus from teaching to learning, understanding how our brains acquire information becomes paramount. The easy going, storytelling style of this book belies its depth and importance; this is a book about how brain cells form, hold onto, and retrieve new information.How we do learn often differs from how we may have been taught to learn. Schoolmarms would be very surprised to find out what actually works. Here are some of the unusual conclusions developed in the book:+ Forgetting is essential to learning.+ Recall is improved in an environment similar to where we originally learned the material.+ Breaking up study time into several sessions spaced out over time—distributed learning—works better than a single continuous study session.+ Testing is a powerful form of studying. Taking a test before studying the material improves the overall learning process.+ Problem solving often occurs in four distinct stages: preparation, incubation, illumination, and verification. Distraction—stepping away from the problem—is important to allow incubation to occur subconsciously.+ Interrupting an activity before it is completed helps in recalling the activity. + Interleaving tasks—practicing skills in a random sequence—deepens learning and better prepares us to transfer those skills to settings. + Perceptual learning methods tap our subconscious to discriminate or classify things that look similar to the untrained eye, but are critically different to the trained eye.+ Sleep aids memory.The book clearly presents convincing arguments for abandoning several traditional study rules and adopting new rules based on solid scientific research. The many studies supporting the conclusions are presented as fun-to-read stories. Although the author may extrapolate general conclusions from a few studies, and rarely presents opposing viewpoints, the arguments are convincing. The book is clearly written, accessible, fun to read, and provides important new guidance on how we actually do learn."
9,0812993888,http://goodreads.com/user/show/288945-jane,3,"I could go 3.5 stars easily, but not four as much of the book was review, not surprising (although my parents never, ever suggested when, where or how I should study!) I wanted to retitle the first half of this book ""How We Memorize"" as Carey dealt, in an engaging way, with studies on how we retain factual information. This is not the heart of my interest in deep learning -- and I think the topic is covered better and with better, useful techniques for memorization, in Moonwalking with Einstein.HOWEVER, in the second half of the Book, Carey delves more into applying what we learn and his findings are far richer. Yes, taking breaks is good. Yes, starting a project early allows for percolation of ideas. Yes, pausing before you finish lets your mind refresh and perchance unearth better ideas. Yes, taking a break when you're stuck and doing something else frequently lets solutions to complex problems surface; you stop thinking of the obvious and think differently. And yes, sleep is huge in the learning process. So keep reading -- like me, you'll most likely stumble on new and helpful information. In fact, as I finished the pages I put together a quiz for a parent group I'll be speaking to which they'll take before I begin. I can then show them the studies on how quizzes on information you haven't studied, and quizzing in general, helps learning!Thanks, Netgalley, for making a copy available in exchange for an honest review."

Fascinating and useful. I wish I'd listened to it before I took my boards exam. There were things I might have structured differently in my study plan.I especially would like to have this on hand in the event that I'm involved in course design at some point.

Things that are seen as detrimental like distractions, randomness, naps, boredom, different settings are actually what can help us the most. Learning or training our brains whether it’s in the storage or the retrieval aspects is just like our exercise routines the more varied , sporadic, intermittent the better. Agility and flexibility are extremely valuable for strengthening .The author highlights tips we might already know like the importance of self testing, immersing in the material and teaching it to others to help us assimilate it better but also shines the light on tips I personally didn’t think of before like more variety in study , interleaving and a general call for ditching structure and linear learning for a more random study plan. A fascinating info was how learning done involving a number of senses is better as things you learn while attaching a sound a smell an emotion are better learned but this can also backfire and not be sustainable. He points out differences in motor and verbal learning were one can be more subconscious than the other and although one might need a slightly different approach than the other they both benefit from the above techniques.Overall enjoyable and informative, so turns out that for learning just like for life it’s better to take it less seriously for best results."
16,0812993888,http://goodreads.com/user/show/266227-jennifer,4,"I’ve been reading a lot of books about the science of learning lately. It started a couple of years ago when I began using an article by Carol Dweck in my developmental reading/writing course—an article about fixed and growth mindset and about how such a small thing like what you believe about your own intelligence or ability can have a huge impact. My students both related to it as learners but sometimes as parents too. Since then, I have seen/read discussions of mindset everywhere and one night last fall I was reading an article on Mind/Shift and before I knew it I had ordered three books off of Amazon: Make It Stick, Thinking Fast and Slow, and The Power of Habit. I read Make It Stick right away (even though I haven’t yet reviewed it for CBR8) but that book led me to this one—How We Learn-The Surprising Truth About When, Where, and Why It Happens by Benedict Carey.  Carey is a science reporter for the New York Times and in this book he attempts to show how many of the ideas we have about learning may not be right or more accurately, that scientists are learning many counterintuitive things about what facilitates learning. [This, by the way, is also the main premise of Make It Stick, which is written by two cognitive scientists and a journalist.] Carey starts with his own story as a learner—a high school grind who actually began to “learn” more in college when he took things less seriously and was pulled in more interesting directions. He then uses that story as a way into the various things that cognitive scientists now theorize about learning—many that run counter to what you learn in study skills courses.  Here’s just a sampler. That idea, that you should always study in the same distraction-free place, has been disproven by research. It can actually help if you do math equations or practice conjugating Spanish verbs in a variety of contexts. The common notion of massed practice, that you should study in large chunks of time, Is also debunked. There have been numerous studies that show learners learn more deeply if they space out their learning sessions and if they practice different types of things. That is, as someone learning to play guitar (as I am), it would be much better for me in the long run if I practiced for 15-20 minutes a day than in one or two hour-long sessions and if I practiced a number of different songs instead of the same song over and over and over again. The idea that my students this semester have found most helpful is the power of “testing” yourself about content versus simply reviewing a reading or lecture notes. Actually, Carey focuses a lot on what scientists are discovering about the power of testing or quizzing as an aid to learning but not in the NCLB way but as a way of getting a “real” sense of what you know and don’t know. One of my favorite chapters is called “You Snooze, You Win” and focuses on what scientists know and don’t know about what the brain does during sleep. I now see afternoon naps in a totally different light. I found this book both enjoyable to read and very interesting. There is a lot of overlap between this book and Make It Stick but they work well together to make me realize how much I don’t know about what the brain does while learning and how helpful it would be to know more about this as a teacher (and as a learner). "
17,0812993888,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4722239-brandi,4,"Well...I spent 8 years teaching students useless study habits. 😕 Informative and eye opening, but I would have liked bulleted suggestions for improving learning at the end of each chapter. "
18,0812993888,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1608811-david,3,"This book started Chapter One with a fascinating question: why do people with brains split completely in half (surgery for severe epilepsy) still feel like one unified person? The answer: somewhere in the left hemisphere, there is a system in our brains that researcher Michael Gazzaniga calls the ""left brain interpreter"". The interpreter what what puts together the story of our lives. Oh, and 'story' is truly the right word; the interpreter will make up bullshit to explain what it does not know! Chapter One has some other interesting information about the brain. It's not directly about learning per se. But it's certainly interesting!Chapter Two was baffling to me at first: ""The Power of Forgetting."" Honestly, I couldn't put the anecdotes and information into something cohesive. I felt like something was missing or I was missing something, at any rate. At the end of the chapter, I asked myself this question: ""Why is forgetting important to learning?"" And I couldn't answer the question. I had no idea.I went back and skimmed over the chapter again. Nope, still couldn't answer that question in my own words. Huh. I shrugged and went on. But not before I stuck a sticky-note with a question mark on the last page of the chapter: a visual reminder of the question that bugged me.Chapter Three was also a bust! The science is all over the place and the conclusions feel like the author's personal preferences: if tying memories to environmental contexts is a crutch, you should vary your environment as you learn. A similar, better argument is made (varying or ""interleaving"" your practice), much more convincingly, later in Chapter Eight.Chapter Four's material about spaced repetition was review for me, but very interesting and worthwhile information if you've not yet read about the work of, say, Piotr Wozniak. The ""Four Bahrick Study"" was new to me and also very interesting. I believe in the power of this method because I've been using it for a couple months (paper flashcards). The general idea: the longer you can space out re-learning things, the better you'll remember them and the less time you'll waste reviewing things you already know. (Look up ""spaced repetition"" online.)Chapter Five is named ""The Hidden Value of Ignorance"" (sounds exciting and intriguingly counter-intuitive). I think it's a pretty poor title for some excellent advice, which is: quiz yourself often if you want to learn something. Don't keep reading and re-reading material, hoping it will sink in. We don't learn (or even memorize) by osmosis. If you put effort into recalling something even (or especially) if you fail to recall it, you'll remember that thing much better later. Much, much better, actually. And just as importantly, you won't be fooling yourself into thinking you've learned something you haven't (the ""fluency illusion""). Another thing I liked about Chapter Five was towards the end when Carey applies ""testing/quizzing"" to the concept of ""fake it 'til you make it."" Basically, pretend you already understand the subject and then try to apply it; treat failures as opportunities to complete your understanding. Another way to look at it is the old adage that goes: you don't really understand a subject until you try to teach it to someone else. Deep down, I already knew that. Writing these book reviews, for example, is very helpful for me because it forces me to put my half-formed ideas and understandings about a book into my own words. I'm trying to communicate my thoughts to other people. I may not succeed, but the effort alone increases my understanding (and often forces me to re-read a paragraph or two!) It's very valuable.The final thing I got out of Chapter Five, strangely, was that I think I finally understood the point Carey was trying to make back in Chapter Two about forgetting! So, if you forget something, you'll remember it better next time, right? Well, I guess testing yourself and failing is another way to find that you've forgot something and thereby actually strengthen your understanding. It's all part of the same ""making connections stronger"" action in the brain.Why is forgetting important to learning? Answer: if we forget a little, we make a stronger connection. Trying and failing makes a better connection.But, really, does this chapter demonstrate any ""value of ignorance""? I'm not seeing it. I'd say that's an odd way to put it at best.Chapter Six was frustrating for me. It's about the idea that you need to distract yourself from a problem in order to let your subconscious work on the problem - often resulting in far better and more creative solutions than brute force mental effort. I actually believe very strongly in this concept; I have experienced it first hand more times than I can count. So what's my problem with this chapter?Well, it's the emphasis on the ""not thinking about the problem"" part. Reading the chapter casually, you might get the impression that your average person is, if anything, not distracted enough! That we should go check our inboxes or juggle a ball every five minutes and the world's mysteries will unfold before our very eyes! Nonsense. You first have to think about the problem to exhaustion. Put in the work. Try it from every angle. Draw diagrams. Lose yourself completely in the attempt. It might take hours. It might take days. It might take months. You have to get to the point where you start to have dreams about the problem. Ah! Now distract yourself. Take a shower. Do some gardening. Play some Minecraft. Your brain is still working on the problem, but now it's applying the subconscious to the problem, making weird connections and being all creative and shit.I'll admit, Carey does mention this mental effort part in the chapter. He does. But it's downplayed so much that distractions end up overhyped like 
this one weird trick that Nobel Prize winners don't want you to know about.
Chapter Seven is yet another take on distractions! On the surface it's about that nagging feeling we have when we can't complete something. We remember the project we weren't quite able to finish the other day. It stays in our memory. At first, this chapter annoyed the hell out of me because...my life right now is a series of distractions. I'm a software developer who works at home...with two young children. I can tell you right now: 
distractions are not the key to solving hard problems,
 okay? Hard work and concentration are the key to solving hard problems. You can live an entire life of distraction, learning and accomplishing nothing. Anyway, the idea that your average person ""would sure benefit from some distractions right about now"" needs to be taken in context (or with a big old grain of salt). Unless you're a cloistered monk, live alone, work in a private office, study in a library, or spend a lot of quality time out in nature, you're probably already up to your damned eyeballs in distractions. You could probably do with a lot less of them. You probably laughed darkly, maybe even a little frighteningly, when you read a chapter about the benefits of distractions. You probably turned to the back flap of the book to see who this Benedict Carey guy is who has no beneficial distractions in his life, the poor guy, so he needs to go get himself some distractions because he's just got too much damned peace and solitude and concentration in his life, the poor bastard! Actually, what's funny is that I really liked how Chapter Seven ended! There was some really solid advice about tackling large projects: don't try to ""incubate"" ideas for a project as a whole; get started right away (""break the skin,"" to paraphrase) and go until you get stuck. Then incubate the solution to that problem. Then get to the next problem. To borrow the quote from poet A.E. Housman:
When I got home I wrote [a line or two of verse or a whole stanza] down, leaving gaps, and hoping that further inspiration might be forthcoming another day.
Chapter Eight. Honestly, I have no complaints about Chapter Eight. It makes a solid case for ""interleaving"" your studies as opposed to mindless repetitive drilling of super-specific skills. The science started with physical activities (sports), but eventually came to find that purely mental learning (say, math) is also most effective if you shuffle the learning up, revisiting topics and doing a little bit of this and a little bit of that.My own flashcards work this way: I have a single deck with everything I want to remember. I have computer science in there, math, some philosophy, the difference between i.e. and e.g., ""who"" vs ""whom"", you name it. I shuffle the cards so I have no idea what topic is coming up next. Reviewing the cards on a spaced repetition schedule brings back old subjects that I'm just starting to forget. According to science, I'm making strong connections. If I keep this up, I'll know these things for life.Chapter Nine was also solid and I'm eager to try out its method: perceptual learning. Here's the idea: make yourself a little computer game; display an image; press a button to identify what you're seeing; display a different image; press a button; repeat. Do it repeatedly and fast. What you're doing is teaching the image-processing and subconscious parts of your brain to identify the patterns in the images. Our brains are really, really good at this.What kinds of things can you learn with this method? Well, the book uses these examples: airplane instrument panels, styles of paintings, and species of birds, medical skin conditions. It has to be visual. I wonder, though, if you can learn things that aren't generally considered to be ""visual"" problems, like programming idioms, certain elements of mathematics (the book confirms this one), obscure or difficult English grammar, and anything else that can be very quickly seen and identified? I bet it would work. My evidence is the fact that we didn't learn all of the words of our native languages by looking them up in the dictionary. No, we learned them through context, whether spoken or written. I'm still learning how to pronounce many words which I learned in books but rarely (if ever) hear in conversation. I've never looked these words up, but I've seen them enough times to have an accurate understanding of their meaning. Seeing 50 examples of right and wrong uses of ""who"" vs ""whom"" and repeating the test until you get it 100% correct ought to very quickly embed the correct usage in your mind even if you can't explain the ""rule"". Anyway, just a thought. I'd love to try it out.I loved the fact that Carey had his daughter make a PLM (perceptual learning module) for him so he could learn to identify the artistic movement (Impressionism, Romanticism, Expressionism, etc.) of a painting by sight. It worked amazingly well. It makes sense that it would work. And yet, it's not the sort of thing I would have ever considered building for myself.Chapter Ten was okay. It's about the role of sleep in learning. Having just finished a whole book on this subject (Why We Sleep by sleep scientist Matthew Walker - who is quoted in this chapter), Carey's summary was a little underwhelming and possibly slightly wrong or out of date.I took quite a few notes while I was reading this book (I use sticky-notes as my marginalia - they act like little bookmarks for quickly finding a subject, I find notes distracting upon re-reading a book, they allow me to revise my notes easily as I refine my understanding, and at any rate, this was a public library book, so I couldn't write in it even if I wanted to). I got a lot out of it!So why am I giving it just three stars? That doesn't seem fair!Well, a non-fiction book can have tons of great information and still fall short of being great book. A fiction book can also have great characters and ideas and still fail as a story.I think my criticisms are most easily addressed by looking at some of the chapter titles:* 2. The Power of Forgetting* 3. Breaking Good Habits* 5. The Hidden Value of Ignorance* 6. The Upside of Distraction* 7. Quitting Before You're Ahead* 8. Being Mixed Up* 9. Learning Without ThinkingThese are clearly written to titillate. They sound counter-intuitive and exciting and - best of all - they sound like shortcuts to hard work! But by shooting for excitement and aiming to please, the titles end up being somewhat inaccurate or possibly misleading (""The Hidden Value of Ignorance"" comes to mind). Worse, in trying to make the text match the chapter title, the conclusions get all muddled. ""The Upside of Distraction"" underplayed the real instigator of powerful problem solving: the preceding deep concentration. The mixed message in ""Breaking Good Habits"" was befuddling at best! If this were the only book on this subject, I would highly recommend reading it (carefully). But I'm part way into ""Make it Stick"" published the same year (2014) and I'm impressed with it. I certainly won't go as far as to say it's better without finishing it, but it's looking good."
19,0812993888,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2133142-patrik,4,"Carey's ""How We Learn"" challenges our traditional views of learning by discussing the experimental results from the science of learning. The book is thus very similar to ""Make It Stick"" by Brown et al. In my opinion, Carey's book is more readable but not quite as useful and informative as ""Make It Stick.""Our traditional views about memorization, studying, and learning tend to focus on making learning easy: study in the same location, develop a study ritual, reduce distractions, then read, take notes, and reread. The science of learning, as discussed by Carey, seems focused on making learning ""difficult"" in the sense that our brain needs a challenge in order to pay attention, see relationships, and make connections. Carey gives a brief introduction to the biology of memory and learning. This introduction provides the foundation for his suggestions for how to improve our ability to learn, without increasing the time devoted to such learning. His six main suggestions are:1. Vary the environment in which learning occurs. An optimal study environment needs contextual cues to facilitate retention, to multiply the number of perceptions connected to a given memory. By varying the location, the time, the background music, etc. we can increase the number of such contextual cues.2. Distribute your available study time. It is much better to space your study our over several hours, days, and weeks, rather than studying in one single sitting. Incorporate spaced review into your learning strategy.3. Avoid the illusion of knowledge (fluency). Re-reading material gives us the impression of fluency, everything makes sense and seems easy, but this practice does not significantly add to our learning. Instead, make sure that your brain has to work by introducing testing. By asking our brains to retrieve the information, the brain makes more and stronger connections between our neurons (= learning). Consider testing as studying because it is.4. Solving difficult problems often require a break. When getting stuck on a problem it is best to take a break, the distraction (""incubation"") allows the brain to make new connections that may spur creativity. 5. Start projects early. Unfinished projects primes the brain to find relevant information all around (""percolation""). 6. Practice and repetition is important, but mix it up. Interleaving, mixing related but distinct material during study, aids comprehension. Interleaving prompts the brain to process information more deeply.Carey discusses additional topics (chunking, perceptual learning, etc.) but these six points are most helpful when trying to improve our learning, and the learning of our students and children."

Findings that you can apply to how you work and learn stuff were at most one paragraph per chapter. Thinking that the book advertises it self as a how-to ""unlock our brains potential"" it vastly underdelivers on that promise. It could be better stated as a ""tour of what researchers do in the last 40 years which you might want to apply"".After reading the first 65 pages, book ended in Sutton Station's exchange library from which I got a 60s pulp science fiction item which I am sure I will enjoy more.After some feedback on the review the bitter part of myself decided to suggest this alternative title: ""How We Learn: Through away this book and buy one which will help you unlock your brain's potential (paperback)"""

25,0812993888,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81647049-roman-kozakov,4,"This book provides an insightful explanation of the principle processes that enable us to learn. The text describes everything for each process from its initial discovery to recent studies that qualitatively and quantitatively express the impact of that process in enabling learning. Each chapter describes an underlying learning process that many may take for granted. However, Benedict does a great job in diving into each of these processes and unveiling each by providing an in-depth analysis supported by practical examples and studies. He provides the reader with a descriptive picture of how exactly that process interfaces with learning as well as how they can effectively incorporate that process in their own life to support learning."
26,0812993888,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2680940-varun,4,"As the sub-title mentions, the ideas preferred in the book is in fact surprising and goes against the conventional wisdom in learning that we have grown up with. Turning too many ideas on its head, through a mixture of cognitive research, social science experiments and philosophical detours Mr Carey presents a cogent and quite persuasive picture of how we can adapt ourselves to learn consistently and most efficiently while keeping our eyes and ears open for that cherished moments of creative dawning. It's a work that smacks in the face of the cohort that believes that hard work and hard work alone lets you learn and understand things. In some ways, the 10,000 hours theory lies squarely on the opposite spectrum of what Mr. Carey convincingly sets out to portray. There are plenty of terminologies that have been in existence in the science of learning. Many, such as the Perceptual Learning Model or Interleaving have come up more in modern times as research around them have established their advantage over their more orthodox peers. Deliberate procrastination lets your ideas incubate and percolate to bring out more creative and tangential learning outcomes. Sleeping at various hours (night-shift theory), or burning the candle at the right end of it can let you master different learning statements better. Perceptual learning lets you learn without thinking and makes the extrapolatory learnings faster. A REM sleep lets you bring out abstract associations, that which we cannot do while being up and about. Sleep, in effect, becomes a consolidator of learnings whereby the brain synthesizes its learnings from the day and tones down the neurons it deems to be noises merely. One of the most important learning that I could relate to personally was the phenomena of pre-testing and self-quizzing and how effective it is in helping us learn faster. In effect, relying on our ignorance to push the brain into its depths. How about a pre-final exam before you have even sat down for your first class in the course? Mr. Carey suggests that students pick up the concepts in the pre-test much more effectively and retain it much longer. There are, in effect, two dimensions of how brain functions - the storage element and the retrieval function. Both are essential but we have to make sure we understand how we use them to better manage our brain. Brain Management, it seems, is a concept that's going to come up more often as we get to know more about this curious and without doubt the most sophisticated piece of machinery every seen by man. "
27,0812993888,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8759510-steven,4,"www.thebookfeed.blogspot.com4.5 StarsTo be honest, I've been looking for a book like this for a while. Not too long ago, I started reading “Thinking Fast and Slow”, but it couldn’t hold my attention long enough for me to finish it. I’ll admit, there were spots in this book that were a bit dry, but overall it was packed full of knowledge that was truly interesting. For instance, I really like how the author included a few brain teasers, as well as some truly bizarre brain experiments (splitting the brain, removing the hippocampus, etc…). By the way, I felt absolutely horrible for the poor guy with no hippocampus. Not sure what a hippocampus is? Read this book :P!One thing I really liked about this book, was the fact that it affirmed notations I’ve often thought true, but were unable to scientifically backup, as well as supported advice I’ve heard throughout the years. For instance, there really is a science behind taking a break when you’re stumped on a problem, instead of attempting to just power through. Also, who would have known that forgetting is actually helpful? It turns out, that forgetting is the brains way of employing a spam filter, which allows the most important or relevanant information to stay available. Also interesting was the “Forget to Learn” theory, which basically stated that when information is stored, it’s never truly lost, but simply governed by the strength of the storage and retrieval ability that’s linked with that specific memory. Even more interesting, if not partially embarrassing, were the moments that I’ve personally experienced. For example, the false sense of fluency and/or misplaced confidence when prepping for a test, only to realize on test day that you don’t know half as much as you thought you did.One thing that really stands out about this book, is the simple fact that it was written to be applicable to daily life. Unlike other books I’ve read, which were jammed with scientific terminology and theory, “How We Learn” was written for the everyday reader. This book provides you with tips to help you with studying and recall, which actually go against what we hear today. For instance, take the nap, study with music, and change up your study location/time. "
28,0812993888,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3007401-biblio-files-takingadayoff,5,"How We Learn is almost a how-to book about what to do to learn better and faster. It turns out we're doing it all wrong.Benedict Carey is a science reporter, and so he has experience taking complex or incomplete scientific concepts and making them crystal clear to the general public. Since we really still don't know much about how the brain works, that is, how it forms memories and recalls facts for instance, we're stuck with trial and error for the time being. Carey points to many interesting, but mostly inconclusive experiments done in university psychology classes on willing 19-year-olds. Are 19-year-old college students representative of the population as a whole? In any case, much of the information makes you think ""Yes! That's why I learn better when I break up my study sessions"" or ""Yes! That's why I figure out a tough problem when I stop thinking about it or better yet, sleep on it.""Counter-intuitively, Carey says we should vary our study habits, study in different places, at different times, with music or in a crowded coffee shop if we like. Study for short periods with lots of short breaks. Take a nap. Take lots of quizzes and try to test yourself as you learn something new. Mix up your study routine. By the end, you come away with the impression that the brain is like a restless eight-year-old, very curious, but easily bored, requiring new and different stimuli to keep it interested. Humor it, Carey says, and you'll learn better. There's an appendix at the end that lists the ways to get the most out of learning, and I wish it had been at the beginning of the book as well. I think you could get all of the main points of the book just from the appendix, but I'll bet that you'll still read the book to find out the theory and science behind the advice.

29,0812993888,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5466966-jonathan-biddle,5,"Excellent book that surveys the research over the last few centuries on how we learn and retain what we learn. The best part is that the information is actionable, whether you're just trying to expand the horizons of what you know or whether you are in academia. ""This much is clear: The mixing of items, skills, or concepts during practice, over the longer term, seems to help us not only see the distinctions between them but also to achieve a clearer grasp of each one individually. The hardest part is abandoning our primal faith in repetition.""""About the only thing we can control is how we learn. The science tells us that doing a little here, a little there, fitting our work into the pockets of the day is not some symptom of eroding “concentration,” the cultural anxiety du jour. It’s spaced study, when done as described in this book, and it results in more efficient, deeper learning, not less. The science gives us a breath of open air, the freeing sensation that we’re not crazy just because we can’t devote every hour to laser-focused practice. Learning is a restless exercise and that restlessness applies not only to the timing of study sessions but also to their content, i.e., the value of mixing up old and new material in a single sitting."""
30,0812993888,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17480837-mary,2,"This is a kind of a gloss of some research on learning and memory and kind of what seems to be the author's desire to reinforce some of his own learning and memory beliefs and behaviors. There are very brief footnotes, very limited current research sources, and I wasn't convinced of his conclusions. It's a very easy read if you don't want to get too deeply into the topic. Carey has degrees in math and journalism, not in science, and I think that lack of background shows itself in this book. For example, in ""The Spacing Out"" chapter, Carey concludes that it's better to study small bits at a time rather than ""cram."" His proof, as far as the book indicates, is one study a guy did of his family, a website that teaches memory, and a 2008 study done by a Psychologist at San Diego. I have no idea if Carey's conclusion is valid or not but his evidence does little to convince me. I might have found it more compelling if it had been presented more as an exploratory article and not ""the surprising truth about when, where and why it happens"" (quoted from the cover of the book). There are thought provoking nuggets in this book that could be helpful for individuals and seem to be worth a try in some cases; truths, not so much."

37,0812993888,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13013580-jose-fuentes,1,Nothing new here. The book can be summarized in about 10 bullet points. Yet another self help book disguised as science. 
38,0812993888,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15639925-t-nu-vahtra,4,"As several other reviews also mention that this is not just a book of optimal learning principles and techniques but rather an overview of the overview of the history of improving understanding about what works better. Focus is rather on general principles and misconceptions that have been disproved by scientific tests. In general I did not get any completely new ideas from this book and had heard about all of them before but it is a good summary/collection nevertheless. The key principles can easily get lost during the ""history lesson"", but fortunately they are briefly summed up during the last chapter:1. Forgetting actually helps you learn. This is the “Forget to Learn” theory. When we forget something, then try remember it again (“retrieval”), the memory then becomes stronger. Forgetting is critical to the learning of new skills and the preservation of old ones.2. We perform better on exams when we are in the same state of mind as when we studied. People remember more of what they studied when they return to that same study environment. Since we can’t always predict the context in which we will need to perform, we can help our studying and memory by varying the environment where we study. The traditional advice to establish a strict practice routine is not advisable. On the contrary: Try another room altogether. Another time of day. Switch cafes. Each alteration further enriches the skills rehearsed, making them sharper and more accessible for longer.3. People learn and remember more when they space their study time instead of concentrating it. This is called “distributed learning” or “the spacing effect.” The spacing effect is especially useful for memorizing new material. Studying a new concept right after you learn it doesn’t deepen the memory much, if at all. Studying it an hour later, or a day later, does. Cramming works fine in a pinch but doesn’t last. Spacing does. 4. The “fluency illusion” is the belief that because facts are easy to remember RIGHT NOW, they will remain that way tomorrow or the next day. It’s one of the reasons students will bomb a test they thought they would have aced. The best way to overcome this illusion is to consistently engage in self-testing. Instead of memorizing a poem by reading it 20 times, read it ten times, constantly trying to recite it from memory as you go. Testing yourself as you go amplifies the value of your study time. 5. Pre-testing is also an important study tool. Even if you bomb a test on Day 1 of a class, that experience alters how you subsequently take in the material during the rest of the semester. On some kinds of tests, especially multiple choice, we learn from answering incorrectly—especially if given the correct answer soon afterwards. Guessing wrong increases a person’s likelihood of answering correctly on a later test. The act of guessing itself engages your mind in a more demanding way than straight memorization, deepening the imprint of the correct answer.6. Many teachers have said you don’t really know a topic until you have to teach it yourself, until you have to make it clear to someone else. One effective study method is to explain the material either to yourself or to someone you know. 7. The mind works on problems “off-line,” subconsciously, when we’re not aware it’s happening. Sometimes, when we are stuck on a problem requiring insight, distractions can be a valuable weapon rather than a hindrance. However, people do not benefit from such an “incubation break” unless they have first reached an IMPASSE. Knock off and play a videogame too soon and you get nothing. Creative leaps often come during downtown that follows a period of immersion in a story or topic, and they often come piecemeal, not in any particular order, and in varying size and importance. 8. Interruptions are helpful to learning. Interrupting yourself when absorbed in an assignment extends its life in memory and pushes it to the top of your mental to do list. And once a goal is top of mind, we are more focused on accomplishing it. 9. Just starting on a project gives that project the weight of a goal, even if the actual work performed is minimal. We should start work on large projects as soon as possible, without the psychological burden of feeling like the project needs to be completed in one sitting. It’s OK to stop when we get stuck, with the confidence that we are not “quitting” but initiating a percolation period. Quitting before you’re ahead doesn’t actually put a project to sleep, it keeps it awake. 10. Varying your practice and studies, known as “interleaving,” is more effective than concentrating on one skill or subject at a time, because it forces us to be able to adjust and think quicker on the fly. Constant repetition alone is less useful. Mixing up practice with different tasks forces people to make continual adjustments, building a general dexterity that sharpens each specific skill. All that adjusting during mixed practice also enhances our ability to perform each skill regardless of context. Also, since tests themselves are mixed sets of problems, it helps to make homework the same. 11. Over time and with practice, your brain develops “perceptual intuition,” the ability to detect minute differences in sights, sounds, or textures. The brain takes these tiny differences it has detected between similar looking signals and uses those to help decipher new, previously unseen material. Perceptual learning is happening all the time, automatically, and subconsciously. 12. Sleeping improves retention and comprehension of what was studied the day before. What happens during sleep, according to recent theory, is that you open the aperture of memory and are able to see the bigger picture. There is evidence that REM sleep is a creative memory domain, where you build different associations and combine things in different ways. Sleep also improves pattern recognition, creative problem solving, and muscle/motor memory. Napping also provides slow wave deep sleep and REM sleep.

Then again, ""The more I discovered about it, the stronger the urge to do something bigger than a news story"" (185). I actually get this. I actually understand something so powerfully welling up inside that it has to have a vent. This book exudes Carey's enthusiasm for this subject.But he goes on to spell out his objective a little more clearly, ""It dawned on me that all these scientists, toiling in obscurity, were producing a body of work that was more than interesting or illuminating or groundbreaking. It was practical..."" (185) I get this too.I work in Special Education and much of the work that I do involves the day in, day out, routine building type of consistency that drives me nuts. I need the mix up. I need the frenzied action that comes with chaos. Oh, sure, I have lesson plans and I try very hard to follow them. But maybe there is something to the idea that going through a day without distractions, a day full of routine, a day without ever taking a break is not the best way to learn.Or maybe it's like writing a book review: so that when I get stuck with what to say next, I should just stop, re-read what I've written or take a video game break, and start again later. I used to do this when I was preaching full-time: maybe I had writer's block, maybe I couldn't get the transition to work smoothly to the next point, or maybe there appeared to be no coherence between the introduction and conclusion. I would just stop. I hadn't read a study that suggested doing so was a healthy idea, I just did it. I'd put it away and forget about it...sometimes not even bothering to finish until Sunday mornings...sometimes not finishing until I actually stepped into the pulpit to preach the sermon.I remember learning to read Koine Greek this way. I would practice my vocabulary words until I learned them and then use them in class and in translating, but when it came to test time, I would break out the cards again. It was helpful, to me at least, to create space between study sessions. There's also the idea of 'spacing' which I found to be an especially helpful idea--particularly as it relates to how I teach in my classroom. Regrettably, we spend a lot of time with word lists in education--especially sight (or high-frequency words) words which are the words we use most in our conversations and reading. Maybe what I hadn't considered is how environment does affect student learning. We always say that behavior is environmental, but suppose learning is too. This would explain (in part, at least) why students--especially special education students--find it so terribly difficult to generalize skills learned in one environment to another--whether related to behavior or academics.What I like about this book is that it confirmed that I am not an oddball because certain things worked for me. A quiet setting never worked for me when it came to studying (cf. p 11). I prefer to study in a place where there is activity and action; chaos and confusion. I like the distractions. I like to sit in the middle of the living room with a television or radio playing in the background. I like to study in different places--and at different times. I like to mess with the schedule--and I like to do that for my students as well. I love scrapping the lesson plans, no matter how beautifully written, and challenge the students with a game or hands-on task (cf. p 52). I was especially happy to learn that 'forgetting' is as important to learning as 'remembering' is. Maybe this book isn't so much about the way we learn as it is about the way we teach. Interestingly, much of what I read in the book seems to correlate wonderfully what I have been learning over the last two years about formative instructional practices. (Teachers who read this will understand what I mean without my having to give a dissertation here as space precludes such a lesson.) Knowing ahead of time that 'testing' is important for learning as mere studying is was enlightening. One of the hardest things I have found in my own classroom is getting students to buy into the idea that we don't have to get everything correct. I did this just today when I was giving my students a pre-test on simple subtraction facts and one of my students complained, ""I don't know what to do."" I kept telling him that it didn't matter; just guess. Write down some numbers. Practice. Try. ""...guessing wrongly increases a person's likelihood of nailing that question, or a related one, on a later test"" (89). But we are born and bred on the notion that we must get it right. (I think chapter 5, The Hidden Value of Ignorance: The Many Dimensions of Testing was my favorite chapter because it was the most practical.)I enjoyed this book. It was readable. It was fun (the author includes a lot of samples in the book so the reader can practice the theories being written about.) There were helpful charts and illustrations scattered throughout the book. It was an interesting tour through some of the history of learning that I hadn't read about in graduate school. Some of the names were familiar, but as he notes, these scientists who have pioneered these studies in how memory works worked in relative obscurity. So unless you are on the cutting edge of this research it is likely you haven't heard of many of these men and women. I applaud the author for bringing them to the popular reader. Carey makes their stories readable and enjoyable.This book will be helpful, in my opinion, for teachers who want to do a little experimentation to see if some of these theories are true in practice. But for the armchair psychologist (as well as the expert), this is a good place to begin a study of how we learn. It's a fun read, but it's not light. It is challenging at times; nevertheless, I think Carey did a great job of parsing out much of the nomenclature for his readers and making this work accessible to a larger audience.I'll let him close my review: ""Learning is hard. Thinking is hard. It's as exhausting, though in a different way, as physical labor and wears most of us down at a similar rate"" (p 176). Maybe something we should do is simply let our students take a nap every now and then.5/5--an excellent volume and contribution to our understanding of how we learn and, conversely, how we teach.PS-even though I received an ARC (which I don't get to keep), I will be purchasing this book so that I can do a little more research and enjoy the book at a deeper level."

We're chained down to a chair and desk, gulping down forced information in preschool, then high school, our careers, parenting, and eventually every area of life. Before it can even feel new and exciting, we're expected to rote memorize any new learning territory perfectly without any flaws. Does that sound fun? It never has to me. How We Learn helps you take learning back for yourself and own your style of doing it, even those tendencies that have been mostly criticized by academia. Distraction, taking breaks, forgetting things, rotating subjects, listening to music or other noise, and switching up study environments all come into play in this book. You can actually enhance your learning by allowing these so-called bad habits to exist, and beyond that you can even use these habits to your advantage. Learn better, instead of just harder. But this book's not only about test-taking and homework. Whether you're an athlete, artist, musician, writer, parent, teacher, student, doctor, or any other walk of life, this book will enrich the magic of learning for you. It's one of the most inspiring and fun nonfiction books I've ever read, and you can put it to use in your life right away. Discover learning all over again!"

I'm not shouting from the rooftop or anything, but it did provide some useful tips and insights into learning. The ""fluency illusion,"" reminded me that to truly learn, it needs to be active. Passive rehearsal, review, re-reading, is not only often a waste of time, but creates a false sense of confidence, too- an automaticity that is dependent on narrow, concrete parameters. When in doubt, quiz yourself. Test yourself. Get it wrong. And when you do, be in a different location/context. Change it up. Ensure the learning is independent of your comfort zone, not the result of it. This book also reinforced some of my own habits. Although it seems counterintuitive, take a break when you're on a roll. Don't necessarily wait until you're stuck. Start early and give it time to percolate so you can revisit it with a fresh outlook. Naps are always ok. Honestly, take more naps. "

It is something else altogether, sensitive to mood, to timing, to circadian rhythms, as well as to location, environment. It registers far more than we’re conscious of and often adds previously unnoticed details when revisiting a memory or learned fact. It works hard at night, during sleep, searching for hidden links and deeper significance in the day’s events. It has a strong preference for meaning over randomness, and finds nonsense offensive.

Carey writes in an often repetitive manner, and sometimes his theory is reinforced by a humorous resurfacing jealousy of others' innate ability to digest and process faster than he (p. 209):""Learning is hard. Thinking is hard. It's as exhausting, though in a different way, as physical labor and wears most of us down at a similar rate. Yes, some people can spend fourteen hours a day doing grueling mental work and then relax by solving puzzles or attending poetry readings by some Eastern European exile. Good for them.""Regardless, he illuminates a lot of interesting strategy and recent scientific research on the ""interleaving"" aspects of the brain and how we learn, which can lead to a valuable evolution in the structure of education and self-learning. ""The point is not that concentration doesn't exist, or isn't important. It's that it doesn't necessarily look or feel like we've been told it does. Concentration may, in fact, include any number of breaks, diversions and random thoughts. That's why many of the techniques described in this book might seem unusual at first, or out of step with what we're told to expect."" (p. 217)Via this book, I have learned our ""foraging brain"" has been primed over thousands of years of evolution, towards perceptual learning and percolation (interruptions of conscious, deliberate thought to make way for subconscious marination). I wonder how the hunters think, though? I wonder how in an increasingly frenetic and fast-paced world, with all our collective knowledge at our fingertips on our keyboards, how the brain will evolve to absorb information. It seems it could become more efficient at filtering useful from non-useful information during our waking hours, thus reducing the amount of necessary REM and NREM sleep. This takes increasing utilization of all mental faculties of the brain, including regions which process emotion. It seems then, that the trick to adaptation boils down to a rational awareness of one's self, including one's emotional matrice and context.""The persistent, annoying, amusing, ear-scratching present is the space we want to occupy...this book...will bring you more in tune with the beautiful, if eccentric, learning machine that is your brain. Let go of what you feel you should be doing, all that repetitive, over scheduled, driven, focused ritual. Let go, and watch how the presumed enemies of learning - ignorance, distraction, interruption, restlessness, even quitting - can work in your favor."" (p. 222)This is a controversial statement, particularly for societies which build themselves upon structure, rigor and discipline. I myself do not entirely agree with it. Discipline is useful when it pushes us to expand beyond our limits; to test ourselves and become, more, better, fuller versions of ourselves and contributions to society. But discipline, both individually and collectively, may be at its worst, a form of inertia. Discipline can often mask over fear of the unknown, fear of revolution; fear of pushing oneself where you, or society, fears to go."

The subtitle of the book is the ""surprising truth"" but not much of it was all that surprising to me. But that's an unfair assessment of Carey's book when I think about it. Many of his examples came from the practice of writers who as Carey mentions are prolific in their writing about memory and focus. Also, I've been teaching for sixteen years. So, it should be pretty difficult to surprise me in a discussion of how we learn. Yet, Carey does. There were some things I hadn't known or thought of in the right way, and it also serves to refresh our memories about what works because we all know that we get caught up in the work we do and sometimes forget to pause from time to time to look at how we've designed that work for ourselves and for our students. What surprised me? The idea that quitting work in the middle of something is better for memory than finishing something because unfinished work gets queued up for completion, a problem yet to solve. I believe Hemingway would be clucking his tongue right now at his intuition on this matter. The idea that the more environments in which we study a thing the better our retention is because of the tie between less conscious sense perceptions and memory storage and retrieval. What I mostly took away from reading this book though is that students need to read it and every teacher should infuse some of these strategies into their teaching because these are the tools that empower kids to see the ability to learn as strategic, not random. And I mean give them the strategies and let them develop their own tools. For instance, instead of teaching how to analyze a literary passage from some acronym that some textbook company came up with to help them remember the steps of analysis, why not give kids the steps and have them come up with an acronym? Why not give them some readings on the connection between sleep and learning and have them keep a sleep log for a week and talk about it? It's very easy to get focused on content/assessment and forget that our kids don't necessarily know how to learn. The IB/top-achieving kids at our school seem to be experiencing a stress crisis. The anxiety and depression rates are up. Kids are vocal and crabby. Partly this is a cultural thing. It is cool to be stressed because that is what IB kids do. The work hard and are super stressed about working hard. But they are working so hard so inefficiently in many cases. They are cramming (won't retain it after the test). They are sleep deprived. And, so on. But who is teaching these kids how to learn? Why do we assume they know just because they've worked hard and done well? I digress. Point is--How We Learn was a welcome reminder to me that there is a place for learning strategy in every class. I'm glad I read it. "

Through lots of trial and error, I've only managed to learn how to struggle through my papers - sailing through them is but a pipe dream.So this book excited me. If it can give me a hint as to how to study more effectively, then I'm all for it. And yes, I've tried the mind-maps thing - for some reason, they don't work very well for me.This book is divided into four parts. Here's a quick summary and my thoughts on the four parts:Part 1: On memory and learning. This is a quick introduction to neuroscience, and how it relates to learning. Not many techniques here, but it was an interesting read.Part 2: How your learning environment affects you, how to effectively space your study sessions and are practice tests any good? This is where the book gets interesting. I learnt that changing your environment may help you learn (good thing I found one alternative study spot, so I alternate between that and my home). It's too late to practice the timed study sessions, but I realised that the reason why I enjoy Indonesian classes is because the study method I use utilises Space Repitition System, which makes it fun and effective. And as for practice tests, well, now I need to go find some practice tests to do.Part 3: Distraction, Stopping mid-way and Block practice vs Mixed (interleaving) practice. I found the Distraction and Stop Early chapters to be interesting, and the distraction chapter, in particular, was comforting. It makes me less stressed to know that a break every now and then is actually helpful. The blocked practice thing was something that I actually learned from psychology last year. It's a good reminder to actually carry it out (for golf perhaps?)Part 4: Perceptual learning and the relation between sleep and learning. Perceptual learning is interesting, and if it's true, then I need to find a way to familiarise myself with the different types of questions, and fast. And sleep as a learning aid? Sign me up!To be honest, I'm not sure why the four parts are grouped the way they are. I don't see the link, so if you do, please let me know!All in all, this is a fantastic book. I learnt a lot, and have a lot more ways that I can use when learning.

The best place I can think of to get you to understand that memorization and learning often benefit from counter-intuitive approach is the book How We Learn, by Benedict Carey. He takes us through much of the recent research and in so doing provides a compelling story of how the brain functions and how we can use this knowledge to gain understanding at a higher level. The book contains fun thought problems, lots of samples and passages to prove how memorization work most effectively Another common assumption is that the best way to master a particular skill— say, long division or playing a musical scale —is by devoting a block of time to repetitively practicing just that. Wrong again. Studies find that the brain picks up patterns more efficiently when presented with a mixed bag of related tasks than when it’s force-fed just one, no matter the age of the student or the subject area, whether Italian phrases or chemical bonds.… In short, it is not that there is a right way and wrong way to learn. It’s that there are different strategies, each uniquely suited to capturing a particular type of information. A good hunter tailors the trap to the prey.Carey, Benedict (2014-09-09). How We Learn: The Surprising Truth About When, Where, and Why It Happens . Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. I should mention, however, that the book provides a great deal of data to demonstrate that testing, from day 1 in a class, helps student to remember. ""In a review paper published in 2006, he and Karpicke analyzed a century’s worth of experiments, on all types of retention strategies (like spacing, repeated study, and context), and showed that the testing effect has been there all along, a strong, consistent “contaminant,” slowing down forgetting.""In an Orwellian moment, Carey has to explain that researchers who have this data have had to change the name of testing to “retrieval practice.”The reason? There are so many educators who think testing is the enemy that they have to employ a euphemism like this in hopes that their solutions to some problems in education won’t get shelved out of hand. My guess is that you would feel much better after having read this book."

The neocortex, the thin outer layer is the seat of human consciousness. It contains the tools capable of re-creating all our earlier memories.The brain then can find the memory and bring it back to life instantaneously. Understanding how we retrieve a memory is useful, but the author writes about zooming out to look at the entire person (living organism). Our memories are not filed away as in a computer but are embedded and intertwined and nothing is lost, just altered for the good.Learning laboratories go way back in time. Ebbinghaus did his experiments in the 1880s. English teacher philip Boswood Ballard administered memory tests to children in the early 1900s in London.Benedict Carey suggested 3 stsanzas of a Longfellow poem for the reader to memorize and check ourselves after having a coffee or a litle break.

How do we break good habits?How to stay conscious-revisiting the location under the same conditions where you studied - the music, colour of the walls, etcHe claims that the background music weaves itself subconsciously into the fabric of stored memory.Contextual cues and study aids enhance remembering as well as breaking up one's study time. In other words, take a break - do something else and then get back to your study or memorizing.We actually create Mental Models to include our new learning into what we already know. The brain simply wants more and more so feed it with information, hence elaborating and enhancing its capacity. ""The Power of forgetting"" -- Any memory has two strenths, a storage strength and a retrieval strength.  Storage strength builds up steadily with studying and more sharply with use. The multiplication table is a good example, the author says. Storage strength can increase but not decrease, according to Bjorks' theory. Aha--- The brain holds on to what is relevant. More than 99% of experience is fleeting: here and gone.I must add that Joseph Murphy's book ""The Power of the Subconscious Mind"" , enters my thoughts whenever I start thinking about the brain.

57,0812993888,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2270881-ken-rideout,4,"The author/reporter takes a somewhat meandering tour of the studies that have been made about which techniques of acquiring new skills or information work best. Often counter intuitive and illuminating to me as a teacher (as I often hear students and parents complain about what is demonstrably a better learning environment because they feel oppositely), the book makes a few points that are valuable to everyone:-The Fluency Illusion (""But I studied so hard for that test and knew everything!""): If you do a lot of classic review: reread, highlight, quick recitation of basic facts in one big sitting, then you are likely to feel prepared when you are not. This kind of one-shot, passive review is not the best way to get stuff into your noggin. (although the cram session the night before does help in the short term with recall related items, it does not help with problem solving & understanding).-Mix it up: Do not study in an extended, focused way in a quiet environment. Rather, break your study sessions into shorter sessions extended over several days and do them in different environments with different types of distractors. The more different types of contexts and the more times you've had to retrieve and use a memory, the easier it is to access later.-Sleep is important: Early, deep sleep stages seem to be most helpful in laying down fact-related memory. Late stage sleep stages seem most useful in creativity, impasse-breaking issues. -Interleaving material and pretesting seem to be most efficient at getting the memories being laid down to be easily retrievable (the best way to increase recall is to retrieve the memory many times). Even physically skilled practice should be broken up so you are not just concentrating on one one skill at a time. Interestingly, focused practice or study feels most effective and gives greater apparent short term gain, but performance testing shows that interleaving works better (Interleaving is more like the real thing the author suggests). Likewise, taking tests (even without any background knowledge) and getting immediate feedback is the quickest, surest route to learn new facts.-Start early and take many breaks. The brain continues to work on stuff off-line and ideas/connections percolate up from your subconscious during the off times. A four star read for me as a teacher who sees these issues all the time, but perhaps a 3 star read overall as it ultimately promises more than it delivers."
58,0812993888,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38699225-lisa,5,"This book is right up my alley. Both my mom and my grandma were teachers and I started teaching when I was 19, as a bilingual teacher's aide in Santa Cruz, CA. Most of my adult life I have been thinking about learning and teaching in one form or another. Currently, I work with adult English as a Second Language students. Recently there has been an explosion of information on the science of learning, and this book is one of many new releases that discusses this new research. (Another good one is Barbara Oakley's ""A Mind for Numbers"".) I gave this book 5 stars because I really enjoyed his writing style and the ease with which, and excitement he has, in explaining the latest research about what aids learning, some of which may surprise you. It isn't just a repeat of some of the other information I have read. There is some new stuff in here.While it is easy enough to pick up the book, skim it and get the basic ideas about what helps learning, it is worth reading more in-depth to understand the history of the research and how scientists have discovered just how these techniques help us. As I watch my own three children grow and learn, I can see that their interaction with modern media has not harmed their learning, but rather has enhanced it in many ways (Chapter 6: The Upside of Distraction: The Role of Incubation in Problem Solving). I am also happy to know that our eclectic approach to homeschooling/unschooling has served them as well (Chapter 8: Being Mixed Up: Interleaving as an Aid to Comprehension). The big takeaway from this book for me is to not fear a daytime nap (or feel guilty about it), as it can really be helpful in consolidating learning, especially for people like me who do a lot of thinking and academic-style work. I used to think it was a sign of laziness, but now I see how important sleep is, and it doesn't all have to happen just at night (Chapter 10: You Snooze, You Win: The Consolidating Role of Sleep).This book would be an interesting read for anybody who wants to know more about what current research says regarding the brain and learning, and some specific techniques you can incorporate into your day to enhance your learning ability: parents, teachers, students and pretty much anybody who is trying to pick up a new skill.
