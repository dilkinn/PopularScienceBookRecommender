How can you hear the subject matter of this book and not be fascinated? David Toomey opens Weird Life exactly where I would expect—with extremophiles. Extremophiles are some of the most unusual and extraordinary creatures in all of biology. Which makes sense, because life = biology. Right?That’s what I thought, but clearly that’s due to a massive failure of imagination on my part. One the most impressive things about Toomey’s book are the sheer breadth, depth, and scope of what is covered. Toomey starts with biology—microbiology, exobiology, marine biology, synthetic biology, molecular biology, astrobiology, evolutionary biology. That, friends, is the mere tip of the iceberg. Toomey touches on disciplines and theories including: organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, interstellar chemistry, molecular chemistry, biochemistry, nuclear chemistry, geology, genetics, robotics, computer science, mathematics, theoretical physics, particle physics, quantum physics, astrophysics, string theory, nanotechnology, multiverses, astrology, botany, taxonomy, engineering, ecology, epistemology, psychology, and philosophy. If that’s not enough, there’s even a chapter on weird life in science fiction! This book is thorough, that’s all I’m saying. There’s a reason for this:“The attentive reader may have noticed that ideas for the weirdest sorts of weird life did not originate with biologists or even, for that matter, with astrobiologists. They came from scholars and practitioners in other fields. The hypotheses of life in other universes were formulated by theoretical physicists (Harnik, Kribs, and Perez; and Jaffe, Jenkins, and Kimchi). Ideas of life in the vicinity of black holes and the atmospheres of white dwarf stars were conceived by astrophysicists (Adams and Laughlin). Hypotheses of life surviving through eternity were developed by a mathematician and theoretical physicist (Dyson), who also supplied us with what may be the broadest definition of life so far. Of the many ideas of weird organisms from science fiction, two that are notably well grounded in science are from a physicist turned aerospace engineer (Forward) and from a professional astronomer (Hoyle). Even the relatively conservative hypothesis of hydrogen-breathing dirigibles was proposed by a physicist (Saltpeter) and a planetary scientist turned astrobiologist (Sagan).”So… there’s some smart stuff in this book. Do not be intimidated! I’m incredibly uneducated, and I had no difficulty reading Weird Life from cover to cover. My mind was occasionally blown—but always in a good way. And if you need a little reminder on the difference between a mesophile and a methanogen, please be aware that there’s a glossary at the back of the book between the text and the endnotes, but before the very thorough bibliography. This book covers science that is being done right up to the minute. At least three times a variation on the phrase “as we go to press” was used. This science is emergent and so very, very fascinating. Here’s a good example, arising from our lack of understanding of what comets are made of:“Being mostly solid bodies, comets resist interferometry. In 2003, it occurred to Allamandola and his colleague Doug Hudgins that there was another way. If they could make a comet from scratch, they could study it. They took a sample chamber called a “cosmic ice simulation chamber,” removed most of its atmosphere, and froze what was left to a temperature near absolute zero, thus making the inside of the chamber a fair representation of deep space. They introduced into the chamber a few simple molecules that might be found in a star’s outflow, and turned on a lamp (representing nearby stars) that bathed the molecules in ultraviolet radiation. Then they waited. They were not expecting much, and they were certainly not expecting what happened. The molecules combined, split, and recombined, and before long the chamber contained some very complex molecules, many of which were prebiotic.”Is your mind blown? Maybe it’s just me. But I couldn’t put this book down. My only minor disappointment is that there weren’t more photos and illustrations, but I guess it’s hard to fault an author for not including images of hypothetical things that may or may not exist. Toomey did pretty well, all things considered.Life, in all its colors and flavors, is amazing. Mr. Toomey has reminded me of that fact. This was the most enjoyable science book I have read in quite a few years. My mind and ideas have been expanded, quite painlessly. So let’s, as Mr. Toomey suggests, allow our imaginations free reign."
1,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda,3,"""In recent years, scientists at the frontiers of biology have hypothesized the existence of life-forms that can only be called “weird”: organisms that live off acid rather than water, microbes that thrive at temperatures and pressure levels so extreme that their cellular structures should break down, perhaps even organisms that reproduce without DNA. The search for these strange life-forms spans the universe, from rock surfaces in the American southwest and hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor to Martian permafrost, the ammonia oceans of Jupiter’s moons, the hydrogen-rich atmospheres of giant planets, the exotic ices on comets, the crusts of neutron stars, and the vast reaches of space itself. David Toomey brings us into the world of the researchers who have devoted their careers to “weird life,” and as they envision and discover ever stranger organisms here on earth, they open up fascinating possibilities for the discovery of life in the rest of the universe.""An interesting little volume, mapping out what to look for with regards to exotic life forms. The search is on, to see if an organism on Earth can be found that doesn't come from the same evolutionary line that has produced all the known plants, animals, fungi, and microbes. There's a strong possibility that in some remote [and awful] part of our Earth, some weird life exists.Toomey also explores non-Earth locations for weird life, including the rest of our solar system, artificial life, and planets outside our galaxy that include liquids + a source of energy. He really covers all the bases.There is also some worry that Earth space craft will contaminate other planets with our microbes, something that I just heard a radio interview about last weekend. One scientist is taking a census of the bacteria, fungi, etc. that survive on the objects that we will hurl into space so that we will have some idea of which ones may show up later on Mars, Europa, or wherever. Wouldn't it be dreadful to wipe out the biota of another planet by introducing a pathogenic bacteria?As far as I could tell, this was a good summary of the available thinking on this field."
2,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5368477-daniel-roy,2,"I hate it when I really, really want to like a book, and it just doesn't let me. I should have loved this one: it's all about ""weird"" life that is theoretically distinct from our own, and it talks about everything from the shadow biosphere to SETI and the anthropic principle. This is one of my pet obsessions, and one of the big reasons I read SF in the first place. Exotic life! Alternate forms of intelligence! Alien civilizations!Except that a book about weird life is, by definition, gonna talk mostly about what we don't know. We haven't found any such thing, even though everyone in the astrobiology community is all excited about Titan and the underground oceans of Europa. The sad fact remains, we haven't found a single microbe on Mars yet, so there's not much to report on.As a result, the book wanders back and forth between vignettes on the scientists at the forefront of the search for ""weird life,"" explorations of the biochemical principles behind life, and puzzling flights of fancy about the various forms life might take out there in the Universe. This book made me dream a little, but it didn't leave me with any lasting impression. It didn't suggest a venue of hope, nor did it enlighten me about the world of astrobiology.And so, I must conclude that Weird Life is a big miss on a very dear subject of mine. There's just a certain lack of audacity to this one. There's no deep pondering of what ""intelligence"" means, no true exploration of the various definitions of Life. The whole thing feels very sketchy, and the book might have benefited from focusing on a specific aspect of its wide topic, whether it's discussions of the shadow biosphere, the search for extremophiles, or the search for life in the Solar System and beyond.Many parts of the book feel as if the author chose certain points of view carefully to suggest the possibility of weird life to the reader. We mostly get the sides of those who argue that weird life exists, and the whole debate around this very important and fascinating question is never truly broached. The chapter on science fiction depictions of weird life was particularly frustrating. There is no discussion on how science fiction informs science research on the meaning of life; just an enumeration of very random and little-known SF works featuring some alien biology or another.Which brings me to the core of my gripe with this book: the point it's clumsily trying to make has been explored in much more elegant ways by science fiction. There are great SF books out there that talk about the meaning of intelligence and life, and that will blow your mind much more efficiently than this book. Check out Stanislaw Lem's Solaris, or the amazing Blindsight by Peter Watts. Those books are real trips, and they articulate their points in a much more rigorous and nuanced manner than Weird Life. Weirdly enough."
3,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10762842-nicole-r,3,"Brian Greene light when I was expecting David Attenborough.Before I get into why this book wasn't what I thought it was going to be, let me explain what it was. It was a very well-written and concise explanation of the possibility of - and search for - extraterrestrial life. Or, better described, weird life. Life that doesn't even closely resemble any kind of life here. We're talking silicon instead of carbon, methane instead of oxygen, and maybe even two-up quark hydrogens (I know! Getting crazy!)We start with extremophiles on Earth - deep sea black smokers, hypersaline lakes, and steaming gysers - and I was all jazzed up and smiling while I read. Alvin? Yes. Deep sea vents? Yes. Ice algae? YES! But we quickly leave the comforts of home for discussions of Saturns moons, red dwarf stars, advanced organic chemistry, quarks, and multiverse string theory. Oh, and SETI. Which makes me think of the movie Contact. Which makes me think of Carl Sagan....and Matthew McConaughey. Both pluses.Toomey walks us through the what, where, when, why, and how of current scientific thought on probable weird life. Some of the facts are truly astonishing and my mind is always blown when I try and wrap my brain around the extent of our universe.But, it wasn't what I was expecting at all. I don't know why, but I was expecting a biology book. Weird life here on Earth and how it freaking rocks while David Attenborough's British accent echoed in my mind. Instead what I got was Brian Greene with two Splenda's and splash of nonfat milk to make it go down smoother. And I think Greene is a-maz-ing. But when I want to read about complex physics, I will pick up Greene and commit myself to pencil, paper, and abacus.This book massively suffered due to my own misguided expectation. And my (quite honest) lack of interest in the search for extraterrestrial life. I love astronomy. I love physics. Astrophysics is a double bonus. But, theoretical explorations of the chemical and physical likelihoods of evolving life on every planet, moon, and comet is not my favorite topic. So, while the book was interesting overall and the first chapter had me literally drooling with excitement, it took a downturn when I realized that it was not what I thought it was. It suffered from unrealistic expectations.In related news, that last part could describe every relationship I have ever been in.....so maybe it is more biology than I thought! lol."
4,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/801667-kyla,5,"Here's the thing; if you're a bit of a science nerd, you're going to love this book. If you're not, you probably won't. The good news is that Toomey is an outstanding writer, making detailed concepts of theoretical physics, astrobiology, chemistry and other hard sciences understandable for a general audience. If you like to play with the What Ifs and How Comes of some of life's big questions, you'll enjoy Weird Life very much. Starting with the ""weird life"" we know about - the creatures that live in places they shouldn't, like frozen ammonia and the lightless, high pressure bottom of the deepest trench in the ocean floor, then moving out to what life might be found on other planets, in other galaxies, Toomey opens a door for the reader to see into some of the more interesting, innovative and important thoughts in play in the world of theoretical and applied science today. A little funny in spots, a little scary in others, but fascinating from start to finish, I recommend it for everyone the least bit interested in, literally, life, the universe and everything."
5,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67391227-john-sgammato,4,"This book was just what I was hoping it would be - thought-provoking and full of things that I didn't already know. This is not a fanciful book about bug-eyed monsters from outer space; it's mostly about chemistry and biology and planetary geology. I was amazed at the enormous potential for life at very, very, very cold temperatures and high pressures. He starts with Earthly extremophiles to show just how peculiar life can be on our own planet, and then defines ""weird life"" as having different chemistry altogether. He describes what energy sources and gradients some alien ecosystems might be based on and then shows how and where we might find them in our own solar system. "
6,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2241304-p-t,4,"A good read, especially for scientists. It stresses the need for different scientific disciplines to understand each other, in order to better discover what the very limits of possibility within each discipline are. In this case, poking at the limits of life makes for an interesting read. It can be a bit dry and speculative, but when you define weird life as something that hasn’t even been proven to exist yet, there’s only so much you can do."
7,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8284707-louisa,4,"The mystery of the origins of life is one that I have been trying to wrap my head around for many years. We've learned in biology class that all life on earth originated from a single ancestor that existed billions of years ago. All known lifeforms today are similar on a molecular level (DNA), and this suggests a common origin. This explanation always left me with plenty of questions. Was the transition to life from non-living matter just that one time, one place occurrence, or have there been multiple abiogenesis events? I find it hard to accept that life emerged so soon after conditions for it were right (almost immediately after the earth's crust solidified) and never again afterwards. But if there was a second abiogenesis that gave birth to other forms of life, why haven't we found evidence of it?So I was happy to find this book, hoping that it would shine some light on this mystery. Toomey describes ""weird life"" mainly in terms of what it's not: it's life that took a different evolutionary path, originated from a different ancestor, resulting in organisms that are fundamentally different from those we know. He takes us on a quest through the universe to find this weird life: to planets and moons in our solar system and to places beyond. For me, the first few chapters that deal with ""weird life"" here on Earth were the most interesting. To the question why we haven't found any evidence of life that does not originate from our last universal common ancestor (LUCA), the book offers a few explanations.Even if it originated from a different ancestor, argues Toomey, this weird life may have grown so similar to life as we know it that it has become indistinguishable. Organisms that have evolved along entirely different evolutionary lines have developed eyesight in a surprisingly similar manner. Toomey mentions the eyes of octopi as an example, which developed independently from the eyes of us vertebrates, and yet seem so similar. Because of this tendency of different evolutionary lines to converge, we may not be able to identify weird life when we see it.Another reason why we haven't found it yet is because it could be very small. The cells of living organisms have to be of a certain size, the lower limit being set by ribosomes, the relatively large molecules of proteins that work inside all cells to link amino acids and make new proteins. So when we find traces of organisms of just a few nanometers across, it isn't even recognised as life. Nanoparticles, says Toomey, fall into a disciplinary no-man’s-land between chemistry and biology.And the more I read in Weird Life, the more I realise how much we don't know. There's something called desert varnish, a thin, shiny coating on rocks that Charles Darwin found on the shores near San Salvador. It has been found elsewhere, too, but nobody has been able to establish what kind of organic material it consists of, or whether it's alive at all.Desert varnish is a candidate for weird lifeThere could be life on Titan, Saturn's largest moon, or on Jupiter's moon Europa. Or perhaps on comets and asteroids, or even, Toomey speculates, on stars. But so far, our little blue planet is the only place we know of that is able to support life, and it's all DNA based, apparently from that same original ancestor we all have in common. Toomey admits in the Epilogue that no one has discovered an example of weird life, and that it’s possible that no one ever will. This book, then, is a little something to whet our curiosity, an invitation to look further, to go out and explore. Just don't expect to find many answers here."
8,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24564242-ben-mcfarland,3,"Books are fascinating windows into people. Take Weird Life, for example. The author is interested in the biology and physics, and in presenting a bunch of ideas, not tearing them down. On the Myers-Briggs J vs. P metric this book is clearly a Perceiving ""P"" not a Judging ""J."" This has an important place in the ecosystem of scientific information, and it was a very entertaining book in its sheer diversity of ideas. In this book, David Toomey describes all forms of life in the weirdest settings possible. He essentially starts with the tube worms at hydrothermal vents, which seem as weird as it gets, but wait, it gets weirder from there. At the same time, the book ventures out away from biology and toward physics, when usually you start with the physics. It becomes more and more speculative and (to this biochemist) less and less relevant as it goes on. Toomey deserves a lot of credit for describing some weird physics very well, like certain aspects of multiverse theory, better than any other book I've read. The biochemistry, on the other hand, is something I'd want much more of, but is not part of this book, reasonably so. Pretty much, this book starts with fascinating biological observations and then jumps to multiverse physics without much of the chemistry inbetween, at least at the level I would like. So I am happy to provide the chemist's perspective on this some day, I'm sure! Weird Life does a nice job of cataloguing the biology and physics. I think I could be a lot more critical of some of the weird ideas here, and I found a few inaccuracies, but that's not really the point of a book like this. This book is a list of possibilities, and who knows, maybe some of them work. I hold out more hope for the first half of the book ""working"" than the second half, which gets into infinity paradoxes that, as a chemist, I think are closer to sophistry than to convincing arguments. But that's just one chapter at the end. This book is worth a read just for the discussion of Titan, that too is done better than any other treatment I've seen. Makes me want to go there, right now, where's the bus? This was a fun book and enjoyable. Let's hope there's more material for another Weird Life book in a decade or two. "
9,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1074042-amanda,1,"I thought this book was going to be along the lines of Carl Zimmer's  Parasite Rex, an exploration of the weird life like those extremophiles living in those crazy sea vents. So I picked it up and started reading and then I realized that it was supposed to be a history of the scientific discovery of the weird organisms like those extremophiles.Then i finished the second chapter and realized it wasn't that either. This is my biggest problem with the book, that it didn't seem cohesive and focused. Somewhere around chapter 3, it became more about how scientists have theorized different forms of life, but not in a very compelling way full of anecdotes about the scientist behind the theory or in a call to action kind of way, urging you to think of different ways life has come and could come to be.There are some flashes of an engaging and fun style here and there that tells me that David Toomey could be a great science communicator, but overall I was bored and confused and wishing this book was something other than what it was, never a good sign."
10,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105482-ari,3,"All known life on earth has essentially the same base biochemistry -- proteins are built out of amino acids by ribosomes, based on genetic instructions stored as DNA in a specific code. There's enough arbitrariness in the code that it we are basically certain all known life had a universal common ancestor. This book discusses life that does not come from that ancestry. This includes extraterrestrial life, but also the possibility of a shadow biosphere on earth, the possibility of life not based on biology at all, and other, even more speculative possibilities. The book is clear and well written, with a good apparatus of notes. However, there are places where the author's lack of technical background shows. On page 135, he says ""white dwarf atmosphere gain what heat they have by collision with particles of dark matter"" -- a claim I'm pretty sure is nonsense. Also, it's a bit rambly -- I enjoyed each of the chapters but they are more in the nature of a set of linked essays than a really coherent overarching narrative."
11,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59682834-jerry-pogan,5,"This book is not at all what I was expecting when I started to read it. The title is a little misleading because I was expecting to read something about known weird life like extremophiles (which it does discuss) and other strange creatures. However, it goes into far more areas of discussion than that and is much more interesting because of it. From trying to define life (which we can't really do) to how life could actually start and the ingredients needed, even a little bit of physics and cosmology and going so far as to include a little science fiction. A very entertaining and wildly wide ranging discussion of anything related to life makes this an excellent read."
12,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5948865-james,3,Enjoyed the walk into the weird life and what really constitutes weird. Enjoyed the examples of looking at life on other planets and the forms they could take contradictory to our own. Best one was the example of cloud based life that someone wrote a book on. 
13,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8942085-nicholas-alfonso-diaz,5,"Loved everything about this book. Going into it, I knew nothing about bacteria, single-celled algae, and extremophiles. Interesting, and insightful on where life might exist on earth and on other worlds."
14,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26850008-nick-blood,4,"I read this book in two sittings, about 4 months apart, so it may not be the most accurate recollection. Writing style and accessibility:The first thing to say about Toomey's writing is that it's clear and concise, while being colorful and imaginative enough to keep you turning the pages. Couple that with the interesting (to me) subject matter, and it was easy to burn through this book when I had the time to sit down and do so. It wasn't too demanding of prior knowledge, and with only a high school level of chemistry, biology and astronomy I was able to get through the book without too much sidetracking into Wikipedia articles and the like. What I wanted to get out of the book:I'm not a scientist and approached this book more from the perspective of an amateur sci-fi writer, so the things I wanted to get out of it were perhaps different than other potential readers. I wanted to be inspired by ideas that had some basis in science. I wanted to also be able to draw on the knowledge in the book to build sci-fi worlds and characters that were more accurate than the usual depiction of ""aliens"" in sci-fi. From my perspective, the book provided a fascinating scientific grounding for science fiction ideas. There was even a chapter dedicated to portrayals of weird life in science fiction, which I appreciated. However...That chapter - which was perhaps the most important one to me - felt like his weakest. He skimmed only a few fictional works and assessed them only in a very superficial way. I felt like much more could have been said in the way of advice for authors who want to tackle the job of writing about alien life. That said, the rest of the book provides a solid grounding in current (and historical) scientifically accurate thinking about weird life, and so it implicitly advises potential writers about good ways to proceed. I found that I drew more writing ideas and inspiration from the rest of the book than the chapter specifically dedicated to sci-fi writing!The opening - Extremophiles, normal life, and life on other planets:The chapters progress in a clear and logical manner. Toomey starts with the most familiar and concrete kind of weird life: the organisms we already know exist on Earth. These are the extremophiles and include organisms that live near super-heated hydro-thermal vents under the ocean, in the mesosphere high above the planet's surface, in alkali lakes, volcanic magma and so on. Although not weird life themselves, they are sufficiently different from regular organisms that they can provide a good gateway into hypotheses about what true weird life might be like. From there, he talks about definitions of regular life, and what constitutes ""normal"" life. This is an important part and I appreciate his efforts in defining the normal standard, because it serves as an important tool when we start to imagine what weird life might be like. As an example, he establishes that normal life is carbon-based, uses water as a resource, and developed/evolved in an environment rich with oxygen. With these definitions in mind, it's easier to understand how exactly silicon-based life is fundamentally different and ""weird"", by comparison, or how organisms that lived in methane-rich environments might be very different from our own. As the book progresses, we eventually leave Earth and start to consider life on very different planets both within our solar system and even further abroad. He looks at the possibilities for life on the surfaces of very hot and very cold planets, on planets with different chemicals available for biological metabolism, and even above and below the surfaces (deep in the planet's crust, or high above in the atmosphere where the conditions for life may be possible). All throughout, Toomey injects the theories with examples found on Earth that are not so different, and in doing so provides a solid basis for the speculation. Similarly, he often provides some background to each idea and the scientist who proposed it, which helps again to ground the theories in some reality. You get the impression as you go along that even though much of the subject matter is speculative, it is all based in well-established science. The end chapters - Simulated life, machine life, SETI, sci-fi, and parallel universes:The final chapters dramatically widen the scope of the book and show the breadth of Toomey's thinking on weird life. They are perhaps some of the more intriguing and ""out there"" chapters, since they are decidedly much further out on the speculative branch of the tree and look much further into the future, or into the cosmos, than previous theories. His discussions on simulated and machine life are particularly good and I think he is to be commended for the way he handled this part of the book. Having spent the previous hundred of so pages talking about strictly biological life, he provides an interest twist by opening up the possibility (perhaps the inevitability) of machine-based life - what we'd call A.I. In a theory that borrows heavily from futurist Ray Kurzwil, Toomey discusses the trend in human history towards machine-based systems and the seeming inevitability that at some point in the future we will no longer be biological creatures and instead become machines. In a chapter that deals with SETI and its own takes on weird, extraterrestrial life, he talks about the concept of machine life and lays out the case for it being highly probable that if SETI does hear from some aliens in the sky, they will not be biological. He does this by pointing out to the grand scale of cosmic evolution. It took billions of years for planets to form, and only a fraction of that time for intelligent life to evolve on them. It is therefore unlikely that two intelligent civilizations would both evolve at the same time, in order to send each other messages (the kind that SETI would receive). It therefore stands to reason that any civilization still out there and transmitting messages would be highly advanced, and non-biological. In all of this fascinating conjecture, it's clear that Toomey's speculations about weird life is much grander in scope than just what a silicon-based life form might be like. His broad view is commendable, and at its best, absolutely engrossing to think about. Having not quite fully exploded the scope, however, he turns one of his final chapters to weirder life still: that which might exist in parallel universes. Although some of this conjecture comes off the rails a little bit, I still found the core ideas quite fascinating. Toomey has to do quite a bit of explanatory legwork in this chapter to first explain the basic ideas behind parallel universes. With a basic framework established, he then proceeds to imagine in very broad strokes, what life might be like in universes where things are different in the most fundamental of ways. As an example, he begins by pointing out something we assume essential for life in our universe - we often say that if a proton had a slightly different weight, life here would be impossible. He then shows that current science has hypothesized a universe where protons with slightly increased weight would still be possible. They wouldn't be able to synthesize the organic compounds we consider essential for life, but they would be able to create other compounds that could, feasibly, serve as the basis for an alien biology. Another example is even more extreme. Even if planets and suns couldn't form in a given universe, the argument goes, there is still the potential for life that exists in the interstellar medium, in dust clouds of enormous size that contain countless tiny dust grains, each with small amounts of chemicals clinging to them. Collectively these can form a kind of drifting, floating bio-chemical cloud in which evolution could occur and intelligence may even arise. Without suns for energy, they would look elsewhere (and the book previously provides many examples of organisms happily drawing energy from very unexpected sources). By the time I'd turned the last page, my ideas of ""weird life"" had well and truly expanded! For that the book has been tremendously valuable. Conclusion:I've no doubt left things out, and my review is a bit scatter-shot, but hopefully it paints a picture of the scope of discussion in this book, if nothing else. I think that's Toomey's real strength here. He manages to drill into a substantial level of detail at each point, and yet still had ample room to keep expanding the discussion outward until we are well and truly in the domain of the weirdest life imaginable. If you're looking to expand your thinking about life, and if you have an interest in space and cosmology, this book will likely give you plenty to think about and be inspired by. "
15,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5219456-megan,3,"This would be a useful book for anyone planning to write science fiction.I picked this up because I thought it would be about extremophiles. It isn't- extremophiles are only examined at the very beginning of this book. The author's main idea seems to be that, up until a few decades ago, creatures that could thrive in below-freezing and superheated environments were science fiction. Now that we know they are fact, what other fictional life forms might actually exist? How should that affect our search for extra-terrestrial life?The book progresses further and further away from reality. From extremophiles, we proceed to life that can survive in sulfuric acid and methane-rich environments that exist in our solar system, like Saturn's moon, Titan. No such life has been discovered, but it is plausible enough that space agencies want to send probes to look.Next is silicon-based life and robotic sentience, and then we get to really speculative stuff like life in universes with different physics, virtual life, and life in higher and lower dimensions.As you might expect, the farther you go from existing life, the more the author relies on examples in science fiction versus actual science. This didn't really bother me because A) these fictional ideas are highly creative (and not completely impossible), and B) the book is short, so it just briefly explores these ideas without taking them too seriously and veering into pseudoscience.If you're looking for dense, hard science, this isn't a good choice. If you're looking for a philosophical study of the definition of life, look elsewhere.

I found my attention wondering as author David Toomey got more and more theoretical as the book progressed, but still found it worth reading. It is amazing to think just how much we don't know. From the book:""The Census of Marine Life, a decade-long project to make a comprehensive tally of life in Earth's oceans, found 5,000 previously unknown species, including an animal that lives without oxygen, several species believed to be extinct since the Jurassic period, and 600-year-old tube worms. ... Of species still undiscovered, it is possible that some are quite large. As recently as the mid-1990s, scientists were astonished to discover a 200-pound animal inhabiting the mountains shared by Vietnam and Laos. It looks part antelope and part cow but, now classified as the only member of the genus Pseudoryx, is neither."""
17,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26397915-jzthompson,3,"I thought this was going to be about 'extremophiles,' those bits of the natural world that thrive in places too hot or too cold or dark or acidic for conventional life. It was actually about the entierely theoretical possibility of life with no common ancestry with anything we're aware of - e.g. life that might be based on silicon or arsenic instead of carbon or water.This way Interesting in parts, but too esoteric to be satisfying on the whole. The turn towards theoretical physics in the later chapters felt really speculative, and honestly a bit mystic, to me. If anything the chapters on the 'multiverse' and SETI really came across as delusional wishful thinking by physicists, leaving me rather sceptical about the possibility of life on other worlds Probably most use to a SF writer looking to mine 'out there' ideas. Not much use or interest to anyone whose focus is on the environment or the natural world"
18,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7822818-aaron,3,"This was a pretty good intro to life as we know it to prepare you to consider the possibility of life wildly different from ours. This book explores the possibility of different forms of life from the planetary crust up through ocean vents to land, atmosphere, comets, and other dimensions(!), through cutting edge science to speculative science fiction. It's mostly focused on the microbial because that appears to be the bulk of life and its beginnings, but has a cool section on intelligent life which could have been more thoroughly explored."
19,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2690074-jorg,3,"For such a short book, this one covers a lot of ground: from extremophiles to the ultimate-ensemble multiverse and beyond. The treatment is light and readable and does not shy away from purely speculative and science-fictional aspects of the subject. A good intro to a rather narrow subset of astrobiological problems that covers a bit of introductory physics, astrophysics and cosmology as well."

It's crazy to realise how much we don't know about life right now so I'm excited to see what will follow.

If you are truly interested in the possibility and chemistry of methane and ammonia based life on Europa or Titan, and love to read the names of all the scientists working on every project done in the last twenty years or so, then this is the book for you. But not me. "
22,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1767089-karen,4,"This was a *fascinating* read. It's basically about the search for life *not* as we know it-- creatures that exist wholly outside of our own evolutionary chain or what we know as ""familiar"" life (some of which isn't so familiar). The book moves from the unusual (creatures that don't quite fit into the classifications we're used to), to life as we have only recently come to know it (the extremophiles that thrive in conditions on Earth that we (humans) previously believed could not sustain life), to actual (as-yet-undiscovered) ""weird"" life-- *truly* alien life forms that might be based on a chemistry utterly different from Earth's organic life. (And btw, there IS a very useful glossary in the back.)Roughly the first third of the book discusses the problems of defining ""life"" (harder than you'd think), the false assumptions that hampered and limited scientists' discoveries of unusual (but still ""familiar"") life forms in the past, and how some out-of-the-box thinkers and surprise discoveries broke through those assumptions. To me, this was the strongest part of the book, and the part I learned the most from (including an entire taxonomic kingdom that didn't exist when I was in school). The array of life that shares a planet with us-- including some that share a BODY with us-- is really mind-boggling. A fungus that lives INSIDE the water core of Chernobyl's nuclear reactor? Bacteria that thrive deep under the Earth's crust? Microbes that chow down on arsenic? Microscopic critters that can live in SPACE? HELL, YEAH. All these and more, including the amazing stories of their discovery. The author's particularly skilled at personalizing the scientists that study these critter, really making their motivations and excitement and frustrations come alive for the reader.The next third talks about the search for life outside of our planet, and here's where things start getting more technical. The author talks about the attempt to pin down what really basic requirements for life *are,* so that (given the SIZE of the universe) we might narrow down our search to places where life could definitively exist. *Are* there outer limits of temperature, radiation, and chemistry? If so, what are they? How do we avoid falling into the same traps that prevented us from recognizing extreme ""familiar"" life on our OWN planet? From there, we get into the problems of how to recognize life once we've found it, particularly given that most of the exploration and experimenting will be carried out by machines over planetary distances. What do we look for? How do we look? How do we test for various forms of life (particularly extremophiles) without accidentally killing it? (And if we do accidentally kill it, would we recognize that the remains were once alive?) There's a lot of discussion here of NASA's various programs (the Office of Life Sciences, SETI, etc.) and a bit of the politicking behind them, and a discussion of what types of experiments are currently aboard our existing probes. (A big part of the problem is that our current probes are all set to test for *familiar* life, and might miss weird life entirely.) He also talks about the planets and moons in our own solar system that might be good candidates for weird life, and where scientists would REALLY like to start looking first (and why they're not).The last third of the book (which I admit I skimmed, since by this point I was really struggling to follow the flights of scientific theory) gets highly theoretical, speculating about types of life as proposed in science fiction and life as it might exist outside the traditional universe (quantum physics comes into play).As I said above, I enjoyed the concrete portions of this book a lot more than the theoretical ones. The edges of our known universe were plenty fascinating enough, and I would have liked to have spent more time on that. (And I did, browsing the 'net for more on extremophiles.) The theoretical half of the book isn't exactly weaker-- the science is VERY strong and convincing, and a lot of the concepts he talks about are pretty darn exciting. But the reader runs up against exactly the same problem the scientists themselves are having-- how do you think about something that's totally and completely outside the wheelhouse of everything you know and understand? The problem is that we *haven't* discovered weird life yet, and so the author is stuck with trying to describe and quantify the utter unknown. It really does give you an idea of the struggles scientists face in discovering weird life, but it makes for some pretty difficult reading, conceptually.This book is MOST DEFINITELY worth the read for as much as you can get through. If you enjoy learning about new things, this book has that IN SPADES. (Seriously, I ran out of adjectives for ""amazing"" in trying to describe it.) But fair warning to layfolk-- depending on how much scientific background you have, the second half of the book gets into some pretty advanced concepts, and might be a real slog. My advice is to work through as much as you can, and then skip to the epilogue for the author's conclusions. Even if you can't finish it, you will NOT regret reading it."

28,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89339670-jessica-kuzmier,3,"	The origins of life hold a great deal of fascination for many, be they philosophers, scientists or just an average person looking up at the stars contemplating, ‘how did we all get this way, anyway?’	David Toomey’s ‘Weird Life’ is an entire book that explores the possibilities of not only the origins of life, but what unusual branches and roads it may have taken once it all started. As a general science writer, Toomey gives a good overview of not only everyday life forms in an oxygen atmosphere, but those with unusual biochemical needs for methane such as thermophiles and hydrothermophiles. His style reminded me of popular science writer Carl Sagan, with clear and concise writing that is literate, vivid and explanatory enough for the lay person to get a general grasp on what could be complicated scientific theories and observations.	I enjoyed the first half of the book a great deal, but was disappointed in its final half. Toomey goes from science fact to listing in what feels like minute detail various speculative theories of science fiction. I knew this was coming from the intro chapters, but didn’t think it would be taking up as much room in the book as it did. I hoped that at least it would have contained more scientific speculations about alternate foundations for life such as silicon. Instead I was treated to literary comparisons of fictional screenplays and novels, and what might be happening in the multiverse. Toomey all too briefly gets into discussing the SETI program, possible life forms on comets, and other extraterrestrial bodies such as Triton and Titan. The fictional commentary randomly interspersed with astrobiological theories felt disorganized. In the end, the book started to lose steam for me.	All in all and despite its flaws,‘Weird Life’ is a decent general science book, and I did enjoy Toomey’s writing style. I was satisfied with the epilogue, which wrapped up the work nicely. If you are a science reader, this is a book you probably will find to your liking, and overall I found it satisfactory. "
29,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28204661-dan-falk,4,"If you spend even a modest chunk of your day glued to social media websites, you’ll have seen links to a site called “WTF evolution?” There, you can scroll through a parade of bizarre creatures, from to the goblin shark (which resembles a fierce undersea unicorn) to the geoduck (a burrowing clam that looks a like an amputated finger) to the aptly named blobfish. They’re peculiar, all right – but they’re not as strange as the creatures David Toomey is on the hunt for in Weird Life.In fact, such creatures aren’t even “weird,” according to Toomey’s (very precise) definition. That’s because, as odd as they may seem, they’re still our cousins, genetically speaking. The same goes for the creatures inhabiting places where, just a few decades ago, we wouldn’t have imagined that life could take hold at all – places like the hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor, or the interior of the Antarctic ice cap.All of these organisms, no matter how exotic, are thought to have descended from a common ancestor, a particular arrangement of chemicals that eventually managed to self-replicate, some 3.5 to 4 billion years ago. The key molecule is DNA, which encodes the genetic instructions for each organism. But other chemicals could also, in theory, self-replicate, and non-DNA-based organisms, if they exist, would be one example of weird life. Alternatively, an organism could build proteins out of a different set of amino acids, or make use of a different “solvent” (terrestrial life uses water, but, as Toomey explains, we can imagine organisms that might use ammonia or liquid methane instead).An intriguing variation would be life whose chemical components are mirror-reversed: In every living organism that we know of, the amino acids have a left-handed geometry, and the sugars have a right-handed geometry. There is nothing to rule out life whose key constituents have the opposite handedness (the scientific term is “chirality”). As Toomey points out, such creatures could be living right here on earth, forming a “shadow biosphere” alongside our own. (Here Toomey cites the work of scientist and author Paul Davies, who has worked extensively in this field, and whose own recent book, The Eerie Silence, covered much of the same ground.)The bulk of Weird Life is focused on the prospects of life beyond earth. Within our own solar system, the rocky moons of the giant outer planets hold the most promise. Europa, one of Jupiter’s moons, is a prime candidate: Beneath its frozen surface there may be liquid water, warmed, perhaps, by hydrothermal vents. An equally beguiling world is Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, whose surface is peppered with lakes of liquid methane, some as large as Lake Ontario. Could there be creatures lurking within Titan’s lakes, using methane to facilitate complex chemical reactions, the way terrestrial life exploits water?And what about the vast universe beyond our solar system? Toomey summarizes the half-century quest that goes by the acronym SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. Again, readers who have kept up with Davies’ work will find much of this to be familiar ground; still, Toomey’s account is engaging and provocative. It’s also more up-to-date, with references to the recent controversy over arsenic-based life supposedly found in a California lake, as well as results from the Kepler space telescope, which has identified dozens of possibly earth-like planets beyond our solar system.As thorough as Weird Life is, it still left me wondering about some basic (perhaps simple-minded) questions. For example, what would happen if you grilled up a steak made from a cow-like creature that happened to be made from opposite-handed amino acids and sugars? Would it smell and taste different from a regular steak? Would it be toxic, or simply undigestable?The questions raised by the possibility of weird life are certainly stimulating, but I was also struck by some of the numbers concerning “normal” life, mentioned early in the book. As the author notes, biologists have identified only a tiny fraction of the organisms living here on earth, with as many as 100 million species estimated to be awaiting discovery. These creatures wouldn’t be weird, by Toomey’s definition, but they may still be worth finding. (Adapted from a review I wrote for The Globe and Mail.)"
30,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15651131-last-ranger,5,"A Stranger in the Garden:Are we alone in the universe? What are the ""limits"" of life on Earth? Questions like these have piqued the interest of scientist's for centuries and we are no closer now to finding all the answers then we were when Aristotle first speculated about biological life. In ""Weird Life"" author David Toomey, an English professor who's research interest are in science writing, has written a fascinating summary of our efforts to answer these questions and define the parameters of life. As far as we know, all life on earth is based on DNA and has descended from a LUCA ( last universal common ancestor ), making us all, more or less, related. But what exactly is ""Life As We Know It"" and how would we recognize it if it was ""Life As We Do Not Know It""? For well over a hundred years now men of science have been speculating on what ""non-LUCA life"" would be like and how it would differ from our everyday ""DNA-life"". Practitioners from such varied fields of science as; Theoretical Physics, Astronomy, Biology and all the various combinations of those fields, devote their lives and careers in exploring these ""shadow biospheres"" for the alternate possibilities of life beyond the norm. Starting with an overview of our most familiar life forms and their ecological limits, Toomey moves beyond the fringe of known life to explore ever more hostile realms of extreme temperatures and caustic chemicals. With the discovery of ""extremophiles""; hardy organisms living near deep sea vents, in thermal pools and hypersaline lakes, we learned that life is far more varied than we ever imagined. But even these alien biospheres, as different as they are, contain only our familiar DNA-life. Toomey starts his hunt for weird-life with a look at some Earth bound oddities that might fit the bill. From there he explores other, less likely, abodes of possible, or impossible life. The farther you get into the book, the stranger and more extreme these speculations become. For example; Could life exist if, instead of oxygen, it metabolized methane gas or used ""liquid hydrocarbons"" instead of water for a solvent? Some bizarre microorganism have been shown to survive in the vacuum of space, is it therefore possible that Earth was seeded by life from elsewhere in the cosmos? As humans leave Earth and travel through space to distant world's we'd better be ready for the unexpected. Life could be lurking in places that we least expect it; on gas-giant planets or worlds covered with oceans of ""exotic-liquids"". In his research, Toomey has compiled and read the thoughts and ideas of a wide variety of scientists and thinkers; people like Carl Sagan, Arthur C Clark, Brian Greene and Fred Hoyle are just a few of his sources. Toomey's writing style is engaging and thought provoking with just a hint of humor. Part biology and astronomy, part science-history, ""Weird Life"" explores a little known realm and provides plenty of food for thought. Just keep an open, but skeptical, mind and you may discover a different way of looking at nature, the world, and even the Cosmos. While I had no downloading or technical issues with this Kindle edition there were problems with the ""link system"" that connects you to the Notes: The links to the ""end of chapter"" notes (indicated by an *) work just fine but the links to the ""end of book"" notes (indicated with a number) do not function. This is too bad because there were some interesting things within the note section. This is not so much a Kindle issue as it is a Publisher oversight. Anyway, if you're up for things like ""SETI"" and life beyond the ""Outer Limits"" you may get a kick out of this book. I certainly did.Last Ranger"
31,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27921245-sam,3,"While I appreciate the effort, this book reads more like an extended bibliography than anything informative. Toomey is too far removed the from the subject matter to be able to speak with authority. The ideas are a little thought-provoking, but much of that is tamped down by the arms' length presentation. Even the chapter on science fiction reads like he hasn't actually read any of the books he's listed.I know it's the nature of the beast, but a glaring problem I had with the book was that most of the science Toomey reported on is either completely theoretical, as in never been tested or not even possible to test, or disputed so much as to be nullified. He is completely open about that, but he accurately predicts in his intro that the result will be unsatisfying. I think if he had focused more on current biology, and relied less on other scientists' way-out-there ideas, it would have been better. He could have talked about convergent evolution in current animals, the different types of body materials, plans, and symmetry, etc. He touches on some of this stuff, like the different sorts of bodies that can exist, but it was minimal and he failed to discuss most of it in the context of familiar life. There is an incredible range to the way animals and plants build themselves. There is absolutely not a single sentence dedicated to the nature of consciousness. He treats life like it is only chemistry, which I suppose in the end it is, but it's sort of a depressing outlook on such an incredible phenomenon.It's weird to read a book on Weird Life that's all about hard science without even a little dose of wonder. Besides virtually ignoring known Earth-life, Toomey spends almost no time of his own imagining the kinds of creatures and bodies that would evolve in harsh gravity or an entirely liquid surface. I once heard an opinion that the reason why an intelligent water-dwelling animal could never reach the level of intelligent society humans have is because living in water precludes the ability to manipulate one's environment. Perhaps this is true, but with the well-known tool-use observed in our friendly neighborhood octopus populations over the decades, I highly doubt intelligence is limited by such a low ceiling. These are the kinds of discussions I was hoping to find in Weird Life. There were a few, but rarely with Toomey involving himself the discussion. Rather, he simply expounds on others' ideas while punctuating it with a little ""isn't that interesting?"" One aspect of the book that made it worth reading, was Toomey's emphasis on the vast chasm of stuff that we still don't know. With so many scientific discoveries and advances in the last three centuries, it can be difficult to appreciate as a person of the present that we understand very little of even the most well-researched branches of the natural world. I loved the story about Carl Sagan, who worried that scientists of the Viking mission on Mars would be so busy with their noses buried in the ground looking for life that they might miss it walking around right in front of them.Overall, if you are interested in filling your head with some outlandish ideas based in real science, you may enjoy this book. It is an easy, fast read. At the same time, be aware that the content quality is a little lacking and there are a lot of unexplored avenues. Even with the low rating I gave this book, I would happily read one of Mr. Toomey's other works."
32,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6857911-ryan,4,"Weird Life takes on the question, “what forms can life exist in besides the carbon-based, water-saturated, oxygen-metabolizing, DNA-encoded ones we’re most familiar with?” Which leads to other questions: did life evolve on Earth more than once? Is there a “shadow” evolutionary tree, whose organisms work differently, and perhaps are specially adapted to hostile environments like undersea hot vents? Could there be life elsewhere in the solar system, in the clouds of Jupiter, the methane seas of Titan, under the ice of Europa, or on the high mountain peaks of Venus (where the temperature is relatively cool)? Is hypothetical life elsewhere in the galaxy MORE likely to be on NON-Earthlike planets?My own take-away from this book was that much is still a mystery. The first few chapters, which discuss life that manages to survive in extreme environments on Earth and current theories about biogenesis, make clear that a lot of the knowledge science does have is both recent and somewhat speculative. Indeed, it’s difficult to define exactly what life IS, and what we’ve gotten used to thinking of as fundamental building blocks (cells, nuclei, etc.) might not necessarily be. And perhaps this chauvinism is blinding us as we begin to search other worlds for signs we’re not alone in the universe.Later chapters consider other planets and the SETI program, and I found these the most interesting. Toomey discusses the famous Drake Equation, and its current implications for the distribution of intelligent life in our galaxy. While there are still many unknowns, the Earth itself offers some important clues. For example, most scientists agree that life appeared almost as soon as it was possible. Then it took another billion years for multi-celled life to appear, and another two billion for intelligent life to appear. Unless our planet is a drastic edge case, the implication is that life could arise easily, but intelligent life, not so. Perhaps the last other sentient species in our neighborhood came and went before modern humans ever existed.The last chapters go into more unconventional territory, and consider possibilities like machine intelligence swiftly outpacing biological intelligence, becoming something beyond human comprehension (i.e. the “singularity” concept coined by science fiction writer Vernor Vinge and further popularized by Ray Kurzweil). There’s also some contemplation of what, in the fundamental rules of physics, makes life possible in our universe, and whether it could exist in other universes, operating under somewhat different rules. And might we even be living in some sort of a simulated reality, like The Matrix but more so? If so, what would be the clues?All in all, the topics discussed here represent only a skimming of a wide-ranging body of scientific research and speculation, and more knowledgeable readers might find it light fare, but Weird Life is still a tasty sampler platter."

It does not disappoint.Weird life is defined as being life that does not share a common ancestor with any of the life currently known on Earth. As in, it is life with a completely separate origin story from our own.Toomey starts by asking two primary questions that he will go on to answer in depth in the main body of the book. What can we say about weird life? Also, would we recognize it if we saw it?Toomey answers his two primary questions very well and very thoroughly, using a huge range of material (hard science to imaginative postulating). Weird Life covers a lot of ground in this manner, trading detail on specific scientific hypotheses for accessibility to the reader. The tone is one of curiosity: this is a subject filled with wonder and imagination and does not disappoint on that front.Because of the presence of meta-analyses in early chapters (such as that of the Wolf-Simon paper, which was a paper that claimed to discover evidence of arsenic-utilizing microbes which received derision in the scientific community), I would’ve liked to have seen more such analyses in later chapters. This would’ve been especially enlightening in the chapter on life postulated by science fiction writers. Is there a scientific reaction to such speculations? This could’ve used more elaboration.I would personally recommend Weird Life to anyone interested in the prominent subject matter: astrobiology, unfamiliar organisms in science fiction, biology/biochemistry, and extremophiles. It touches on all of these subjects and relates them to the overall topic in creative, interesting ways and so is a good introduction to all of them for general readers. It relates its material in a fun, easy to understand writing style and is a quick read relative to other nonfiction books, so not a major commitment to anyone looking for some interesting reading material.So, if you want to inject a little wonder into your reading life, I encourage you to pick up Weird Life."
34,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14365792-patricia,4,"Science that sounds like science fiction. In recent years, scientists have hypothesized life-forms that can only be called ""weird"": organisms that live off acid rather than water, microbes that thrive at temperatures and pressure levels so extreme that their cellular structures should break down, perhaps even organisms that reproduce without DNA. Some of these strange life-forms, unrelated to all life we know, might be nearby: on rock surfaces in the American southwest, hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor, or even in our own bodies. Some, stranger still, might live in Martian permafrost, swim in the dark oceans of Jupiter's moons, or survive in the exotic ices on comets. Others - the strangest of all - might inhabit the crusts of neutron stars, interstellar nebulae, or even other spatial dimensions.In Weird Life, David Toomey takes us on a breathtaking tour of a universe of hypothetical life, a universe of life as we do not know it. Weird Life takes on the question, “what forms can life exist in besides the carbon-based, water-saturated, oxygen-metabolizing, DNA-encoded ones we’re most familiar with?” Which leads to other questions: did life evolve on Earth more than once?

35,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5917740-nilesh,4,"Weird Life is a fascinating subject, nearly unexplored at least in popular science books. The book is excellent in the first half when it is mostly explaining and fantasising life forms in environments different from those in which the carbon/water-based life seems to thrive. However, the relatively short book loses the nice base as it veers toward astronomy in the end.The beginning sections on extremophiles are the most impressive when the book introduces the strange and unknown life found in deep oceans, molten lava or in frozen ice. The experience is well used to hypothesise the existence of Silicon-based life or life that has solvents other than water or even a life without any solid substrates. However, the weird goes completely weird once the author confesses almost a theoretical impossibility of defining what we could call ""living"". The discussions in the book remain fascinating but most readers could struggle splitting even what the author does not brand fiction from such. The only solace is that the readers can dream on and create their own examples of weird life in this subject where rules are few and almost everything goes at least as a possibility. From this reviewers, the weird life ideas beyond not discussed in the book are- stars, galaxies or even universes as life forms (they seem to ""grow"", ""die"", evolve, replicate etc)- bacterias or any insects as only 3-D and a small part manifestation of much larger life forms in a far larger dimension or a parallel world. A bit like the nails in the hand-glove fabric world.- why not time or dimensions?Essentially, the absurdities abound when imagination is allowed to run amok and that's where the book suffers despite staying highly engaging throughout."
36,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/180214-ob-jonny,4,"A comprehensive book about life forms living on earth in the most extreme of conditions and about the possible and theoretical life that might exist elsewhere in the universe. After reading this book you will understand bacteria, viruses, and extremophiles which are lifeforms that can survive in the most extreme of conditions. For instance, it's fascinating to learn about life that can survive in water at temperatures well above the boiling point, and about microbes that can survive deep inside the earth. It's pretty amazing how far life on earth has gone to inhabit every possible environment. If there is any open area then life will find a way to live there if possible. The book discusses the myriad of lifeforms within your own body which is kind of trippy. If you have a science background then it's fascinating to learn how life can flourish with a fluid base different than water as their base, like methane or ammonia. The possibility of silicon based lifeforms is discussed with more scientific detail than in the old Star Trek episodes. It's fun to learn about Carl Sagan's research into the possible life forms on Jupiter, Mars, Europa, and other solar bodies. He worked hard to theorize life based on the real science and chemistry about the atmosphere and surfaces of these worlds. He came up with a theoretical biosphere in Jupiter's clouds and huge atmosphere which is thousands of miles thick. Theoretical life on the surfaces of neutron stars or just outside a black hole really stretched the boundaries of imagination, but the argument was that these environments will be stable for trillions of years giving an almost infinite amount of time for life to appear. This would be a great book to get high school students interested in science."

Toomey's style is straightforward rather than lyrical, but very enjoyable. And the book includes so much food for thought! What if there is weird (i.e., non-carbon-based) life already here on earth? How would we know? How would we look for it? What might life based in liquid methane on Titan look like, or life in the atmosphere of Jupiter, or even the atmosphere of a neutron star? What if our present ""universe"" is a simulation (and if we posit enough advanced civilizations capable of creating simulated universes, eventually there are more simulated than real universes, and odds are, we're in a simulation). Utterly fascinating, with that other great thing about any book -- leads on new books to read, including James White's series set in a space-based hospital, ""with patients that include delicate dragonfly-like chlorine breathers, ambulatory vegetables, and armor-plated elephantine beasts that can withstand atmospheric pressures four times that of Earth's at sea level.""

I'm a biology teacher so I did enjoy the earlier chapters on the definitions of life and odd biochemistry the most interesting. Some of the weird life on our own planet surprised me and I found it very intriguing. Later in the book, the author delves into astronomy and astrobiology. Here, the author would have benefited from adding pictures and diagrams of life on other planets. It could start with a hypothetical picture, location, metabolism, waste, and possible biosolvent. That would have clarified the concepts enormously. The science fiction chapter was pretty fun. I'll admit I had to slog through the last chapter which was a detour into quantum physics and multi-verses. Some of it was interesting, but considering they were the most hypothetical and the chapter was fairly long, it could have used some editing. Overall, the book was neat and taught me a lot. It might have benefited from different formatting, but altogether it was worthwhile. "

That being said, if you power-through some of the more ""scientific"" sections (if they prove a bit too detail-oriented for you), you'll find some very interesting and even powerful thoughts and ideas coming to mind. As a long-time fan of science fiction and personal musings on ""What does it mean to be alive? What does it mean to be human?"" this book was right up my alley. One of the challenges the author faced is in bringing a very large and surprisingly disparate subject into one book...not just the search for life unlike what we think of as life in our familiar world (for example, strange bacteria), but to point to possibilities of life beyond the normal ""physical laws"" that we abide by in the universe we know. The author hints at societal and As such, the title might be better as something like: Weird Life: Science and Speculation Reaching Beyond Life as We Know It."
40,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32011156-justin-hickey,4,"The best place to start discussing English professor David Toomey’s speculative smorgasbord, Weird Life, is with the book’s cover. That beautiful, evocatively photographed green fellow certainly looks strange. Yet, those of us familiar with nature films might guess that it’s some form of zooplankton–the larval stage many sea creatures experience. Or perhaps it’s even smaller, originating in the microbial realm invisible to the naked eye. What we definitely won’t guess at first glance is that this creature is something that could live in the vast ammonia clouds of Jupiter.And that is what Toomey means when he suggests searching for “life that is very, very different from our own.” He refers to life that doesn’t use water as a cellular medium, or is built from a different set of amino acids. Ultimately, he searches for life that does not share the ancestry common to everything else living on Earth, including frogs, strawberries, that orange mold in the shower, and you.

41,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2006699-tariq-mahmood,4,"The author has done a pretty commendable job in sufficiently dumbing down a very scientific topic to a novice level. Trouble for me was that I was so far away from any Genesis of life theories that at time I had difficulty picking up the thread but on the positive side I picked up a lot. The book challenges all assumptions and definitions pertaining to life in the Universe and successfully posits the phenomenon of weird life along existing familiar life. I am now open to all forms of life as a result, whether carbon based, silicon based or hydrogen based. Who says science is mundane? Books like these are very important in interconnecting disparate sciences like biology, astronomy etc, not afraid to delve with the imagination. I particularly enjoyed the coverage of science fiction novels and even movies. Credit should be given to the author for mixing up the narrative between the know a and the unknowns so fluidly. Donald Rumsfeld would be a proud man.... "
42,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13222064-eric-wurm,5,"The variety of life on Earth is immense. Some of the species that have lived defy belief, and some of them that still live do the same. Yet, we haven't sufficiently explored our own solar system. Perhaps life once existed on Mars, perhaps it still does on some of the moons that orbit planets in our solar system. Perhaps there is life that does not even meet our definition of life out there somewhere.This book explores some of the many possibilities of where life can exist and how it might survive. This is a book of rigorous scientific examination and imagination. Both of these are required to spur discovery. What is possible, probable, improbable and what we consider impossible come together in this book. If you love mainstream science as well as science at the fringe, this book is for you."
43,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1058994-ryan-mishap,3,"While starting with extremophiles--such as thermal vent loving bacteria--and other examples of life on this planet that live on the ragged edge of possible, this book is mainly concerned with examples of life that don't resemble what we currently think of as life. Think about that. Okay, now you probably realized that this is a speculative work of non-fiction. There's a lot of maybes, ifs, and perhaps going on here but it is still a fascinating look at not only the search for eldritch creatures but at how we define life, the universe, and everything. The last half of the book is long on speculation and thought experiments but also gives a good grounding in modern physics and theories.I might have rated this higher but Toomey's sense of humor didn't really appeal to me. Nothing bad or offensive, just unable to elicit a chuckle when clearly that was the goal."
44,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56877432-charlee,5,"This is truly a thought-provoking compilation of fascinating, interdisciplinary theorems and hypotheses that examine many different examples of potentially weird life, mediums for weird life (like the multiverse), intelligent extraterrestrial life, and more. Somehow, Toomey ties together ideas pertaining to anywhere from the beginning of the universe (and before?) to its end, ranging from black holes to beaches, to simulated worlds, to inside of us...wow. Don't be put off - you don't have to have a PhD in biology or astrophysics to understand Weird Life, but when you close the back cover you certainly feel like you could hold an interesting conversation with someone who does have a PhD in any of those fields. It's a gateway book, too. An introduction to a hypothetical world full of ideas that are only beginning to be explored. "

All of the good stuff--interviews with authors, history of weird life, creative insight into the modern scientific community, & etc. is glossed over early & then we get a lot of stuff on extra terrestrials, string theory, and way out theorizing. I wanted more focus on actual biological creatures that are weird, not theoretically weird things. Insight into the fact that scientists traditionally only find what they are looking for was great, but could have used more examples. The photos and illustrations are very poor--mostly artists drawing potential alien life forms. I do not recommend this at all..."

It is truly imagination-expanding science writing, and one of the best books I've read in 2014. It is cogent, well-researched, and written for a lay audience. Although somewhat esoteric, I found that even as a non-physicist I could understand completely and visualize clearly the amazing and bizarre concepts Toomey explains. Throughout the book, I thought, wouldn't it be great if Toomey published a version of Weird Life for middle school/high school readers! He could simply add some pictures and diagrams to open this amazing text up to younger readers. David Toomey, bring it on! "

It was fascinating to read and to learn about theoretical concepts on a basic level :DI would say that it seems to float around a little, but honestly considering the subject matter and what's currently known about it, I'm pretty sure that's understandable.

49,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3772144-eric-jackson,5,"Fascinating read all around. The first chapters posed a number of different biologies, but never went into great technical detail (I'll be purchasing the text version to get the bibliography) The last few chapters strayed far from biology into those fuzzy realms of quantum mechanics, philosophy and *gasp* science fiction.

However, the later sections (with talk of multiverses, string theory, and so forth) to be really quite distant from the beginning of the book, and the thread that linked the two sections was very thin indeed. I'll need to find another book on extremophiles. "

But this is a book of cursory overviews awkwardly patched together with not much more info on most topics than you would find on Wikipedia.

58,0393071588,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1426051-gevera-bert,3,I was excited to read this book but the reality fell flat. It was too much supposition and what-if. I thought it would be more about life that's already been found instead of getting very science-y over what could be or might be.
