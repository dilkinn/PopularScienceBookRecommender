0,1847921965,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7232207-fiona,3,"I was in Glasgow a couple of months back, and a friend invited me along to a Skeptics in the Pub night - they regularly have interesting people along, at the front of a room beneath a pub, to talk about whatever sciencey or philosophical or what-have-you thing it is they work on. This time, they had a couple of people from the gravitational research group at Glasgow University - and they came along to talk about LIGO. This being about May-ish time 2016, the room was packed and consisted about 50% of physicists. (Many beards. Many pre-formulated questions.)LIGO stands for Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, and I have been low-key obsessed by it since the news came out in February that in September last year, physicists discovered that gravitational waves are a thing that exist in real life, rather than just the realms of theoretical physics. This book is about that discovery, less from the physics end (although Janna Levin is a professor of physics in her own right) than a whole lot of interdepartmental politics. Honestly, I will never complain about trying to get funding for a project again; this stuff is incredible. By the time the story had got as far as the mid-90s, I was breaking out in a cold sweat every other paragraph. It's a fascinating story: interestingly, it looks like it was written largely before the breakthrough in September 2015, because the actual discovery is an epilogue, and the book came out at the end of March. I'm not sure how I feel about that: sure, ride the coattails of the announcement, there's no better time to do that - but I might have preferred a bit more fleshing out of that final chapter, even if it took a few more months for the book to get printed.The thing that stopped it getting All The Stars (because really, if there's anything going to catch my attention, astrophysics and advanced project management are high on that list) is that it didn't really feel like a book. It's written... almost like an overgrown Vice article? which I'm sure is doing it a disservice, what I mean is that it's obviously long-form journalism. It's like an investigative article, but 180 pages of it, with chapters. So this is purely a matter of taste: that either works for you or it doesn't, and I'm afraid it doesn't really for me. Still, there's a shoo-in for the Nobel prize this year, and quite frankly several members of the project sound like they'd be strong contenders for the peace prize too."
1,1847921965,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,4,"This is a rather fascinating personality-centric accounting of post-WWII science that lead to the facilities that currently detect Gravity Waves. The science is there at the core, from the postulations to the amazingly hard-fought politics and accounting that made the whole thing happen.And believe me, it almost didn't happen so many times. Fortunately, it did and a few years ago we had confirmation of real-life Black Holes to celebrate over.Truly, I couldn't be happier. Science needs these kinds of astronomical wins. It was astronomical in the way they pulled it off, too.But wow, the rest of the story reads like a great novel full of difficult personalities, boundless hope, disappointment, and heroism. Kinda like most science. But then, it is a calling. These men and women are truly devoted to the cause despite not always agreeing on the best direction or means to the goal. So did this read like a soap opera full of departmental squabbles, politics, money-wrangling, and even a little madness thrown in?Yep.But that's what makes it so interesting. They did it despite all that. And the project is very healthy now. :) :) Fun read!"
2,1847921965,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51089-jamie,2,"Interesting (and timely) subject, intriguing history, but the chatty, almost gossipy way the book is written does it a disservice. The writing is downright peculiar, overly poetic or nonsensical at times, full of interjections from the author, less like credible journalism and more like a he-said-she-said oral history with whole paragraphs of rambling, unedited quotes and a baffling structure. There are a few reviews saying the physics are on point but the storytelling isn’t; however, I found even the physics were told like a pop culture piece assembled for clickbait instead of a published book on scientific discovery. Ah, well. I’ll still read more about LIGO, and the fool’s errand aspect of the story is an interesting one, no matter how it’s told."
3,1847921965,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22224713-john-gribbin,5,"Here is a version of a review I wrote fir ther Wall St Journal:In February this year scientists announced the detection of a burst of gravitational waves from space. The waves, predicted by Einstein’s general theory of relativity, came from a pair of colliding black holes, each with about 30 times the mass of our Sun, in a galaxy more than a billion light years away. The ripple they produced jiggled the Earth by much less than the diameter of an atom. The astonishing story of how science was able to measure such a tiny effect, at a cost of a few hundred million dollars (which seems modest given the achievement) is told by Janna Levin in this superb new book. Levin is able to tell the tale so soon, and so well, because she has had privileged access to the experiment (known as LIGO, from Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory) and the experimenters for several years, and knew that the first runs were due in September 2015. Like the experimenters, and everyone in the scientific community, she was stunned by the speed with which LIGO has produced results, but was able to squeeze in a brief mention of the news in an Epilogue. Levin is herself a scientist, which explains her privileged access; but more than that she is a writer—a writer with a background in science, rather than a scientist who writes. Her book is less about the nuts and bolts of the science and technology, although it contains enough of that to satisfy our interest in how such measurements can be made, and more about the people, personalities and politics involved in getting such an expensive and long-gestating (four decades and counting) project to fruition. She gives due credit to Joseph Weber, a lone pioneer who built a gravitational wave detector in the sixties and thought he had found something, but was later proved wrong. In spite of this false start, Weber’s example encouraged interest in the possibility of detecting such waves, and stimulated others to take up the challenge. It was Weber who “brought Einstein into the lab.” The contributions and clashes of the three key players in Levin’s story who did take up that challenge are each given comfortable space, and should soon be sharing a Nobel Prize. They are Rainer Weiss, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever, the “troika” who got things moving, both scientifically and politically. The project grew out of a course on relativity theory that Weiss was teaching at MIT, in the early 1970s. His class were intrigued by the idea of gravitational waves – ripples in space – and to entertain them he devised a purely hypothetical idea (a “thought experiment”) for detecting such waves. The idea involved bouncing beams of light of mirrors to create so-called interference patterns. The passage of a gravitational wave through the experiment would change the interference pattern. Then, Weiss decided to try to turn the thought experiment into reality. He was, he said, “going to try to do the most interesting thing I could think of” even though the project, if it succeeded at all, would take decades. It looked as if the effort would fail for lack of funds. But in 1975 Weiss met Thorne, a leading theorist in the field of relativity, and also a leading light at Caltech, who was seeking a partner to work on the search for gravitational waves. It was a marriage made in heaven. The troika was completed when they headhunted Drever from Glasgow, where he had established a formidable reputation as a hands on physicist who got things done, and was working on his own gravitational wave detector. Drever had been brought up in the sealing wax and string tradition of British scientists such as Ernest Rutherford, and was a genius at cutting corners and making things work – provided he was left to do it his way. This was an asset when the project was young and impoverished, but as Levin details his approach became a problem when the project became a large, well-funded bureaucratic organisation with no room for mavericks. But the Nobel Committee had better get its skates on; none of these pioneers is in the first flush of youth, and Drever, sadly, now suffers from dementia. Not that Nobel Prizes, and the lust for them, are necessarily always a good thing. In an interview with Levin, Weiss refers to them as “the sin in this field”, causing friends to fall out with each other over claims for priority. On the scientific side, I was pleased to see Levin giving due emphasis to the importance of the discovery of a system known as the “binary pulsar”, which was seen in the early 1990s to be losing energy in a way which could only be explained by gravitational radiation. This was itself Nobel-winning work, and gave a great boost to the attempt to detect gravitational waves directly. Indeed, it was the binary pulsar that “proved Einstein right”, in so far as that needed proving. The importance of LIGO is that it provides a way to study gravitational waves directly, opening a new window on the Universe, potentially as important as opening up radio or X-ray astronomy. So far, it has detected what people expected it to detect; the real excitement begins when it begins to detect the unexpected. There are some minor irritations regarding Levin’s style. She is clearly unfamiliar with English places and titles, which won’t bother many of her readers. More annoyingly, when introducing the physicist John Wheeler she cannot resist a parenthetical “difficult not to mention his most famous student, Richard Feynman”. Actually, it is easy. Just leave out that sentence. But this is a small price to pay for the pleasure of Levin’s easy style, which makes the reader feel like they are sitting in on her interviews or watching over her shoulder as she writes. I am much more uncomfortable about Levin’s telling, in my view too detailed, of the rivalries which led Drever to be pushed out of the project at the end of the 1990s. The other protagonists were interviewed and gave their versions of the truth in detail, but Drever is now unable to tell his side of the story. I am not sure that we need all the details anyway, but in the circumstances I definitely concur with the comment made to Levin by Weiss: “Nobody wants to resurrect this stuff. It’s unfortunately in the public record now. But it doesn’t have to be in your book.” Indeed not. But I don’t want to end on a sour note. This is a splendid bookThat I recommend to anyone with an interest in how science works, and in the power of human imagination and ability. What LIGO actually measured on 14 September 2015 was a change in the length of detector arms 4 kilometres long that amounted to one ten-thousandth of the width of a proton. To scale that up to “see” a change in length as great as the width of a human hair would require a detector as long as a hundred billion times the circumference of the Earth. It is worth sitting back and letting that sink in. If human beings are capable of measuring that, they are capable of almost anything, given the will to do it. And if you want to know how they did it, in spite of all the trials and tribulations, you will have to read the book. John Gribbin is a Visiting Fellow in Astronomy at the University of Sussex, and author of 13.8: The Quest to Find the True Age of the Universe."

5,1847921965,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea,5,"The subject of gravitational waves is fascinating. Being able to hear major galactic events like collapse of stars into black hole, or a collision of two galaxies has been in the realm of theoretical physics for exactly 100 years until late last year the first event was officially recorded at LIGO. Naturally such an exciting project attracted a lot of drama. This is not the first science book that confirmed my speculations that the academic world is full of cutthroat politics and fierce competition. If you are working on something groundbreaking, you better bet your keister someone else is working on it too, and is secretly hoping for you to get struck by lightning. When there is prestige, Nobel Prize, and personal fulfillment on the line, all is fair. I bet Janna Levin got into some bad blood over publishing some of the uglier conflicts at LIGO. Other than the juicy scientific gossip, this book is full of great information on a very relevant topic, presented in an accessible language not bogged down by industry jargon. Recommended. "
6,1847921965,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1701553-carlos,4,"This book is more of a chronicle of the work that went and it's still going into developing equipment that could be able to listen to disruption on the cosmos thereby proving the presence of black holes or at least that there disturbances on the time space continuum , I loved the physics aspects of it and the epilogue finally made it all worth it when it actually proved the existence of black holes , I'm sure that as I'm speaking there people are writing books, reports and articles about the existence and dynamics of black holes , the understanding of it might well change everything we think we know about the Big Bang and our cosmos.... This book it's just the beginning , highly recommend it to people that want an introduction to theoretical physics and/or the history of the project that made it possible to prove a concept that at one point people only considered science fiction."
7,1847921965,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"I came across Black Holes Blues rather late, when Kip Thorne mentioned it as somewhere you would discover the difficulties the management of the LIGO gravitational waves detection project went through. It's slightly weird reading it now, after the first gravitational wave detections, as the book was clearly written before anything had been found (though there's a rapidly tacked-on afterword to deal with the discovery).Despite the author being a physics professor, this is classic US journalistic popular science writing in the style that was arguably typified by James Gleick's classic Chaos - like that, Black Hole Blues is a book that is driven entirely by the people involved, based strongly around interviews, visits and fly-on-the-wall descriptions of historical interactions between the main characters. The science itself plays a distinctly supporting cast role to the detail of the people, their background and their psychology.I absolutely loved this approach when I first came across it. I must admit that, by now, (Gleick's book is a remarkable 30 years old) it feels a little forced and there are occasions when I'm yelling 'Tell me a less about another origin story, and more about the science.' Sometimes Janna Levin can be consciously wordy, whether over-stretching the simile when she constantly refers to gravitational waves as sound (they're not) or when she puts in folksy human observations, some of which I simply don't understand, such as 'Part of Rana's charisma is related to the social power of indifference.' What?Despite these concerns, though, this is an engaging story of big science - the ups and downs of a billion dollar project, showing the very human frailties of those involved in coming up with the ideas and making them real. Sensibly, Levin spends a fair amount of time on the doomed work of Joe Weber, whose bars proved controversial when no one else could duplicate his work. And we certainly get an impression of the size and complexity of the LIGO setup, even though it was sad that the science and engineering achievements were sometimes obscured by the obsession with the human stories.I have no doubt at all that Levin knows the science behind this stuff backwards, but occasionally the approach seems to demand such hand-waving vagueness that we veer away from accuracy. I've already mentioned the description of gravitational waves as sound, repeated over and over in different ways. There's also an example where we are told that due to the gravitational waves generated by its orbit 'the Moon will [eventually] spiral into us' - where in reality what's happening is dominated by tidal effects, which mean the Moon is moving away from us. Again Levin inevitably knows this, but seemed to prefer the dramatic notion which overwhelms a vague qualifier.Black Hole Blues is a great read and uncovers the human side of scientific work wonderfully. The only let down is, for me, that the art of the writing has overwhelmed the beauty of the science."
8,1847921965,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7780828-sue,5,"Even if you know how the story ends (and, unless you've been living under a rock, you surely do), Janna Levin keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end. Most of the science went over my head, but Levin's compassionate chronicle of the great minds and crazy personalities that made the recording of gravitational waves a reality, 100 years after Einstein theorized them, is intimate and thrilling. I highly recommend the audiobook, narrated by the author. "
9,1847921965,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4763049-holly,4,"Today's announcement of a second detection of gravitational waves reminded me how much I enjoyed and learned from this book. As in How the Universe Got Its Spots Levin intersperses her personal story with clearly-explained physics, but in a much lighter way here - this is in no way a memoir. She's an educated observer and an acquaintance if not admirer of many of physicists involved. She's writing a full account (to-October 2015) of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) project(s). Here's part of a passage I highlighted that shows how she guides the reader. The decades of labor hidden by this unassuming single-story building will culminate in an accomplishment that I am going to try to impress upon you deserves new adjectives, new descriptors. I'm crossing the modest threshold of a trailer into the R&D phase of an experiment that will measure waves in the shape of space less than a billionth of a trillionth of the length of the machine. [italics mine] I recall thinking while reading that this is sort of a nuts and bolts ""process"" book, i.e., about the process of big science; sort of like the documentary ""Particle Fever"" on Netflix about CERN and the Higgs Boson (which I've watched about six times!). There aren't that many difficult equations or graphs and images, or brain-melting theoretical problems to tackle. Instead Levin conveys the frustrations and obsessions of the eccentric researchers, as well as the excitement of having their hard work vindicated."
10,1847921965,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4136921-sookie,2,"In this book Janna Levin says, ""In the Milky Way, there may be one neutron star collision with another neutron star every ten thousand years, although these predictions are still very uncertain."" The speed with which the world has moved since LIGO and VIRGO, statements made by scientists like Levin become obsolete within a year or so. In mid October (10/16/2017), the world saw collision of two neutron stars and the information that astrophysicists collected during the event has changed the course of astrophysics. The book, however, lacks the structure and organization that is necessary when presenting a subject matter such as ""gravitational waves"". Levin's approach is more conversational and goes through the book like a magazine piece, while talking to scientists and their motivation. The tone of dialogues is restricted to casual exchange of backgrounds and ideas while the subject matter is treated as a by-product of the process. "
11,1847921965,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5685608-john-jr,3,"Astrophysicist and author Janna Levin has a good nose. In the late naughts, catching a rising swell of attention to Alan Turing as the centenary of his birth drew near, she wrote a novel that intertwined his life with that of logician Kurt Gödel, which she called, with a knack for alluring but sometimes twisty language, A Madman Dreams of Turing Machines. Sure, anyone could’ve looked up the date of Turing’s birth, but few would’ve guessed he’d soon be the subject of a major American film. A few years later, again with an anniversary looming, Levin decided to chronicle the decades-long effort to catch a new kind of wave, and she began interviewing major participants, visiting laboratories, and compiling an account to be published sometime in 2016, 100 years after Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves. It’s as if (pardon the illogical analogy) somebody had said in 1492, “Hey, I think I’ll go to the Bahamas in case any Europeans turn up.” On February 10 of this year, not many people knew of these waves; on the 11th, the world was set on its ear, so to speak, by the announcement that they’d been heard, and Levin’s book, already on its way to print, was simply rescheduled to come out in March. She didn’t know how the story would end; the entire book is written from the standpoint of an open question. But she was there with the backstory just when we wanted it.As we’ve grown to expect of scientific discovery, the work involves immensities both large and small. The basic idea for the project dates back to the 1960s, when slide rules were still in common use. The leading figures in the tale are old men now or, in one case, passed on. Hundreds of others contributed; Levin lists all of them in the back of the book. The plot keeps repeating itself: think of something, try it; figure out another way, try that; think of something bigger, ask for money, build it; imagine improvements, work them in, try it. The cost has become enormous; a relatively early plan had a price tag comparable to some present-day Hollywood films, around $70 million, but that was in the 80s, and the total has since surpassed a billion dollars. The machines involved are basically yardsticks, but they’ve grown from something that’ll fit in a room, to a prototype that’s 40 meters on a side, to a fully functioning device whose arms stretch four kilometers—that’s not far short of the horizon to someone standing on the ground. The aim all along has been to detect a tiny sound—it has frequently been called a chirp—that began very long ago and very far away. As Levin puts it, “The signals are infinitesimal. The sources are astronomical. The sensitivities are infinitesimal. The rewards are astronomical.”The scheme is fairly simple, and Levin sketches it early. As it occurred to Rai Weiss, it was “let’s measure gravitational waves by sending light beams between things.” Levin amplifies that: “Suspend mirrors…and watch them toss on the passing gravitational wave. Keep track of the distance between them and their motions will record the changing shape of spacetime.”She’s usually deft at explaining the science. In its current form, the project uses two huge installations, one in Washington and the other in Louisiana. Why two? You want a second one “not only to confirm the detection…but also to ascertain the location of the sound. The utility of two detectors on the Earth is like the utility of two ears on the head.” But the heart of the story, for Levin, is elsewhere: it’s not the science but the scientists, their background, their strengths and weaknesses, how they think, the labs they work in, the way they work with others. For most of them, we get a good sense even of how they talk, for Levin has tried to let them speak for themselves, through recent conversations of her own as well as earlier interviews. Rai Weiss considered studied engineering in undergraduate school at M.I.T. but found that physics had fewer requirements. He’s a restless tinkerer, an emeritus member of the project now but still likely to be found with his hands in the apparatus. You can sometimes hear him trying to fix his memories into words: of an all-night talk with Kip Thorne in 1975, he says, “We made a huge map on a piece of paper of all the different areas in gravity. Where was there a future? Or what was the future, or the thing to do?” (Levin’s quotations can sometimes seem diffuse, but they catch her subjects thinking on the fly.) Despite his taste for independent work in a lab, Weiss eventually becomes the one most determined to do what it takes, in terms of studies and proposals and concessions, to keep the project going and growing. He’s the one who went to the National Science Foundation, who took the idea into the realm of big science.Much like Weiss and much unlike him is Ron Drever, an experimentalist from Scotland with a special skill for ingenious methods—he once achieved an important result from a device he built in his mother’s backyard. Drever has some sort of visual-intuitive sense that’s the envy of his colleagues; he can work something out with a diagram that Thorne could resolve only with lengthy calculations. But despite Kip’s last name, Drever is the thorny one, convinced of the rightness of his views, virtually incapable of accommodating others; eventually he’s fired from the project. And there are mysteries about this man. Why, since childhood, has he always required special attention? Why does Levin report that she has only heard his voice in recordings? She’s cagey about him, which is one of the things that keep you turning the pages.And then there’s theorist Kip Thorne himself. He’s the persuasive charmer, the one who soothes and smooths over and reconciles; Levin says, “Kip could make you believe.” Thorne may be even more far-seeing than the others in this tale. Levin reports, “He went so far as to say that by…1962, it was obvious to him that gravitational waves must exist, although the debates would continue…for another twenty years.” (Though Levin doesn’t say so, Thorne has one thing in common with the great popularizer Carl Sagan: each helped shape a major Hollywood film—Contact in Sagan’s case, Interstellar for Thorne. Levin does mention the latter.) You get the sense that his appearance disarms people; Weiss, meeting Thorne for the first time, recalls, “He’s a delightful man, but he looked cuckoo, absolutely cuckoo.”The supporting players are well drawn, too. There’s Joe Weber, another experimentalist and an embodiment of “almost.” Levin says, “He was Shackleton many times, almost the first: almost the first to see the big bang, almost the first to patent the laser, almost the first to detect gravitational waves.” Weber, who died in 2001, was also an almost tragic figure; hubris led him to push his claims of detection too far, and he ended up setting back a field he had helped pioneer. There’s Jocelyn Bell Burnell, an astronomer who “found the first four pulsars ever discovered by human beings” but who was omitted from the Nobel Prize for the work. And there’s Robbie Vogt, the first director of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO for short), who learned as a child in Nazi Germany to hate authority; he’s the sort of person who would take an administrative job because he’s sure all the other candidates would be worse.Levin is a mostly reliable narrator—maybe only a fussbudget will care that in World War II, no nuclear weapon was “carried in a fighter plane over a target.” But she’s an unreliable stylist; some of her prose could benefit from a detangling treatment. Whether or not you know the concept of a random walk, you may stumble over this, as did one of the book’s two New York Times reviewers: “Progress was as random as the walk of a shred of lint through hot air.” She tells us that a Soviet researcher made a speech “for which he was later denunciated.” She uses “conceded” when she means “acceded” and says “the upscale” when she means “the scaling up.” And, despite her efforts to keep the general public in mind, she leaves unexplained a few terms such as “stochastic.”Anyone reading the book now will know that the search paid off. But Levin, writing before the results were announced, repeatedly stresses the uncertainty. She calls the quest “quixotic” at one point and says elsewhere, “Gravitational-wave detection was risky, controversial, technologically nearly impossible.” In a way, the long effort is reminiscent of something Norbert Wiener pointed out about the atomic-bomb project: until it was done, no one knew whether it could be done. Some people may wonder whether the results so far have been worth the cost, as others have no doubt wondered whether the Large Hadron Collider has been; Levin herself says, “LIGO also needs to do more to justify the investment versus rewards calculus. LIGO has to ‘do astronomy,’” by which she seems to mean that this project, and others like it now being built, can’t rest on their laurels but must continue to advance scientific understanding. Is the answer worth the price? For me, the idea that human societies must focus on A, B, and C and can’t do D until later, as well as the related idea that not doing D would somehow in itself advance A, B, and C, goes against a part of human nature and a part of human history, the part that says we do and we must figure out for ourselves how things work. Besides, though we’ve mostly moved beyond the Victorian spirit, we still vibrate to tales of Ulysses-like striving, as many of our superhero entertainments show. There’s something of grandeur and inspiration here; listen attentively and you’ll hear it.I read an uncorrected proof that lacked Levin’s epilogue, which addresses LIGO’s first success, and am curious how she wrapped up this short (256 pages) yet sweeping tale. But the body of her text ends on a fine note:Somewhere in the universe two black holes collide…maybe more than a billion years ago.… A vestige of the noise of the crash has been on the way to us since early multicelled organisms fossilized in supercontinents on a still dynamic Earth.… When I started to write this book, the sound reached Alpha Centauri.… As the sound moves through the interstellar space outside the solar system, the detectors will be operational.… [Finally,] someone…in the control room…might barely hear something that sounds different. A sophisticated computer algorithm will parse the data stream in real time and send a notification…and someone will be the first to look over the specs of the trigger and think calmly, “This might be It.”[This review also appears on my blog.]"

13,1847921965,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,3,"An odyssey for the Kiss of spacetime This book narrates the building of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory and the detection of the of gravitational waves in 2015. It describes the determination and perseverance of a team physicists dedicated to discovering the existence gravitational waves or spacetime ripples that travel at the speed of light. Spacetime ripples was predicted by Einstein in 1915 but over the past 100 years skepticism existed among cosmologists. The cost of building a machine was astronomical and some physicists questioned the wisdom of such a vast and unwarranted expenditure. But to understand the nature of physical reality and the very fabric of our universe, this effort was necessary. We come across the works of three major players in this odyssey, Rainer Weiss, Kip Thorne, and Ron DreverColumbia University Professor Janna Levin is an author of several books and as a writer and a cosmologist she has a unique style of describing the excitement, joy and drama behind this important discovery in our lifetime. She works closely with physicists, writers, artists and musicians in an ever-expanding role of a scientist interested in art and beauty of creation. Despite her efforts, for a casual reader, the writing may not generate enthusiasm since the story is about the efforts of people who contributed to the success of a physics experiment. The fact that this is the costliest project the National Science Foundation (NSF) has ever funded, exceeding $1 billion, you would have to be very interested in physics and cosmology to appreciate this work."
14,1847921965,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15798988-gary,4,"This isn't a science text so much as a journalistic/biographical work on the LIGO project. In effect, it's somewhere between a very long science events article and a short, contemporary history. Levin is more journalist than scientist in this text, though she inserts herself into the narrative in various places and her background as an academic no doubt gave her access to the participants in ways that typical science writer would not have. As more bio/history than science text, we get a lot of he said/he said/they said kind of material about the interpersonal relationships of the participants in that project, and Levin shows us what many of us probably already knew: neither science nor scientists are always scientific. Nonetheless, LIGO has been a dramatic success and whether that is in spite of the foibles of the scientists or because of them is a question that Levin doesn't ask directly. However, it is the background theme of this book. How should ""big science"" be conducted? By whom? Who gets the credit? Levin doesn't provide an answer, but shows how science moves on in spite of those issues, almost inexorably."

This book is about the people who theorized such a detector could be made, how the detectors were built and a bit of the science behind all of it.Three stars because too much time was spent getting to know the people and too little time was spent on the science. By the time the epilogue comes around, the discovery is almost an afterthought.Kudos to the author for making the little bit of science understandable and getting this book out so soon after this amazing discovery.As always, Einstein is correct."
16,1847921965,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1060231-todd,4,"The real joy in this book is found in Levin's wonderful phrases. There may be too much personal drama and office politics stuff at the slight expense of adequately developing the fundamental science, but Levin consistently nails the right-words-in-the-right-order thing. The detection of gravitational waves started with high end audio tech in the 1940s. The theory of these space-time ripples started with Einstein a generation earlier. Detection was recently achieved in late 2015 via two identical instruments, separated by 1500 miles, each capable of detecting changes across their 2.5 mile long vacuum tubes of about 0.0000000000000001 miles. All in all, Levin offers a fine telling of humanity's greatest signal-to-noise story. "
17,1847921965,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37892595-subha-prasad,4,"Janna Levin's latest non-fiction work, Black Hole Blues and Other Songs from Outer Space, chronicling the detection of gravitational waves at LIGO, resembled nothing of the Brian Greene or Stephen Hawking that an unsuspecting reader, looking at the “Popular Science” genre, would expect it to be. This isn't science as a conglomeration of theories sandwiched between a front and a back cover: this is science as executed and planned by the people on the ground. Despite having my expectations of a theoretical book usurped by a book on experimental physics, I am glad that I decided to keep on reading.This book comes at a juncture in astrophysics, when theoretical physics has quite captured the minds of popular science enthusiasts. One can see the appeal: space-time and wormholes, and so many things which can lead to so many exciting and wondrous advancements for humankind over the next million years or so. However, the other side of the story remains quite out of the public eye: experimental physics, which, after all the calculations of theoretical physics, actually does something practical about it and helps filter out the untenable theories from the more possible ones. Levin, herself an Associate Professor of Physics at Columbia University, perhaps finds it necessary to bring this aspect of astrophysics to light with, quite possibly, the most momentous discovery in the last hundred years in astrophysics, which also won the Nobel prize.Levin's narrative structure is rather unexpected for a book dealing with a topic as complicated as the creation and detection of gravitational waves which can automatically lead to several questions (What is laser interferometry? What is a gravitational wave? Why should I care?), but Levin, to her credit, knows her target audience very well, gauging what they might know, what they might not know, and what they don't need to know, quite adeptly. Moreover, since the narrative is more human-centric and individualist than a scientific book, difficult topics are often dealt with on the fly, with a short half-page or one-page explanation, with an effort at evoking awe at the majesty of the Universe.Another interesting quirk of the narrative, by virtue of it having been composed before gravitational waves were detected at LIGO, is that it takes us along with Levin on her exploration of a nascent experiment. This means that despite knowing the final outcome, let's say the climax, of the narrative, we are still thrown around by the twists and turns of events, and feel constricted by the difficulties our scientists face. This perspective is much more interesting than if Levin had written assuming foreknowledge of the outcome on the reader's part.The true strength of the narrative, as previously stated, lies in how it speaks about the people involved. There are characters in this non-fic, not just personalities. Levin has this uncanny ability to humanise and personalise the people she talks about with striking descriptions of idiosyncrasies (a remarkable example of that was conveying the German heritage of Rainer Wess through his vocabulary), and very well-written histories of each person, which regular non-fic often lacks. Since a major section of the narrative involves only character history and dialogue from interviews, it is quite well that Levin can hold the reader's attention through these devices. Within these real characters’ real stories lie the drama, the conflict, the tragedy, and the pride of science. Levin manages to toe the fine line between overly investing in the drama with sentimental comments, and cold hard recounting of events, to a very respectable, and yet engaging effect. Most notable example of this skilful handling of a sticky, almost gossipy situation is in the professional conflict between Robbie Vogt, the first director of the LIGO program, and Ron Drever, a Scottish experimental physicist who later suffers from dementia. Titled “The Drever Affair”, she shows the reader both sides of the conflict, and produces sympathy for both Vogt and Drever, without plunging into shameless sentimentality.Where this line isn't toed is in the momentary digressions from the human perspective to the scientific perspective. Here, we see a tendency for poeticism, which isn't bad in and of itself, but is rather corny when compared to the restraint of the rest of the book. The style sticks out like a sore thumb from the style adopted through the rest of the book, and reads oddly like a Discovery narration.We see another problem arise, again, because of the unusual narrative framework: lack of physical descriptions of the people. Levin won't provide you with much help visualising these scientists. This is a problem because the narrative style almost feels like it deserves character descriptions, like in a storybook. This means there is an odd sense of incompleteness in the writing style, and the reader might feel the need to reach out to the internet for images of the scientists in the book.However, the cracks in the narrative style show themselves most prominently through the sheer number of characters, especially in the first half of the book. Every chapter will pause the momentum to go through four or five pages of character history, and how the scientist in question got involved in the LIGO project. Not to mention, this particular edition of the book hasn't been proofread to perfection, and there is the occasional misprint or grammatical errors lurking here and there.Nevertheless, Levin's prose itself is often peppered with an acerbic wit, which while not as humorous as Hawking, or as innocent and awestruck as Green, does manage to extract an occasional giggle out of a generally humourless narrative. The head scientists cleaning out the tunnels full of wasp nests, spiderwebs and mice was rather funny, as is the occasional deprecatory remark aimed at a character she met, or, more often than you'd expect, herself. She manages to evoke a gamut of emotions from a narrative about science policy, which in itself is worthy of praise, and a testament to her writing skill.The poeticness earlier criticised does create a very heartening epilogue where the gravitational waves are finally detected. The writing truly makes you understand the minuscule size of humans in the context of the Universe, the momentum of human progress, and also a sense of wonder and gratitude at being alive in this day and age. After turning the last leaf, the reader knows that just like the scientists who interact in this narrative, just like the narrative itself, just like LIGO, this work may be imperfect, but it is monumentally important"

19,1847921965,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2014250-tim-martin,4,"This was a strange book, one I generally liked, but it wasn’t entirely what I expected. I had been uncertain about diving into it at first because while the subject of gravitational waves sounded exciting, I hardly knew enough about physics to really make sense of the subject without a lot of hand holding. I had read a few things on black holes and neutron stars for instance, but I was really rather limited on what I knew on the subject or would be able to explain to others. Turns out my unfamiliarity and uncertainty with the subject matter didn’t matter for two reasons. One, what exactly are gravitational waves, why they matter, and the science of detecting and interpreting them were well explained. Gravitational waves are waves in the shape of spacetime, a deforming or ringing of space so to speak purely in gravitational form, occurring due to otherwise unseen and unimaginably distant events often involving immense energies, such as the merger of two black holes, colliding neutron stars, supernovae, pulsars, and the like. Gravitational waves are incredibly faint; “[b]y the time the gravitational wave gets here, the ringing of space will involve relative changes in distance the width of an atomic nucleus over a stretch comparable to the span of three Earths” but represent a new way of seeing the universe, revealing evens that are otherwise unknowable (distant neutron stars can’t be seen, black holes are generally completely invisible, etc.). The reader learns that a half century ago a project – the most expensive undertaking ever by the National Science Foundation – was started to record gravitational waves, a project known as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Not a telescope despite the name observatory, LIGO is essentially a recording device that can detect and chronicle the sloshing waves in spacetime created by the most aggressive motions in space such as merging black holes. Explaining and then touring the actual LIGO instruments (there are two, one in Livingston, Louisiana and one in Hanford, Washington state), the author makes clear that it is a surprisingly simple to understand device (if not simple to construct and maintain, as it is extremely difficult for instance to call forth and then keep over 18,000 cubic meters in hard vacuum for years at a time in a world with seismic events, weather, and various local fauna who find the LIGO project irresistible all conspiring to destroy that vacuum). Essentially LIGO is device called an interferometer (or ifo for short, though each letter is sounded out), essentially a device that sends a laser light down two arms maintained in vacuum, a laser beam that is split so that one beam travels along one length of the L and the other beam down the other, each beam bouncing off a nearly free-floating mirror at the far end and returning down the original arm to where the beam was split. The light will recombine perfectly if the arms are the same length, but if something however minutely changes this – such as a gravitational wave – the light will interfere with itself. Not to spoil anything, but when a gravitational wave is finally detected December 2015, the ifos “detected changes across their 4 kilometers about a ten-thousandth of the width of a proton.” The other reason I needn’t have been nervous about reading this book was that for long stretches this was more a of history about the search for gravitational waves (and at times the gossipy history of the projects dedicated to it) than a science book. The author exceled at giving a feel for the personalities involved and the writing there was good (the brilliant chapter introducing Rainer Wise and describing his past and how his quest as a youth in removing the hiss from records ultimately and weirdly transformed into trying to remove the hissing background sound of the universe to hear gravitational waves was one example, another is the grippingly tragic tale of Joe Weber, who claimed to record gravitational waves in 1969 to great acclaim and some popular fame, only to have all his work questioned and then refuted and in the end living a lonely life in his own privately funded laboratory in the woods of Maryland). Simply the amount of time spent on the personalities frankly surprised me a little. It was certainly interesting and often quite relevant, as their were bitter rivalries that not only plagued the LIGO project in particular but almost doomed the very concept of gravitational waves or the idea that they could ever be detected before LIGO even was a concept. The author is upfront about discussing as much (if not more) the personalities and personal politics behind the science and especially LIGO, “[a]s much as this book is a chronicle of gravitational waves – a sonic record of the history of the universe, a soundtrack to match the silent movie – it is a tribute to a quixotic, epic, harrowing experimental endeavor, a tribute to a fool’s ambition.” I see some reviewers on Goodreads have talked about the author’s writing style. It could be a bit rambling at times, had a number of personal interjections, and almost veered into gonzo journalism with the author putting herself in the disagreements between various scientists and project managers, not quite taking sides but definitely highlighting and reporting disagreements that some apparently didn’t quite want to dwell on. I think in the end the gonzo aspect seemed to work as the author sort of – to my eyes at least – became an honorary insider, getting access and information she wouldn’t have otherwise gotten (though on the history aspects, not the science so much). Some have said she was a bit poetic at times but that didn’t bother me in the slightest, as this is a bold, new area of physics and astronomy, one that could produce exciting information, LIGO being “a direct commune with fundamental law,” a project that is successful can not only test the General Theory of Relativity but also mark “the opening of an observational window on the universe that differs fundamentally from that provided by electromagnetic and particle astronomy.” It was a fairly fast and easy read. I would have like a few pictures but it didn’t change my enjoyment of the book. "
20,1847921965,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2945070-thom,1,"Extremely conversational, with petty politics, occasional interesting anecdotes, and a very cool scientific result from a potential fool's errand. This mixed bag reads like an extended article, and I had to resist abandoning it multiple times. 1½ stars."
21,1847921965,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1829065-mike,5,"I could fault this book for being more about the personalities than the science. But the personalities are so good... Black Hole Blues could almost be a sci-fi novel. A couple of things stand out. In the 80s, I read about Joe Weber's attempts to detect gravity waves. At the time, I thought it was crackpot science, even though Stanford and a number of other major research centers had built versions of his detector. Levin goes into Weber's story more than I would have expected, and you get to see him as a genuinely tragic figure: a brilliant scientist who legitimized the attempt to detect gravity waves directly, but a bad statistician who became obsessed with defending results that just didn't hold up.I've followed the LIGO project for detecting gravity waves since the 90s, and was thrilled when I saw the news that they had succeeded. But when you read the story, you're amazed that this project happened at all. Not because of the physics or the engineering (which is nothing short of amazing), but because of the bizarre management and personalities that nearly destroyed the project many times. Rainer Weiss and Kip Thorne come off as heroes--and that's probably deserved. The strange role of Ron Drever, the third member of the ""troika,"" is more puzzling. Levin never speaks to Drever directly; he is present only through earlier recorded interviews, and is now suffering from dementia. While all of the characters in this book are polite and gracious towards Drever, he seems an odd victim: of his own weaknesses, of circumstances, of the desire to make this project work. He made it clear that he would only go to Cal Tech to work on the project if he was in complete control. That request was neither realistic nor reasonable, and yet Thorne and the CalTech administration agreed to it--or agreed to let Drever think they agreed to it--or didn't realize that Drever thought they had agreed to it. His genius as an experimenter was clearly essential to the early days of the project. But it's difficult to read about heroes of science making promises that couldn't possibly be kept, and that were inevitably broken. The stratosphere of academic physics is a tough world: Drever was clearly playing a game for which he was unequipped and unsuited. Would the project have succeeded without him? Possibly not. Did he have to be pushed out? It's clear that he became poisonous, and eventually was a threat, rather than an asset. It's not comfortable reading, and one suspects that the Levin's interviewees were at least somewhat self-serving.But it's no surprise that high-stakes physics has some rather nasty warts, and uncomfortable as it is, Levin reports them. Drever's role, whether heroic or tragic, is an important part of the story, and shouldn't be erased. Levin honors her subjects by refusing to erase it.Well worth reading."

23,1847921965,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28204661-dan-falk,4,"It was the top science story of 2016, if not the decade: Physicists had finally detected elusive ripples in space-time known as gravitational waves, produced by a pair of colliding black holes. These subtle waves were predicted by Einstein’s theory of gravity, known as general relativity, 100 years ago – but they remained a matter of speculation until they were finally snared by the LIGO detectors in Louisiana and in Washington state. (The acronym stands for Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.)In Black Hole Blues, physicists and science writer Janna Levin gives us the back story, guiding us through the five-decade history of this remarkable project (LIGO was the most expensive project ever funded by the National Science Foundation). Levin has conducted detailed interviews with the three main scientists involved with LIGO – Kip Thorne, Ranier Weiss, and Ronald Drever (note: Drever died in March of 2017, after the book was published), and excerpts from these interviews form the backbone of the story. A fourth figure, Joe Webber, believed – erroneously – that he had found gravitational waves back in the 1970s; he refused to back down, and even considered suicide as he grappled with rejection from his colleagues. Levin manages to weaves Weber's tragic story into the larger picture.Levin has a unique, almost hyper-casual writing style, which may not be to everyone’s taste (e.g., each of the three main scientists are referred to by their first names, all the way through the book) – but the story is never dull, and of course Levin knows the science inside and out. Here, though, the focus is on the flesh-and-blood people who make the science happen. Note, we review Black Hole Blues in Episode 13 of BookLab – so dial into the podcast for more details!"

This is the story of our search for that sound, only detectable through gravity waves. It's also the story of how we do ""big science"", science that requires hundreds of brilliant minds, working for decades, and fighting to acquire the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to build the instruments that may be able (or not) to accomplish the task. This is the story of LIGO, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, a device (actually two of them, one in Washington state and one in Louisiana) so sensitive that it can measure a length change in a four-kilometer path of one ten-thousandth the diameter of a proton. As of the publication date of this book, LIGO had not yet found gravity waves, but on September 14 2017 an event was detected and confirmed by optical telescopes. The 1.1 billion dollar LIGO has succeeded in seeing gravity waves. I withheld a star from my rating only because the book gives so much detail about the interactions of the scientists involved in the project (some of whom worked on it throughout their entire careers) that it bogged down a bit at times. If you love science and how it is sometimes accomplished, I highly recommend this book."

A billion years ago, two black holes collided and created a faint sound traveling towards us, at the time, multicelled organisms fossilized in supercontinents. As that sound got closer to our Local Supercluser of galaxies, dinosaurs were chilling on the spot where you're reading this from.  Closer and closer, it reached the Andromeda galaxy, around the same time as homo sapiens and neanderthals were freezing their asses off in the ice age. When it hit the halo of our Milky Way galaxy, people were painting caves. Soon after, approaching nearby star clusters, industrialization got under way and the steam engine was build. By the time Albert Einstein theorized the existence of gravitational waves in 1916, the sound was on its way to Alpha Centauri.  This book celebrates the crazy dudes who had the vision and ambition to build an observatory to record this one billion-year journey and add to your metaphysical playlist this  sonic record of the history of the universe, a soundtrack to match the silent movie ."

Dr. Levin is a physicist, teacher, and an award-winning author. She understands both the science and the scientists. She describes their friendships, their rivalries, and, ultimately, their triumphs with sympathy and a touch of humor.  Modern physics is often so nonintuitive that it is difficult to grasp the theory behind the experiments and understand the importance of the results. By telling the story through the people who conceived and worked on the experiments, Dr. Levin has found a way to describe their work simply and clearly. You come to understand what gravitational waves are, how they are formed, and how they are detected. Ultimately, you understand why the work was important and how it could change the way we see the Universe in the future."

Janna Levin writes with humor, insight, compassion, but with a scientists discerning eye towards separating truth from perception, and avoiding the trap of rewriting history based on those who won. For anyone with a love of science, and history, and the amazing people behind the stories, this book is a must read, and to top it all off, it has an amazing ending.

It's fully of flowery language. It reads like a human interest news story. You can tell the author is more interested in the spectacle than the science. This makes the book unbearably stupid and boring.All the factual claims are correct, but the author sounds like they have no background in science.

For anyone wondering, this book focuses on the sometimes rocky history of the building of LIGO and not on the physics and astronomy of interferometry, relativity or black holes. Yes, there is some discussion, but the book spends most of its time on the personalities who brought this new science into reality. It was an enjoyable read."

It was also inconsistently personal. The ""I imagined he was thinking XYZ"" was annoying, and I didn't understand the purpose of going on about drinking with the grad students.

38,1847921965,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57803005-tomas-sedovic,5,"On paper, this sounded like the perfect book for me. Consider: it's about my favourite subject (astronomy), my favourite spacetime phenomena (black holes), about one of the most ridiculously impossibly massive scientific endeavours to date (gravitational waves interferometers) and it's written by an author who, while being a scientist (theoretical cosmologist) herself, by her own admission does not like a lot of scientific literature because it's too dry and prefers fiction (a kindred spirit).Well, the book was excellent! Absolutely amazing. It is brimming with emotion, stories (fantastic as well as horrific). It documents a human and scientific achievement that is absolutely staggering.The author has embedded herself within the LIGO teams and witnessed much of the recent history leading towards the gravitational wave detection (spoiler alert!) and writes as much about the people, events and stories that unfolded as about the science. The project lasted decades, endured doubts and push-back from the wider scientific community, requiring multi-year industry studies (is it even technologically possible to build this thing?), politicking (the U.S. Congress had to approve the budget) and personal disagreements.It documents the extremely complicated story of Joseph Weber. Inspiring and tragic, on par with N-rays when viewed from one direction, founder of the gravitational detection field itself from another and a person who's fallout almost destroyed it as well.Unlike in fiction, the stories here are almost never simple. There's never a clear villain. Never a spotless hero.There's the story of Jocelyn Bell Burnell, who as a grad student detected the first pulsars (neutron stars). It shows how that slowly helped turn the acceptance that black holes may be actual physical objects and not just some mathematic quirks of General Relativity. How Burnell did not get the Nobel price while her advisor did, quite possibly because she was a woman. About the people who were outraged and how she stated she didn't think she deserved the price, being just a grad student. How she won basically every other price there ever was.The author tell the stories from as many vantage points as she could get. Often citing multiple parties' perspectives and highlighting where their views or recollections differ. The book is never judgemental, never proposing the ""right"" interpretation.Again, this is life. People are complex and memories notoriously unreliable. I have a huge respect for Janna Levin. She did not try to simplify or smooth out the truth. She puts everything on the table, contradictions and all.Given how incredibly young the field of gravitational waves is (the first paper on the topic having been published by Albert Einstein in the year 1915 -- a little over a hundred years ago) with the first ever detection recorded in 2015, most of the people involved in the project are still alive. Or were while the book was being written. The author got to speak to a lot of the people directly involved.The book is an emotional roller coaster. How often can you say that about a science book?You don't need any scientific knowledge to enjoy it. It describes the whole century-long story in more or less a chronological order and it tries to impart the understanding of the sheer insanity this project was and the involvement of the people who made it happen.The book was finished before the gravitational waves were detected, acknowledging the event in the epilogue. So it reads like an honest thrilling tale, uncertain to the last minute rather than a description of a done deal.I love it to bits."
39,1847921965,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22428213-ian-scuffling,4,"Janna Levin is quickly becoming my favorite public astrophysics intellectual figure. In the vein of Carl Sagan and others of his ilk, she possesses a beautiful mix of severe intellect and a unique capacity for language that is evocative, engaging, and informative. Reading Levin's work is to slip in to the stream of the precise and poetic river of her mind.Where How the Universe Got Its Spots: Diary of a Finite Time in a Finite Space takes a novel approach to science writing (a diary that commixes the personal, the historical, and the scientific), this one is a bit more straight forward; it's a kind of biographical history of the scientists involved in the development of LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) and the recent discovery (or rather, detection) of gravitational waves. Levin paints clear pictures of the personalities of the primary players and includes lively conversations with them through personal interviews that read like conversations among friends.Where Levin's ability to render some of the most complex scientific principles in layman-accessible terms, her literary nuance is not to be underestimated as she makes clever and unique allusions to Gravity's Rainbow and Kurosawa's seminal Rashomon where Levin uses the film's device to paint a multivalent picture of the ego-clashes and inner-workings of getting LIGO funded and built.Further, beyond biography of the people, Black Hole Blues is a biography of Big Science and the often-aggravating process of how scientific discovery happens; from backyard contraption to $1 billion project, Levin weaves an intricate tale of clashing personalities, egos, management styles, visions, data and the slog of the bureaucratic process in acquiring the funding to make such huge scientific endeavors happen. There are even nods to the failures of this process with mentions of the Super Collider that would have been built in Texas and would have discovered the Higgs a decade+ earlier had the US congress not stripped the funding in the '90s.Black Hole Blues closes on the days following the first confirmed detection of a gravitational wave—a powerful blast of gravitational energy caused by the collision of two black holes. The first indications of the detection receive little-to-no excitement; there had been many ""candidates"" in the past that ultimately amounted to ""noise,"" but quickly this instance became clearly different. Those initial reactions quickly boiled into frenetic energy as it became clear that this was a definite detection—a detection that has massive, long-term significance on our understanding of the universe, and a deeply satisfying confirmation for the scientists who had spent 50+ years chasing what was once only a mathematical probability."

To try to put this in perspective - Gravitational Waves are really hard to detect, they were predicted by Einsteins’s General Relativity way back in the day, but aside form seeing patterns in the cosmic background microwave radiation that strongly imply they were part of the early universe, no one has ever detected them. Because a Gravitational Wave is really a flaw in space-time, the universe itself flexing and squeezing in ever so subtle ways. So subtle in fact, that for the realistic chance of detecting them, then a device must be built that can detect such a ripple as small as one ten-thousandth the width of a proton.This book covers what became a life long obsession for a few people as the LIGO was conceived, funded, and eventually built. It followed the brief fame of a guy way back in the 60’s that claimed to have detected them, and all the fallout from the later realization that he was in error.And through it all, a few people never giving up the dream of building a device like what he have today. A device so spectacularly sensitive and large that it requires miles long tunnels underground filled with lasers and mirrors and obsessive monitoring. The sites where the Observatories are built are sometimes believed be nefarious top secret govt facilities where time-traveling missions are conducted - and the engineers and scientists who work there have to do quite a bit of public outreach to try to calm the locals. The whole thing is fascinating to me. This book was written prior to the LIGO team announcing their success in detecting Gravitational Waves (it’s covered in an epilogue) and is really about the 50 year journey to get this completed. The topic is riveting, I was a little flustered how the technical aspects were glossed over in favor of focusing on the personality conflicts of the principal actors in the story. Still, worth the read, but IMO could have been more than what it was."
41,1847921965,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13967071-becky-carr,1,"This book is not actually about gravitational waves!!!! So if you, like me, pick it up because you wanted to learn about them and expected a science book, this is not for you. Instead it’s about the people who worked on LIGO and the search for gravitational waves. So right off the bat this wasn’t going to be what I was looking for but that’s not a reason to give it 1 star. The reason for that is that this book desperately needs an editor! Or just a better editor (sorry penguin random house) Why are there so many ridiculous long quotes in here? Quotes that could and should be paraphrased??!?! I listened as an audiobook and that just made it so much worse because it was difficult to tell if it was the narrator talking or a quote. Trying to keep this timeline straight is a Herculean effort. The chapters switch back and forth between decades for seemingly no purpose and there are so many names dropped in there that you can’t keep them straight. Kip, Ron, Robbie, Joe... who are all these people and why am I trying to remember all their names?! Also the author switches back and forth between addressing them by first or last names, sometimes in the same sentence! It took me way too long to realize that Druver and Ron were the same person. And the editor was needed most at the sections that for some reason are still included, like Stephen hawking’s terrible betting or Robbie’s feelings on nuclear war. And the whole time I’m just thinking, but where are the gravitational waves??? Even if you were looking for a book that covers the process of scientists’s search for gravitational waves, look somewhere else. This one is a hard pass."
42,1847921965,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16080726-sabin,4,"For a scientist who writes books on scientific topics, Janna Levin’s writing seemed a bit strange to me. It felt rather like the work of a journalist than of a scientist, and the story is less about the physics than about the people who make it happen and the struggles they go through in order for said science to happen and discoveries to be made. And it is a gorgeous story, all 50 years of it: from Weiss’ interferometer experiments in 1967 up until the launch of the Advanced LIGO Observatory and its initial detection of gravitational waves, which finally landed the principal collaborators in the project, Rainer Weiss, Kip Thorne and Barry Barish, the 2017 Nobel Prize for Physics.The thing that struck me as more of a work of science reporting, than science storytelling is the depth of her investigation. In order to deliver her story, the author visits the sites, goes through numerous archives both at MIT and CalTech, interviews the principal actors involved in LIGO’s development and success, and manages to narrate a coherent story while, at the same time, keeping every piece of information distinct, relating the conflicts which arose from multiple points of view.The book is by no means the definitive account of all that transpired in those 50 years, especially since it is quite sketchy in regard to what happened in Europe and Russia during the same period, but it is, nonetheless, a thoroughly enjoyable reading experience."

It definitely didn’t make the book unreadable, just requiring some patience to understand. I would have loved a little more explanation in parts; if the book had explained more of the science in depth, that would have been helpful. The interviews and the narrative were wonderful, I now have a weird crush on Rai Weiss and my love for Kip Thorne has grown twofold."

The book is a chronicle of gravitational waves, a monumental breakthrough in science which marks the beginning of a new era of gravitational wave astronomy. It came after decades of research, through a world-wide effort of thousands of scientists. It is also ""a tribute to a quixotic, epic, harrowing experimental endeavor, a tribute to a fool’s ambition,""as described in the book. It is equally divided between the science and the story of the people behind the endeavour, their dreams and their challenges, the failures and the clashes of huge egos, and the drama and the excitement they share. Levin avoids using technical jargon and difficult scientific concepts associated with black holes."

50,1847921965,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1345046-todd-martin,3,"Black Hole Blues and Other Songs from Outer Space is the first book (that I’m aware of) to come out describing the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and its recent discoveries. If you’ve been paying cursory attention to science news of late, you’ll no doubt be aware that in February, 2016 scientists announced that LIGO had detected gravitational waves that were produced as a result of a collision between two black holes that occurred 1.3 billion years ago. Amazing … right?!?So … what are gravitational waves? It’s been known for some time that gravity distorts space-time. This is often illustrated via the bowling ball on a rubber sheet analogy. The heavier an objects mass, the more the fabric of space around the object is distorted. Gravitational waves are radiating ripples in space-time produced by objects whose motion involves acceleration (as long as the motion is not perfectly symmetric). Sources of the waves would include massive objects rotating around one other, a spinning non-symmetric object, or the collision of two black holes. Gravitational waves were predicted by Einstein’s theory of general relativity, though Einstein himself waffled back and forth as to whether they actually exist. LIGO is designed to detect gravitational waves by splitting a laser beam and shooting it down two 4 km (2.5 mile) long orthogonal tunnels. The beams bounce off a mirror at the end and are eventually recombined. Because gravity distorts the shape of space-time it actually distorts the length of the tunnels. This results in an interference pattern when the light beams recombine if waves are present. Because gravitational waves are very small, the instrument was designed to measure changes as small as 1e-20 meters, or about one ten-thousandth of the width of an atomic nucleus.Within two days of receiving an upgrade LIGO detected gravitational waves on September 14, 2015 … and the crowd (or at least the nerds among them) went wild.Black Hole Blues  was written by Janna Levin a theoretical cosmologist and professor of astronomy and physics at Barnard College of Columbia University. The book mostly focuses on the scientists involved with gravity wave science and their efforts to fund and construct the LIGO units (there are two, one in Washington and the other in Louisiana). The book’s subject matter is interesting overall, but I feel compelled to mention Levin’s writing style, which I found to be peculiar:- She writes that black holes “churn space-time” and that the their collisions “ring the universe” (as in the ringing of a bell). That’s fine, there’s nothing wrong with these descriptions, but she then repeats these phrases over and over and over again. I get it, the universe “rings” and space-time “churns”, however the phrases became grating with repetition. - She quotes extensively from Kip Thorne and Rai Weiss in the text. Again this is fine, but people often speak in a casual or slapdash manner. When someone is quoted as saying “I think this is what happened”, or “This is what I recall happened”, it’s the job of the journalist to verify the facts to the extent possible. Levin often fails to perform this journalistic function and as a result the book has kind of a slipshod feel to it.- I found Levin’s sentence structure to be awkward and disjointed making the text annoying at times and more difficult than necessary to read. - The book focuses too much on the ‘sausage being made’, interpersonal he-said-she-said gossip and the inside baseball of a large scale science project and not enough on the science itself. I’m sure there will be better books written about LIGO in the future, until that time Black Hole Blues will have to suffice."
51,1847921965,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2893093-chuck-erion,4,"This review appeared in the Waterloo Region Record and Hamilton Spectator on Feb 3, 2017.Even though I had the chance to meet Janna Levin in 2006 when she spoke at the Perimeter Institute Public Lectures, it was a Best Books of 2016 listing on BrainPickings.org that tweaked my interest in this book. The author is a physics and astronomy professor with an astounding ability to translate the imponderables of cosmology, especially black holes, for the general reader. This is her third book, after How the Universe Got Its Spots (2002) and When Madmen Dream of Turing Machines (2006).While most people have heard of CERN, the huge electron collider in Switzerland, few know about LIGO, a research project in Louisiana (LLO) and Washington (LHO) to listen for gravitational waves. Einstein in 1916 first conceived of such waves. It was Stephen Hawking who worked out the theory of black holes in the 1970s. Black Hole Blues traces the history of that project from its inception by three scientists in the 1960s to the first Nobel-worthy results in late 2015, which were published in February, 2016. Levin moves easily between explaining science to interviewing the players to reflecting on their impacts. This is not a dry discourse striving for objectivity; she interacts in interviews but it is clear that they are based on mutual respect.LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) was the brainchild of three astrophysicists, Rainer Wiess, Kip Thorne and Ron Drever. Weiss grew up in Brooklyn, building his own hifi from discarded parts, including theatre speakers. Drever was the son of a rural doctor in Scotland; he built a television in time to watch Queen Elizabeth’s coronation. Thorne was raised in an academic Mormon family in Utah. A fourth experimenter, Joe Weber, has a more tragic story. He figured that a metre-long aluminum rod could bet set up like a tuning fork to vibrate in response to gravitational waves. Trouble was, only he got “results.” He died in 2002. The others built on his model, eventually stretching that tuning fork to a four-kilometre vacuum tube with a laser light shining through it. But how can they be sure the ‘noise’ is from a black hole collision and not a truck rumbling by or a seismic disturbance deep underground? So LIGO was duplicated in various settings around the world—if they all pinged at the same time (10 or so microseconds apart), they assume the source is from deep space. Imagine the delicacy of the instruments to control and collect that data.A project of this magnitude runs to hundreds of millions of dollars, and lobbying Congress for basic research is a Herculean task. Experimentalists are not necessarily good as administrators or lobbyists. Drever was director of the project which began in a wartime shed at Caltech, but was ousted in 1992, and replaced by the provost, Robbie Vogt. He in turn was replaced. Drever later succumbed to dementia and was not part of that press conference last February.Levin concludes: “Two very big stars lived in orbit around each other several billion years ago…Eventually one star died, and then the other, and two black holes formed. They orbited in darkness, probably for billions of years before the final 200 milliseconds when the black holes collided and merged, launching their loudest gravitational wave train into the universe. The sound travelled to us from 1.4 billion light years away. A few hours before the wave hits the Earth, LHO is locked. An hour before the wave hits, LLO is locked…The gravitational wave came from the southern sky, skimmed past Louisiana, ringing LLO first before cruising at the speed of light nearly in the plane of the continent to hit LHO 10 milliseconds later.” A century after Einstein published his theory, a gravitational wave was recorded. Nobel Prize juries take note."

The title is only appreciated after the reader discovers that the entire point of the on-going research experiment LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) is to hear and record gravitational waves (translated into audible sounds) produced by neutron stars, supernovas, and cataclysmic collisions in deep space – two black holes, for example. The very proposition of the experiment, formulated more than 50 years ago, assumed much that hadn’t yet been proven. The experiment’s progress over the years has been a bumpy one filled with a turbulent mix of personalities, dreams, successes and failures, and perhaps most importantly, epic proportions of hope. These were men and women whose work might never in their lifetimes bear fruit. And yet it did. And now it has again. What a wonderful story!"

She provides just enough allegory-laden scientific explanations of what happens when two far off black holes collide. The resulting collision, Einstein theorized, would transmit gravitational waves across the galaxy.The last chapter of the book recounts the first detection of such an event after many years of the efforts described earlier in this book.One trick was to build an instrument sensitive enough to detect the infinitesimally weak gravity waves when they finally reach us after traveling vast galactic distances. Building such an instrument took many years and consumed the passions and intellect of many scientists who, at the risk of their own careers, persevered against much skepticism and occasional professional hostility.We have the U.S. National Science Foundation to thank for pouring money into the project over many years, along with the dedication and imagination of the five key scientist that serve as the author’s focus. (Personally, I shall always have a warm spot in my own heart for the NSF as they funded my own PhD dissertation research which included astrophysicists as one of the study populations. I wonder if any of the researchers mentioned in this book were part of the population whose journal publishing preferences I studied?) This book is heavy on personal histories and provides “just enough science” to help the reader understand what’s going on.Some reviewers have complained about the lack of technical detail. I’m okay with that. This book succeeds in bringing “big science” down to earth by telling its story through a few key players. That Levin secured the cooperation of these key players is fortunate and she skillfully weaves the connections between theory and experiment with attention to the people involved.I really enjoyed this book. While I’m still not really clear on what gravity is, it helps at one point that the author for comparison provides a brief overview of the different forces that bring atomic particles together.But no matter. The story is fascinating. If you have ever read any serious histories of nuclear weapons development you understand how important it is to understand the personal, political, and intellectual challenges in managing such “moonshot scale” efforts.Science can be a noble pursuit yet the humans who “do” science are subject to the same hopes, fears, and dreams as the rest of us. Understanding something about how this is all done is one more step in understanding what separates humans from other life forms."
57,1847921965,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33596025-steven-sidley,4,"Book Review — Black Hole Blues by Janna LevinSince I started writing novels some years ago I read non-fiction less often than I would like and far less often than I used to. But a daughter at UCT studying Astrophysics and a wifely Christmas present of this book (roundly garlanded as one of the best of 2016 by various opinion-makers) gave me license.The subject is the 60-year story of the construction of two co-operating LIGOs in the US (I won’t bother with the expansion of the acronym, but it is an L-shaped, 4km long piece of insanely complex astrophysical equipment) and its very recent confirmation of Einstein’s prediction of gravitational waves, now considered to be one of the most important experimental scientific confirmations of the last century. It is also the study behind the geniuses (and eccentrics) who envisioned and built the project.The book doesn’t attempt more than a careful prose description of the science, so as not to fall into the trap of losing non-physicist readers along the way. Suffice it to say that billions of years ago two stars circled each other. They collapsed eventually into individual black holes and then merged. In the last 200 milliseconds of that merger, they released a massive amount of energy which warped space-time in a little ripple that travelled 1.4 billion light years to earth, which was ‘heard’ by the two LIGOs at exactly the same time on a day in September 2015. Billion of years. Billions of miles. And we design a piece of kit to hear the last 200 MILLISECONDS of the event, which proves a dazzling prediction of the theory of relativity.If this doesn’t impress impress you about the boundless ambition of human curiosity, I am not sure what will. It has not only confirmed the theory, but opened the first truly ‘new’ field of astronomy in many decades, and will allow us to look deeper, further and more clearly into where we came from.The science in the book is given bright colour by the descriptions of the fascinating politics of big science and the human brilliance, failings and tragedies of the many scientists who laboured on this near-impossible project. Janna Levin brings all of them to light in a way that only the best fiction tries to do. BTW — astronomer Kip Thorne (the driving force behind this for decades) also wrote the treatment for the film Interstellar.Levin is herself a physicist and professor, but her use of language and an unusual stylistic flair can stand toe-to-toe with the best writers in any genre. This is a must read for anyone with who struggles, like I do, to make sense of the inscrutable world of advanced physics and cosmology and its practitioners, but who wish to get a clearly articulated glimpse of its mysteries.You will leave this book knowing far more about the universe and the best of human ingenuity than when you started."
58,1847921965,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5567347-craig-werner,4,"Fascinating chronicle of the LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) from its inception as a visionary idea in the late 60s/early 70s through the surprisingly quick detection of gravitational waves last September during what was intended as a trial run to test the engineering. Like the LIGO collaborators, Levin has a spectacularly good sense of timing, having completed but not yet published her book just as the breakthrough occurred.Beyond the topical dimension, Black Hole Blues makes a major contribution to the sub genre of ""scientific procedurals,"" books that focus on how a particular problem was imagined, pursued and (in most cases) resolved, always in ways that open new avenues for research. The Double Helix is probably the best-known example; I also love The Voyager to the Great Attractor and Levin's first book--in which her own research as a cosmologist is central--How the Universe Got Its Spots. That book garnered some of its impact from Levin's personal story as a young woman trying to make sense of her personal and professional lives. Black Hole Blues focuses outward; Levin's there, but mostly as an observer (and as a writer who's highly conscious of her role as stylistic and arranger).There are four distinct threads that run through the book: 1) a fairly traditional popular science story telling the reader what gravitational waves are and why they matter as astronomers and physicists work to open a new window onto the universe; 2) a story about ""Big Science,"" the massively expensive, complicated bureaucracies--multi-institutional and international--required to do this sort of research; 3) a story about the sometimes congruent, frequently conflict-ridden, personalities of, and relationships between, first-tier scientists (Kip Thorne, Rai Weiss, Ron Drever are the ""troika"" at the center, but Joe Weber, who represents the agonizing situation of someone whose results weren't verified is also important her); 4) Levin's poetic meditations on the nature of the universe.It's not a perfect book. At times, Levin drops stories without following them through, and some of the transitions are jarring. She made a decision to quote most of her interviewees without the kind of editing that's standard--as a result quotes loop around, break off in mid-thought, etc. That's an accurate description of process, but I probably would have done a bit more editing if anyone had asked.For all that, a compelling read about an important topic. Highly recommended for anyone wanted to keep abreast of what's going on in contemporary science."
