The book starts out very readable (which is uncharacteristic of Damasio), then (about half way through) the book becomes nearly unreadable (which is typical of Damasio). I am an educated reader. I teach affective and developmental psychology. I am not a researcher or a specialist but I can say that none of the material in this book is unfamiliar to me. But I'm often lost as to the larger point Damasio is trying to make. I attribute this to Damasio's prolix writing style. Much of the book feels like he's barfing data onto page after page with out connecting any of it back to the central metaphor of the book. I find this to be the case with a lot of European intellectuals. They (big generalization, lots of exceptions e.g. Dawkins) don't seem to value economy, clarity or functionality in their writing. The older I get, the more I respect writers who do. I'll finish this book, I'll read the rest of his books, but dear god what a chore.."
1,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28709846-manuel-ant-o,3,"If you're into stuff like this, you can read the full review.Life Is but a Dream: ""Descartes' Error: Emotion, Reason and the Human Brain"" by António R. Damásio(Original Review, 1994-11-17)Dave Chalmers did a great job of making consciousness popular but his own view was 400 years out of date. Descartes is the real rigorous physicist here - he was after all one of the people who devised physics. What he meant by the soul and God being 'spirit' is that they caused matter to move. Matter for Descartes was just the inert occupancy of a space (extension). So physics consisted of the interaction of spirit and matter. We now call spirit 'force' or 'energy' and Descartes was quite right because thinking is all about electromagnetic fluxes - which in themselves do not occupy space or have mass. His mistake was to think that there had to be one special spirit unit. Leibniz sorted that out in 1714."
2,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6978592-sean,5,"I read Descartes' Error as an undergraduate. In grad school, I learned that my advisor's wife (herself a neuroscientist of some renown) had a very poor opinion of Damasio's work. However, by that point, this book had already changed my life.Damasio provides here a popular account of research in neuroscience that started with the famous case of Phinneas Gage, who, upon having a railroad spike shoved through his head by an explosion, changed from being an upstanding, reliable citizen into a scurrilous bastard with a gambling problem. From this, as well as experimental work with other victims of brain damage, Damasio draws the conclusion that ""reason"" as we typically think of it is not an abstract process, but a fundamentally embodied one: the brain and the body are in constant communication, and the brain uses feedback from the body to evaluate, prune, and select for further exploration the branches of a decision tree that, for even the most minor of problems (""when should we get together next?"") would be otherwise unmanageably large.My interest in cognitive science and neuroscience were the natural outgrowths of my interest in computers and science fiction. I grew up, as did most people of my generation, with the metaphor of the mind as a computer, executing logical programs in a way that would have made Aristotle - and Descartes - proud. I knew from studies of psychology how apparently irrational the human mind could be, but until I read this book, I always thought the mind was, fundamentally, a separate thing from the body. This book convinced me they are, at least as we implement them, inseparable."
3,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1936157-dwight-cates,4,"Rene Descartes was a 17th French philosopher and scientist, often called the father of modern philosophy. Descartes argued that 'mind' is an essence that exists independent of 'brain' - this is known as 'Cartesian Dualism.' In 'Descartes' Error', Antonio Damasio argues persuasively that that mind is inextricably linked to brain - when you change the physical brain in specific, measurable ways, you induce specific and measurably changes in mind - personality and behavior.Damasio illustrates this through numerous examples, drawn from patients who've exerienced brain damage due to trauma or disease, and emerged from the experience with a new personality and mental abilities.Given the evidence, it's very difficult to argue that the 'mind' or 'soul' is a non-material essence that exists independent of the physical structure of the brain."
4,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1323053-corey,4,"I had an unusually ambivalent reaction to this book and alternated between being fascinated and being, well, slightly bored. I'd say that the book is good and the author has some excellent insights, but he gets a little long-winded at times and tends to meander. For the curious, Descarte's ""error"" was the separation of mind and body, and consequently, an artificial dichotomy between rationality and emotion. Damasio makes an excellent case on neurological grounds that rationality simply doesn't work without emotion."
5,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/863801-ade-bailey,5,"Having read and become involved with his later books, I have gone to the first in a series which explains the difference between emotion and feeling, which makes the mind and body one again, and which profoundly disturbs the comfortable idea of any but conventional separation of 'reason' and the passions.Damasio is of the 'sufficient but not necessary' strand when it comes to looking at the relationship between brain and mind: you can't be human with the attributes of feelings, emotions, memory and so on without a brain, but all of the attributes relate to things beyond the brain (in particular, the body). I'm a little puzzled as to why he looks forward to a time when 'we' will understand such a thing as aesthetic response. I am not sure, for one, that we are much further than Plato in beginning to understand aesthetics so finding even neural correlates with 'aesthetic states' seems conceptually doomed; more importantly it feeds into the current neuromanic slop that assumes with the intellectual grasp of a five year old that a mood state, a feeling, something like an aesthetic adjective are simple labels to 'things' that exist with the solidity of a stone. As I say, Damasio is aware of the dangers but sometimes, apart from inserted disclaimers, his enthusiasm for his subject tends to imply that while he is very good on the brain he has less of a grasp on the psychology, and of the immense conceptual complexities of enculturation.For all sorts of reasons though, I'll give this five stars - not least because it's enjoyable and a highly accessible primer to some of the basic anatomy and hypothesised functions of the brain, and, most importantly, its embodiment: we separate brain from body only for conventional convenience. I find that Damasio's work fits (for me) with Lakoff and Johnson (especially relating to the embodied mind), Mark Turner (The Literary Mind), and Chambers, Clark et al (the extended mind)."
6,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1394357-laura-grabowski,5,"I was captivated and fascinated by this book, start to finish. The book addresses the importance of emotion in cognition, thus pointing out Descartes' error in separating mind from body. In many ways, this book simply affirms things that I have ""known"" for many years, having spent 20+ years as a dancer/choreographer, but Damasio's perspective as a neuroscientist provides additional and compelling insights. I recommend this book to anyone interested in cognition, psychology, philosophy, arts, or science -- basically, to just about anyone."
7,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1183993-nathan,4,"Ignore my bias of working in a body-centered cognitive neuroscience laboratory (whose nascence was likely inspired by researchers such as Demasio), but Demasio's theory resonates as a particularly well-informed ""big-level"" brain theory. I've read a number of others who attempt to explain away a lot of the mysteries of the brain by big-level theories, but Demasio turns out to build one of the more compelling set of explanations based mostly on evidence from his years of research in dissociation studies in neurology. Where others fail by skirting the issues of how neural structures and organization can lead to self consciousness and the link between mind and body, Demasio succeeds. His message is simple: we must not forget the entire biological organism when analyzing the brain. The fallout from this main thesis is that proper ""cool-headed reasoning"", decision making, and logical thought is influenced by emotion, and vice versa. This symbiosis theme continues as we are taught to remember that the brain is part of the body, and the body is part of the brain. Forgetting the strong coupling between the two is denying the reality of the situation. A brain in a vat is no brain at all. Stylistically, Demasio writes an engaging tale. The book is meant for a general audience, but I guess that most people unfamiliar with the brain structures, competing theories, and the general debate in philosophy of mind will find the content a bit heavy and must re-read certain passages. The book sags a bit in the middle (editor please!), but Demasio's theories of self to be found in the closing chapters are well worth the wait.I won't delve too much into the implications for neuroscience, but Demasio's claim only makes our task to describe the brain all the more difficult. He sides with high-level theorists, pointing out that no matter how well we understand the constituent units of our neurological system, it is not sufficient to describe behavior until we account for the whole picture. This means that every high-level experiment needs to understand that behavioral results can be not only task-related but also influenced by background emotion, something difficult to measure and control.  Bref: He's successfully left me with some new ideas and has made a compelling thesis. Congrats."
8,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45676923-mr,1,"very bad. the title takes on a literal meaning as this book is good for: 1. a further explication but just largely a complete repetition of Descartes' philosophy under the guise of a 'correction'2. never pointing out any errors Descartes actually made, and falling in to all of the same traps Descartes did, most of which were pointed out in the 17th century. "
9,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1360306-joshua-stein,4,"Damasio's book is terrific, and works both as an introduction and a good guide for those studying neuroscience and cognitive science. The scientific case studies are easily accessible and thorough (it features, by far, the most thorough assessment of the Phineas Gage case that I've come across) as are the discussions of circuitry. Damasio does use some unqualified terms, but he does a reasonable job at keeping the very technical discussions brief or relatively well qualified by the context of the case studies.There are a lot of areas that Damasio glosses over, but that is largely because he is attempting to cover a fairly massive scope, in terms of science. The text really is about the science, and it is only towards the end that Damasio really begins to address the philosophical assessment, at all. There are some interesting methodological considerations for those who are approaching this book from the ""philosophy of mind"" bent, as I am. I strongly recommend paying attention to Damasio's relatively interchangeable use of functions usually seen as properties of mind, and the the circuitry of the brain. Damasio is a brilliant writer, and there is a lot of thought put into that particular assessment of causal relationships.The assessments of evolutionary psychology are very interesting, though I do have some skepticism with regard to some of Damasio's claims about genetics and the development of the brain, as he is not entirely clear about the role of genetics in the emergence of structures in the brain. There's a sort of weird micro/macrostructure distinction that isn't entirely clear to me, and I wish that portion of the text had been more lucid.That is really nit-picky, though. I think that, overall, this is one of the best books on the subject that I have come across. I really like Damasio's writing style, though the asides can be a little rough, and feel a bit disjointed. Overall, this is a terrific overview of the science and the repercussions on philosophical theories, both historical and contemporary. Damasio doesn't present this as a screed against Descartes (which would be gratuitous, as writers like Dan Dennett have already beaten that horse well to deal at this point) but instead allows his account of the brain to be taken in its proper philosophical context. Definitely a terrific text."
10,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/185000-jon-stout,4,"Antonio Damasio has written a fascinating book, taking as his point of departure a nineteenth century case of a man named Gage who had an iron spike neatly blown through his brain in a mining accident. Gage seemed to retain all of his faculties, amazingly enough, but failed in his later life due to emotional problems. Damasio, a neurologist, uses the case to explore the relationship between emotions and the neurological structure of the brain.A friend recommended this book to me because of our mutual interest in the philosophical problem of free will, especially as illuminated by the nature of the emotions. Damasio addresses these problems by showing how emotions are related to a particular portion of the brain (ventro-medial cortex), and how emotions function on a basic level as instinctual (non-voluntary) responses to environmental situations. As animals evolve or as human beings grow up, the brain develops these instinctual responses to have a conscious, cognitive component (free, rational thinking) while still using the mechanisms of the primitive instincts.Damasio reacts to Descartes by criticizing his mind-body dualism, although this is old hat. Seemingly everybody since Descartes has knocked the dualism and still made use of the mind-body distinction.My favorite part is Damasio's discussion of how one's emotional life plays an important part in rational thinking, by recalling bodily feelings which give a coloration to this line of reasoning or that. My analogy would be that emotions are like the sound box of a guitar, which gives timber and resonance to the vibration of the strings. John Dewey quotes George Santayana as talking about the ""hushed reverberations"" which give richness to life. These are the emotions, as Damasio describes them neurologically."
11,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2689041-jeremy-lent,5,"I’ve been reading Damasio “backwards”. One of the first books I read three years ago to try to understand the neuroscientific view of consciousness was Damasio’s The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness published in 1999. That gave me a solid grounding in Damasio’s view of embodied consciousness, which has become a foundation of my thinking. Later, I came across Damasio’s paper on the somatic marker hypothesis, which powerfully rejects the idea that abstract thinking can take place without a direct connection to the body’s bio-regulatory processes.With this context, when I finally read Descartes’ Error, (probably Damasio’s most cited book), it had some of the characteristics of a quaint, historical document, making the case for embodied cognition as though it were a radical new idea: “Surprising as it may sound, the mind exists in and for an integrated organism.” I guess that shows the enormous impact Damasio himself (and others such as Edelman, LeDoux, etc.) have had in changing perceptions about consciousness in a mere fifteen years. Thanks to these ground-breaking neuroscientists, “we’ve come a long way, baby.”I can only agree with the array of distinguished names that cite Descartes’ Error as a key book for understanding human consciousness. Through Damasio, Phineas Gage has become a household name (in certain households!) – the emblematic tragic figure whose prefrontal cortex was severely damaged in 1848, and whose consequent experiences paved the way for the neurological understanding of the prefrontal importance in regulation of emotion, complex decision-making and general executive functioning.I think there are two fundamental take-aways from Damasio’s classic: (1) the mind is embodied and without this foundation, no approaches to higher cognitive functions or theories of consciousness have much validity, and (2) the prefrontal cortex (pfc) is the crucial mediator between our “innate regulatory circuits” and our self-aware consciousness, with its attributes of reason, willpower, symbolization, abstraction, etc.Damasio’s work is a significant resource for my research project. However, an initial impression of my thesis of “the tyranny of the pfc” might be that it’s incompatible with Damasio. After all, if the pfc is the key bridge between bodily regulation and self-awareness, how can there be a “tyranny” of the pfc? And what sense does my distinction of conceptual and animate consciousness make if conceptual consciousness is fundamentally connected with animate consciousness? In fact, though, my approach is not only consistent with Damasio, it relies squarely on the work of Damasio and others for its evidence.My argument is not that an individual’s prefrontal cortex is, by itself, a “tyrant” of our consciousness, but that our Western cultural milieu, imposed on an infant’s perceptions before s/he has even learned to speak, shapes the individual brain in such a way that our sense of identity and values give an inappropriate priority to pfc-mediated attributes (such as planning, reason, abstraction, logic, etc.) at the expense of a balanced self-identity emphasizing such attributes as integrated mind/body experience or full awareness of the present moment.Here’s a key passage from the book which relates to my notion of a split between animate and conceptual consciousness: From an evolutionary perspective, the oldest decision-making device pertains to basic biological regulation; the next, to the personal and social realm; and the most recent, to a collection of abstract-symbolic operations under which we can find artistic and scientific reasoning, utilitarian-engineering reasoning, and the developments of language and mathematics. But although ages of evolution and dedicated neural systems may confer some independence to each of these reasoning/decision-making ‘modules,’ I suspect they are all interdependent.What Damasio describes as the “collection of abstract-symbolic operations” is essentially the same as my idea of “conceptual consciousness.” As he pointedly emphasizes, they are “interdependent.” But Plato, St. Augustine, Descartes and the whole momentum of Western civilization have idealized the conceptual consciousness as “the soul,” as the proof of our very existence, and as the foundation for science and civilization. It’s only when we begin to re-balance our values to give equal import to our bodily existence that we can begin to move towards a ‘democracy of consciousness.’So thanks, Antonio Damasio, for your ground-breaking classic. Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in gaining a serious understanding of human consciousness."
12,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2915426-tippy-jackson,4,"I was just finishing up chapter 8, the somatic-marker hypothesis. I find this idea fascinating! What it made me think of, interestingly enough, was my old Social Science class. My teacher had said that we are born with only a few innate behaviors and everything else is learned. Because we are learning everything we know, it is so deeply ingrained in us, that even when we actively try to be objective and to sort of turn off our cultural bias, it is impossible. He pointed to the book Return to Laughter as an example. He was explaining that this is one of the biggest challenges of anthropology. But after reading this hypothesis, it makes me think of that again. Not only is much of what we know and do culturally learned, but what we learn is even marked in our brain to help us make quick decisions! (Or rather our brain connected specific classes of stimuli with specific classes of somatic state, and our automated somatic-marker device is based on the ""education to the standards of rationality of that [our:] culture."" It is in effect a marker based on our secondary emotions) This book has really done a compelling job of explaining this hypothesis, both biologically and circumstantially. I appreciate its thoroughness and originality. I picked this book up because I've seen it referenced over and over again in many animal intelligence or animal mind books and I wanted to see what the fuss was about. That being said, I'm coming at this book from a zoologist perspective, not a neurologist perspective, so I haven't really been keeping up with current ideas in the brain science world. So far, reading what I have has made me want to go and look up more current research on this idea. This book was published in '94, but it seems that many more current books are referencing it and now I'm really curious to find out if these ideas have been tested more or what other ideas there are out there. Also, I love that he opened with Phineas Gage and his use of case studies is very helpful. Having finished the book now, there are a few other things he brings up which I found interesting. He distinguishes between pain and suffering, which is referenced in animals in translation. Essentially, he explains that suffering has an emotional component. Pain can be simply the physical responses, i.e. neurons firing, hormones/neurotransmitters released. He uses examples from humans who have had a leucotomy. Also, he defines the difference between feelings and emotions. He specifies that acknowledging that there is a physical (and rational) component to feelings/emotions does not mean that prescription drugs should necessarily be used for treating emotions, or performing any treatment that ignores the mind-body relationship, which he also throughly details. He explains that what we refer to as the mind cannot exist without receiving feedback from the body as he ponders the ""brain hooked up to electrodes"" question. "
13,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33092929-tina,2,"Two words: Very Dry.Book is not suited for layman readers. If you have not taken a university-levelled neurobiology course, you will be lost. You must be familiar with neuroanatomy before diving into this book, it makes for a smoother read (but still very taxing).Damasio's research a nutshell: emotions are just as equally important as reason in decision making. Patients with neocortical damage in prefrontal cortex of brain are unique cases of ""functional beings without any affects"" -- they maintain their IQ and all relevant physiological control, except the use of emotions. This results in alienation in all social circumstances. They essentially become social deviants, unable to make any effective (or acceptable) decisions in any situations. BTW: descartes' OWN philosophy has nothing to do with this book. Rather, Damasio critiqued the schools of Rationality (and ancient Stoics for that matter) -- how it undermined the importance of FEELINGS in all capacities. Reason and logic? Not enough. If Reason and Logic were the ONLY qualities required to make effective decisions, then Damasio's patients would've been the ""Ideal Rational Being"". But instead these patients were shunned by family and friends, lost their jobs, cannot maintain any effective interpersonal relationships. So, kids, feel those feels. go nuts."
14,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98272-matt,0,"A very intriguing book exploring the relationship between reason and emotion. Having grappled with how the two can complement each other for most of my life, I'm digging it. The author uses historical medical examples of bizarre cases of brain damage, such as the story of Phineas Gage, a construction foreman from the 1800s who survived a 3-foot metal rod passing through his head, suffering nothing but blindness in his left eye physically but a whole slew of mental and emotional problems due to the precisely localized brain damage. Fascinating stuff."
15,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24892753-jon-boorstin,4,"Damasio takes advantage of some bizarre accidents to discover new things about the brain. Mainly, that decision making isn't rational, but involves a leap of faith. Very persuasive, and it jibes with William James's Will to Believe."

17,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21396405-gaby,3,"The book started off as easily accessible in terms of wording and concepts, but then got too academic and abstract near the end."
18,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25904223-abderrahmane-nadir,4,"Damasio recalls that he grew up “accustomed to thinking that the mechanisms for reason existed in a separate province of the mind, where emotion should not be allowed to intrude.” yet his experience with patients like"" phineas Gage ""convinced him that normal human reasoning is inextricably linked to emotionPure reason, reason uninfluenced by emotion, seems to occur only in pathological states that are characterized by impairment of day-to-day decision-making and social interaction. Says Damasio, “Certain aspects of the process of emotion and feeling are indispensable for rationality.” To think otherwise was Descartes’ error. “(The error was) the abyssal separation between body and mind, the suggestion that reasoning, and moral judgement, and the suffering that comes from physical pain or emotional upheaval might exist separately from the body. Specifically: the separation of the most refined operations of the mind from the structure and operation of a biological organism.”"
19,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/94560861-marta,3,"I give it a 3.5In the beginning of the book, Damásio states that he wants to write as if he was giving a lecture to someone who knows nothing about neuroscience, although it seemed to me that it was not accomplished. This book is not suited for those people. The only reason why I didn't feel completely lost at the most technical parts of the book, was because I previously had an introductory neuroscience class at college. I wouldn't be able to understand most of it if it wasn't for that particular class, giving that he explains complex ""stuff"" way too briefly for a beginner to fully grasp what he's trying to teach.On another note, he lost himself in thought, speculations and philosophies a lot, which made it hard for me to find the book captivating at some points.Of course that not all of it was bad. I give it a 3.5 because I really feel like it helped me have a slightly deeper knowledge on the field. After all, that's what I was aiming with this reading: some learning experience."
20,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/442654-andrew,0,"Embodied cognition, the notion of emotion as a sort of primitive rationality... I think these are ideas that were a bit more controversial in the '90s when Descartes' Error was published, and while I would still not quite call them fully accepted, it was interesting to read a clarion call for a more nuanced approach to cognitive science than is often presented to those of us in the general public. To be honest, I don't know enough about the details of the neuroscience to confirm or deny much of his research, but the conclusions he reached seemed to this layman's eyes to be logical."

It starts to get a little vague after the first chapter, then the content started to go above my head. As a person who likes to read books on Neuroscience, I couldn't keep with the details and their abstract nature even with a lot of effort. So stopped reading midway (which I usually don't). The author could have been more lucid with his explanations which could have been easy to visualize and comprehend."
22,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7198893-jonathan-karmel,3,"You need to rely on ""gut feelings"" to make good decisions. People who can't process emotions, such as people with very specific types of brain damage, can think and act logically, but on a personal level, they lack the necessary judgment to navigate all the choices that need to be made to live effectively.I had read about this ""somatic marker hypothesis"" in other places (Blink by Malcolm Gladwell and the Social Animal by David Brooks), so I was interested in reading the book where it came from. There is a lot of technical stuff in here about how brains work (neurobiology), and I did not have the patience or interest to try to understand this stuff, but I still thought it was interesting to see how the author lays out his theory.One thing I thought was really interesting was the distinction the author makes between primary and secondary emotions and feelings. Primary emotions (e.g. fear of snakes) probably developed at a much earlier stage of evolution. They are instinctual emotions that exist in many animals, and they are processed in the amygdala and the brain's limbic system. Then there are secondary emotions (e.g. romantic love) that are processed in the prefrontal cortex. The author distinguishes emotions from feelings of basic universal emotions, feelings of subtle universal emotions and background feelings: ""all emotions generate feelings if you are awake and alert, but not all feelings originate in emotions.""Descartes' error was to believe that mind and body were two separate things. According to this book, the error continues to influence us. For example, the author contends that in medical school, students generally do not study normal psychology, as if normal psychology is not a human bodily function. I thought it was really interesting to read the perspective of a scientist trying to understand the biological basis for thoughts and feelings who completely rejects the idea that they are somehow different from other bodily functions."
23,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10361209-dan-downing,5,"I discovered Antonio Damasio with ""Looking for Spinoza"" in 2003. The book captivated, stimulated and entranced me. Since then I have read extensively in the realms visited by Damasio which were new to me: Spinoza himself was an old friend.Somehow there was always something more enticing than ""Descartes' Error"", his first book. It has been on my list for over a decade, and practically every book in this general area mentions it, thus enticing me more. Recently Sam Kean's ""Dueling Neurosurgeons"" pushed me hard enough. I ordered the book, and now have read it.Much of the first part was familiar territory, as other authors have since quoted Damasio and cited his work extensively. As one goes deeper into the argument he evinces---and he clearly explains he is advancing an argument for understanding the mind, and what he writes is not holy writ---one gets caught up in the nuances and conflicts which have entered the world of neuroscience in the 20 years since ""Descates' Error' was published. One also realizes how much of a revolution in thought Damasio caused, and what an inspiration to others he has been.I thought that viewed from today's lofty peak (that is a joke) the most valuable---or perhaps more accurately, most compelling---parts were at the end. His thoughts on medicine, medical training, scientific co-operation, and the future of neuroscience still resonate with a freshness which borders on tragic. An entire generation has passed and all too much of what he contemplates not only remains unresolved, but has been aggravated.A monumental work, seminal, still relevant, still invigorating, this is Highly Recommended."
24,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14631356-michelle-marvin,5,"I'll be honest, I'm shocked that I liked this book as much as I did! I've read Damasio's 2010 book, ""Self Comes to Mind"" 4 times through now, and I'm very at odds with many of its premises and claims. Having read that book first, I approached ""Descartes' Error"" with an antagonistic stance, ready to fight ... and found myself bewildered as I was highlighting and underlining key philosophical presuppositions that weave throughout the book that I agree with. Mind and body are integrally connected, rationality is intertwined with emotion, the neocortex is built upon and draws from, but is not superior to on its own, the subcortical levels of the brain, etc. ""Necessary but not sufficient"" is a theme that runs throughout the book, with a high regard for the sublimity of the integral person as a whole that is not downgraded by the fascinating revelations brought out through neuroscientific findings. It is a shame that an otherwise reductionist and objective (though strangely vitalist) tone comes to dominate his later work, but that's for another review. I know there are differences among opinions in the reviews given here, but I personally loved his mix of quick-read narratives and scientific prose. Some of his hypotheses (i.e. phantom limbs are memories) have been either proven wrong or have more likely causal hypotheses that are in vogue now, but his more significant general claims are very much worth the read. I love the earlier Damasio, and this book has convinced me to give further investigation into more of his previous works!"
25,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1908418-rob,5,"Damasio takes on Descartes: why you cannot separate emotion from reason, the body and brain from the mind, and how brain-damaged patients provide us with these insights. More accessible if you're well-versed with brain anatomy. Damasio explains how body and brain constantly construct the image of our ""self"", changes in body states we perceive (feelings), and how reason and emotion use the same equipment. The book constantly warns against any sort of reductionism. I wasn't well-versed with brain anatomy, knowing only the big chunks (e.g. lobes, cerebellum, brain stem). It became obvious I can get more out of this book with a gazillion videos, pictures and Wikipedia articles; after which I felt I had the sufficient background to visualize the big wall of text on what's going on with long-ass-named parts such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and how it's connected to the other parts of the brain. Not a great popsci book, not a great introduction to neurobiology (?), but a great book. "

27,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8550-scott,4,"Dense psychology terminology, hides a beautiful argument that probably deserves more beautiful prose. This book is all about emotions and feelings, but unlike soft-core psych (read: Self-help books) it makes a substantive argument for why they are important, indeed inextricably linked to human decision making. Sure, that may seem self-evident, but the argument and the studies that back it up are amazing. Who would have thought to test whether spinal cord injury patients feel emotions to a lesser extent than normal people. "

Reintegrates the mind, body, emotions and reason through more than just philosophical musings. If you pick this up, it may be helpful to note that a) this is the first of three books in which he details his research findings, b) there is a lot of anatomical and neurological info - sometimes it may be necessary to skim those parts if that's not you're field of study and c) I think his concept of reason (here) can best be described as ""social reason.""

29,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98058161-daniel-solomon,4,"This book sets out one of the best available theories of the role of feelings and emotions in human thinking, the somatic market hypothesis. In a nutshell, emotions and feelings are markers of the value of different things and situations in making decisions. Without these markers of values, rational decisions by the human mind would be impossible.This is a significant improvement over a more traditional view that emotional and rational thinking are opposite. The distinction between emotions as body states and feeling as the conscious awareness of an emotional state is also novel I think and has been used in later research.The book deserves high mark just for that, and for explaining key concepts and ideas in clear prose for the educated layperson. As someone who's more into the big picture perspective of cognitive/social science and philosophy of mind it was hard to follow Damasio's enthusiasm for more detailed biological/neuroscience descriptions and explanations. But it's hard to fault the author for that, let's just say some parts of the book can be skimmed more quickly if one's main interest is in a higher level understanding of the relation between emotions and rational thinking."

It reminds me of The Paradox of Choice, in that it argues a certain philophical position which being strongly rooted in amazing research (in that case microeconomics, in this case nuerology). this guy realy geeks out when he gets into hardcore neurology and he's tough to follow (and as a lay reader, I didn't really feel the need to try and follow at this point anyway) and as with The Paradox, the editor could have done a better job in trimming this up (book contracts are for a certain number of pages, right?). Also there is an amazing photo of the author that is real gay.He does a nice job of summarizing his theses in the introduction: 1. ""Emotions and feelings may not be the intruders in the bastion of reason at all: they may be enmeshed in its networks, for worse _and_ for better"". 2. ""The essence of a feeling may not be an elusive mental quality attached to an object, but rather the direct perception of a specific landscape: that of the body"". 3. The body, as represented in the brain, may constitute the indispensible frame of reference for the neural processes that we experience as the mind"".

34,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17367460-jim-angstadt,5,"I need to make more sense of the introduction. I suspect that the meat of the book is embedded in the intro.Chap 1 and 2 deal with Phineas Gage and his modern day incarnation. This is an effective way to demonstrate that damage to specific parts of the prefrontal cortex can result in socially un-acceptable behavior, behavior that ignores long-term consequences, and is detrimental to the interests of the subject. And, significantly, all standard tests, of the time, did not show an organic problem.In Chap 3, a modern-day Phineas Gage is Elliot, who also has prefrontal damage and a strong lack of social awareness and planning and decision-making.Chap 4 introduces the idea that a ""reduction in emotion may constitute an ... important source of irrational behavior."" After reviewing other cases of brain damage, in humans and in monkeys, Damasio identifies the brain locations that seem most connected to lose of social function: - ventromidial, in the split between the left and right sides, above the corpus callosum.- amygdala- dorsolateral or left and right sides of prefrontal contex.- somatosensory, the 'lightening bolt' on the side of the left hemisphere.Damasio also touches on the role of neurochemical transmitters, such as Prozac, as only one factor, among many, that must be considered when understanding the full behavior and impact of treatment.Chap 5: Assembling an Explanation.""...having a mind means that an organism forms neural representations which can become images, be manipulated by a process called thought, and eventually influence behavior by helping predict the future, plan accordingly, and choose the next action.""""An integrated mind from parcellated activity."" The sensory subsystems do their own processing and create a representation which can be stored and accessed later. Or, combined with other representations to form a whole, ie, a representation that links to the other relevant representations. That whole may be about now, a perceptual image, or past, a recalled image, or the future.Chap 6: Biological regulation and survival.Pre-organized mechanisms, such as maintaining blood sugar levels, are not consciously monitored by the brain, but they do classify things or events as ""good"" or ""bad"" due to their impact on survival. This ""good or bad"" then extends to other related things or events. These patterns are ""maintained in circuits of the brain stem and hypothalamus.""Chap 7: Emotions and FeelingsPrimary Emotions: Innate, pre-organized, Jamesian, depends on limbic system, amygdala and anterior cingulate.Secondary Emotions: process in the pre-frontal contex.Chap 8: The Somatic-Marker HypothesisWhen we consider a situation, we instantly remember sketchy memories and filter out the undesirable options, while paying more attention to the options with positive rewards. Rather that considering a ton of options, we now consider much fewer; thus, we can process, cognitively, and in detail, the fewer remaining options with greater efficiency.Our body associates an option with a remembered reward/pain. Our body actually senses a pain, as a memory of an undesirable outcome. Hence the somatic (body) marker (memory) theory. The memory can be real, or it can be a remembered memory, an 'as if' memory. In either case, we react to the memory and reject the undesirable outcome.Chap 9: Testing the Somatic-Marker HypothesisLab tests show that subjects with pre-frontal-cortext damage are not able to factor-in the effects of repeated experience. They can logically state the pro/con but cannot translate that to prediction of the future, and consequently, to a better course of action.They do not sense those stimuli which have an emotional content. With risk-taking tasks, they cannot factor-in the negatives.Chap 10: The Body-Minded Brain""The organism [body] actively modifies itself so that the interfacing [eg: view an object] can take place. The body proper is not passive.""Efficiently promote survival by ""representing the outside world in terms of the modifications it causes in the body proper."" Another representation. First, a dispositional representation, then an 'as if', now a primordial representation. Dual signals, one from the special sensor (eg ear), another from the skin near the signal.We construct a state of self from: 1) a constant refresh of our personal history, 2) primordial reps. 3) constantly updating. Slight delay. ""We are hopelessly late for consciousness."" Having an image is not enough, attention and awareness are also required, which imply self. Also need 'third-party ensemble' to receive disp. rep. and self rep. Ie, ""building a disp. rep. of the self in the process of changing as the organism responds to an object.""Chap 11 and 12 conclude."

37,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75043917-momo-bradham,1,"Let me be clear: I'm not giving this book 1/5 stars because its science is outdated. I disagree with the framework in which Damásio presents his argument, which makes me sad, because I agree with the general premise: emotions are a crucial faction of reasoning (In 2018, this should come as no big surprise to many of us; however, this was also not new science for 1994.). Here's why I didn't like the book: Damásio doesn't actually point out any ""errors"" in Descartes' work. In fact, he's stolen much of Descartes' work and has made it his own. The language is also very painful to read and reeks of narcissism.Descartes doesn't get his champion defender. Instead, Damásio does not even tell us of the alleged ""error"" until nineteen pages away from the book's ending, where he uses a famous Descartes quote out of context:What then, was Descartes' error? Or better still, which error of Descartes' do I mean to single out, unkindly and ungratefully? One might begin with a complaint, and reproach him for having persuaded biologists to adopt, to this day, clockwork mechanics as a model for life processes. (I wondered here how he could have somehow forgotten all the medical limitations pre-Descartes, the ones Descartes helped eradicate? Also, as I'll explain later, if you believe emotions to be neurological calculations just the same as reason, and intimately mixed with reason, (and they are), then Descartes is still very, very much so correct.)  But perhaps that would not be quite fair and so one might continue with 'I think therefore I am.' The statement, perhaps the most famous in the history of philosophy, appears first in the fourth section of the 'Discourse on the Method' (1637), in French ('Je pense donc je suis""); and then in the first part of the 'Principles of Philosophy' (1644), in Latin ('Cogito ergo sum'). (Damásio produces wordy, irrelevant information such as this throughout the book.) Taken literally, the statement illustrates precisely the opposite of what I believe to be true about the origins of mind and about the relation between mind and body. It suggests that thinking, and awareness of thinking, are the real substrates of being. (248)Okay... firstly, Descartes' mantra ""I think, therefore I am"" is not to be taken literally IF you are referring to a biological, human brain. This should be pretty obvious, as it is obvious that a biological, human brain can still exist without thought in the event that the brain is lifeless. Descartes makes room for this with his analogy of the machine; specifically, with res extensa (measurable things). Descartes' ""I think, therefore I am"" means this: If I can ask myself if I exist, then I must exist. Secondly, as stated earlier, what Descartes argues in  Discourse on Method still applies to the mind with or without the ""additional"" faction of emotions. My guess is that Damásio is confusing the God aspect of Descartes' machine theory with res cogitans (thinking things). Here's my logic: emotions are a part of the neurological machinery. The fact that the brain can, and does, change itself in response to emotional stimuli in its environment does not change the fact that emotions are ""calculated"" on a neurological level, like a machine. We now have computers that can adapt to their surroundings, as well. If a computer can respond to emotional stimuli, does that mean its not a machine? By Damásio's reasoning, your smart phone's facial recognition algorithm is not an algorithm at all. We know for a fact it is an algorithm in the phone, just as we can now confirm Descartes' theory that the biological body functions as a machine on a neurological level. Our machine is just far more complicated than we expected in the 1600s; and so, we can now include in the science the more complicated faction of reason and logic we call emotion."

39,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29791454-domhnall,5,"I have already read Damasio's 2003 book, Looking for Spinoza: Joy, Sorrow, and the Feeling Brain, and while it was interesting to read this book, published in 1994, it does not add to what the later book contained, the later book travels further and I preferred the more philosphical style of the more recent book. The strength of this particular book is its painstaking accumulation of evidence, which for some readers will be what they most desire, but for others will appear dry [though in fairness, his clinical case studies are fascinating and more than slightly disturbing]. I have long felt that Damasio's account of the embodied nature of our minds, his materialist account of human consciousness, is superior to any other that I have read, and for this I recommend going straight to Looking for Spinoza."
40,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/964406-nick,4,"The book starts with neuroscience's cause celebre - a man whose head was pierced by a metal stake that passed through his neck and out of the top of his head. The fact that he survived is astonishing, and is where many neuroscientists in the past have stopped, having proven some point or another about neuroanatomical structure. Damasio not only provides us with gorgeous detail about the tragic accident that resulted in Phineas Gage's custom-made tamping rod exploding through his skull, he also follows Gage after his initial recovery into a tragic story of the downfall of a once-proud man. As well as Gage, Damasio offers many more intriguing stories of brain damage and other ailments that affect the way that we operate in our social environments and in doing so he makes a very strong case for the reintegration into science of emotion. Damasio complains that emotion has been ignored for too long - perhaps because of the over-riding desire to be logical and ""scientific"". However, even if (as Descartes would have us believe) it is possible to think and act logically, that does not mean that we cannot logically study the emotions. On the contrary, it is the passion, insight, intuition and inspiration that has produced the greatest advances in science - great innovators just knew they were right even when nobody else believed it. More specifically, Damasio argues that it is precisely when people lose their ability to evaluate emotionally that they become paralysed by logical thought. Certain syndromes result in people being unable to choose the right option, even when one may involve losing a job or a friendship. Damasio's answer is to propose a model of thought that gives the emotions a key part in cognitive processes, and demanding that the Dualism so popular in science that follows Descartes is consigned to the history books.If you are not entirely convinced that emotion plays a part in our most logical thought processes, consider these 2 points: 1. Descartes reasoned that the only truth any of us can be sure of is that ""I think therefore I am"". One error he made was that he did not take his logical analysis 1 step further. How do we know we think? We feel we know. Without the feeling that we know we would not be so sure that we think. This is not how Descarte's error is explained in the book, but it is what I have learned from it. 2. Our primary sense is not vision. It may be the one we are most aware of using, but vision depends on another sense: Touch. Not touch at the end of the fingertips, but touch as our whole skin. We touch our environment by taking a position within it, and only when we know where we are and how we are situated in our environment can we start using our other senses as comparative measures. We feel who we are and where we are. Without touch we have no awareness, and without awareness we have no thought."
41,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5513893-marlan,4,"This one took me a while to get through, probably because I deal with neuroscience on a daily basis at work, so it's not usually my first topic-of-choice when picking up a book to read. But this was a classic, and I wanted to give it a go. So I did. And it was good. The book is pretty science-y, and thus not easy reading, but it was good.Probably the biggest, most ground-breaking theory proposed in the book is the somatic marker hypothesis. This hypothesis stands on a soapbox and yells, ""Hey all you scienceheads! Listen up! Emotions are supremely important for how we make decisions. That includes ALL of us, including the hardcore logical Spock types. Just because some histrionic overemotional types can be 'irrational' doesn't mean we can poo-poo emotion as a whole. Emotion is an integral part of how the brain makes decisions with inadequate information, a critically important part of being human. Look at how screwed up are the guys that damage that part of the brain!""It was kind of a rational attack on the uber-rational, if you will. The book goes into tons of detail as to how the brain & body use these somatic markers, so much so that I think it'd be a hard book to read without a science background. The emotion bit is only part of the book; a lot actually talks about the brain's awareness of its own body, which is useful for figuring out what consciousness is, too.Anyway, I appreciated the book. It was solid and well-grounded. Definitely a must-read for neuroscience and philosophy-of-mind types.Side note: I hope I don't give the impression that I'm a big Damasio-phile, because I'm not. Having trained at the University of Iowa (where he was at), I've heard plenty of stories about his many personal flaws. I even got a sense of them in the book, when he would insert short notes on art appreciation or ethics without any scientific backing at all. But I suppose he's not the first scientist to use impeccable science in his science, and poor science with his everyday life. Oh well.I also thought it was funny (at least in the first chapter or two) when he would quote scientist after scientist in support of his proposals. Of course, having worked at Iowa, I recognized many of them as other researchers in and around his lab. :DBut anywho. Don't let those detract. The book has some phenomenally good ideas, if you're willing to dive into the science."
42,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8259482-renah,4,"Fascinating. I'll be reading this again. I'd be very interested in reading the responses to this 'modern classic' in neuroscience... I'm sure lots has been written since this was published to support and criticize his ideas. But his two main ideas (really two parts of the same idea)-- that reason and emotion are intrinsically linked because emotion is essentially a body state reported to us and used to understand the world and make decisions and judgments, and that the body and brain cannot actually be ""split"" into mind and body--- both intriguing and loaded with implications. I like Frederich Buechner's thoughts on the second of those two topics--lines up with Damasio's neurobiological theories quite nicely: ""Immortal means death-proof. To believe in the immortality of the soul is to believe that though John Brown’s body lies a-mouldering in the grave, his soul goes marching on simply because marching on is the nature of souls just the way producing apples is the nature of apple trees. Bodies die, but souls don’t. True or false, this is not the biblical view, although many who ought to know better assume it is. The biblical view differs in several significant ways... As someone has put it, the biblical understanding of man is not that he has a body but that he is a body...The Greeks spoke of (the body) as the prison house of the soul. The suggestion was that to escape it altogether was something less than a disaster. The Bible, on the other hand, sees the body in particular and the material world in general as a good and glorious invention...All the major Christian creeds affirm belief in resurrection of the body. In other words they affirm the belief that what God in spite of everything prizes enough to bring back to life is not just some disembodied echo of a human being but a new and revised version of all the things which made him the particular human being he was and which he needs something like a body to express: his personality, the way he looked, the sound of his voice, his peculiar capacity for creating and loving, in some sense his face...The idea of the immortality of the soul is based on the experience of man’s indomitable spirit. The idea of the resurrection of the body is based on the experience of God’s unspeakable love."""
43,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57079482-chuck-kollars,4,"The main point of this book -revolutionary when it was first published, but now fairly commonplace- is that emotions are NOT the opposite of logic/reason, that in fact they are _integral_ to the best reasoning. Without them, reason doesn't work very well. This book is an easy read - it's short and well-written; nevertheless it dives pretty deeply into neuroscience, so much so that I'm a bit reluctant to recommend it to a general reader who has absolutely no familiarity with neuroscience. With my background and my other reading, and the book's reputation as being far more clearly written than most other things on similar topics, I expected this to be a breeze. It wasn't -- I reread many paragraphs, finally reread an entire chapter, and still am not at all confident I ""get it"". There are a couple reasons this _may_ be specific to me rather than something general. First, for many years I've tended to skip over all descriptions of fMRI brain scans, as likely being over-interpreted to the point of being the current age's phrenology. A resulting side effect is I'm completely unfamiliar with the names of different brain sections and largely unfamiliar with the brain's geography. Here it mattered. And second, the author is _very_ careful about his exactly accurate use of terms. He doesn't call attention to it, and the text doesn't feel at all awkward because of it, but woe to him (i.e. me) who just skims a definition or doesn't pay attention to _exactly_ which term is being used. The Penguin paperback I read -printed eleven years after the original publication- was pretty bare-bones. Only one fairly conventional font is used for everything. Notes are hard to find because the list of notes is divided by chapter _number_ but every page of the main text repeats the chapter _title_ . Sidebars are noted only by a vertical line at the left margin and can easily be misinterpreted as part of the main text. As one might expect of a paperback there are no photos, but there are not even hardly any drawings, and this lack seems to be due to the book itself rather than to the paperback edition. The drawings I particularly missed, as there was no alternative I could refer to if I didn't understand a bit of the text. "

I don't understand everything, but enough to have an idea of what is going on - more or less...The author draws a connection between feelings and rationality. Just cold rationality without the involvement of feelings is defective. People with a specific braing injury retain their rationality, but it does not involve feelings, so they made some odd choices and have ""rational"" reactions without emotion. They also have trouble visualizing the future of choices. The brain is not just thoughts - feelings and thought are bound together to result in the essential being.Some things I found interesting:""What worries me is the acceptance of the importance of feelings without any effort to understand their complex biological sociocultural machinery. The best example of this attitude can be found in the attempt to explain bruised feelings or irrational behavior by appealing to surface social caues or the action of neurotransmitters, two explanations that pervade the social discourse as presented in the visual and printed media; and in the attempt to correct personal and social problems with medical and nonmedical drugs. It is precisely this lack of understanding of the nature of feelings and reason (one of the hallmarks of the ""culture of complaint"") that is cause for alarm.""""On a practical note, the role outlined for feelings in the making of rationality has implications for some issues currently facing our society, education and violence among them. This is not the place to do justice to those issues but let me comment that educational systems might benefit from emphasizing unequivocal connections between current feelings and predicted future outcomes, and that children's overexposure to violence, in real life, newscasts, or through audiovisual fiction, downgrades the value of emotions and feelings in the acquisition and deployment of adaptive social behavior. The fact that so much vicarious violence is presented with a moral framework only compounds the desensitizing action."""

One of the biggest (and more controversial) ideas that Damasio puts forward here is his theory of somatic markers, which, in a nutshell states that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is a 'convergence zone' that collects and stores information (manifested in the form of neuronal circuits or neuronal dispositions) generated by the organism's bodily experience of pain and/or pleasure--whether such experience is processed consciously, on a high cognitive level, or processed as a 'gut-level' emotional response, or processed unconsciously (e.g., reactions in the skin or pulse)--which information is used in the organism's future decision-making. Another highly interesting hypothesis (and related to the somatic marker hypothesis) advanced near the book's end is that subjectivity (the feeling one has of being a self) is the result of a complex cascade of neuronal dispositions, conditioned by the organism's bodily experience (though some dispositions are presumably innate), followed by neuronal reactions to those dispositions, and reactions to THOSE dispositions, and so on. Once all of those dispositions are collated in the powerful convergence zones of the brain, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the organism experiences feelings of being a self, with agency (and there are rather obvious reasons why evolutionary processes would have selected for organisms that experience this sense of agency). Once language enters into the process, we become an 'I' and a 'me'.'Behind your thoughts and feelings, my brother, there stands a mighty ruler, an unknown sage--whose name is self. In your body he dwells; he is your body.' -Friedrich Nietzsche, 'Thus Spake Zarathustra'"
46,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24339688-mischa-andrews,4,"This is an exploration of human reasoning - a topic that has traditionally been represented by philosophers and generalists - seen from a neurobiological perspective. We need more work like this if we are to overcome misconceptions from ancient and modern philosophy and come to understand how the brain really works.The book is 20 years old but remains relevant, and I get the impression that it directly influenced the lecturers I studied under in neuroscience and psychology (but not so much philosophy). Don't get me wrong, I think that philosophy is important - but we are at an ideal time to contribute to philosophical discussions with neurological data and models.The content of the book is focused on a hypothesis, backed by research and examples, that emotion is an essential part of decision-making. The body and mind are not disconnected entities: they are intimately tied together. While most of us know of the potential dangers that emotions can pose on our reasoning, we tend to be unaware of the importance it plays in effective decision-making, and the devastating effects that occur without emotions to guide us.Antonio explains this idea (namely his 'somatic marker hypothesis') in great detail and with vivid examples. At times I thought there was too much detail or repetition - but this was probably important when the book was released, before it influenced others and became more accepted.Overall, this is an interesting read and an important piece of work, but most of it is not exactly an easy read, as it contains details of neurobiological processes and theories.I'm very interested to read its modern successors!"
47,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2413543-greg-collver,4,"Most of it was beyond my level of comprehension, but I'd like to read it again after I have learned more about the anatomy of the brain and about the somatosensory systems. I think his writing could be improved, but his thoughts are very important.A paragraph in his postscript was of special interest:[An] important target for biomedical efforts should be the alleviation of suffering in mental diseases. But how to deal with the suffering that arises from personal and social conflicts outside the medical realm is a different and entirely unresolved matter. The current trend is to make no distinction at all and utilize the medical approach to eliminate any discomfort. The proponents of the attitude have an attractive argument. If an increase in serotonin levels, for instance, can not only treat depression but also reduce aggression, make you less shy, and turn you into a more confident person, why not take advantage of the opportunity? Would any but the most spoilsport, puritanical creature deny a fellow human being the benefits of all these wonder drugs? The problem, of course, is that the choice is not clear-cut, for a large number of reasons. First, the long-range biological effects of the drugs are unknown. Second, the consequences of socially massive drug intake are equally mysterious. Third, and perhaps most important of all: If the proposed solution to individual and social suffering bypasses the causes of individual and social conflict, it is not likely to work for very long. It may treat a symptom, but it does nothing to the roots of the disease."
48,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6486762-karol,4,"First of all, I'll admit it: it was a bit presumptuous of me to think I could pick up a book on neuroscience and think I could breeze my way through it. This was dense, intricate, and high-level enough in the science that I found myself consulting other sources just to make sure I was properly understanding it. Second, some aspects of the key argument of this book have since been successfully contested through further research. That doesn't invalidate a lot of what Damasio has put forth, and is no reason to ignore this work. You'd think these two would lower the rating quite a bit, but given the complexity of what the author tackles, I'm surprised so much was explained so succinctly (and yet a good half of the book slowly eases you into the central thesis and the heavy lifting of examination). The Phineas Gage story provides the initial glimpse into the argument being constructed, and from that, hard science and philosophy of the mind are woven together in a way that makes me wish I'd done a better job of really learning both. In short, the author posits that the titular error was in separating emotion from reason, and thus the entirety of the dualistic treatment of mind and body is thrown into question. In developing what he calls the somatic marker hypothesis, Damasio proposes that emotional input is a key aspect of rationality - in effect, that the two are inseparable. It's provoked a lot of thought on my end, and while it's definitely not light reading, I still think it's a very worthwhile endeavor. "
49,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/287113-ulf-kastner,3,"Taking the infamous and oft-referred-to Phineas Gage incident (a fairly well-documented case from mid-19th century Vermont in which a very highly functioning rail construction foreman survives a large steel rod blasting through his brain with surprising consequences) as a diving board into a realm of folks with emotionally crossed wires due to loss of various brain regions, Antonio Damasio develops various hypotheses regarding the nature of emotions and their intrinsic role in rational decision-making.Not an easy read as far as pop sci books go, but the subject matter and the originality of the ideas presented make the effort worthwhile in my estimation. If you read 
Phantoms in the Brain
 by V.S. Ramachandran and enjoyed the ride, this one might be for you.The concept of somatic markers which the book works towards as a pay-off of sorts in the final chapter strikes me as plausible and elegant to a degree that I find myself relating to it with increasing frequency now that I'm done with the book. A satisfying finish to an at times trying read."
50,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/705887-broodingferret,4,"I found this books fascinating. In short, Descartes' Error is a summary of the data and hypotheses behind Demasio's Somatic Marker Hypothesis, which postulates that reason and emotion are intricately intertwined, to the degree that the former will not function correctly without the latter. Basically, and this is quite a simplification, Demasio argues that the brain continuously monitors/manipulates the body so that, through an awareness (either implicit or explicit) of the body's state, an individual knows how to feel about a given situation or idea. This provides a context within which to make value judgements and determine courses of action. Again, that is seriously simplified, so read the book for the details, though do note that it is written mainly for a professional, rather than a lay, audience, so there is definitely jargon and some of the sections may be a bit of a slog. Demasio has quite a bit of data to back up some of his ideas, though quite a few other ideas are hypothetical and difficult to test, if they can be tested at all. It's also important to note that the book was published in 1994 and some of the hypotheses he puts forth have since been modified or demonstrated to be false. Still it was a fascinating read and certainly provides a refreshing change of perspective on emotion and its relation to reason."
51,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4582869-katja,4,"I thought the book would be more about Descartes' error and the ""body-mind problem"" but it turned out to be different from what I expected. Mainly, because for Damasio there is no real problem: the mind *is* embodied for sure, it is not just a piece of software running on the brain, it cannot be in any way separated from the body states. Part 1 of the book is absorbing, the story of Phineas Gage reads like a novel. I am not sure I could follow all of the arguments in Part 2 (some of them I found rather vague) but understanding the main points should be easy for anyone with a genuine interest in the subject. Damasio's attitude seems to be both humble and determined. Humble, because many neural mechanisms are far from being well-understood and because the ""sciences of the mind"" and neuroscience have been separated for a long time and have to catch up with each other. Determined, because one cannot overestimate the significance of understanding the real mind, one should not get frustrated by the sheer complexity of the brain. I personally liked a lot that the presented theory, or an outline thereof, seems (to me) compatible with certain branches of psychology. For example, the Jungian psychoanalysis could get a whole new interpretation with ""hard evidence"" from neuroscience. If there is a book connecting the two, I would love to read it. "
52,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4033991-joe,4,"Damasio opens with the intriguing historical case of Phineas Gage, a railroad worker whose frontal lobe was destroyed in an explosion by a steel-tamping tool. Gage changed from a quiet, compliant worker to a cursing adventure seeker who expatriated to South America to work as a cowboy then repatriated to San Francisco to continue as a rowdy. Damasio studies quite a few other cases, his point in these chapters being that body and spirit are not the separate entities that Descartes conjectured. In the middle chapters, Damasio—a noted neurologist—furthers his case with examples of patients whose various physical damage or diseases left their logical skills completely intact, while wrecking their life skills. Damasio theorizes that emotions—that maligned facet of humans—is not only intricate but indispensable in our lives. Lastly, Damasio theorizes that our body itself is an intricate part of our decision-making process, that it offers indispensable feedback that allows us to make decisions quickly rather than roiling about in loops of logical choices and their consequences. Damasio ends with his own theories of consciousness, a sort of ever-renewing steady-state between the body and the areas of the brain. This is not the easiest book around to read, for the physiology and logic combine intricately. It is, however, eye-opening and challenging. "
53,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3211932-fivebooks,0,"New York Times columnist David Brooks has chosen to discuss Descartes' Error: Emotion, Reason, and the Human Brain by Antonio Damasio on FiveBooks as one of the top five on his subject – Neuroscience, saying that:“…Damasio’s work concerns emotion and the role of emotion in decision-making. We have an idea that every day decisions are shaped by rational thinking, but Damasio worked with people who have suffered strokes, and as a result are incapable of feeling emotion. And far from making good decisions, they make terrible decisions, and their lives fall apart. His now widely accepted theory, the somatic marker hypothesis, suggests that is that emotion is how we value things, it’s our GPS system. So the error Descartes made was to separate the mind and the body, because you actually can’t have a brain thinking without those visceral reactions....""The full interview is available here: http://fivebooks.com/interviews/david... "
54,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6881657-cameron,4,"Although this book is 20 years old, the major concepts are as fresh today as they were back then. The difference today is that neuroscientists know a lot more about the details of how the various parts of the brain are connected than they did 20 years ago. Damasio is definitely one to follow and his research is top notch. In this book, he explains with great clarity and depth how the mind is not simply made up of the brain, but rather is a synthesis between the body AND the brain. He opines that from birth we develop or ""learn"" a variety of body states which he calls ""somatic markers"" which are basically reactions to our environment. These learned states are then replayed back to us each time we enter into similar environmental conditions. These body states are directly connected to various parts of our brains including our ancient emotional parts of our hindbrain. Definitely a good read for those interested to understand ""gut feelings"", feelings in general, and intuition."
55,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28621174-daniel-williams,5,"Can a technical book move you? Well, yes, it turns out it can. Not being exactly in the neuroscience but certainly overlapping with it in my day job, I struggled with a lot of the medical and biology jargon but the book's message is an excellent consciousness raiser.In short, our experience of emotion and life in general is determined from the body up. Every sensory experience, emotion and thought is a physical experience. Mind arises from and within body only (and disappears when the body dies), not the other way around and with no separation as modern thinking currently (and, it turns out, arbitrarily) tries to make. This book describes what's known about this process (of mind arising from body and functioning within it) eloquently and (considering the massive technical understanding required) simply enough for a wide audience to take something away from it.Thoroughly recommend."
56,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31211965-vasile-rotaru,5,"One couldn’t overstate the importance of Damasio’s book for the educated layman (but I don’t know if it is still considered accurate by neuroscientists themselves). It was, in 1994, a pioneering work in the popularization of the neurobiology of emotions. While his ideas about the mechanisms of higher cognition, explained in the last part of the book, are not so sophisticated as those proposed nowadays, the essential part of the book remains highly relevant (once again, for a layman). His main idea is, first, that pure reason, the one deprived of emotions, only occurs in pathological states and is accompanied by an impairment of the decision making process. Emotions are, thus, fundamental; they are evolutionary shortcuts that allow prioritizing and solving basic problems, generally linked to survival. Second, the human mind is, of course, the byproduct of the human brain, but it is equally depended upon the interactions between the brain, the rest of the body and the environment. "
57,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13126807-alex-rubenstein,4,"Damasio makes a persuasive case that reason does not guide the passions, but rather that reason is the servant of the passions. More clearly, Damasios studies support the idea that without emotion to guide us, our decisions are often wholly misguided and we are screwed. So, the somatic marker hypothesis tells us, we need emotions as a signal from bodily states to tell our brains how we should feel. We don't run because we are scared, we are scared because our body is pumping adrenaline and our heart rate increases and we are running. It's an interesting idea and seems to have much support. Even more, I like the idea that there is no ""mind"" without body and brain--that they are so intertwined. This is Descartes error (among others, which Hume and Kant have also discussed). The thesis is clear but he does often get extremely technical to the point of becoming very confusing, so some parts one must gloss over in retaining the larger essence of his ideas. 4 stars. "
58,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7700-kyle,0,"Fascinating read. Think that ""reasoning"" requires a ""cool head?"" Think again. Damasio sets out to explore the relationship between emotion and reason and finds that rather than diametrically opposed, reason basically requires emotional reactions. While exploring this link he also provides the most thought provoking interpretation of ""intuition"" I have ever encountered. The idea that when we encounter a familiar situation (read familiar sensory stimuli) we have a somatic (i.e. body) reaction first and only then our ""reasoning"" interprets the situation is so useful (and so similar to much in yoga). The ability then to notice our BODY reactions to situations and realize that they are habitual responses and to deal with them accordingly is shown to be even more useful. Lots of fodder for future thought. And thank goodness he has so many more books to enjoy!"
59,014303622X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6628534-ricardo-acu-a,4,"The separation of mind and body that Descartes proposed, is a concept that gradually with the progress of science is being left behind. Damasio discussed in this book his ideas and hypotheses (yet to be proven), showing the union of body and mind. At times the book becomes repetitive and cyclical exposure of ideas. However, ""Descartes' error"" is demonstrated with several clinical cases. From what I found most interesting is the thesis of where is located the mind and consciousness. It is becoming more evident that our mind and body are one unit that work together. Our mind is located all around our body. Our thoughts and subjectivity are intimately linked to our emotions, feelings, which in turn are induced by our biological, chemical and sensory percepctions. I found a good book on this fascinating subject."
