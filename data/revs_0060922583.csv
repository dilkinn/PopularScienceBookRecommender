0,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/863801-ade-bailey,3,"I have decided to add a new shelf called 'slowly reading'. I am reading this book slowly and carefully. Sometimes a paragraph or two is enough for me to stop and digest. Also, often I want to 'spin off' from a section and read related stuff, in books or on the internet. I am reading this in conjunction with Murray Gell-Mann's 'The Quark and the Jaguar', and as happens sometimes they seem to make a good pair. Both are very different in content and approach, yet they are similar in that they show a great interest in how we interpret scientific data, the metaphors we use, the nature of theory and so. Both do deal with similar physics topics too. A month later: One of the reasons I could not proceed with the book in one sitting reflects what to me is its strength and weakness. Weakness, in that it has no sustaining line of theory building although it relies for what it does say not only on anecdotal evidence but also some quite complex theory; its strength is in its accretion of many points of view, hints, nudges, interesting examples and insights, so that it builds an accretion of suggestion. It is particularly strong in being aware of the importance of classification and naming, metaphor and analogy in the processes of scientific discovery, and, implicitly, the excitement of imaginative approaches at the furefront of explanation (thereby emphasising, what any scientist would agree with, the strict parameters of scientific approaches: to a large extent science work comes after speculation without boundaries). While I do not share the author's (or anyone's) enthusiasm for supernatural phenomena, most of what he covers comes under the heading of unexplained or inexplicable phenomena. It is a useful and entertaining read, and a reference for future return."

But there exists another explanation as described by Michael Talbot in his book “Holographic Universe”; here is an excerpt where he writes of Karl Pribram a neurophysiologist at Stanford:'... Pribam realised that the objective world does not exist, at least not in the way we are accustomed to believing. What is 'out there' is a vast ocean of waves and frequencies and reality looks concrete to us only because our brains are able to take this holographic blur and convert it into sticks and stones and other familiar objects that make up our world...''...In other words, the smoothness of a piece of fine china and the feel of beach sand beneath our feet are really just elaborate versions of the phantom limb syndrome (when amputees 'feel' a limb long after it has been removed)..''According to Pribram, this does not mean there aren't china cups and grains of sand out there. It simply means that a china cup has two very different aspects to its reality. When it is filtered through the lens of our brains it manifests as a cup. But if we could get rid of our lenses, we'd experience it as an interference pattern. Which is real and which is illusion? ""Both are real to me,"" says Pribham, ""or, if you want to say, neither of them are real""."
3,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2243557-helena-harper,5,"The Holographic UniverseThis must be one of the most fascinating, if not the most fascinating book I have ever read, and it is a must-read for anyone who is even remotely curious about who and what we really are or who wants to see spirituality meeting science. The claims that are made are backed up by numerous scientific studies, but it doesn't blow you away with scientific jargon. It's written in an easy-to-read style and the different chapters are split up into subsections, which also helps. Michael Talbot explains what a hologram is and then goes on to argue that the holographic model can be used to explain multiple personality disorders (extraordinary! - if you know nothing about MPD, then you absolutely must read this section), psychokinesis, miracles, the human energy field (or energy bodies), past/present/future existing seemlessly together, near death experiences (NDEs), UFO sightings and much more. Whether you accept the holographic theory or not, just reading the results of the various scientific studies mentioned in the book is fascinating and for me, personally, as a poet and author, it was also inspiring. The idea that everything is interconnected in this holographic universe of ours and is part of the same continuum inspired me, for example, to write a poem called 'My Life' to try and make sense of it ('...all that I see and don't see, hear and don't hear, touch and don't touch, smell and don't smell, taste and don't taste I am - I am the eternal energy of everything...'), whilst the story of the woman in the NDE chapter who said that 'she hadn't danced enough yet', making the being of light she was talking to laugh heartily and enabling her to return to physical life, gave me an idea for a children's story. In short, I found the book riveting and inspirational - jam-packed full of extraordinary scientific fact way more mind-blowing and thrilling than any science fiction I've ever read - and I am now reading it for a second time and will probably read it a third and fourth time as well!"

5,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9529521-brian,2,"There is much fascinating material in Michael Talbot's book, including discussion of scientific theories of the nature of reality and our perception thereof, as well as anecdotal accounts and clinical data regarding a vast array of parapsychological phenomena. Talbot believes that the holographic model of space-time and consciousness developed by David Bohm, Karl Pribram, and others can explain phenomena ranging from UFO encounters to psychic abilities and religious miracles, all of which, it is argued, may in fact be periodic glimpses of a more fundamental level of reality wherein consciousness and matter form a continuum of interacting wave-structures.Frustratingly, Talbot seems to uncritically accept any and all such reports, indiscriminate of source, as not only genuine, but also self-evidently supporting his favored , decidedly New Age, interpretation of the holographic model. Indeed, if taken at face value, much of the evidence does allow for such an interpretation, but the univocal manner in which it is presented makes independent assessment impossible. Nevertheless, Talbot's argument that scientists must seriously address claims of parapsychological phenomena is well taken. I would counter, however, that this should mean an expansion of the methods of objective observation and falsifiable hypothesis, not their abandonment in favor of subjective phenomenology."

Without wanting to spoil the read, or without the urge to get to in-depth about the subject matter in a simple review, I can sum the book up as an alternate view on both quantum physics and neuro-science, and the postulations that the book makes throughout its course are simply marvelous to read about. If there were 6-stars, I'd give this a 6."
7,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/242358-brandon,3,"by michael talbot. this is a fun forray into the grand theory of everything. basically, everything is a hologram acording to physicist David Bohm (""Wholeness and the Implicate Order""): waves interfere with each other to form images, objects, everything. that which we can perceive is the explicate order and that which we cannot is the implicate. the implicate contains the explicate, and the boundaries are also constantly wavering. the interesting thing about a hologram is that every part of the hologram contains all parts of itself. therefore if you take a piece of holographic film and split it in half, the image does not split, but remains as two whole images. the results are quite profound: the normal distinctions we draw don't actually exist. you and i don't exist as separate entities but are just an interference pattern from the same cosmic unity. moreover, time doesn't exist in the linear sense that we think it does, the ""past"" and ""future"" are equally accessible as the present.talbot starts from the interesting results of quantum mechanics (nonlocality, uncertainty, conscious observer effect) and moves on to note findings in not only physics, but neurobiology, dreaming, psychokinesis, near death experiences, out of body experiences, religious miracles, reincarnation, psychic powers, and even ghosts. see? fun! what's more interesting is that people are starting to study things like psychokinesis and the results are startling - it seems that we all have the ability (at least to some degree) to control and effect the world around us with our beliefs and minds.moreover, there is a bias or trend in science to discount these experiences as not testable or verifiable, which means they are often not studied or simply ignored. it has also been shown that the belief of the scientist running the ""new agey"" experiments influences the actual results of the experiment. children often experience these ""other dimensions"" more often than adults perhaps because adults have had so much conditioning as to what ""is possible.""some interesting notes:*an ink drop spun in a glycerine tube undergoes reverse entropy* stigmata is manifest through deep belief: stigmatists portray wounds on the palms instead of the more accurate location of the wrists. this is likely due to artistic interpretation of crucifiction occuring on the palm.*when we dream, we typically have access to information that is beyond our waking knowledge (i.e., we can learn new things when dreaming).*in chinese medicine, the method of mapping the entire body to the foot, or the ear is an example of a hologram* people being able to see with with the tips of their fingers, ear lobes, tip of the nose, and even, yes, armpits.* Immanuel Kant's *Dreams of a Spirit-Seer* an account of Swedenborg: ""we are constituted by the intersection of two flows: one direct from the divine, and one indirect from the divine through our environment.""* The Conibo Indians of the Peruvian Amazon use of ayahuasca (""soul vine"") - a hallucinogenic plant that when taken transports even lay people to exceedingly similar dimensions that the Conibo shamans visit regularly."
8,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9111202-ruhl,5,"With The Holographic Universe Michael Talbot has created his Masterpiece.For anyone even remotely interested in the convergence of Science and Metaphysics, this book is a must-read. Talbot masterfully combines science, research, theories on Human Consciousness, and eloquence into a colorful collage which in my opinion remains un-rivaled as the pinnacle of its genre. His narrative is factually detailed while remaining unpretentious; at times he is capable of reducing the empyrean to the mundane. The reader comes away feeling awe-struck, with a new understanding of the nature of subjective Reality. Our perceptions of Reality influence its' structure, a structure fractally repeated throughout all nature. From the largest cosmic structures to the smallest sub-atomic particles, this fractal pattern is enfolded within itself time and time again. I have read this book several times, and on each occasion I have gained something new. I plan to read it once again in the near future, and hope that someone writes a worthy follow-up. Read this book, you won't be disappointed. "
9,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1297090-brian,2,"In this book, the presentation of numerous historical accounts of the miraculous from the point of view of a believer is the central theme. Out-of body, near-death, and otherwise supernatural experiences are discussed, and the uniting theme is that the ""natural laws"" within which physics operates cannot explain all that we observe. What does, you ask? Well, imagine that everything is actually a pan-dimensional interference pattern stemming from a truly holographic universe. What does that mean, precisely? I've no idea, and I've already read the book. Every bizarre encounter is rapidly chaulked up as further proof to the holographic nature of existence, but without much explanation leaving me to wonder precisely how it supports anything other than the lunacy of the author - he retells a story in which, during his college days, spaghetti noodles suddenly materialized mid-air and plopped down on his chest. Oh sure, he checked for open windows, someone else around, the presence of boiling water, but to no avail. Talbot concludes that this random pasta must have come from the mental manifestation of a holographic interference vision. I don't get it either, but I'm now convinced that it'd be hysterical to throw wet noodles at someone as a messy, if confusing, prank. This book was recommended to me by a good friend, and I'm sorry to have to say, I didn't get it. I did, however, particularly enjoy one passage in the beginning which stated, and I'm paraphrasing, ""we find ourselves compelled to accept the words of scientists as the truth, despite our knowing that they are as equally fallible as ourselves."" No we're not."
10,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26973827-luca-mauri,1,"This is probably the first time I buy a book thinking about a subject and discovering a total different text.Apparently this book should talk about the theory of holographic universe, explaining what it means for the reality to appear three-dimensional while it really is bi-dimensional. This should be about information theory, black hole entropy and so on.Surprisingly this book is totally different: it just take some holographic principles for granted and start by discussing each and every kind of para-normal, supernatural event or perception.In the very beginning of the book there is some small scientific diversions, but in the rest of the volume, every non-scientific phenomenon is just assumed as real and explainable by the holographic principle.In the final parts of the book, it became almost anti-scientific and I can't justify in any possible way the results the book presumes to explain."
11,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/741149-kalin,5,"I started reading this book about a decade ago and, for reasons that I can't remember anymore (gave it to a friend?), left it not even half-way through. I shall finish it someday.However, even the first part--with the theory of memory as a holographic film--has vastly influenced my perception of the way we human beings think.Highly recommended: it resonates with basically all my observations of the world around. So much so that I hardly know where to start if someone asks for a more specific recommendation."
12,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19864523-leslie-m,4,"I have to admit, when I first encountered the idea of us being holograms in a holographic universe it rocked my world. This book builds a case for it being perhaps the most logical theory about the universe shared by many, though certainly not all, physicists. Physics dominates the first third of the book. Talbot makes this portion fairly easy to follow, with some included diagrams.A holographic universe can account for psychics, clairvoyants, out-of-body and near-death experiences, and other oddities not dealt with in our current view. This makes up the latter two-thirds of the book. It got pretty 'out there', sometimes, yet seemed plausible. My world continued to rock with a lot of outside-the-box thinking that I found, frankly, exciting.I haven't been this captivated since I started reading about Tibetan Buddhism."
13,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10576134-julie,5,One of the most scintillating books I've ever read! :)
14,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26379543-aaron,4,"I would say the first third of this book was very good and captivating. The book then drifted into more of a vast amount of cherry picked anecdotal support for mysticism. I understand this is the author's forte, belief and according to himself, personal experiences. But I thought the book would have used the unexplainable types of paranormal events that some people have experienced and/or witnessed to help support or explain the ""holographic universe"" theory principles analogously. Instead, the book dove into the weeds of the paranormal and reshaped the constructs of the ""holographic universe"" theory to better fit his interpretations of both the paranormal and holographic theory.For example, instead of taking an objective and observable occurrence with regards to sub-atomic particles, such as how electrons can behave as both a wave form and a particle form, and trying to figure out how a mystic performing a miracle, like healing someone just by touching the sufferer, relates with respect to the phenomena of an electron shape shifting from a wave to a particle and back again; he try's to demonstrate how the principle theories behind why electrons can do this as reason to believe and to some degree support these paranormal occurrences. I know what I just said sounds like six in one hand and a half dozen in the other but look at it this way.He seems to be saying, in my opinion, that the ""holographic theory"" supports, gives reason and meaning to miracles and paranormal events-rather than-supernatural events simply being a part of a misinterpretation of the witnessing and experiencing of the holographic model.In a simple analogy. Many years ago people thought gods caused volcanos to erupt. Now we know the science of why they erupt. What I think the author does with his application of the ""holographic theory"" is this. Currently we don't have any concrete explanation for why miracles seem to happen or precisely why sub-atomic particles behave the way they do in quantum physics when observed just like ancient people couldn't explain an eruption.The author's logic works something like this. Paranormal events are ""real"" but unexplainable until you draw, far stretched in my opinion, comparisons and conclusions from the holographic universe model to paranormal occurrences. In other words, it's like using modern science to explain why the gods got angry and how the gods made the volcano erupt. You first have to believe that most every paranormal and supernatural event that has allegedly taken place was ""real"" and the ""holographic theory"" supports it. Same as believing angry gods DO exist and geological science proves how these gods make eruptions happen.This is MY primitive grasp of the ""holographic universe"" theory in my own words:Colors are just various wavelengths and how we interpret these waves are also various so think about this. With regards to the ""string theory"" all matter breaks down into strings that are so small our current technology can't detect them. These strings vibrate or resonate differently from one another. Example, the element iron may resonate/vibrate differently from the element carbon. Both elements, in theory, are made of the same ""strings"" but depending on their vibration frequency is what determines how the sub atomic particles interact with each other and therefore determines what ""kind"" of matter it will be and how much energy it will have.Just as we interpret various wavelengths with light we also do with sound. What we hear and see and sometimes feel are these wavelengths. When matter changes, for example, iron to rust forming iron oxide, the only thing that happened was an exchange in each elements electron configuration . Oxygen and iron take and release these electrons and now we have a ""new"" matter that has neither properties from which elements it came from. Possibly, with the increase and decrease of each elements electron configuration during the process of iron and oxygen combining, the vibrations of the strings are also altered because if the strings influence the sub atomic particles then the particles may influence the strings resonating. Now back to the different light waves. Depending on the atomic structure (electron configuration) of a given piece of matter, environment, perception and which light wave frequency hits an object mostly determines what light waves will be either absorbed, reflected or scattered thus, its color, will be perceived in our mind. If the change in the particles change the the strings vibrations and therefore change the properties in this ""new"" matter then it's color also changes and it does. Possibly, then, everything we perceive is just an interpretation of these vibrating strings. Nothing actually exists but everything is perceived.What is a hologram? Possibly, it's our perception of an arrangement of light that has been manipulated by the specific arrangement of vibrating strings. But I can touch a ""real"" thing. I can't touch a hologram you might say. Well, What if that touch is just a perception brought on by a more complex combination of vibrating strings much in the way you feel the heat radiating from a hot stove. If we are all connected to the cosmos in some way then our energy can be felt and the light that brings these perceptions can be seen.Color and pain are some of the biggest tricks our mind plays on us. Nether really exist but one gives us a very vivid image and the other gives us a very intense feeling.Our brain assigned colors to different light wavelengths much in the way we color code things for easier reference. Pink for example does not exist in any light wave. Our mind analyzes the percentages of blue, green and red sent to it from the eye and imagines a color pink. When you stub your toe it hurts but the pain is just a sensation and nothing more. This is why some people get ghost pains from addiction to pain pills. Your mind is using this sensation to get what it wants; more narcotics.Death could be just a rational perception but as elusive in reality as the concept/feeling of heartbreak."
15,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/295029-cathy,5,"Very fun book to read! This book presents anecdotal and scientific evidence in the argument that the universe is actually a combination of various frequencies which our brains then interpret into what we experience as reality. The author uses examples ranging from Near Death Experiences to salamander brain experiments to argue his point. Overall, I believe a lot of what he is presenting. He does a good job of noting references, but near the end he starts getting a bit more personal in presenting what he believes without as much scientific backing.Fun to read and challenges you to think about things very differently."
16,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1008466-jennifer,4,"Basically, a mind-blowing book that should be a requirement for anyone interested in the universe, themselves, others, and how they are all really the same thing. Explains paranormal abilities incredibly well...enough to make the skeptic take note. Incidently, also explains how BodyTalk works...i.e. there is truly only one person in the room during a session. Muscle testing is used to confirm what the practitioner already knows."
17,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4243664-liz,5,"Thought-provoking book, and one of my all time faves. I have purchased this book a few times and after reading it I always loan it to someone with no expectation that I'll ever get it back...and I never have. An absolute must read!"
18,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2518185-cooper-cooper,4,"This book is a popular treatment of the ideas of psychologist Karl Pribram and physicist David Bohm, which in turn are based on the concept of holography. Hungarian scientist Dennis Gabor invented (discovered?) holography, and was awarded the Nobel Prize the development of the laser allowed University of Michigan scientists to verify Gabor's theory in the laboratory. Holography produces, in thin air, the three-dimensional image (a hologram) of an object. This is accomplished by splitting a laser beam, with one of the split beams directly illuminating the object to be photographed, and the other beam illuminating the image of the object on a photographic plate. Where the two beams of light overlap on the plate, they produce a so-called interference pattern, and it is this pattern that (when re-illuminated) creates the three-dimensional image (the hologram) of the object. Interestingly, the whole hologram can be re-created from any portion of the holographic image—a phenomenon reminiscent of Mandelbrot's fractals (which for some reason Talbot fails to mention). 	Trying to understand how memory works, psychologist Karl Pribram hit on the hologram as the best theory to account for the fact that memories are not localized in the brain (each memory stored in a separate group or circuit of neurons), but rather are distributed throughout the brain so that, for example, rats that have literally had their brains minced still retain memories for learned behaviors, and among humans, even after massive strokes that have incapacitated large areas of a cerebral hemisphere, many people continue to retain a remarkable store of memories. By retaining only scattered pieces of a memory, a damaged brain might still be able to reproduce (holographically) the whole memory.	Physicist David Bohm hit on holography while trying to understand how the universe works in the light of quantum theory, about which he was a leading, textbook-writing expert. It bothered him that quantum theory left many things unexplained: 	*How can a quantum of energy be both a particle and a wave? 	*Since we interfere with subatomic particles when we try to measure	 them, how can we know with certainty what that nanoworld is really like? 	*How is it that two photons in different locations can influence each 	 	 other faster than the speed of light?	According to Bohm, the universe consists of energy waves. The physical reality that we perceive ""out there"" is our brains' translation of those waves (via mathematical equations called Fourier transforms) into sensory images. Well, not a translation of the waves themselves, but of the very interference patterns that produce holograms. So we live in a ""holographic universe"" teeming with energy waves that our fertile brains convert into the world we (think we) know.	That's not all: Bohm holds that the world we normally perceive, what he calls the ""explicate order,"" continually arises out of a background world that we normally do not perceive, called the ""implicate order."" In the implicate order, time and space do not exist: the past, present and future freely intermix, and everything is everywhere. The implicate order, the matrix of existence where everything is possible, continually expresses itself by ""unfolding"" new configurations of energy waves. 	And there's more. The implicate order is more like mind than like matter: for Bohm, matter arises from mind rather than vice versa, although mind and matter are really two apsects of the same substratum. With this view he enters an age-old dispute more on the side of Plato and the major religions, east and west, than on the side of conventional materialistic science (for a recent example of the materialistic position, see Daniel C. Dennett's Consciousness Explained ). Bohm's approach focuses on the whole, while modern materialistic science tends to focus on the parts, which are easier to model and analyze. Scientists have generally assumed that if you learn enough about the parts, you will automatically come to understand the whole. For complex systems, this has proved questionable—as any chaos or complexity theorist will tell you.	Bohm's implicate order accounts for the phenomena—nonlocality, indeterminacy—unexplained by quantum theory. It also accounts for psi phenomena such as telepathy, clairvoyance (remote viewing), clairaudience, precognition, retrocognition and psychokinesis. How? Since the implicate order is exempt from the conventional rules of time and space, it can ""unfold"" the same phenomenon in minds and places that are far apart physically or separated in time.	These are the basic ideas. Author Talbot elaborates with a lot of anecdotal evidence—some of it very engaging—that seems to support the holographic universe, and he cites (but not systematically) some of the more rigorous research that seems to support the theory. He also cites the usual New Age suspects: Robert Monroe on OBEs, Kenneth Ring on NDEs, Larry Dossey on remote healing, Deepak Chopra on correspondence between quantum physics and eastern religion, etc. I found the book interesting and thought-provoking, obviously written by an enthusiast who is trying to appear objective, fairly persuasive, somewhat repetitious, and strewn with fascinating anecdotal cases. I say ""fairly persuasive"" because for one thing, some research has challenged Pribram's notion of non-localized memory (see, for example, Joseph LeDoux’s The Emotional Brain), and for another thing, throughout the book I was nagged by the notion that Bohm's theory is really a modern-vocabulary version of the shamanic and vedic worldviews, and that while intellectually cogent and intuitively resonant, most of the theory is unverifiable in the scientific sense. Which doesn't invalidate it, but also doesn't allow us to advance much past speculation—and where speculation is unverifiable, one is never far from Ockham's supersharp razor. I'm not talking about the phenomena themselves (for example, psi)—these, I believe, have been well demonstrated (see, for example Dean I. Radin’s The Conscious Universe). Rather I'm talking about the theory that purports to explain them. 	Overall: Highly recommended, but I would advise skeptics to read Radin's The Conscious Universe first. 	Key concepts:	Explicate order	Hologram	Holography	Implicate order	Indeterminacy	NDEs	Nonlocality	OBEs	Precognition	Psi Phenomena	Psychokinetics	Remote Viewing (clairvoyance)	Retrocognition	Synchronicity	Telepathy	Unfolding "
19,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2526106-jason,3,"""Considered together, Bohm and Pribram's theories provide a profound new way of looking at the world: Our brains mathematically construct objective reality by interpreting frequencies that are ultimately projections from another dimension, a deeper order of existence that is beyond both space and time: The brain is a hologram enfolded in a holographic universe."" (p. 54)As you may imagine, I was fascinated with this book when I began reading it in 1994 at the suggestion of a respected friend. At about the sixth chapter--right where the author started discussing auras, astral bodies, and chakras--I hit a snag, and put the book down with the intention of finishing it ""soon."" Sixteen years later and tens of thousands of other pages later, and I again got bogged down in the exact same section (at this point I guess I felt like the book was attempting to shoehorn every single new age trope into the author's new ""paradigm."") This time, though, I persevered through what I considered two-star material, and got to the final chapter which unveils Talbot's image of a holographic universe where the part and the whole comprise one another, where everything literally ""inter-is"" everything else. On the whole, a fascinating--if nowhere near convincing--speculation on the nature of reality and a theoretical framework for what Greg Egan has elsewhere decried as ""quantum mysticism"" and what I consider really awesome if we could provide substantial evidence for it.""Indeed, the holographic model itself is highly controversial and is by no means accepted by a majority of scientists. Nonetheless, and as we shall see, many important and impressive thinkers do support it and believe it may be the most accurate picture of reality we have to date."" (p. 3)""We are indeed on a shaman's journey, mere children struggling to become technicians of the sacred. We are learning how to deal with the plasticity that is part and parcel of a universe in which mind and reality are a continuum, and in this journey one lesson stands out from above all others. As long as the formlessness and breathtaking freedom of the beyond remain frightening to us, we will continue to dream for ourselves that is comfortably solid and well defined."" (p. 302)"
20,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2412666-mangoo,4,"This book was probably one of the first to divulgate the conceptions of Bohm about implicate/explicate order, and of Pribram about the nature of brain's activity, and to derive from them some conclusions for our daily world view. This by itself makes the book worth having, though the actual discussion it includes may not please everyone.Bohm and Pribram agreed that our reality is in fact holographic, and so was the operational principle of the brain (a reader of information concerning the hologram that reality supposedly is), as explained clearly in the first two chapters of the book. From then on, basically Talbot takes the lead on enlisting an impressive amount of feats (mainly historical, and some first-handedly experienced) that, while buffling our best current explanations let alone skepticism, may eventually find a reasonable support in the holographic paradigm. While it can be rather amusing and instructive to have a look at such supposedly real wonders, it is nonetheless a kind of pity that most of the books deal with miracolous healings, psychokinesis, clearvoyance, materializations and phenomena at odds with our materialistic contempt for space as time. This is still done by means of a clear and even pedantic writing style, rich in citations by alleged academic authorities and historical testimonies.Overall, a nice read, if only disconcerting or thought-streatching."
21,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24265763-cat-noe,1,"I hate to rate a book halfway through, but the only way I can continue to read this piece is by consigning it to the ""science fiction"" shelf. I loved the quantum theory pieces at the beginning, and spent a few pleasant mornings toying with ideas offered in the first chapters. The approach, however, has grown steadily less scientific in ways that set my analysis training into convulsions. Anecdotes are not evidence, not every study is unbiased, and credentials and supporting information have to be in place before anything should be taken at face value. The way this book hops from idea to idea, it's amazing he was able to put a single title to the thing.Holographic universe? Maybe, but I strongly suspect this holograph exists only in the writer's mind. Maybe affected by those LSD studies he mentioned? Sorry, but you lost me for good at ""My poltergeist likes to drape socks over house plants while I sleep."""

For those looking for a potentially scientific / rational explanation for supernatural or extra-sensory phenomena, look no further. This book is on my ""five most important books I've ever read"" list, perhaps right at the top. The holographic model of the universe was not dreamed up by the author, but he stands on the shoulders of others to bring a very complex and advanced concept to a non-physicist level of comprehension. The holographic model applies to the mind as well, and this is discussed thoroughly. Mainstream scientists are rapidly coming to accept the holographic model of the universe, so you should read up on it. Quantum entanglement is now a little less ""spooky action at a distance,"" as Einstein put it."

26,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,5,"Physical reality is a hologramThis is an interesting book by an author who passionately believes that existence and physical reality perceived through consciousness is generated by a holographic phenomenon. In other words the holographic universe creates reality. This book is described in three parts; the first part describes the central concepts of physicist David Bohm and neurophysiologist Karl Pribram. The second and third part of the book does an exhaustive review of the work of many psychologists, psychiatrists, neurosurgeons, and neurobiologists who have expressed strong support for Bohm-Pribram holographic concept to explain phenomena such as; near death experience, out of body experience, telepathy, ESP, etc. The summary of this book is as follows: The holographic concept is a form of quantum mysticism extrapolated from two theories. One due to David Bohm who proposed that the universe and physical reality is a holographic structure; and the second due to Karl Pribram who proposed that consciousness perceives reality through the holographic structure. The holographic paradigm is rooted in the concept that all organisms and forms of matter are holograms embedded within one universal hologram. A hologram is two-dimensional photographic pattern of interference between coherent light reflected from the object of interest, and light that comes directly from the same source or reflected by a mirror. When this two-dimensional image is illuminated from behind by coherent light, a three-dimensional image of the object appears in space, but without illumination the image appears as blur. The characteristic of a perfect hologram is that all its content is contained in any finite part of itself: If a hologram of a rose is cut in half and then illuminated by a laser, each half will still be found to contain the entire image of the rose. Indeed, even if the halves are divided again, each snippet of film will always be found to contain a smaller but intact version of the original image. The reductive or deterministic approach doesn't work, which means that components or parts doesn't make the whole. Bohm used this analogy to explain quantum entanglement where the separated quantum particles ""communicate"" with each other regardless of the distance separating them, which is a direct contradiction of special theory of relativity. Bohm suggested that particles remain in contact with one another because at deeper level these particles are not individual entities, but extensions of the same fundamental reality; the separation is a mere illusion. This phenomenon is illustrated by ""Bohm's aquarium."" Imagine an aquarium containing a fish, which you can not see directly, but this can be seen indirectly from two television cameras, one directed at the aquarium's front and the other directed to its side. As you stare at the two television monitors, you might assume that the fish on each of the screens are separate fishes, because the cameras are set at right angles, and the two images are different. But as you continue to watch you will notice that when one turns, the other also turn; when one faces the front, the other always faces toward the side at right angle. From this you will conclude that the two fishes are instantaneously communicating with one another, but we know that it is not so. Bohm suggested that this is precisely what is going on between the particles in quantum entanglement. In a holographic universe time and space are no longer viewed as fundamentals, because concepts such as location and time breaks down in a universe in which nothing is truly separate (as in quantum entanglement described above). At its deeper level reality is a sort of super-hologram in which the past, present, and future all exist simultaneously. Support for Bohm's quantum physical ideas came from unexpected sources when neurophysiologist Karl Pribram invoked holographic model to explain memories, which are dispersed throughout the brain. Pribram suggested memories are encoded not in neurons, or small groupings of neurons, but in patterns of nerve impulses that crisscross the entire brain in the same way that patterns of laser light interference crisscross the entire area of a piece of film containing a holographic image. In other words brain itself is a hologram. Pribram's theory also explains how the human brain can store so many memories in so little space. A human brain memorizes of the order of 10 billion bits of information during the average human lifetime. How does brain translates the avalanche of frequencies it receives via the senses (light frequencies, sound frequencies, electro-chemical potentials, and so on) into the concrete world of our perceptions? Pribram argues that encoding and decoding frequencies is best performed by a hologram. Just as a hologram functions as a sort of lens, a translating device able to convert an apparently meaningless blur of frequencies into a coherent image, Pribram believes the brain also comprises a lens and uses holographic principles to mathematically convert the frequencies it receives through the senses into the inner world of our perceptions. It is only in the holographic domain of consciousness that such frequencies are sorted out and divided up into conventional perceptions. This essentially means that consciousness creates the appearance of the brain, the human body and everything we regard as reality. When holographic models of David Bohm and Karl Pribram are put together the world becomes a secondary reality. Primarily the world is a holographic blur of frequencies, and if the brain is also a hologram which selects some of the frequencies out of this blur and mathematically transforms them into sensory perceptions, then the objective reality cease to exist. This is in agreement with Vedanta philosophy (Hindu philosophy) where Maya, an illusory power creates the illusion which we believe is physical reality, but the universe is one whole entity called Brahman. We are essentially ""receivers"" floating through a kaleidoscopic sea of frequencies of a super-hologram. "
27,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12788229-christopher,1,"I'm shocked how large a percentage of the reviews on Goodreads are of the ""five stars, this totally blew my mind"" variety. This book is absolutely terrible. It is easily the worst book I've read this year so far, and would be the worst book of last year, and nearly any other year. That should give you a good idea how much I hated this book.  My experience with this book is very similar to my experience with the book Brain Wars. I picked them both up off the clearance table for science books at the University of Washington bookstore. Often when I am there I will go to the clearance section and just pick up anything that looks interesting, but after these two books I'm going to be more discerning. In the case of Brain Wars, it turned out to be a book arguing for substance dualism written by a neuroscientist. This book is an argument for mysticism written by somebody who read a physics book one time.  I'm not against books about the relationship between religion and science. A quick look at my religion, or science shelf on Goodreads will show you there are some books on that subject that I have reviewed somewhat positively. I'm also not against arguing for highly contrarian philosophical positions, or taking the paranormal seriously. I'm not one of these so-called skeptics who think the ""scientific"" approach to paranormal claims is just to dismiss them outright, and I am genuinely interested what people who argue for the supernatural and paranormal have to say.  Just like Brain Wars this book starts with some fairly solid science. Though I had huge problems with the book Brain Wars, I appreciated how the author started us off on scientific ground and then slowly moved to wackier ideas. It felt like he was actually trying to convince me, and that is what I want when I read one of these books, even though I ended up giving that book a negative review overall. This book by contrast goes from what seems like a science fiction premise with some interesting science behind it, to outright absurdity rather sharply. By the half way point the book had lost me entirely, because it had made outrageous claims based on anecdotal evidence and the connection to the overall theory was hard to discern at that point.  There is a similarity to Brain Wars in this book talks about the placebo effect. I find this all fascinating, but this book goes even further than Brain Wars, suggesting that most diseases, if not all, are mental. The fact the author died at age 38 of cancer, after writing a book suggesting cancer patients need to think positively in order to cure their disease, is an irony too bitter to be funny. The book gets worse from there, with claims about religious miracles that not only doesn't rely on anything scientific, but doesn't question its own assumptions, and even misrepresents both data and the opinions of certain ""experts."" Don't read this book if you are somebody who likes rigorous argumentation and critical thinking. It will be a complete waste of your time."
28,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7370729-christopher-hivner,3,"The first part of this book is fascinating as the author explains a theory of how the brain works like a hologram. Apparently if you cut a piece of holographic film, each piece still contains the entire object. The theory states that each section of the brain contains all of our memories and knowledge. Then it moves on to a theory of the universe as a hologram, stating that every electron actually contains all the matter and time of the universe. I'll admit I found the physics theory hard to comprehend. Fascinating, but hard to believe. These theories have been suggested by highly intelligent, well respected men in their fields which adds some gravitas to them.The book started to lose me after this though. The author goes on to explain how you can perceive any number of phenomena through the lens of a holographic universe, including your health, miracles, psychokinesis, out of body experiences, near death experiences, stigmata and the list goes on. It started to sound like an infomercial selling you on the merits of the holographic theory. The biggest problem was no real distinctive proof was offered. The book collapses under the weight of all the anecdotal evidence. Dozens of studies done by dozens of doctors are cited. Historical legends about mystics and holy men and women from the past being able to create things out of mid-air and leave their bodies whenever they wanted to.I have always been fascinated by paranormal sciences and the possibility that it is possible to leave your body or see things of the future in your mind or that you can influence events just by thinking about it. But I haven't seen any real proof of much and this book doesn't offer it. The stories from 700 years ago can't be held accountable because of the length of time and the predilection for hyperbole from the people who recorded these events. The anecdotes from more modern history seem to be heavily from India and Indonesia. Why not more from industrialized countries?By the end of the book you find out the author himself claims to have some of these paranormal abilities and then you realize why there isn't a counterpoint in the book. The author believes these theories whole heartedly and he's just trying to get you to wise up. This is a well written book and at times fascinating and hard to put down. However, I would have liked a more balanced approach and more solid attempts at proof."

I didn't at first like it because metaphysical theories usually make sense to me intuitively and the pace seemed kind of slow and pedantic, but that's just necessary since most would not find the information easily digestible. As it picked up steam... quite amazing. There were many times in reading where my inner skeptic was yelling in protest, but the psychic, ""supranatural"" phenomena he discusses are well-documented (though not understood). Yet the mainstream science community largely denies their importance in better understanding what is real! It's about time that theories containing ALL OF REALITY start being entertained by the scientific establishment. Traditional, ""objective"" science is dead. In it's place, an all-encompassing understanding of vibrational energy fields waits to be discovered and understood. It's time for a major overhaul of the scientific method, what constitutes proof of phenomena, and an expansion of understanding about what is possible within this strangely perfect interconnected universe which we barely comprehend the scope of."

I ended up skimming over the latter parts of the book because of that.

33,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30705954-avalon,4,"The Holographic Universe by Michael Talbot presents the fascinating theory that our collective consciousness shapes our reality. We can essentially think something into existence and by that same token, snuff it out. In a holographic universe, thoughts are things. Talbot spends the first two chapters throwing a smorgasbord of scientific information including quantum physics and the mechanics of holograms at the reader as if to say... See! All of this fantastical esoteric stuff is backed by cold, hard, science. I appreciate what he was trying to do here- distract skeptics with his shiny facts, make the outrageous claims he delves into later appear more legitimate, establish a sense of intellectual integrity, etc. However, it was a bit dry and I would not be surprised if those who are unwilling to brush up on the foundations of particle physics put this one down out of boredom. If you can make it through to chapter 3 though, you will be well rewarded. From there on out there is an array of shocking information about the power of the placebo effect and the impact a doctor's confidence has on the outcome of prescribed medication. There is talk of Near Death Experiences, UFO's, remote viewing, ESP, out of body experiences, and more. Whether or not you are willing to suspend disbelief, I do think there is something in this book for everyone. Perhaps the most scintillating treasure that The Holographic Universe has to offer is the idea that our mind has incredible power over our bodies, much more so than we have been led to believe. If you only use Multiple Personality Disorder (now known as Dissociative Identity Disorder) as an example, that is more than sufficient. Those with MPD have an identity that is fragmented into two or more different personalities. What is captivating about this is that each personality, or ""multiple"" has its own gender, IQ, age, identity, memories and abilities. ""Often one or several of a multiple's personalities are children, and if an adult personality is given a drug and then a child's personality takes over, the adult dosage may be too much for the child and results in an overdose. It is also difficult to anesthetize some multiples, and there are accounts of multiples waking up on the operating table after one of their 'unanesthetizable' subpersonalities have taken over...Other conditions that can vary from personality to personality include scars, burn marks, cysts, and left- and right-handedness. Visual acuity can differ... one personality can be color-blind and another not, and even eye color can change. There are cases of women who have two or three menstrual periods each month because each of their subpersonalities has its own cycle.""In my personal opinion, MPD illustrates just how much control we have over our own bodies. If individuals with MPD can physiologically alter their own eye color, allergy susceptibilities, pain tolerance, menstrual patterns, etc. by sheer force of will alone, the implications are mind-blowing; the possibilities endless. My main criticism would have to be that for all the subjects Talbot brings up, he fails to discuss their practical applications. There is a lot of name dropping and anecdotal evidence, but he fails to inform the reader on exactly how they can go about learning to increase their psychic abilities for example or see auras. While his book is rich in theoretical substance, it lacks the most important component- how to go about acting on all these enchanting ideas. Despite this crucial missing piece, The Holographic Universe is a riveting read. It may just cause you to start questioning everything we are programmed to believe from an early age. Skeptics welcome. "

It's nice to read, but it's also not that great.The problems lie in some of the word choices and sentence structures as well as the fact that the author doesn't use his brain the way he should. He just assumes every account of something is correct even if it's written down centuries ago and there is no way to fact check anything. No critical not whatsoever is placed when conclusions are drawn. Then again, how should that be done if no reasoning whatsoever is supplied except for again, using the holographic model we could explain this. It would fit in perfectly. Why isn't really explained well enough though. Here comes the next problem. At the beginning of the book, the holographic model is explained, but not well enough. This leaves it a bit confusing in parts and not really used to explain anything. It seemed like Talbot only had a superficial understanding of what he is talking about.Then we have the fact this is the most biased piece of 'science' writing I have ever seen. Nothing to counter Talbot's views is written. I haven't even seen it being mentioned. If this happened, it didn't really happen clear enough. No science against his viewpoints is used. Scientists who don't agree are mentioned, but scarcely and only because they have views that don't contradict what the author is trying to tell us.Telling us at the start there is compelling evidence and then using anecdotes in at least 90% of the cases of 'evidence' isn't the way science works.Shame this one didn't work out. The topic is fascinating. This isn't non-fiction though. It's closer to retelling stories. The science component isn't very strong either."
35,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5924066-jeff-hrusko,2,"I saw this book listed in an article called 10 books that will change your perspective of the world, or something like that. It was listed with other books I have read, such as Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared M. Diamond and A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson – books that truly have changed my perspective of the world. So, I felt this book was a must read. I had heard a few things about the theory that reality, or what we perceive, is a sort of holographic projection from the micro-quantum level, and I wanted to learn more. The author, Michael Talbot provides only the thinnest of explanations of the actual theory, then goes into a lot of supernatural non-sense and easily debunked examples of the paranormal. I continued through discussions of the “The Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research (PEAR)” experiments, because although their methods were flawed, I don’t believe they tried to trick anyone. I clenched my teeth when he spoke of Stigmatas – but I had to jump ship when he held up Sathya Sai Baba as an example of man who could materialize objects. I remember seeing this man on show called “That’s Incredible” as a child and seeing clearly that his miracles were poorly done slight of hand. So, I will say I enjoyed this Arthur’s writing style, and he seems earnest. It is interesting how a person that is seemly very intelligent can believe things that are demonstrably false. I looked up the author Michael Talbot after I put the book down and discovered that he tragically died young. He was a talent, but as much as we want to believe, quantum does not equal magic, and although there are wondrous things to existence, and I have no doubt we will learn things beyond our imaginations as we progress… creating a gold watch from thin air will most likely not be one of them.

It's easy to think of a subject as silly, but whoa whoa this book really combines a lot of quantum physics (which we don't totally understand) and the phenomenon of so many unexplainable activity, and does so in a very clear, straight-foward manner, and yet, asks for a leap of faith. for a paradigm shift. The fact that Hawking's final paper was directed towards a similar subject is telling. Life/Reality is infolding/enfolding in structure. Quantum mechanics shows the observer is always a direct result of the outcome. Miracles happen because of collective conscious belief. so on and so on.

Because neurons are packed together so densely, these expanding ripples of electricity - also a wavelike phenomenon - are constantly crisscrossing one another.

Was it possible, he wondered, that what the mystics had been saying for centuries was true, reality was maya, an illusion, and what was out there was really a vast, resonating symphony of wave forms, a ""frequency domain"" that was transformed into the world as we know it only after it entered our senses?"" - Michael Talbot (The Holographic Universe, Pg.31)""...quantum potential permeates all of space, all particles are nonlocally interconnected.

Fa-Tsang, who held that the whole cosmos was implicit in each of its parts (and who also believed that every point in the cosmos was its center), likened the universe to a multidimensional network of jewels, each one reflecting all others ad infinitum.When the empress Wu announced that she did not understand what Fa-Tsang meant by this image and asked him for further clarification, Fa-Tsang suspended a candle in the middle of a room full of mirrors. This, he told the empress Wu, represented the relationship of the One to the many. Then he took a polished crystal and placed it in the center of the room so that it reflected everything around it. This, he said, showed the relationship of the many to the One. However, like Bohm, who stresses that the universe is not simply a hologram but a holomovement, Fa-Tsang stressed that his model was static and did not reflect the dynamism and constant movement of the cosmic interrelatedness among all things in the universe."" - Michael Talbot (The Holographic Universe, Pg.291)"
42,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15148376-gregg-bell,4,"All right, astral travellers, time to come back to earth to read this review (because it will enhance your subsequent journeys, like an upgrade from coach to first-class).The Holographic Universe is not hollow. It has many solid ideas from many very solid sources. Somehow, though, it was lacking as a cover to cover read. As is so often the case with non-fiction, this is a book of nuggets.And yet, lovely nuggets they are. The general idea is that the entire world is interconnected. (So while you thought you were doing whatever you were doing, right at this moment you were actually here with me writing this review. I hardly noticed you to tell you the truth, but I'm pretty sure you were here.) So put down your crystals for a minute and try this on for a new-age rush:Space is not empty. It is full, a plenum as opposed to a vacuum, and is the ground for the existence of everything, including ourselves. The universe is not separate from this cosmic sea of energy, it is a ripple on its surface, a comparatively small ""pattern of excitation"" in the midst of an unimaginably vast ocean.Now if that doesn't want to make you rush off to meditate I don't know what will.So yeah, I'm joking around a bit, but the book is substantial. As I said it's a bit dry reading through the entire thing, but some really fascinating thoughts are interspersed amongst the aridity.It's not in the book but I always liked this idea from Nikos Kazantzakis (the guy who wrote Zorba the Greeek): By believing passionately in something that still does not exist, we create it. The nonexistent is whatever we have not sufficiently desired.I mean, we've all heard of Schrodinger's Cat and the idea that observing something changes physical reality. Well, like the Kazantzakis quote, I believe the same sort of thing applies to belief. If you belive something enough, you will change physical reality.Back to the book:The world is nothing but an objectivized dream,"" says Yogananda, and ""whatever your powerful mind believes very intensely instantly comes to pass.""Do you doubt? The scientific studies documenting categorically the effectiveness of placebos should dispel it.And back to the idea that if you want something enough you'll create it. (There's a Don Henley song ""How Bad Do You Want It?"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqUmC... )The book says:When our collective beliefs and emotions become high-pitched enough to create a psychic projection, perhaps what we are really doing is opening a doorway between this world and the next. Perhaps the only time these intelligences can appear and interact with us is when our own potent beliefs create a kind of psychic niche for them.Try it. Want something, believe something with all you've got. 90% desire or belief won't do it. But cross the line to 110%, well, then there are some pretty serious people who think you will get results from that. If you're interested in such things, the book is well worth the read."
43,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58158946-alexandra,3,"This book was quite interesting because 1) it taught me stuff about holograms that I had never known before 2) it collected tons of super fascinating paranormal phenomena in one read (from stigmatists to UFO sightings to Near Death Experiences (NDEs) and 3) a lot of the takeaways fit into my religious worldview already. It was well written so that I wanted to read it (even though I thought I was going to immediately dismiss it as hippy babble). The overarching argument/thesis/premise is a little beyond my belief, but the smaller ideas that make it up are thought-provoking. Also, are there really quantum physics particles that only exist when observed?! Cool. Now I am going to list the stuff that caught my eye, so that I can give the book back to the person I borrowed it from.Our senses may work by analyzing frequencies. (p28)""Indeed, [David] Bohm believes that our almost universal tendency to fragment the world and ignore the dynamic interconnectedness of all things is responsible for many of our problems, not only in science but in our lives and our society as well. For instance, we believe we can extract the valuable parts of the earth without affecting the whole. We believe it is possible to treat parts of our body and not be concerned with the whole. We believe we can deal with various problems in our society, such as crime, poverty, and drug addiction, without addressing the problems in our society as a whole, and so on. In his writings Bohm argues passionately that our current way of fragmenting the world into parts not only doesn't work, but may even lead to our extinction."" (p49)Why a woman with brain tumor did not die: ""Although the woman was intelligent in the worldly sense, she was only moderately educated and did not really know the meaning of the word ""tumor"" or the death sentence it imparted. Hence she did not believe she was going to die and overcame her cancer with the same confidence and determination she'd used to overcome every other illness in her life."" (p85)Measuring the human energy field with ""chaos patterns"": ""Recently researchers have found chaos patterns in EEG recordings of the brain, but they needed many minutes of data from numerous electrodes to obtain such a pattern. [Valerie] Hunt obtained a chaos pattern from three to four seconds of data recorded by one electrode, suggesting that the human energy field is far richer in information and possesses a far more complex and dynamic organization than even the electrical activity of the brain."" (p178)""In a wide-ranging speculation [William A.] Tiller even suggests that the universe itself started as a subtle energy field and gradually became dense and material through a similar rachet effect. As he sees it, it may be that God created the universe as a divine pattern or idea. Like the image a psychic sees floating in the human energy field, this divine pattern functioned as a template, influencing and molding increasingly less subtle levels of the cosmic energy field 'on down the line via a series of holograms,' until it eventually coalesced into a hologram of a physical universe."" (p189)""'I think we have way overrated the brain as the active ingredient in the relationship of a human to the world,' says Hunt. 'It's just a real good computer.' ...If the mind is not in the brain, but in the energy field that permeates both the brain and the physical body,...it suggests that our awareness, the thinking feeling part of ourselves, may not even be confined to the physical body."" (p192)There is (or was) a ""Planetary Commission""? A group of ""millions of individuals around the world who have agreed to spend the hour of 12:00 to 1:00pm, Greenwich mean time, each December 31st united in prayer and meditation on world peace and healing""? Does this still exist? Curious. Snow says, ""If we are continually shaping our future physical reality by today's collective thoughts and actions, then the time to wake up to the alternative we have created is now."" (p225)""It is currently not fashionable in science to consider seriously any phenomenon that seems to support the idea of a spiritual reality."" (p244)""NDEers universally report that they are never judged by the beings of light, but feel only love and acceptance in their presence. The only judgement that ever takes place is self-judgment and arises solely out of the NDEer's own feelings of guilt and repentance. Occasionally the beings do assert themselves, but instead of behaving in an authoritarian manner, they act as guides and counselors whose only purpose is to teach.""This total lack of cosmic judgment and/or any divine system of punishment and reward has been and continues to be one of the most controversial aspects of the NDE among religious groups, but it is one of the most oft reported features of the experience. What is the explanation? [Raymond A.] Moody [Jr.] believes it is as simple as it is polemic. We live in a universe that is far more benevolent than we realize.""That is not to say that anything goes during the life review. ...After arriving in the realm of light NDEers appear to enter a state of heightened or metaconsciousness awareness and become lucidly honest in their self-reflections.It also does not mean that the beings of light prescribe no values. In NDE after NDE they stress two things. One is the importance of love...It appears that in the minds of the beings of light, compassion is the barometer of grace. ...The second thing the beings emphasize is knowledge."" (p250)""One of the most basic tenets of [Emanuel] Swedenborg's thinking is that our universe is constantly created and sustained by two wavelike flows, one from heaven, and one coming from our own soul or spirit."" (p259)""Argentinian physiologist Hugo Zuccarelli recently developed a new recording technique that allows one to create what amounts to holograms made out of sound instead of light. Zuccarelli bases his technique on the curious fact that the human ears actually emit sound...He calls this new kind of sound 'holophinic sound.'"" I wonder if that is still around--I want to look it up! (p292)""Why don't we assume that any class of experiences or phenomena that have been reported, through the ages and across cultures, has a face validity that cannot be denied?"" --asked by Willis Harman (p295)""As long as the formlessness and breathtaking freedom of the beyond remain frightening to us, we will continue to dream a hologram for ourselves that is comfortably solid and well defined...And when we outgrow any given set of conceptual pigeonholes we must always be prepared to move on, to advance from soul-state to soul-state, as Sri Aurobindo put it, and from illumination to illumination.""

44,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15395927-dan-geddes,3,"Many readers of The Holographic Universe will have doubted religion earlier in their lives, and so may be skeptical about spirituality in general. The Holographic Universe is one of those books that proposes the reunification of Eastern and Western thought: the East offering thousands of years of wisdom about the unity of all things; the West providing triumphant Science, which in turn spawns the mixed blessings of the atomization of all reality. Luckily, quantum physics, is now said to bear strong similarities to the descriptions of reality offered by Eastern religious texts, offering the hope of East/West integration.The Holographic Universe begins by noting the inadequate model of the mind we are left with by cognitive scientists. In keeping with a philosophical materialism, psychologists have affirmed the essential physical nature of mind: thought occurs within the mind, and no thought occurs after the body is dead. Talbot however cites various studies that cast suspicion on that model. For example, Paul Pietsch did various studies with salamanders, wherein he sliced and diced their brains, scrambled and replaced them, only to find that they still retained their memories. In another study, laboratory rats had large portions of their brains removed, but still retained their knowledge of mazes. Similarly, people who have lost large portions of their brains still retain their memories. Psychologist Karl Pribam later formulated his theory that memories are distributed, not stored in a particular location throughout the brain. See more at http://www.thesatirist.com/books/TheH..."
45,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23798089-sam-guest,5,"This is a very interesting book. It is a theory on how the universe is made up of one huge hologram. It discusses things from outer space to what is going on in your own head, such as dreaming.This book has taught me to the look at the worlds a little differently. It discusses things along the lines of how the universe was made to a theory similar to ""If a tree falls and nobody is around, does it make a noise."" The main theory of the book is that the whole Universe is a hologram. It explains that if this is true all the information of the universe can be in the palm of your hand. Just like a hologram that is made by humans, each section of the hologram contains all the information of the whole, hence the key to the universe could in the palm of your hand. It also explains how atoms can turn into waves when we are not observing them. It's like anytime your not looking somewhere it could be one huge fuzzy blob, but you would never know because wherever you look they turn back into particles.Although I have only read about 1/4 of the book, it has taught me a great amount of information that makes you want to read more. It talks about subjects that are not just factual and informative, but subjects that make you use your imagination and forces you to think outside the box and be imaginative. I would have to say that this is one of my favorite books that I've read. I would recommend it to anyone that is creative and wants a different outlook on life. Michael Talbot did a wonderful job writing this book. "
46,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17899448-sara,2,"This book is not at ALL what I expected. I honestly don't know where they get off putting it in the 'science' category, because it really isn't that.There is an interesting universe-as-hologram hypothesis in physics. I thought that's what this book would be about. But instead of reasonable exploration of hypothetical concepts, what I got instead was ""this stuff is 100% REAL based on a couple of papers written by a tiny handful of very obscure scientists, and BECAUSE it's all 100% real, you can melt tumors with your brain! Change PAST events by thinking about them really hard! Psychic surgery can actually cure you and is totally not a massive fraud perpetrated by a bunch of con men. Also your internal organs have their own rudimentary consciousness and you can upset them if you think bad thoughts about them and it'll make you sick, so don't do that."" (?!?!)The end of the book even seems to suggest that conventional science would be better off if it became LESS objective and fact based. I really hope no one is taking this crap seriously, because that's what it is, is crap. I would also like to point out that the author of this book, who claimed that it's possible to heal things like cancer by thinking about it the right way, subsequently died of cancer. So... I guess he wasn't wishing for it to go away hard enough? Come ON.Gets 2 stars only because it's SO far out there that you might chuckle a few times at the total absurdity."
47,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1296744-kate,4,"I enjoyed reading Talbot's interpretations of Quantum Physics, even if the Holographic metaphor did at times feel a bit overwrought. He has a gift for making complex ideas quite readable.At the quantum level, it becomes evident that separateness is an illusion. I've heard that before--that all things are vibrantly, dynamically interconnected--but Talbot helped me see it in fresh new ways. He explores how different thinkers illuminate this profound insight.Especially powerful to me was his explanation of physicist David Bohm's view that space is not empty; it's chockfull of energy. I've been drawn for years to the idea of the ""fertile void"" in my life. It has allowed me to take risks--such as leaving job and home to travel the world--knowing that something will always come. In fact, I now look at most any circumstance, even the brain surgery I had, as an opportunity for something new to arise. I love thinking about how this disposition is actually lining up with the way the universe works at the subatomic level.Ultimately, this book asks the question: What is Reality? And it shows how Quantum Physics is drawing the conclusion that Reality is infinitely more than we perceive with our conscious minds, that it's interconnected and infinite and limitless. In other words, science is confirming what mystics have said for thousand of years."
48,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36233155-erik-akre,3,"Talbot makes a rather dizzying, quite thorough exploration of his topic, linking up with quantum physicists and other scientists along the way, to arrive at an idea that was to me very foreign. By the end of the text, I felt I had a less-than-complete grasp of the thesis. Perhaps it all came at me too fast; I read it eagerly, with the hunger of one searching for new concepts of reality. It gets pretty wild.Some basic ideas include...The brain stores its information as holograms: wave interference patterns that are present equally throughout the brain. Thus that which we perceive is, from a certain perspective, not ""objective things out there,"" but a soup of energy and wave forms, as are we...The universe consists of that which is made explicit from the implicit realm of potentiality (the hologram). That which is expressed is merely a ripple on the surface of the cosmic ocean of energy-potentiality.Psychological elements are part of the holographic universe; they are ""transpersonal,"" potentially accessible to anyone else in the universe (i.e. explanation of psychism, etc.). Dreams are access points to holograms, but of a weaker image (excepting lucid dreams, which are stronger). It starts to sound pretty new-agey, doesn't it? If you like to explore the border between science and new-age, this will keep your attention, at least while you read it."
49,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2456516-sophia,1,"The premise of The Holographic Universe drew me to this book of which I quickly became and remained skeptical. The early chapters start off discussing the properties of holograms (of which I was not aware), well-known corollaries of quantum mechanics, and the mind-body-wellness connection. The idea that the universe and the mind are arranged like holograms—where a piece contains all the information of the whole, among other properties—is intriguing and plausible, despite the paucity of data provided to support it. However, subsequent chapters go on to discuss miracles, out of body experiences, near death experiences, and UFOs, which are presented as evidence the universe is organized as a hologram and physical reality is a product of consciousness. It should be noted that the author claims psychic abilities, and that his spleen has its own separate consciousness which was able to communicate to another psychic that the author had yelled at it. The ideas that the author advances seem to be a rehashing of ancient ideas about reality and consciousness (with a somewhat Eastern philosophical bent) in pseudo-scientific language. Nonetheless, it was an interesting survey of various shamanistic and religious traditions."

If you are interested in the paranormal – primarily in regards to psychic and telekinetic abilities – you will enjoy this book. Although Talbot’s analogy of the universe as a hologram in the first couple of chapters might be difficult to understand if not hard to swallow, the cases, scenarios, and experiments he refers to thereafter are quite intriguing. Even if you are skeptical of Talbot’s dated perception of the hologram, it is a pretty fun read if you suspend disbelief. Talbot offers very out-of-the-ordinary explanations to many of life’s little mysteries that are fairly convincing. He argues that the world around us might be far more profoundly influenced by our thoughts than we, well, think. Whether you accept Talbot’s holographic universe as plausible or not, he truly demonstrates that the human brain is a powerful tool that we do not completely understand."
51,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5980435-aaron,3," The first few chapters were excellent, but the book quickly focuses on 'all of the things science cant currently explain' and simply states...""but if the holographic universe idea is real...then all of this can suddenly be explained!""  I really liked the direct comparisons this book makes between current scientific understanding and this new way of thinking...I also liked the facts, the experiments, the unusual findings that have been documented and simply make so little sense that it begins to make you wonder.  I did not like, however, the many cases in this book that posed situations that were documented poorly, untestable in the laboratory, and difficult to duplicate - it's easy to say that THESE situations COULD imply a completely new approach...well of course it is! But we shouldn't do that until they ARE documented, and testable. "

Specifically citing the works of Bohr, Bohm , Pribram and others. How this is applied to our ""reality"" is compelling and warrants merit, and more research. After this the book goes onto list phenomena such as NDE, OBE, Lucid dreaming, UFos and many other paranormal phenomena, with examples through history ad infinitum. This list at times, although interesting initially, becomes a little tedious.Nevertheless, this is a must read book for those unfamiliar with the theory and even those that want some more research.

Imagine that every imaginitive thought any human has ever had is logged into this collective parallel dimension.

But the gist of this book is that it uses quantum physics and a subsequent holographic universe in order to explain miraculous things, such as people who seemingly don't feel pain, having the energy transferred somewhere else, or moving objects with the mind. Soon enough the author himself admits his own experience with this paranormal phenomena to give it more credence. With all the eastern Buddhist philosophy as well we eventually get a holographic universe as one of the only explanations for allowing things not to break the laws of physics and still making way for stuff like out of body experiences and near death ones as well. Despite how it may sound Terence McKenna isn't mentioned until the second to the last page, surprisingly. It starts off by introducing readers to some quantum physicists and their beliefs in God even though it may seem like they weren't religious scholars. There are the stories of Pauli and his coincidental streak, with the machines becoming inoperable as he would pass by. Apparently, such a Jungian thing violates basic physical law and is unexplainable, only being so if life and the universe is a hologram. The experiment which verifies this is a laser, which is capable of producing a hologram and fractal like images contained within, every part or pixel containing the image in its entirety alone. This means that one part is all that's needed to reproduce the entire image already, and the rest aren't relative, but just their own separate universes. This could also be related to the simulation universe theory, which would also make the universe holographic. The main metaphor is that your hand will go through a hologram and so something like thought or mind might be a more applicable medium for what is being projected. The eye also projects an image nearly holographically. The thing is though with this kind of science is it has long been disputed whether the neuroscience is just a theory or remarkable speculation for conspiracy theorists. But especially nowadays I'd suspect the simulation category is largely becoming popular.But Albert Einstein wasn't the only physicist who worked on the quantum mechanics problem of the 1940's; David Bohm was another, and it was he who declared the model of implicate and explicate orders, which was an influence for a holographic model. It seemed quite simple. Things behave and are structured via particles, which must come from somewhere and can be potentiated out of a field. It reminds me of a story regarding the dual nature of reality with man and woman. They can get frustrated for not seeing eye to eye and so veer off, man inevitably noticing something and being proud of it, in his own image perhaps, and woman generally finding it nondescript of a sort. There was a chance she noticed it already but said nothing, found in inconsequential for the record. There was no way of knowing. But whatever wasn't there something was conjured up to make up for the image but it was all the same, and some liked to pretend theirs was better than others for all the difference it would make. But that wasn't true, it was all an arbitrary game with a new force being necessary for reconciliation - merely just to stave off the boredom. Contained within this book is a start kit of all you need to become an explorer in the latest frontiers in the fields of consciousness, in which it was proposed to be another form of matter which, indeed, could be hiding somewhere. There are lucid dreams which could be a consequence of the universe being holographic and some of the imagery even related to OOBEs or NDEs. LDs are like the waking life - all problems one thinks about are represented symbolically there. Jealousy, envy, anger, curiosity, all the reasons which need something different to solve are available to know, if only you could solve the puzzle. But it depends on how you look at it. I found the most interesting part of this book, or the one which let me down the most, was the section about supermen, or miracles associated with the Vatican. There were examples of pain being inflicted but which could easily have been due to subtle manipulation. Known as the Jansenist miracles, they are associated with the liquefaction of San Gennaro's blood, which hasn't been studied thoroughly, so they still can't say whether it is miracle or mystery. And further on there is the topic of whether consciousness creates particle or particle creates consciousness. Again, that model is associated with a holographic sense of vision, and energy fields with accompanying auroras. Apparently materialist physics can't account for it, and people are here to learn for knowledge, so that one day perhaps in the future they can break through the illusion and be more free with better technology. The most disconcerting part is the mind-object levitation and people doing weird stuff while walking down the street, then like an agent or something pretending they don't know what happened or what they did. I have yet to see any concrete examples of this and yet I'm too sympathetic with the author to hope he could be some kind of shill. Other people are brought into the picture to make it more realistic with their own testimony and experience with him. Many of the time out of fright or pure surprise the experiments and research is ceased as the conclusion may be clear enough to them. And yet, I still might wonder what the point of a holographic universe is. You can choose to look at it that way, as opposed to some reductionistic model consisting of mostly solid matter. Life develops as it does. And cancers or transformations to the brain will result in a less efficient product presumably. If it is relative then who is to say their model is more applicable to life, even in isolation? If one challenges another then the more common one could win out if it isn't considered sick. I bring it up because it has implication for space travel and cosmic rays, the engineering feat long being a dream in the frontiers of physics. Will it happen someday in those ways still? If it isn't some strange ploy to avoid the holographic consequences, or if man just didn't know any better, then yes, it could. But first, maybe nuclear rocket fuel wouldn't be the best energy source for that, initially. The most interest part always is when the Indian mystics get involved. Here they can pluck food out of thin air, or there are even girls who can survive seemingly indefinitely without food. You can see how that would be holographic. It's related to OOBEs or NDEs because any spirits there say it isn't time for them to go yet and send them back to the body. Since they need to learn it fits in with the hypothesis that knowledge is good. These are also primitive beliefs regarded by ancient and still existing tribes so it is largely a matter of choice. Certain problems would call for industry. However, maybe they can mostly lounge in a difficult nature oriented life like that because they know it isn't their time to do anything else requiring extensive planning or travel?Well, nonetheless this is a satisfying book at over three hundred pages but I wish I read it earlier for the names, sources, and starter pack orientation. Instead, in the meantime I've found other sources of the subject matter since I couldn't get my hands on a copy of the book in time but I'm glad I did. I am inclined to think though that some of it may be filler to help the reader discern for his or herself which may require more critical thinking methods to take serious. See for example modern magicians and sleight of hand. Placebo can also be powerful, it is told. Certain body parts it is said may be ailing because the person is mad at it - that's what the healer would say, and a new relationship is needed to actually heal, cancers included. It should all be about the mindset. If drugs don't really work then it's all about the mind to somehow manipulate the chemical amounts in the brain and body to induce the intended effect.  "
73,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52589155-asdf123,4,"A nice overview of the holographic universe theory developed by Bohm and Pribram. Talbot does a great job at conveying the richness of the subject in a vivid, lively, exciting and easy to read way. I found this book to be quite heavy on anecdotes (of paranormal experiences in particular), which are sure interesting and as they are often quite numerous, can be seen as a form of evidence for this unconventional but intriguing theory. At times I  personally would have wished it had delved a bit more deeply into the science (particularly physics) part, but considering the wide range of the fields included, that would probably have gone beyond the scope of a pop-science book. I see this book more as an appetizer that gives you a nice taste and overview of this theory or idea and how it applies to fields such as physics or psychology, so that you can then delve more into what is of particular interest of you. It's more like an eclectic compilation and attempt of bringing together seemingly disparate fields such as physics, psychology, medicine, spirituality and even mythology in this one theory. And at that it did a great job, as well at making it exciting and easy to read. Even though Talbot admits he doesn't have all the answers or that this theory is yet able to provide it, the arguments and evidence provided in favor of it are very cohesive. And last but not least it is a reminder of the limits of (at least our current, very one-sided form of) science and of how the concepts we create ultimately always fall short in grasping and neatly separating that which is indivisible and unfathomably vast - and everything is, in a holographic universe. It's a reminder of the wholeness and unity of all and the importance of realising this within ourselves. That isolation of a certain subject in reality doesn't work, which includes the isolation of the subject/observer and the studied object. This addresses the same problem as the wave particle duality and the question of the role of the observer in quantum physics, which might render the whole fundament of empirical Sciences highly questionable - here examples and anecdotes are provided of how the subjective within a human (through the force of emotion and belief) can literally spill over into the ""objective"", outside world, molding and shaping it according to the subject's content. As the mind itself also has a hologram like nature, it co-creates and influences reality through its projection, and in turn is also shaped by what is already existing - a constant Flux, a dance, a web, entanglement. (Might this express the same idea as that of quantum entanglement but in a slightly different language?) The reminder of plain, pure experience as a valid - but forgotten and neglected - means of gaining knowledge and understanding, rather than conceptualizing. Or in addition to it. I appreciate the advocating of a reform of science and a more ""participatory approach"", that takes into account the ""omnijective"" (rather than purely subjective or objective) nature of the universe. It is astonishing though that generally this shift hasn't occurred yet. "
74,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10746832-wesley-fox,2,"A disappointment. Talbot introduces the holographic theory built by two prominent scientists in the 20th century. One comes from physics, offering the concept of a holographic universe to explain the weirdness of quantum mechanics at the atomic and subatomic level. The other explains the mysteries of the brain, neuroscience, and psychotherapy with the idea that the brain generates memories and consciousness through a holographic-like process.It is an interesting analogue and one that does offer something that main stream science so far hasn't. It is a model that at least explains some of the un-explainable. Talbot begins with an excellent summary of what a hologram is, how it applies to physics and neuroscience, and what it offers that others don't. A great start. The first two to three chapters were interesting.After that, Talbot abandons the scientific method. He shoots out one paranormal anecdote after another in support of his holographic analogy. Instead of empirical data supporting a model, he cherry picks stories of bizarre experimental results and stories from centuries past to support what is basically his metaphor for reality. From asserting that LSD is superior to conventional psychotherapy or proven medicines, that we can cure cancer with our mind and that people die because they just don't ""believe"" they can cure themselves or want to live badly enough, that telekinesis is real, that faith-healers are real, and most confounding is reference to our minds being able to reshape matter and reality around us.This is ancient aliens pseudo-science crap. I am familiar with a couple of his anecdotes that were debunked as hoaxes long ago. In other instances he puts forth unverifiable and un-reproducible anecdotal data, an approach that is not scientific or credible. Jumping from one wild and weird story that fits better in a 90s early 2000s show about ghosts, UFOs, and bigfoot.These don't support his theory much since they are all one-offs that support different experimental conclusions. A couple seemed unrelated to his holographic universe hypothesis. Talbot is an interesting man and good storyteller but not a scientist. In the nearly three decades since his death there has been no growing evidence or support for his theory.Talbot is an excellent writer, did extensive research, and documented his various stories well. Problem is that after 160+ pages I just did not see much support for his revolutionary theory of reality. He puts forth scientific theories and ideas that many people want to be true but there is limited evidence that any of them are true. If they were, why does it seem that so many are not reproducible? I do not recommend this one. Too frustrated by his unscientific approach to making his case and the lack of validity to several ancedotes that I personally know with highly tenuous credibility."

He applied the metaphor of a hologram to the human psyche and to other living organisms. In the 1980s this concept reached and spoke to many Cultural Creatives, looking for new, useful ways to conceive of our waking psyche.I recently re-read Michael's book. It belongs on a short list of influential compendiums of recent uncoveries and new thinking. Other books in this ""series"" include:- Secret Life of Plants, - Secrets of the Soil, and - Crack in the Cosmic Egg. As someone else noticed, Wm. Blake’s idea of “To see all the world in a grain of sand” is perhaps the first Western hologram meme.The value of Michael's book can be demonstrated by how his ideas can be applied:For each individual, our unique web, our multi-hologram, has multiple facets, most clearly enumerated by employing a couple ""helper metaphors."" Our psyche incorporates multiple facets of intelligence to navigate waking Earth experience. If we analogize each facet of the hologram to a ""suit of clothes,"" an ""ability suit,"" we get this:- We have and make use, of a meat-suit granting us weight and density,- We have and make use of, an imaginal suit granting us vitality and sensory channels in out meat body,- We have and make use of, an emotional suit, granting us capacity to feel and have empathy,- We have and make use of, a mental suit, granting us capacity to think clearly, be alert to externalities, learn and understand language, - We have and make use of, a mythological suit, granting us capacity to admire and imitate worthy role models and formulate goals, Each individual waking adult has a further aspect-facet, which is NOT a ""suit,"" granting us capacity to come to a single point of awareness and say, ""I am.""Our hologram psyche can be conceived as the above hologram of facets, inter-penetrating the same 3D space we call ""me.""The hologram metaphor has potential to permutate in many directions, as demonstrated above. Many ideas can come together within a hologram metaphor. One of our right-brain intelligences is perceiving patterns, and perceiving Gestalts. A 3D hologram is a Gestalt possible for our right brain to perceive and understand. Healthy children up to age 11 are most holotropic, most hologram-like in their expression. Children up thru age 11 tend towards wholeness, expanding in all permitted directions, looking to capitalize on any potential towards wholeness and self-esteem. -=+ -=+ -=+Reviewer Bruce Dickson is a Health Intuitive and writes on Best Practices in Energy Medicine and Holistic Brain Balance topics.http://www.Amazon.com/Bruce-Dickson-M..."

For example, pose two simple questions: Where did we come from? Who are we (really)? Conventional science posits that we evolved from lower life forms, and we, as humanity, are intelligent beings. Still, these responses do not answer where the lower life forms actually came from, and it does not completely define what an intelligent being is. There are theories, but nothing yet in science is proven … 	The Holographic Universe posits that we are more than what we are physically, and the same goes for our surrounding and the Universe. Talbot proposes that we have abilities and access to higher realms that we are not aware of because we are socially conditioned to believe that any consideration of ‘super-human’ abilities and higher realms, are fantasy. Yet, that contention does not explain what beyond human abilities people do possess, and where these abilities come from, i.e., psychic abilities and high (Genius/Juno) inspirations. Insofar as our surroundings, what gives our surroundings its beauty, its light, its diversity? What even gives humanity its inspiration in art, science and technology? The book begs these questions of humanity, nature and the universe being more than (perceived) just and only dead matter. The spark of creation and inspiration come from somewhere. 	Talbot explores these possibilities, and uses scientific research conducted to explore these possibilities, as well as his own anecdotal evidence – which is part of his, and by extension, our own exploring/learning what talent(s)/abilities we do have! Crucially, Talbot also adds that the science as it is currently structured and oriented, has to change in order for people to seriously consider and explore our innate talents, memories (beyond current life) and exploration into other realms beyond what we (are socially programmed to )perceive. Otherwise, it dismisses what it does not narrowly consider quantitative, and therefore, credible evidence. It always sounds crazy to expand the scientific paradigm to consider, let alone accommodate broader data, we then, again, have to consider how do we progress in science, technology, art, cinema, if not by imagination – insight from somewhere else beyond our (only) matter existences? The book raises some valid challenges. However, the shamans and Hindus already know this; it’s just time for humanity in general to catch on, and catch up. Our continued evolution, from a different perspective – if we so choose- depends on it!   "

Was it possible, he wondered, that what the mystics had been saying for centuries was true, reality was “maya,” an illusion, and what was out there was really a vast, resonating symphony of wave forms, a “frequency domain” that was transformed into the world as we know it only after it entered our senses?” (p. 31)Bohm believed that “consciousness and life (and indeed all things) are ensembles enfolded throughout the universe has an equally dazzling flip side. Just as every portion of a hologram contains the image of the whole, every portion of the universe enfolds the whole. This means that if we knew how to access it we could find the Andromeda galaxy in the thumbnail of our left hand. We could also find Cleopatra meeting Caesar for the first time, for in principle the whole past and implications for the whole future are also enfolded in each small region of space and time. Every cell in our body enfolds the entire cosmos. So does every leaf, every raindrop, and every dust mote, which gives new meaning to William Blake’s famous poem:To see a World in a Grain of SandAnd a Heaven in a Wild Flower,Hold Infinity in the palm of your handAnd Eternity in an hour.” (p. 50)“Considered together, Bohm’s and Pribham’s theories provide a new way of looking at the world: Our brains mathematically construct objective reality by interpreting frequencies that are ultimately projections from another dimension, a deeper order of existence that is beyond both space and time. The brain is a hologram enfolded in a holographic universe.” (p. 54)“The idea that the physical body is just one more level of density in the human energy field and is itself a kind of hologram that has coalesced out of the interference pattens of the [auric field] may explain both the extraordinary healing powers of the mind and the enormous control it has over the body in general. . . . This suggests that the field is in some way more primary than the physical body and functions as a kind of blueprint from which the body gets its structural cues. Put another way, the energy field may be the body’s own version of an implicate order.” (pp. 187-88)"
78,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9029324-brendan,2,"If you’re looking for a scientifically based reasoning on why the universe is a hologram, this isn’t it for the most part. It should be placed in the metaphysical/ religious section of the bookstore, not in the science section.Michael starts the book off strong with some science which actually drew me in and intrigued me. He starts off with some quantum physics and how interference patterns occur in the double slit experiment, quantum tunneling and how holograms work. If this part of the book wasn’t there I would have gave 0 stars or a weak 1.After these sections he delves into first hand accounts of near death experiences, UFO encounters, people who self harm and come out unscathed among others, and presents them as scientific fact. He even claims to have had multiple visions himself, such as his spaghetti incident, which he may have but I believe there are usually explanations (sleep paralysis).One of the first examples he gives where I soon after lost interest in the book, was Mirim Dajo whom was known for sticking swords through himself and coming out with no wounds, which Micheal says is due to summoning holographic mind control of his body (or something along those lines...). But I watched the video on YouTube and yeah he does it, but there are scars all over Mirims body and the doctor places it in a specific spots. David Blaine does a similiar thing which he explains himself is that he just gradually stuck metal through his skin till scar tissue build up(like a piercing), which is what is probably occurring with Mirim, still crazy nonetheless but can be explained by biology not pseudoscience that Micheal gives.I do think there are lots of things we don’t truly understand, like with the placebo effect and the effects of certain drugs on the brain and why we see what we see or the body healing by itself. But the facts Micheal presents are little to none and most not based scientifically. So if your interested in weird occurences people have claimed to have had, or some more religious understanding to life, this is the book for you. But if you enjoy understanding the underlying science of things, read the first 80 pages or so then turn away."

There is information on OBEs (Out of Body Experiences), NDEs (Near Death Experiences), miracles, psychic healing, remote viewing, telepathy, telekinesis, and more. This book is not mere speculation, it contains over a 1000 detailed footnotes to books, scientific journals, and even private correspondences with the various researchers. The author's thesis is in the title to the book. But the implications of his thesis are truly mind-blowing. I can not do it justice with a summary here.On a personal note, it has taken me many many months to get through this book. It is not because the book is long, it is only 300 pages. It was not because the book is filled with impenetrable or arcane knowledge; for the most part, I was familiar with the material presented. I did find it annoying that the author's vocabulary exceeded my own, causing me to, far too frequently, to pause and ponder the meaning of some unfamiliar terms. While I was reading this, I took a ""break"" and read a 500 page SciFi novel, among several other books. The reason I found this book so hard to get through is simply the fact that my mind was resisting the truth the author was exposing. I would read a chapter, figuratively shake my head, and put the book down so I could mentally process what the author was saying. When I temporarily recovered from having my worldview destroyed, I would pick the book back up and undergo the process again with the next chapter. My (ego) mind did not want to accept the author's view of reality, in spite of his encyclopedic breadth of knowledge and his well documented, decades worth of research to come to the conclusions that he has reached. This is an advanced book for the truth seeker. Well worth a read if you are ready for it."

But what if they are actually true?Radical open-mindedness was required while reading this one. This book contains hundreds of paradigm-shifting cases across all the spiritual phenomena that have been happening throughout the history of mankind, and are still happening today. He talks about paranormal phenomena, such as telekinesis, OBEs, NDEs, materializations, time travel, UFOs, clairvoyance, healing, auras, energy fields and much more, and merges them together into a theory, according to which the universe is a hologram, that gives a proper context for all those new-age sounding terms.Michael Talbot did a great work at gathering dozens of studies, quotes, stories, and combining them with his personal experience, which makes this book very fascinating to read. It covers a very broad range of spiritual phenomena, and I think is a must-read for everyone who tries to understand and make sense of all the spiritual, paranormal, mystical or mythical occurrences that there are in the world.He not only presents all the stuff mentioned above but wraps them in the context of quantum physics and psychology. He tries to give a proper context to all the mystical stuff with David Bohm's theory of the holographic universe and implicit and explicit orders of reality.In short, many things can be said about this book, but one thing is clear: there are lots of stuff that's going on and has been going on for thousands of years in the world that tells us that reality may not be something material and objective, as we've been taught at school, but rather something mystical and basically unknown to a human mind at this point. So, as much as your materialistic and scientific mind will want to close and throw away this book, my advice is to keep at it and stay open-minded. "

I asked my daughter: is that a person or a mannequin ... she told me ... she is a person, but she is immobile, she looks like a statue ....What would that person be doing? My daughter started asking me if it would be reality what we are seeing in this universe or just an illusion, like a video game, that had an error at that moment.Your questions are not just questions of a fifteen year old girl, they are questions that have been asked and have tried to answer the main religions of the world, all of which have a different vision of reality.Also very based on the oriental ideas of the world, the book of Michael Talbot: ""The holographic universe"", tries to show us that reality is not as we see it, but a holographic projection.The concept is interesting, but although the author tries to make his descriptions in a scientific way, today's scientists will not accept the majority. I think that as a theory it is viable but it has to be elaborated more. I am not a scientist but it can be an alternative to string theory and other explanations that are being tried of the universe.The part where the author ""flew"" is when he tries to explain the paranormal experiences from the point of view of the holographic universe. I think it's interesting but one thing does not come from the other, it's like saying ""because God is good then ..."" and trying to demonstrate a lot of things ... but based on the premise ""God is good"". In the same way it says ""because the universe is holographic then ...."" and has long dissertations.If you are interested in parapsychological reality, you have a very good summary of all of them."
82,0060922583,http://goodreads.com/user/show/310403-kyle,4,"Talbot starts off strong with an introductory section on my second favourite physicist/psychologist team-up since Pauli and Jung, except it is not clear how closely Bohm and Pribram worked together (no co-authorships as far as I can tell, just mutual fascination in holograms). The next section, however, begins to falter as it turns out any medical procedure is a placebo – I kind of believe this anyway, but seeing it in print seems to fan the anti-vaxxer flame. Any controversial claims, thankfully, are out-crazied by parapsychology that have a strong personal connection to the author. His encounters with the holographic nature of the universe make his main thesis, how both mind and matter are projections of something else beyond common experience, more relatable. Whether or not chakras, psychokinesis or shamanism are believed by the reader (once again, I am on board with almost all of these realities), it doesn’t really make Talbot’s arguments stronger or weaker as he has seen firsthand much of the unknown and they are all informing how he lives his life. Being as open to all ways of knowing is something everyone should strive for, and it makes more sense to live in a monad-filled universe that reflects all other monads than the boring Newtonian cause-and-effect one we ended up accepting as reality. Speaking of which, it would have been wonderful to have some mention of VR in connection to the holographic principle, but I am also content to see Star Trek: TNG’s Holodeck referred to as a possible way of understanding the universe, as it is what VR will eventually become."

I found his overall thesis thought-provoking, and his attempt to explain all variety of inexplicable phenomena within a unified cosmology was earnest and impassioned. This was exhaustively researched, but the problem with Michael Talbot is he believes everything he hears. I had to read this alongside Google, stopping and fact checking as I went. While I admire his ambition, he at times loses credibility when he cites the magical and miraculous feats of gurus/mystics/saints that have since been debunked as hoaxes. That was a letdown. There is plenty of good, verifiable stuff in there, woven in with esoteric knowledge and philosophy, but there’s also a fair share of nonsense/BS and I almost stopped after his effusive treatment of stigmatists. I’m glad I persevered beyond that to uncover later gems. Read with a discerning eye and you’ll extract something worthwhile. It’s good bedtime reading and I often stopped and turned to my husband to remark “hey boo did you know...nothing is real”. He’s used to that sort of thing out of me though. This is not a book that is going to explain the physics of the holographic universe-that’s just the umbrella he’s using to fit the paranormal into a potentially scientifically feasible theory. However, it has given me a bibliography for further reading and exploration, and it’s a book that will likely stay with me."

I've recently gotten into the study of physics, quantum mechanics, particle physics, astrophysics, anything regarding the laws of nature and their causality is awesome and interesting to me. Now, I have to say that ""most"" things instead of anything, because this ridiculous pseudoscience began to fall apart by page 50. I should've read more reviews before buying, but I probably still would have bought it since the idea that science mixed with paranormal happenings sounds appealing and COULD have been good. Unfortunately, it was poorly executed by sounding like a cult conspiracy. Like many other reviews have said, it starts out promising. Karl Pribram and David Bohm's theories on the holographic universe are intricate, thoughtful, and interesting. Ultimately, their ideas of the holographic universe are still theories, and until further evidence it's preferable being respected as such. There's no denying that the universe is vast, truly anything is plausible with plentiful evidence and arguments to back it. But when it comes to a writer's personal beliefs mixed in with ""scientific fact"", beware of what you feed yourself. I can't look at this book as anything more than a science fiction novel."

Very good book exploring the latest radical theory of Quantum Physics, The Theory Of Hologram. Reality as we know in our material Earth plane is very different. The Universe or Cosmos is alive pulsating with Energy, all reality seen & experienced as well as the unexplained paranormal phenomenon of telepathy, clairvoyance, other spiritual & mystical phenomenon are dimensional projections of our mind consciousness. Modern conventional Science cannot explain the non-material aspects of our Microcosm & Macrocosm Cosmos. Much before Quantum Physics became popular, if we study the various Ancient Scriptures like the Indian Vedas & other literature, these concepts of Holographic Universe, existence of Parallel Multi-Universes are clearly explained. Unfortunately the Western Scientific Community & Institutions have systematically destroyed the essence of all Ancient Science as myths & stories, ridiculed all Eastern Knowledge. It is this same Western Society now re-discovering all Ancient Knowledge in new format. Its like old wine in new bottle. Quantum Physics is derivative of Ancient Wisdom.

It intrinsicly interweaves spirituality with science by providing a theory which has been subject to peer-reviewed, repeatable experiments. Mostly based on the work of Bohm (1917-1992) and Pribrahm (1919-2015).In the second part, you kind of need to sift through the author’s biased opinions and interpretation of those experiments. His tone shifts from uncertainty to one of absolute certainty – grounded mainly in his own empirical findings.A wise man (aka Neil Degrasse Tyson) once said that eyewitness testimonies are about as valuable to science as a kitchen utensil is to a dog. (Though not with my specific analogy)Nevertheless did this book spark my interest in more serious works on the subject of the holographic theory. So in that sense, I do think that this book can act as a gateway for further exploration for the reader – if they succeed in not getting lost in Talbot’s ideology.

Talbot does a good job of presenting these ideas with his own personal anecdotes to help the reader along - he isn't sheepish, and he's also not the arbiter of stony truth. These are ideas that present readers an opportunity to think differently about our personal life, our communities, our planet, and the infinite cosmos. You don't have to believe anything in this book to enjoy this book. You only have to be someone who loves dipping a toe into the world of ideas."

When you are seeking answers as all humans do, you are bound to make mistakes along the way and those can be forgiven because this book undoubtedly will be thought-provoking at a minimum; the basic theory of this book is that the space-time continuum and consciousness are interacting with each other and the interfering wave patterns result in everything we see and interact with (matter)."
