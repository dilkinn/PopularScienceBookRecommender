0,0192806025,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,5,"I confess that I wasn’t expecting to love a book that focuses on photosynthesising plants; I don’t have a huge interest in plants, as a general rule, and I picked this up because it was one of the Oxford Landmark Science books. Buuuut this book definitely got me interested in the way plants work, the various types of photosynthesis, etc. It’s written in an engaging style — you can feel that Beerling loves his topic, and it really works.I find myself recommending this to people now. If you don’t understand how much we rely on the photosynthesising part of the biosphere, well, maybe it’s time you got a wake-up call. And I think this book could get anyone enthused.Reviewed for The Bibliophibian."
1,0192806025,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672661-lois-bujold,4,"Dratted Goodreads just ate my review... try again.Well, hm. Not quite the book I was looking for. This was more of a scattered grab-bag, which did include interesting recent news on plant and atmospheric science and some good history of scientists, but it lacked... cumulative narrative flow? The writing was good on a section-by-section basis, but putting it all together was more of a do-it-yourself project than I was quite on for.I'd wanted something to give me a round-up of all that is currently known about plant evolution, starting with, say, cyanobacteria, touring the cladistic relationships, and bringing one up to the present. (Well, probably not all, which would require not a volume but the Library of Trantor.) But something more basic, botanical, and chronological. I'm sure such a volume is out there, but it's not this book, which has a different, perhaps larger-scale, focus.Ta, L. "
2,0192806025,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3522435-tom,4,"Oh earth you fox of a planet! If you have read Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis then you might enjoy this more orthodox account of the relationship between Earth's climate and the action of plants. It turns out those naughty plants have repeatedly kicked the planet out of climate equilibrium by monkeying around with atmospheric CO2 levels.So basically, climate change will be just fine: During the Eocene climatic optimum there were no polar icecaps, and there were forests on Antarctica. In the short term we'll almost certainly cause a horrific mass extinction maybe accompanied by a collapse in human population and weeping and gnashing of teeth. In the long term, 10 million years from now your great great grandchildren will be joyously picking mushrooms in the midnight sun of a balmy Antarctic summer. Hooray!"
3,0192806025,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5624130-emma,4,Over all an excellent book. Beerling’s style of writing makes this book accessible to everyone. He is clear and concise which reminded me of the no nonsense approach of journal articles. In some places this means a humorous remark or observation reads awkwardly.There were a couple of parts of the book that I felt deviated from plants for a little too long. The fact I was left thinking “Get on with the plant stuff already” is a credit to Beerling and his ability to draw the reader into a subject matter.This next gripe is a bit petty but I hate it when the notes are at the back of a book! It is more in tune with the academic style to have notes after the text but in a popular science publication flicking to and fro from the reading page to the notes was driving me crazy. I hate interrupting my reading flow and it pains me to think some people may not have even bothered to read them.
4,0192806025,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1768003-sam,3,"While this is a very informative book, it wasn't quite what I expected and as a result I found I didn't enjoy it quite as much as I could have. I was expecting a book about how plants have evolved and how this has affected the planet's history and climate and while Beerling does cover this to a certain extent the main thrust of the book was more about the effects plants have had on everything else and how these discoveries were made. Don't get me wrong, this is very well written, well researched and surprisingly easy to read given the complexity of the subjects covered and it is one I would certainly recommend, it just didn't match with my expectations (or the title for that matter). It is a very interesting read though, it's just more about the planet than the plants."
5,0192806025,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9188766,3,"Though the topic is obviously interesting, the book somehow persists to be extremely draggy."
6,0192806025,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2702966-mareike,5,"The Emerald Planet gives a broad introduction to the combined fields of paleontology, geology and botany. The book follows a scheme of introducing leading researchers and their contribution to the field, which I personally find very interesting (i.e. I like to get more of a context of the researchers that lived at round about the same period and how hypotheses developed with time).Having a basic understanding of geological time and its division into ages definitely helps understanding this book, but this is also remarked at the beginning. If you're completely new to this field, try and have a geological chart with you to know what period the author is referring to (e.g. the Carboniferous or Eocene as times of extreme climates).Although this is not a textbook, the extensive list of references to scientific papers and other publications is also a fantastic starting point to dive deeper into this field and start studying this topic independently.Roughly, this book covers:- early and recent investigations into plant evolution- explanations of important chemical networks (i.e. photosynthesis and respiration, ozone formation, rock weathering)- implications of fluctuating atmospheric composition for the climatic system of our planet."
7,0192806025,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2726875-filipe-dias,5,"A subject I never gave much attention to, plants. They don't appear to share the thrill of learning about animals and so I guess that for most people they're no more than scenery, food or just the home for animals.I used to see them like that, as 2nd class beings after animals, and so after watching the BBC series ""How to grow a planet"", very much based on this wonderful book, I was dumbstruck and had to know more.The book itself is simple, not many details that would be too specific to understand by the average science enthusiast like myself, but the writting style can somewhat be confusing or deal with many open concepts sometimes. One has to find a balance always into getting too technical or too dumbed down, and this book hits an excellent place as it portrays the scientific findings and how they can be interpreted and criticised. A very hard target well achieved here.Why is it a 5 star book? Because it completely shows me the world in a new light. I thought I knew a thing or two about some of the fields focused on the book, but I was deeply wrong. Plants, it's amazing what you can do."
8,0192806025,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19446286-elentarri,4,"Nicely written book that explores the changing physiology of plants and how this affects the climate in the past and possibly the future. I found this to be an extremely interesting book and learned a whole lot of new things which is the whole point to reading science books.NOTE: Due to the large number of diagrams, it is probably better to read a print version of this book rather than an epub/mobi version since the diagrams are rather small on an e-reader."
9,0192806025,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18293816-bill-leach,3,"This book is largely about various mechanisms that have affected the earth's climate over the eons. The plant connection is twofold - plant fossils have provided information on past climates and how they have changed, but also plant growth has been a factor in climate change.The author discusses numerous feedback effects that have been proposed in earth processes. Examples include a negative feedback where higher oxygen levels encouraged vegetation fires thus reducing vegetation burial and reducing oxygen levels. Many of these effects are speculative and quantification is uncertain, showing just how poorly understood are earth processes.The first vascular plants, which appeared 425 mya, had bare branches but no leaves. Leaves developed 30 my later, and diversified greatly by the start of the Carboniferous period 360 mya. The homeobox gene KNOX, found in many plants, must be turned off for leaves to develop. The upper surface of the leaf is specialized for gathering light, while stomata on the lower surface control the uptake of carbon dioxide needed for photosynthesis. As the stomata also loose water, plant evolution using the HIC gene, tends to minimize the number of stomata, given the carbon dioxide uptake requirement. Trees in southern England have 40 percent fewer stomata than 150 years ago. Early land plants living in the CO2 rich atmosphere had less than 5 stomata per square millimeter, while plants living in the current relatively low CO2 environment have several hundred per square millimeter. More pores mean greater transpiration, providing better cooling and allowing larger leaves which gather more heat. Large leaves are an effect of an atmosphere with lower carbon dioxide concentration.The long-term carbon cycle has CO2 being released by volcanic action which falls with the rain dissolving rock. The carbonate is used by animals to build shells. When they die, the shells fall to the ocean bottom and subduction eventually buries the carbon deep in the earth. A feedback effect exists whereby warmer temperatures increase weathering, reducing CO2 concentrations and the greenhouse effect - thereby cooling the planet. When the plants underwent their Paleozoic explosion, the increased fixing of CO2 by plant action caused the CO2 concentration to plummet. Plants dissolve rocks at five times the rate that precipitation does.The oxygen content of the atmosphere rose to about 35 percent, starting in the Devonian, peaking in the Permian, then dropping to as low as 15 percent by the early Triassic. The high oxygen levels allowed giant insects to evolve. It is apparently thought that the abundant growth of plants during the Carboniferous lead to the higher oxygen levels, and the subsequent stimulation of the long-term carbon cycle brought the oxygen levels back down. The author is not clear on this issue, however.A chapter on the ozone layer introduces the idea that a breakdown of the ozone layer caused the huge extinction at the end of the Permian. The proposed mechanism revolves around massive volcanism from the Siberian Traps releasing chlorine, warming releasing methane from the oceans and stagnation of the oceans.Plant fossils from Greenland and Sweden suggest a pulse of carbon dioxide, rich in C12, at the Triassic - Jurassic boundary, leading to global warming and a hot climate. The current thinking is that eruptions of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province released massive amounts of carbon dioxide, warming the oceans and releasing the C12 rich methanes from hydrates, in turn causing additional warming.Polar forests existed between 75 and 80 degrees north, fossils dating to 45 mya having been found in the Canadian Arctic. The preserved leaves are those of the Dawn Redwood. While forests are now limited in their northern expansion by permafrost, at the time temperatures were higher. The forests had to deal with the virtual lack of light during the winter. However, the growth rings average 4 mm, compared to northern larches that currently produce 2 mm of growth per year. The annual productivity of wood in these polar forests has been calculated as being comparable to the southern forests of Chile. The polar forests were deciduous - the author reviews various theories as to why that was the case.The warm temperatures of the Eocene peaked about 50 mya. They have steady fallen since then, except for a warming period in the Miocene between 15 and 25 mya. The cause of the warm Eocene has been proposed as ocean circulation patterns or global warming due to the presence of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and water vapor. The author reviews many of the mechanisms of warming. Climate modeling has had little success in reproducing the temperature changes.Most plants a mechanism for photosynthesis that uses a triple carbon molecule, giving the process the name C3 carbon fixation. Only in the 1960's was it recognized that some plants use a different mechanism, termed C4 carbon fixation, which makes more efficient use of the available carbon dioxide. C4 is used by largely by grasses, but evolved some 45 times in various species. While only 3 percent of all plant species use C4 carbon fixation, they account for 30 percent of the productivity of the terrestrial biosphere. Strangely, the C4 plants only became significant some 8 mya."
10,0192806025,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3159861-marcelv,4,"Accessible but still informative book, which covers a rather overshadowed group of organisms; plants. Lots of interesting insights into the plant world and the evolution of plants in general."
11,0192806025,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4313152-mandy-haggith,5,"A really good, in-depth explanation of plant evolution and the impact plants have had on the planet. "
12,0192806025,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26429755-martin-hayes,4,"Well written and accessible to the non-scientist, so long as you have a good general knowledge."
13,0192806025,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4399620-jim-mastro,5,"Loved this book. Beerling clearly laid out the many ways that plants have shaped our planet, affecting its geology, its weather, its climate, and the development and evolution of animal life. I knew snippets of this before, but nowhere near the whole story. It was absolutely fascinating. Definitely recommended if you are interested in the life history of our planet. Can be a bit technical in places, but even if you don't have a science background the material is accessible. Recommended."
14,0192806025,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15847575-marc-oliver,4,"I love reading about the evolution of plant life on earth — how plants have been influencing the global climate, the evolution of life in general and how plants themselves are a geological force of nature. It’s an excellent book. However, I could have done with a little less history of scientists, and I would have preferred a more coherent narrative style."
15,0192806025,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36257554-zo,3,"This was enjoyable and readable, with a few terrifying sections concerning climate change. I knew about quite a lot of the scientific discoveries mentioned but I liked reading about the historical context and the people whose pioneering work helped us understand the effect of plant life on earth systems and their ability to tell is about the climates of the past."
16,0192806025,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19054809-sarah,4,Fascinating about plants and also gives a good insight into how science works. The only problem is this is the author’s first popular science book and sometimes he forgets who he is writing for especially in the early chapters. There were occasions when the explanations needed more explaining.
17,0192806025,http://goodreads.com/user/show/68022124-steve-lee,5,"A fascinating book that looks at geological history from a very different perspective. I've now moved on to the author's other book: Making Eden, which, with hindsight, I would have preferred to read first."
18,0192806025,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19506824-martina,4,Hm I guess I expected more physiology but very interesting anyways.
19,0192806025,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37736420-harshith-gowda,5,"A great account emphasising the role of plants in shaping earth's past, present and future"
20,0192806025,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4339777-mark,3,"This is something in between a history of plants on Earth, and a set of essays on that theme. It does start with the development of leaves, and then moves on to the plants' creation of massively high oxygen levels in the Carboniferous (the era of dragonflies with 5' wings) so the first two chapters felt like it would be a tour of plant evolution.This is probably far too broad a topic, and in any event is not what we get. Nothing about the evolution of flowers or the period worldwide redwood forests, for example. Instead the themes are not merely what was important to plants, but when plants were important to the climate, or even our understanding, through fossils, of the climate. This is a fascinating picture of a dynamic planet, constantly changing in response to a dance between geological processes and plants, which respond and then change the atmosphere and soil in turn.The chapters cover the science with some technical detail, but also the history of the science, and in some cases the quirks of the scientists. The implications of these sorts of changes to modern day climate change is mentioned more than once, but happily the science is treated as interesting on its own terms, rather than a tool for the present. Some of the research referenced seems cutting edge, which is actually both a complement and a concern--I'd expect at least one or two of the stories to change as we learn more about the distant past. (Not a knock on Beerling, who is quite up front about uncertainties.) My only other nitpick is my ebook was missing the full color plates.For my own reference the chapters are below--spoilerized, although the stories are tens of millions of years old, it's probably better to just read the book.(view spoiler)[- The evolution of leaves took place only when CO2 dropped. This was the ""Cambrian explosion"" of plants, but before CO2 dropped thin photosynthetic stalks were better at managing water loss and heat.- Oxygen level shot up in the Carbiniferous. In general oxygen varied between 15 and 30% or so in the Earth's history; contrary to Lovelock increased fires did not stop oxygen from reaching high levels.- The Permian extinction was probably caused by the collapse of the ozone layer, possibly by volcanic emissions passing through halogen containing layers (in Siberia?) to create the aerosol can from hell. (Note: Beerling does not use the term 'aerosol can from hell.')- Increased CO2 (and global temperatures) cleared the way in the late Triassic for the dinosaur era, probably caused by more geological upheaval.- The forests of the poles were not evergreens, but deciduous. Interestingly the six months of darkness wasn't apparently the driving force for them dropping their leaves, as it's expensive to regrow them; rather, it was the ability to grow quickly in the summer months that let them outstrip their more stately conifer brethren.- The Eocene warm spell (50 million years ago) probably hit peaks not driven by CO2 so much as amplified by methane hydrate release. No, there's nothing to worry about with the IPCC projections, why do you ask?- Grasses and weeds use a C4 pathway rather than a C3 pathway in photosynthesis. This is far more efficient and they can do it by concentrating CO2 in organelles beyond normal atmospheric levels. Furthermore, once grasses get going (maybe eight million years ago) they increase the frequency of fires, killing trees and opening up more areas for colonization by rapidly growing grasses. (So they are nasty ""disruptive innovators"" destroying the world's traditional forests . . . some stories hit too close to home.) (hide spoiler)]This was all well presented. I'd recommend this if it sounds at all interesting; the fact that I can type things like ""High oxygen levels in the Carboniferous"" a month after finishing the book is a credit to Beerling's ability to fit each chapter's facts into a coherent narrative, rather than my fading memory."
21,0192806025,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15651131-last-ranger,5,"The Climate Puzzle!For me The Emerald Planet contained all the elements necessary for a good science book. One, it was written by a working scientist: Paleoclimatologist David Beerling who has published papers in some leading scientific journals as well as another book on this same general subject (but that one is priced way out of my budget). I found his writing to be readily accessible to the interested layman. Botany and its effect on the climate are the main theme but Beerling also touches on several other scientific disciplines that relate to the issue: physics, chemistry, paleontology, geology, etc.. He also delves into the history of this study, referring to numerous other scientist and discoveries made over past years. The book itself starts out with , of all things, the Galileo spacecraft that, on its way to Jupiter, needed a little help in the form of some slingshots around Earth and Venus. While passing Earth the spacecraft was able to scan the atmosphere as a test to see if our probes could detect life. The test was successful and led to some important discoveries about our climate. The author goes on to talk about plant evolution, how small leafless plants first invaded land and, when environmental conditions were just right, went on to develop leaves. It turns out that the chemical make up of the atmosphere ( carbon dioxide ) played a major role in that development. So, basically, we have a feedback system in place; things like carbon dioxide and oxygen, among others, enable plants and animals to live and develop while life itself gives those things back to the environment in a never ending ""circle of life"". I think anyone interested in botany, evolution or natural history and science in general might find this book to be a good read. I read this book on my Kindle and had no technical problems with this edition. However I did find an anomaly that may not set well with some readers. The book has numerous line drawings and charts that show up well on the Kindle ( in the text look for: ""see fig xx"", you click on it and the Kindle takes you right to fig xx). The hard bound edition also has several black & white ""plates"" but these are not on the Kindle edition even though they are listed in the table of contents and through out the text ( see plate xx) but you click on it and it goes nowhere. Other than that I'm more than satisfied with this purchase and the fact of missing plates does not diminish the text in any way.Last Ranger"
22,0192806025,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5876945-ryan,2,"This book felt like a collection of research papers, with a level of detail in a topic of each chapter that would only interest true specialists, i.e. other paleoclimatologists or paleobotanists. If you think modeling our current climate is complex, trying to figure out past climates and the factors that affected them is a yet higher level of complexity. The sheer number of variables involved - composition of atmospheric gases, layout of continents, ocean currents, amount of solar radiation, type and prevalence of different organisms etc. make this an almost impossible task. And to top it all, one only has fossils and ice cores to work with as evidence, more or less. Perhaps because it seems so complicated that I was not entirely convinced by the arguments put forth in each chapter in explaining how climate on Earth was like millions of years ago, and the role plant life had in it. There are just too many factors that could change the story one way or the other!I would not recommend this book to anyone unless he or she has a genuinely deep interest in paleoclimates. It is written by a scientist for a scientific audience, and I suspect the layperson would not get much enjoyment out of it."
23,0192806025,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92052562-garry-nixon,4,"I bought this because it was referred to in Dawkins' The Ancestor's Tale on the grounds that the structure of that book meant any narrative of plant evolution was truncated. However, this is NOT the story of plant evolution I was expecting, rather it's a series of stories from the history of plant science. So I shrugged and enjoyed it anyway for what it was. Most interesting to me was the discussion about how plants survived in the non-frozen Arctic during the sunless winter periods. I'm trying to suppress weeds at the allotment with membrane, so plants-without-light was topical for me. And as should be the case with popular science, it gave me a enough grounding to go to the scientific journal articles on this subject (ie dark senescence) with sufficient wherewithal to be able glean some sense from them. "
24,0192806025,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1465827-john,4,"I found this fascinating as most books on the history of the planet focus on people or dinosaurs. This is not a history of plants per se, but more a discussion of what plant fossils tell us about the history of the atmosphere, although plant evolution is discussed along the way. It was interesting to learn that at one time the level of carbon dioxide was much higher and at another time the oxygen level was much higher. This is discussed in the context of our current global warming.Minor complaints: the font was rather small for a hardback book and a few artist's renderings of some of the plants discussed would have been helpful. "
25,0192806025,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2658996-ben,4,"Beerling makes science interesting to read. He doesn't just state scientific facts, but instead describes the history and methods behind scientific discoveries. He does a good job of explaining ""how"" throughout the book, so it is appropriate that this word is in the title. For instance, ancient animals and plants were huge. But why? Beerling describes how scientists gathered information to answer this question."
26,0192806025,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7617616-daniel-hulmes,2,"Giving this book a 2 star review feels a little harsh as it's very interesting in parts and covers a subject which is largely ignored by popular science. However, I just couldn't get into it. I expected a book on plant evolution but the book is more concerned with how plants have altered the earths atmosphere throughout geological time. It is therefore of more interest to Paleontologists and geologists than to a student of Biology such as myself."
27,0192806025,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9388055-fred-dameron,4,Very use full. Maybe we need to stop planting fast growing conifers and instead replant with slow growth broad leafs. Soak up more carbon but aren't as quick to grow and then get reharvested. Maybe Earths needs instead of Georgia Pacific should hold sway over how we replant after clear cutting?
28,0192806025,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1579520-demetra,0,Brilliant writing. This book changed how I saw the plant and mineral kingdoms. The writer is a sort of an Indiana Jones of the paleobotany community. 
29,0192806025,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5869795-steve-mitchell,5,It's such a refreshing change to read a book on evolution that skims the animals and concentrates on the plants.
