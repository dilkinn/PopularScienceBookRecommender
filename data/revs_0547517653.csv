0,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6609117-eustacia-tan,4,"I will be the first to admit that I'm not good at math. Despite taking Higher Maths in IB (I just practiced so many times that I somehow knew how to solve the question), I still didn't understand a lot of concepts. And despite all the quotes about how math was beautiful in my textbooks, I still just don't get it. And I suspect that this problem isn't unique to me a lone. So, I was really intrigued by the promise of this book to be a guided (and fun) tour of math.The Joy of X, unlike what the name suggests, doesn't start from algebra. Instead, it starts from what we all consider basic - the concept of numbers. From there, we move on to addition and subtraction, and the book gets progressively harder as we head into algebra, geometry, calculus, statistics and finally, the biggest number of them all, infinity. If you're looking for a ""how-to"" guide book, then this book probably isn't for you. After reading it, I can't say that I fully understand all the basic concepts in maths, but I am much more interested in them now. Each chapter is short and sweet, and I suspect that the fact that each chapter is fairly short means that there is less time to understand each concept. So what we do get is a very interesting introduction to the concept, designed to spark your interest. And really, with the internet (and all the math textbooks lying around. Oh, you already burned yours?), you can always study the topics that interest you in-depth by yourself. To me, the true gem of this book is how it encouraged me to regain hope that math can be fun and rewarding. I would say, that if you're looking for a fun and interesting explanation on one particular topic, you should check out the ""manga-guide"" series (e.g. The Manga Guide to Statistics). But if you're looking to encourage yourself after feeling like you will never understand mathematics, or simply want to regain a spark of curiosity in maths (doesn't it too often feel like the mere memorisation of formulae?), then you should definitely pick up this book.Disclaimer: I got this book free from NetGalley in exchange for a free and honest review.First posted at Inside the mind of a Bibliophile"

He likes Archimedes. We then played on table with “ kinder augen.” Seagulls watched as we attempted to replicate Archimedes lever using a fork, saltshaker and finger while salty breezes blew the blue linen corners. “The Joy of X: A Guided Tour of Math, from one to Infinity” is not a rollercoaster ride in math. Yet it is a rather elegant meandering from algebra to vector calculus. In the smallest and rudimentary forms of life math leaves its indelible signature on little things like dragonflies to large black and white zebra stripes. Discovery within how number three is not naked. How is the correct formula for Y = 3G really F = 3Y?""Princeton rejected his application... His best option, though he found it depressing, was MIT... In physicist Gell-Mann's eyes, MIT was a grubby technological institute, beneath his rarefied taste... He could always go to MIT and commit suicide later if he had to, but not the other way around.""---Steven Henry StrogatzHarvard man Steven has us brushing up against Galileo and Georg Cantor in realizing that infinity could occupy three varied types. Math and mental illness (for Georg) seemed to be bitter common companions despite his orchestration of set theory. Royal Society awarded him the Sylvester Medal in 1904 post hospitalization.Word etymology is fascinating as the light shines brightly on algebra and how the word is Arabic from the word “al Jabr” meaning restoring---taking term on one side of equation and restoring balance by moving it to the other side. Who knew algebra came out of the need to solve Islamic law fair division issues? Find wisdom within (giving clarity to the blind). Buy."
2,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61519-aerin,3,"This book is based on Strogatz's online New York Times column, ""The Elements of Math,"" and on the whole I found it a little underwhelming.I typically rate pop-math books based on how many ""fuck, that's cool"" moments they elicit, and that's a game of diminishing returns - many of my ""fuck, that's cool"" resources were spent on books I read previously (and recommend more heartily), like Bellos's  Here's Looking at Euclid and  The Grapes of Math, Parker's  Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension, and Cochrane's  The Secret Life of Equations. My well of fucks hath run dry, I suppose.Still, this book has some nice moments, like a very cool and very ancient graphical breakdown of the quadratic formula (chapter 10), a visual method showing why the area of a circle is πr^2 (chapter 16), a few nifty brainteasers on probability (chapter 23), and some almost poetic commentary on the strange qualities of prime numbers (chapter 25). And I'm so glad this book introduced me to Vi Hart's mathtastic YouTube channel.There's more cool stuff in here (visual proofs of the Pythagorean theorem never fail to enchant me, for instance), but I had come across them before. So if this is the first pop-math book you've picked up, it's probably not a bad choice! But it wouldn't be my first recommendation."
3,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2375838-cheryl,4,"I wish I could have read this book during that hell year of first year university, when I barely passed calculus despite devoting more time to studying it then the other 4 subjects combined (or maybe it just seemed like that -- very long nights in the library, writing out reams of papers of formulae, the table strewn with my hair and tears).Now sufficient time has passed and, like childbirth, I forget the pain and remember only those good moments, the eureka! ones.This isn't a book for geeks and nerds, coz they already get this stuff. But for the rest of us who might still be curious, it is just as advertised in the blurb. One of my favourites was the explanation of the quadratic formula. I learned how to solve it, but never understood ""...the cleverness packed into that porcupine of symbols."" He says that ""The quadratic formula is the Rodney Dangerfield of algebra. Even though it's one of the all-time greats, it don't get no respect."" He then goes on to provide and illustrate the history and concept of the equation with elegant passages such as, ""The upshot is that x² and 10x are now moving gracefully as a couple, rather than stepping on each other’s toes, by being paired within the single expression (x + 5)². That’s what will soon enable us to solve for x.""And then there's this excerpt from the discussion of π, and infinity to the rescue:""What’s so charming about this calculation is the way infinity comes to the rescue. At every finite stage, the scalloped shape looks weird and unpromising. But when you take it to the limit—when you finally get to the wall—it becomes simple and beautiful, and everything becomes clear. That’s how calculus works at its best.""and""This approach is known as the method of exhaustion because of the way it traps the unknown number pi between two known numbers that squeeze it from either side. The bounds tighten with each doubling, thus exhausting the wiggle room for pi.""This man loves math, and the reader can't help being caught up in the passionate and well-written explanations."
4,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3260895-stuart,4,"Are you the type of person who spent hours on the bus on the way to school working out multiplication tables for prime numbers only? When you're having sex do you find that the earth may not move, but images of numbers and mathematical symbols appear in your head when things are going great? OK, I'm getting a little too personal here, but if you're a numbers geek, you'll love this book.Steven Strogatz writes in a very chatty, entertaining style about the nature of mathematics, from number theory all the way through calculus. This book is the perfect present to give to your geeky nephew/niece/husband/wife/son/daughter who majored in electrical engineering/math/comp sci/physics. They will be thoroughly amused and maybe even laugh out loud at some of the clever descriptions of the math they know so well.I knew some of the stories and anecdotes told here, but certainly not most of them. The Joy of x would be an excellent beach read for a geek. I'm knocking off one star only because I doubt someone who isn't as numbers obsessed as I am will find this book, lighthearted and witty though it may be, accessible."
5,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,3,"You wouldn’t know it, but maths permeates everything we do and touch. Your smartphone would not be able to operate without maths, nor would the internet. You couldn’t buy anything risk free if we didn’t have the primes. Things as unlikely as the correct time to flip a mattress, the number of people to date before settling down, the best path from A to B, that if you look hard enough you can see sine waves everywhere all have some element of maths in them. He does manage to take a subject that many people find confusing and make it manageable and understandable and possibly a tiny bit less scary. There is the odd subject that will make non mathematical readers blanch a bit (it involves quadratic equations), but you’ll be pleased to hear that there are not many subjects that he cannot clearly illuminate. It is packed with photos, picture and diagrams to help illustrate each of the short punchy subjects. Overall a good introduction to maths for those who need to brush up a little when staring at their children’s homework in a bemused fashion."
6,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2620012-jim,5,"Struggling through several years of higher math in engineering school in the 1960s didn't engender a love of mathematics in me. It wasn't until years later that I began to value the beauty and elegance of mathematics. A big part of my appreciation came from mathematicians like Steven Strogatz who wrote about math for readers who appreciated the concepts but had no desire to wade into a morass of complex equations.In The Joy of x, Strogatz has done a masterful job as our tour guide through the elements of mathematics, and he's done it without ""dumbing it down"" or making it just another refresher course for the subject. He presented the various mathematical elements and concepts in fresh new ways, but he clearly expected the reader to exercise their mind to understand. The reward was a new appreciation of the beauty of mathematics and for how our knowledge of the subject advanced in fits and starts over several thousand years.The book has six parts, each presenting certain elements of mathematics: Numbers, Relationships, Shapes, Change, Data, and Frontiers. These sections represent a grand tour through the history and development of mathematics, including the practical - and some whimsical - applications. Never again will I fall into the trap of bungling the answer to the classic ""If three men paint three fences in three hours, how long will it take for one man to paint one fence?"" (answer: 3 hours). Now I understand why a piece of paper can't be folded in half more than 7-8 times, and how a high school junior was able to beat the record using a monstrously long roll of... toilet paper! I know how Luke could guarantee himself a win over Darth Vader in a game of laser tag (hint: it involves a conic section). For young lovers, mathematics could help in finding the perfect mate (if you make a few simplistic assumptions, that is). And if the prosecution in the O.J. Simpson murder trial had understood probability and statistics, could they have gotten a conviction?As enjoyable as the first five sections of the book were, my favorite section was the last, ""Frontiers,"" where the author covered topics including prime numbers, where I learned that no one has ever found an exact formula to find primes; group theory, which bridges the arts and sciences; topology; spherical geometry; and infinite series. This section presented some fascinating ideas. For example, group theory suggests how to get the most even wear from a mattress and confirms the old mnemonic ""spin in the spring, flip in the fall."" For topology, the famous Möbius strip is examined. I thought I understood the properties of a Möbius strip, but they're actually more remarkable than I would have guessed. And the most mind-blowing concept was that some infinities are larger than others. This finding, which was bitterly contested at the time, is brilliantly demonstrated with a parable named the Hilbert Hotel.I don't always read all of the footnotes or endnotes in a book, but the endnotes in The Joy of x are not to be missed. There are dozens of links to websites and online videos that demonstrate or expound on the concepts presented in the book. Some of these were so intriguing that I spent a couple of hours being spellbound by them.For anyone who's been disappointed by other math books written for laypersons, The Joy of x may be the book they've been hoping for. With keen insight, a light touch, and a bit of humor, author Steven Strogatz has written a splendid book for anyone who wants a broader understanding of mathematics.Note: I read an advance reader copy of this book provided by the publisher through NetGalley."
7,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4413597-praxedes,5,"If you feel that Mathematics is not for you, please read this book. Strogatz deftly guides the reader through some of the most important ideas in the field, using easily digestible examples. I was able to grasp concepts that eluded me all through graduate school with ease.Most people think Math is about numbers, but it is much more than that. When used properly it is more akin to a language or a philosophy, a way to understand the world we can see and the many worlds we cannot. Some scenarios are clearly memorable, such as his explanation of how Google's PageMark works (that is the algorithm that assigns relative weights to the almost infinite web addresses).Definitely a worthwhile read!"
8,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/126714-angela,5,"I love this book. My only regret is that I couldn't read it in high school, when I was *actually* struggling with math. At this point (having degrees & math & math education & have spent over a decade teaching the subject and/or teachers of it), I read it more from the point of view of, ""How could I use pieces of this with students and/or the teachers that I work with?""In these 30 short essays--a couple of which I had read before in his Time column--Strogatz begins at the beginning (with the concept of counting) and winds his way through everything from basic algebra to calculus to advanced topics like group theory and topology, discussing each topic in a way that is not only friendly and approachable for the mathematical neophite (or phobic), but fascinating. And for all that the book is aimed at a general audience, I have to admit that I learned a few fascinating things about some topics that I didn't even learn in my advanced semester-long college classes. (Did you know there are real-world applications from infinite series? I didn't!)So yes, this is a book about math, but it isn't just for math lovers. In fact, it's probably more for people who felt like they ""never really got it"" in school but are maybe just a little intrigued and kind of want another crack at it (in a way that doesn't involve doing homework). I also think it makes a GREAT resource for math teachers. (I used the two calculus essays as introductions to each semester of the course, differential & integral respectively. They give a really great, 30,000 ft overview that I thought might help the students see what it was we were really doing and why before we got bogged down in problem sets.)"
9,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,5,"I wish all math was taught with the passion and insight Strogatz brings to the subject. This was not as fantastic as Infinite Powers, which ended up becoming a favorite book of all time for me, but it made me wish I could go back in time and make all the connections outlined in this book before learning the math taught to me from middle school through college. I spent so much time memorizing. If only I had looked at foci from the point of Luke Skywalker trying to hit Darth Vader with a light saber. I think I would have understood things in a more intuitive manner. Strogatz takes his reader through the most basic math through calculus by helping the reader make the necessary connections to understand not just what a theorem says so that you can solve a problem, but connections so that you start seeing the world in mathematical terms. Then no matter what problems comes your way, you solve it not from memorization of a rule but from a true understanding of what the problem is actually asking you about the world and universe in which you live. Strogatz teaching style is second to none. "
10,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/406763-mikell,5,"I applaud you, Stephen Strogatz, for truly putting the joy back in math! My life might have been very different if I had read this book in high school. Biology was my passion, but I avoided the field because of the math courses required for a bachelor of science degree.My father was a calculus professor and he made math interesting and approachable. He died when I was 13 and afterwards numbers became a challenge because my teachers never explained them with flair and passion. My dad said, ""If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it."" Strogatz understands it and effectively communicates so that YOU will understand.Words and art have been my passion all my life, but the world of numbers left me cold. After of life time of being intimidated by numbers, I'm falling in love with math again. If you, or anyone you know is intimidated by numbers, find a copy of this book and settle in for a delightful spin on the world of math!"
11,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4054541-wayne-mccoy,5,"A wonderful book of short essays displaying the elegance of math in a grand and easily digestible format. This book started life as a series of columns in the New York Times as an introduction to and has been expanded on a bit. Each chapter is the length of a typical column, and while the book is by no means comprehensive, there are copious notes and reading lists in the back should one want to explore topics further.The book starts with basics like numbers and addition and continues right on to infinity. Filled with history, anecdotes and *gasp* how we actually use each type of math in our daily lives, the book is written in a very comfortable style. Filled with humor and the joy of learning, I found it refreshing and inviting to it's approach."

Took me twenty-eight years to make it 30 minutes into a book that explained it to me.. but.. I KNOW!! WooohoooooReally, I loved reading this book, it was a super fun journey. Now, I'm going to sit down and make a mobius strip with my five-year old daughter!!(Won this off of Goodreads first reads btw. Going to purchase two more copies for Christmas presents. So fun!)"
13,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4070035-kartik-narayanan,3,"The main premise of the Joy of X is to explain mathematical concepts for adults in a way that they can relate to it to now (as opposed to rote learning in schools). The other premise is to basically answer the question which most adults (who have found maths to be a nightmare) have - why should I learn this topic? I think the book succeeds in some areas while falling flat in others. The Joy of X is a collection of articles written for a magazine about various topics in mathematics. While a few were interesting and offered insights, I found the overall quality to be a hit or miss. So overall, it is worth a read but I don't think it lives up to its goals."
14,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4, Has some nice examples good for someone who isn't a big fan of mathematics. Gives a nonmathematical reader a taste of some of the reasons why some people like this subject.
15,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5954293-david-dinaburg,3,"Rare is the occasion to have math thrown at your brain in a direct and pedagogical manner after, say, college calculus. The Joy of X is math made quick and fun, replete with dad jokes, groaners that make an appearance at the close of each chapter. Typically, they reference a social touchstone that is out of date or just sort of lame. After a certain point, though, their earnestness infected my mind and I began to unironically enjoy them, even attempting to anticipate when, where, and in what form they might appear:The great innovation here is that even though this system is based on the number 10, there is no single symbol reserved for 10. Ten is marked by a position—the tens place—instead of a symbol. The same is true for 100, or 1,000, or any other power of 10. Their distinguished status is signified not by a symbol but by a parking spot, a reserved piece of real estate. Location, location, location.You can almost hear the author chuckle as your read these  bons mots; maybe you will hear them in the voice of your dad as he assures you that, “You’d be disappointed if I didn’t say it,” while you roll your eyes from teenaged embarrassment. I sure did.There’s a lot of math to cover, and, like any good course, the subject matter gets more difficult the further into the semester book you go. The chapters, which are either adapted or pulled en masse from the author's prior column, do not have the heft of a full-novel’s chapter pacing. Which, given the subject matter, is a benefit. Illustrations abound and while the actual symbols-in-your-face math is kept to a minimum, the concepts and their implications are given free reign: As the numbers inside the logarithms grew multiplicatively, increasing tenfold each time from 100 to 1,000 to 10,000, their logarithms grew additively, increasing from 2 to 3 to 4. Our brains perform a similar trick when we listen to music. The frequencies of the notes in a scale—do,re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do—sound to us like they’re rising in equal steps. But objectively their vibrational frequencies are rising by equal multiples. We perceive pitch logarithmically.But The Joy of X is not simply information transfer sweetened with sincerity. There is a dark side to math, the spooky forest of numbers and incomprehensibility that frightened so many of us into a B.A. in English Lit. For those willing to return to the road not taken, there are forty pages of endnotes: The analysts of the 1800s identified the underlying mathematical cause of the Gibbs phenomenon. For functions (or, nowadays, images) displaying sharp edges or other mild types of jump discontinuities, the partial sums of the sine waves were proven to converge pointwise but not uniformly to the original function. Pointwise convergence means that at any particular point x, the partial sums get arbitrarily close to the original function as more terms are added. So in that sense, the series does converge, as one would hope. The catch is that some points are much more finicky than others. The Gibbs phenomenon occurs near the worst of those points—the edges in the original function.These notes are here to remind a reader, flush with feelings that math is for the people—doable by everyone in an egalitarian utopia of numbers and equations and formulae—that maybe math is not quite that simple. The Joy of X just makes it seem so clear and enjoyable, like an organized hike up gentle mountain trail. The path has been worn clear of debris by the generations of travelers before you, and your tour guide is so witty and knowledgeable that before you know it you're standing next to a sign marked ""Scenic Overlook,"" posing in front of the same backdrop as countless other tourists before you. You feel like you've done something: ""I've hiked a mountain!"" But no. You've trod a path that's existed for millennia, and while it may be a good first tour, experienced outdoorsy-types would cluck their tongues and shake their heads if you started calling yourself a hiker. As time passes, only the photo remains; a vague memory of the brief moment your comprehension of mathematics sufficed for a picturesque vista. By contrast, the endnotes lead you to a sheer cliff, toss you a rope, a compass, and a pocket knife, and ditch you in the middle of the Appalachians. Just like this extended metaphor, math is a struggle. Unlike this metaphor, math can often be elegant.The only other thing that I could ask of The Joy of X is some historical context, maybe a few well-placed digressions within the streamlined chapter/niblets.In the early part of the ninth century, Muhammad ibn Mus al-Khwarizmi, a mathematician working in Baghdad, wrote a seminal textbook in which he highlighted the usefulness of restoring a quantity being subtracted by adding it to the other side of the equation. He called this process al-jabr (Arabic for “restoring”), which later morphed into “algebra.” Then, long after his death, he hit the etymological jackpot again. His own name, al-khwarizmi, lives on today in the word “algorithm.”Well, good, then. One would think this would be common knowledge. Really, both algebra and algorithm from the same person? That's impressive. ""Restoring"" even makes sense—it's what you do while balancing equations in algebra. Many students, past and present, might benefit from having context to frame the math ex nihilo that is constantly being smashed into their faces.Rather than close out on a dad joke, this sample problem should let you know whether The Joy of X is right for you: “If the cold-water faucet can fill the tub in a half-hour, and the hot-water faucet can fill it in an hour, how long will it take to fill the tub when they’re running together?” Whether or not you can solve it in your head, The Joy of X is a great opportunity to let you soak in some math."

I was excited to be learning about math as an adult - to create a new relationship with it.But very quickly it became too much for this math-phobe. The gentle guiding ended by being thrown into the deep end with i, and it didn’t get better. I hung in for over 50%. But I hung it up when I admitted to myself I was absorbing nothing. If you already like math and just wish to get reacquainted, this might be the book for you. For everyone else, it’s a reminder of struggles best forgotten."

I wanted a greater appreciation of math's beauty, instead I god a folksy re-hash over concepts I was generally aware of, and competent and applying (the exceptions being topology, group theory, the hilbert hotel, and a few other odds and ends).In the end, it wasn't worth my time.Disclaimer: I have a math minor, so I know only enough math to be marginally dangerous."

20,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,5,"I admit it: I bought Joy of X: A Guided Tour of Math, from One to Infinity for the title, although the concept also engaged me (the joy of it). I love watching people doing anything that they are passionate about: skating and gymnastics during the Olympics, performing, philosophy, science, cooking. And, apparently, Mathematics.  The goal is to give you a better feeling for what math is all about and why it’s so enthralling to those who get it.As Steven Strogatz said, this is a guided tour, but an idiosyncratic one. All sorts of things are fair game: Sesame Street, Google searches, the OJ Simpson trial, flipping your mattress ... and children's questions.Today is the 100th day of school. [My son] was very excited and told me everything he knows about the number 100, including that 100 was an even number. He then told me that 101 was an odd number and 1 million was an even number, etc. He then paused and asked: “Is infinity even or odd?” (p. 249)And, then, Strogatz explored why. In exciting detail, as he did in each essay. These details are engaging. A book that includes things like this, for example, is a book worth reading:Years later he would explain that he had contemplated suicide at the time but decided against it once he realized that attending MIT and killing himself didn’t commute. He could always go to MIT and commit suicide later if he had to, but not the other way around. (p. 27).And, in the process, Strogatz demystified Mathematics.The naive view is that we make our definitions, set them in stone, then deduce whatever theorems happen to follow from them. Not so. That would be much too passive. We’re in charge and can alter the definitions as we please—especially if a slight tweak leads to a tidier theorem, as it does here. (p. 204)Okay, now I know. Life is good."
21,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21514123-natalie,4,"Considering how horrible I am at Calculus, it's surprising how much I enjoyed this book :|Brilliantly written and covers so many aspects brilliantly, all the way from ""kindergarten"" math to ""University-level"" mathematics using a wide variety of interesting examples and tidbits of humour.The book ended up being a bit of a combination of a mathematics introductory and a refresher course without dumbing anything down or making one feel silly for not previously understanding the topic.There are also so many external sources referenced that you can quite easily use this book as a stepping stone into a brilliant and well rounded education in mathematics or calculus. Highly recommend. "
22,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2382227-rick-davis,3,"If I could give half stars, this would get 3.5 stars. It was fun to read, but maybe a bit too light and fluffy. I think the purpose of these essays was to skim the surface of a number of ideas though, and the author succeeded at that goal. If you're interested in some different ways to look at math functions, this book is worth the read."
23,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2704704-julia,5,A very interesting read.
24,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17485839-zena-ryder,3,"This book is about math, but it doesn't have much math in it. So mostly it's pretty easy to read. It must have been very difficult to write about some complex math ideas for non-mathematicians! For the most part, Strogatz does a good job. There were, however, a few parts where I confess I couldn't be bothered to think hard enough to get through the little bit of math there was and I just skimmed those parts. ;) Other times, I felt that Strogatz lingered too long over an easy point. It's probably impossible to get this balance perfect for every single reader and their particular level of interest and ability.I enjoyed this book because, although I am not knowledgeable about or skilled in math, I do find it fascinating and appreciate its beauty and amazingness. If you fall into the same category, I recommend it. If, however, you are good at math, don't bother. You will likely already know most of this stuff and you will be frustrated by how elementary it is.It gets only 3 stars because I was reading it for pleasure and it's hard for a book about math — however fascinating I find math — to score any better than that, compared to good fiction. That it scored as highly as 3 stars shows that the author did a good job of making difficult ideas accessible to a non-mathematician."

26,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/76014-raghu,4,"Some amount of Maths is part of everyone’s life, whether literate, illiterate and/or poor. Basic knowledge of arithmetic is fundamental to livelihood everywhere. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are part of our arsenal. Without a functional command over these basics, we can endanger survival itself. However, beyond it, maths raises anxiety in many of us. Fractions, geometry, calculus and complex numbers appear as if they have nothing much to do with our lives. This is where Dr. Strogatz’s book comes in. It attempts to help us get comfortable with formulas, quadratic equations, calculus and even the advanced math that engaged Albert Einstein in his life. The book contains engaging anecdotes on great mathematicians and examples from ordinary lives using which it explains mathematical concepts. Whether we do arts or science in high school, we all do a basic amount of math. That much math suffices to understand and enjoy the contents of the book. The early chapters deal with the fundamentals of arithmetic and numbers. The book starts with the basic summation of all numbers from 1 to 10. But the author grabs your interest by showing that you can find the sum without doing the add operation itself. Instead, we go back to a primitive way of using a collection of rocks and shapes to find the answer. Then, he explains negative numbers through the concept of ‘my enemy’s enemy is my friend’. The author uses graphs and relationships among the shifting alliances between the European powers during World War I. With these tools, he sheds light on the multiplication of negative numbers and the negative of a negative. He discusses the commutative law of addition (a+b = b+a) with simple financial examples. However, nature often disobeys the law of commutativity. A light-hearted anecdote from the life of the quantum physicist Murray Gell-Mann brings this out. After seeing these ideas explained in this way, we will always associate the law of commutation with Prof. Gell-Mann’s decision not to commit suicide!Two simple problems bring out broader lessons for the reader in chapter 9. They teach us how to solve problems approximately when you can’t solve them exactly. They also show us how to solve them intuitively, to feel the ‘Aha’ moment. The first example is:“If the cold–water faucet can fill the bathtub in half an hour and the hot–water faucet can fill it in an hour, how long will it take to fill the tub when they’re running together?”. Most people guess the answer to be 45 minutes and it is wrong. The author shows two ways of analyzing the problem, one with simple arithmetic and the second by logic and hypothesis.The second example is:“suppose the length of a hallway is y when measured in yards and f when measured in feet. Write an equation that relates y to f.”Here again, surprisingly, most people get the equation wrong. Further on in the book, we get to the messy side of life, such as chance, luck, risk, and randomness. They come under the ‘Probability Theory’. Two beautiful examples illustrate the idea. One is from the famous O. J. Simpson case and the other is from a book by Gerd Gigerenzer, a cognitive psychologist at the Max Planck Institute in Berlin. In the OJ Simpson case, Dr. Strogatz says that both the prosecution and defense asked the court to consider the wrong conditional probability. They asked the court to consider the probability that a man murdered his ex-wife, given that he previously battered her. That is the wrong probability to consider. Instead, the probability that a man murdered his ex-wife, given that he previously battered her and someone murdered her, was the right question to ask. In the former case, the conditional probability is 1 in 2500. In the second case, it is 40 out of 43 or 93%. However, the author adds that we should not confuse this value with the probability that O. J. Simpson did it because that would depend on a lot of other evidence, pro, and con.In the second example, Gerd Gigerenzer asked doctors in Germany and the US to estimate the probability that a woman who has a positive mammogram has breast cancer even though she is in a low-risk group: forty to fifty years old with no symptoms or family history of breast cancer. Gigerenzer also provides them with additional data to solve the problem. The result was that Gigerenzer asked twenty-four German doctors, who gauged the chances as ranging from 1% to 90%. Ninety-five out of 100 American doctors opined that the chances are 75%. The correct answer, however, is 9 percent. Imagine how upsetting it would be for a patient to hear such divergent opinions. Gigerenzer shows that the doctors erred because of analyzing the problem in terms of odds, percentages and conditional probabilities. The analysis becomes transparent if we translate the original information from percentages and probabilities to natural frequencies. Dr. Strogatz describes how to do it this way. Even those who have no grounding in statistics or probability would enjoy reading about it.The chapter titled ‘Analyze This…’ takes us through the mysteries of infinity and the infinite series. It uses a deceptively simple problem that consumed mathematicians from the early 18th century as an example. Consider the infinite series,1-1 + 1-1 + 1-1 + 1-1 ....The answer looks obvious as 0 because each set of 1-1 comes to 0 and the series adds a series of 0s. The author shows how the series can also give a result of 1, and in other cases, ½. Astonishingly, the debate over this series raged for over 150 years until a new breed of mathematicians put all of Calculus and its infinite processes (limits, derivatives, integrals and infinite series) on a solid foundation once and for all. Those who love tennis and watched the stars of yesteryears like Pete Sampras and Ivan Lendl would fondly recall the great forehand down-the-line passing shots they played. The author uses them to explain Vectors. When Sampras plays the shot while running at full speed towards the sideline, he does not aim it close to the sidelines. If he does so, it will sail wide off the sidelines. Instead, he aims slightly cross-court to compensate for his sideways motion. It is because the ball’s velocity relative to the court is the sum of two vectors: the ball’s velocity relative to Sampras (a vector pointing down the line as intended) and Sampras’ velocity relative to the court (a vector pointing away from the court).There are many more charming examples in the book, ranging from finding your dream date to equations on Love to Google search algorithms while discussing calculus, the number ‘e’ and linear algebra. It covers the ideas in calculus briefly in a few chapters. If the reader wants to learn more, they can read the author’s book ‘Infinite Powers’ which is only on Calculus in the same popular science mode. Except for a few sections, the book is easily understandable for most readers, even if they feel mathematically challenged. It is an entertaining book for the curious mind, whether in high school or in the University or retired. "
27,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1974052-milan,5,"If Steven Strogatz can't make you fall in love with mathematics, then probably nobody can. I have never studied math after my school but recently my curiosity got better of me and I've been reading about different math and science topics. That is when I stumbled upon this book. In this book, the author strives to communicate what mathematics is about to a set of people who might be otherwise intimidated by the very name of 'math'. The book is divided into six sections - Numbers, Relationships, Shapes, Change, Data and “Frontiers. Strogatz’s writing style and use of visuals and anecdotes makes the book very interesting. Each chapter is very short and about a particular topic of mathematics. He covers so much of the basic ethos of the topics like algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, probability etc. often by stressing upon intuition and visualization. It’s a great book for the curious mind."
28,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5686119-book,5,"The Joy of X: A Guided Tour of Math, from One to Infinity by Steven Strogatz""The Joy of X"" is an entertaining introductory guide through the elements of math, from the very basic to the infinity. Professor of Applied Mathematics at Cornell University, Steven Strogatz takes the reader on an amusing ride through some of the more interesting stories behind math concepts. This enjoyable and informative 336-page book is comprised of thirty chapters broken out by the six following main parts: 1. Numbers, 2. Relationships, 3. Shapes, 4. Change, 5. Data, and 6. Frontiers. Positives:1.	An engaging, well-written, entertaining and practical book. 2.	Turns what must have been a challenging topic for any publisher to embrace into a successful popular book on mathematics. Kudos!3.	Excellent approach to writing this book. Short chapters of math concepts with engaging narrative that complements what would have otherwise been frightening equations for the public. Strogatz succeeds where other authors have failed. He has made math fun and interesting for the public. 4.	Great use of a number of supplementary materials to engage the audience: graphs, charts, pictures, illustrations, and even those dreaded math equations and it works! 5.	The love for math, in awe of numbers and its power to model the world. “the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences.”6.	An interesting look at prime numbers.7.	A brief history of representing numbers. “The Babylonians were not nearly as attached to their fingers. Their numeral system was based on 60—a clear sign of their impeccable taste, for 60 is an exceptionally pleasant number. Its beauty is intrinsic and has nothing to do with human appendages. Sixty is the smallest number that can be divided evenly by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. And that’s just for starters (there’s also 10, 12, 15, 20, and 30). Because of its promiscuous divisibility, 60 is much more congenial than 10 for any sort of calculation or measurement that involves cutting things into equal parts. When we divide an hour into 60 minutes, or a minute into 60 seconds, or a full circle into 360 degrees, we’re channeling the sages of ancient Babylon.”8.	Professor Strogatz makes great use of visual aid to help the readers understand mathematical concepts. 9.	Helps the readers understand what’s behind the symbols along with what the formula means and where it rises. The power of exponential functions.10.	A look at geometry. 11.	Throughout the book, the Strogatz provides the applications behind the math. “Yet trigonometry, belying its much too modest name, now goes far beyond the measurement of triangles. By quantifying circles as well, it has paved the way for the analysis of anything that repeats, from ocean waves to brain waves. It’s the key to the mathematics of cycles.”12.	The great ideas at the heart of calculus. Great stuff! “Calculus is the mathematics of change. It describes everything from the spread of epidemics to the zigs and zags of a well-thrown curveball.”13.	Explaining the nature of light through math.14.	Understanding conditional probability. “The real question is: What’s the probability that a man murdered his ex-wife, given that he previously battered her and she was murdered by someone? That conditional probability turns out to be very far from 1 in 2,500.” Applying math to a famous court case.15.	The triumphs of linear algebra. “But the greatest triumph of linear algebra, from the standpoint of real-world impact, is surely its solution to the Zen riddle of ranking webpages. “A page is good insofar as good pages link to it.” Translated into symbols, that criterion becomes the PageRank equations.”16.	A look at topology. “In topology, two shapes are regarded as the same if you can bend, twist, stretch, or otherwise deform one into the other continuously—that is, without any ripping or puncturing. Unlike the rigid objects of geometry, the objects of topology behave as if they were infinitely elastic, as if they were made of an ideal kind of rubber or Silly Putty.”17.	Understanding the concept of the shortest path around a sphere. “With all these flights of fancy, you may be wondering if geodesics have anything to do with reality. Of course they do. Einstein showed that light beams follow geodesics as they sail through the universe. The famous bending of starlight around the sun, detected in the eclipse observations of 1919, confirmed that light travels on geodesics through curved space-time, with the warping being caused by the sun’s gravity.”18.	Far fetched concepts of math that lead to real-life applications. 19.	A look at infinity.20.	Comprehensive notes.Negatives:1.	Math is a topic that will automatically drive some people away regardless of how well written is it.2.	Despite all the supplementary material provided, I like to see a summary table breaking out all the applications for the math concepts brought up in the book. A quick reference table. 3.	Many books are mentioned but no formal bibliography.In summary, what a surprisingly fun book this was and along the way you are guaranteed to learn some amusing facts about mathematics. What sets this book apart is Professor Strogatz’s ability to take what is considered a dry subject into an engaging, entertaining and educational ride. I highly recommend it! Further recommendations: ""Mathematics for the Nonmathematician” by Morris Kline, “Love and Math” by Edward Frenkel, “Everyday Calculus” by Oscar E. Fernandez, “The Signal and the Noise” by Nate Silver, “Secrets of Mental Math” by Arthur Benjamin, “What is Mathematics?” by Herbert Robbins, and “Our Mathematical Universe” by Max Tegmark."

30,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3129567-christian,3,A great read for anyone who maybe didn’t have the greatest set of math teachers... Or who didn’t listen all that much.
31,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20465079-tam,3,"A quick read that can be done in a couple of hours. If you don't work with math much this would be very lovely and enchanting. If you do, it's still cute."
32,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30569007-jos-lu-s-fernandes,5," In this book Steven Strogatz makes a brief tour of many areas of mathematics. He starts that tour with the concept of natural numbers and approaches many subjects like arithmetics, geometry, trigonometry, algebra, calculus, statistics and so many other subjects in a simple but highly effective way. He didn't want a fat and huge book about maths or calculus for example and instead he preferred to make a simpler book destined to everyone where he makes an introduction to mathematics and explains some of its greatest ideas.  Although graduates in Physics or Maths may know all or almost anything of what's in the book (I think that there were some people who hoped something more sophisticated and ended up disappointed) and it was based on a New York Times column, that doesn't take any credits for this book because it's rare to see maths presented in such a concise and simple way and the texts are very fun to read with lots of endnotes in order to explain some details and give indications about specialized books to the most curious. That's why I gave 5 stars to this book and my only correction I point out (as this book is for everyone it doesn't make sense to have it full with equations, even if the book has some calculations and simple equations) is that in chapter two he says that only two groups of stones which have between 1 and 10 elements form a square but that's false because in fact there are three (he forgot the group with one stone which forms a square as well), but that's a relatively minor mistake probably due to a oversight."
33,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21587896-katie,3,"This was an enjoyable read and probably burgeoning on just as cool and entertaining as a book about math can be (I love you math, but...). I definitely found some chapters to be better than others, specifically the ones that brought more of a grander perspective to math's purpose. It makes you take a step back and experience broad mini-epiphanies about something you've been studying for years, and had too much tunnel vision to see on your own. Things like the fact that we don't just integrate because we can, but so we can calculate infinities. That being said, some chapters were a bit over my head despite the fact that this is a book for ""beginners"" -- say, people who never really quite grasped the greater purpose of long division. Although the ""simple and easy"" explanations of some concepts likely appear to be just that to the writer, at the end of the day, he is a Princeton/Harvard/Cambridge educated mathematician and we as an audience are not. Nonetheless, this is a cool book that ultimately does what it sets out to do -- give you new perspective and appreciation for math and it's role in your everyday life."
34,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36692218-suneel-madhekar,4,"This is a delightful little book on mathematics. One of those rare, wonderful, popular math books. It was actually a gift for my nephew who started his engineering studies. After he was through reading it, I thought I'll give it a try myself! And the book was absolutely worth reading. Strogatz, whom I knew as a pioneer in nonlinear dynamics, chaos and synchronisation, has done a wonderful job of getting people interested in mathematics. The book touches upon some of the most important concepts of mathematics, counting, arithmetic, algebra, geometry, number theory and probability. It also touches some ""frontiers"" such as prime numbers, group theory, topology and analysis! Strogatz playfully talks about the contributions of giants like Hilbert, Poincare, Newton and Gauss, together with stories and wisecracks. "
35,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9819315-steve-losh,3,"A nice little romp through a whole lot of areas of math.Each topic has its own self-contained, bite-sized chapter. There's not much depth here, but there are a few clever descriptions of tricky things. Still, it seems like you'll need a bit of a background in math to grab some of the later chapters.If you're looking for an introduction to a bunch of things so you can figure out what to look into more deeply, this is a good book. Otherwise it falls a bit short on detail."

I've always loved math, and was always pretty good at it (although I struggled a bit with Calculus at first year of engineering), but it's always good to refresh basic concepts, and this book was very light, enjoyable and easy to read. The author does a great job on presenting examples of how math applies to our every day life, with very simple and understandable explanations. I would totally recommend this book to anyone struggling with maths, but I also definitely recommend it to math lovers. It's hard to write a book about maths that is funny and light, and we're all too used to boring technical books which make us dread the subject, so even if you actually already like it, it's interesting to read a different approach.I just don't give 5 starts because I think some of the final subjects are harder to follow and the examples are not that clear, but other than that, I really loved the book."
39,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83922532-ralph-quirequire,5,"I've always loved math (maybe more than I care to admit). This book helped me think about concepts in different mathematical fields in a genuinely intuitive way and gave me a rich overview of how various ideas in math fit together.I think that if more math educators where I'm from will try to take a page from *The Joy of X* (as well as other books like *How Not to be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking* by Jordan Ellenberg) and not just teach math as a collection of abstract facts and operations to master, more students will be drawn to the beauty of mathematics.Anyway, the author couldn't have chosen a more spot-on title, since chapter after chapter, I couldn't resist smiling at the nuggets of insights I picked up. I highly recommend this book, even to people afflicted with arithmophobia. You'll thoroughly enjoy it."
40,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10623242-sadish-ravi,5,"I stumbled on this book recently while looking for some math books to refresh my memory. I did not expect anything more than a usual math book which focus on how rather than the why. I was pleasently surprised after reading the reviews of this book and I could easily see that while reading first few pages of this book. I just could not drop this book down with out finishing it. I wish I had read this book while at school. Math is really joy. The book starts with numbers and progressively goes in to algebra, calculus, geometry and other advanced math topics. But all the while keeping it simple and grounded. With every topic the author ensured to not overwhelm the reader with details, but at the same time get the concepts across in elegant way. Highly recommend to anyone who is curious about math."

However, Steven Strogatz presented what I thought to be even the simplest ideas in new ways that really invoked thought about what these simple numbers, procedures, and formulas mean. Then, when I did get to the “hard stuff” he explained it in such a way that it was manageable and even exciting to think about. This book made me more interested in countless topics surrounding math and it’s unexplored corners. "
42,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4293493-beth,5,This book blew me away. I've read books on math by physicists & mathematicians and consider myself to have an above average understanding of math. This book certainly humbled me. It made connections with simple concepts I never would have considered and built upon itself beginning with elementary topics until it was diving into the headache that is infinity. Yet somehow this book managed to make sense out of even the most confusing. It was funny and had clever quips throughout which kept me entertained and I genuinely enjoyed the read. Even if you don't like math I highly recommend this book - you might realize you do like it after all.
43,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4777656-mjaballah,5,"I wish I read this book during my school days. Books like this are important, if not crucial for those exploring the different sciences beyond the limited and lonely abstract world portrayed by their randomly assigned school teachers. This is a book that I would recommend to teens and perhaps freshmen, to help in understanding, and hopefully, in falling in love with the world of Mathematics. A world that can be so abstract and complex that it can be off putting for new entrants to withhold the confusion and agony that we all go when we begin our journey within during our school years.Steven, the Author, does wonders in simplifying the labyrinth of mathematics into simple baby steps. His approach, a mix of story telling and puzzle finding narrative gives the reader a light hearted view of mathematics. He begins with the concept of numbers, an important start for newcomers that is a huge step into the world of abstraction. His illustration, through a sesame street episode, on how the world would look like if we did not have numbers. It was not only memorable, but also a great way to convince youngsters of it necessity, which is pretty much the overall approach of the book; we are learning maths, not because its abstractions will be useful at a latter stage in life, but because our life makes more sense through those abstractions.I went through a couple of the pages in the book with my father, a professor in Mathematics, to find out that he was equality delighted in many of the examples provided, the writing style, and the specific path chosen to narrate the complex concepts. Some of my favourite passage from the book are:- “In mathematics we are free to pursue the questions we ask, and how we pursue them, but not the answers.”- “Calculus has to do with Solving for x, and Algebra detecting formulas which contain many variables.” To this effect, Calculus is the mathematic of change, while Algebra is that of relationships.- “Wrong answers are educational, as long as you realise that they are wrong”."

52,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15841028-th-rsis-souza,4,"Brought back so many memories from when I first discovered concepts and creative proofs in algebra, arithmetic, geometry and calculus. So delightfully written I finished it in one seat."
53,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3851037-tina,4,"I was a math major in college. I chose it for a major because the concepts of numbers and the relationships in the study of number theory fascinated me. Strictly speaking, I never had a job where I had to do any higher math, solve a quadratic equation, discuss or teach functions, trig, geometry, etc. But it did strengthen my ability to reason, look at ideas in the abstract and conceptualize a problem in real terms. It certainly helped me a lot in working with software development in one of my previous careers.I was absolutely thrilled when I got a copy of Strogatz' book. He explains math to the non-math mind in easy to understand tidbits. I often wished I could explain things as easily. This is a book that progresses from simple number theory, e.g., what do we mean when we say we have six of something? to basic arithmetical operations (adding, subtracting, multiplication, division) to discussions of fractions, and percentages. There are chapters explaining basic algebra, and how often we use the theory of solving for X without even realizing it. Next up is Geometry, the theory of infinity, negative numbers--Strogatz covers them all and then marches through integral calculus (here it started to get a bit more difficult ----just like college!!), differential equations, and vector analysis.The later chapters are definitely more advanced, but if you manage to stick it out that far, you'll be rewarded with an esoteric but lilting discussion of number theory.While the author would like to think this is not rocket science, it is still deep and requires attention and interest. It should help many motivated adults in understanding what children are now being taught in school, but I'm not sure it will make math aficionados of those who don't want to get it. It's worth a look for anyone who wants to get a better grasp of what the glorious world of numbers is really all about.A NOTE: This is NOT a book to be read in the e= format. Unless the actual book is formatted better in the Epub format it is almost unreadable in sections. Anytime there is a line drawing, a table, an equation that includes fractions, it can only be see as it is designed when the text is reduced to the smallest available, thus making it absolutely impossible to read. The constant need to reduce the page so I could see the illustrations really turned me off. The book itself is fabulous, and I have no doubt that in paper, or a proper e-formatting it will be a hit."
54,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2899477-bryan-higgs,5,"This is a charming book that attempts to provide an understanding of Mathematics for pretty much anyone.As one who has a strong background in Mathematics, I found it an easy read. I found it to be quite interesting, despite my already knowing quite a bit about the topics being covered. The writing style is light, engaging, even charming, and includes a lot of items that relate the Mathematics to the real world (something I find too many Mathematics courses seldom do)Of course, as someone with a good Mathematical background, I felt the need for more at the end of each chapter, but that would have changed the goal of the book, and probably reduced its effectiveness. It is unfortunate that so many people come out of secondary schools and colleges having taken Mathematics courses, but not really knowing what Mathematics is all about. Usually, they are overwhelmed by the symbols, and underwhelmed by the apparent lack of relationship with the world as they see and experience it. Ask a typical college-educated person to describe what Mathematics is all about, and I think you will see what I mean. Most answers will probably talk about arithmetic, algebra or geometry, and will probably not be able to connect those subjects with each other, since Mathematics tends to get taught in separate courses that don't sufficiently connect what has been learned before.When asked to define Mathematics, people will most likely focus on arithmetic or algebra, but not be able to move far beyond those topics, as those are what most people are familiar with. I asked Google to define Mathematics, and here is what it told me:""the abstract science of number, quantity, and space.""I don't find that satisfactory. I believe a Mathematician would be more likely to define Mathematics as, perhaps, ""The study of patterns"". Unfortunately, that's probably too abstract to mean much to typical non-Mathematicians.By reading this book, I think the typical reader will gain a better perception of what Mathematics is all about. It's a great contribution to the set of books that can provide a better understanding of what Mathematics is, and why it is important, and shows that it truly is relevant -- indispensable, even to everyday life."

The descriptions of infinity and topology are perfect in their deconstruction of mathematical concepts to what they really are. Is math complicated? Yes. Are its core concepts difficult to understand? NO.One of the more frustrating things I feel from the math side is when people say that proofs are too complicated. Usually they are only as complicated as the proof writer's style. If the writer is good at articulating and building an argument, then the proof is usually easy to understand. Strogatz is a good writer and a good presenter, so he's able to present ""complex"" topics with ease.If you are not a fully math-y person, read this book. That way you can talk about infinity and geometry and all these other topics with ease. Not only do you get that knowledge, you can also start to deconstruct some of the more complicated math topics being written about today. Most of them just build on the basic concepts in this book. Armed with that knowledge, you can then be far more skeptical and understanding about some of the science literature & articles written today.For example, knowing the different sizes of infinity helps with a lot of work in computer science (countable is a possibly-tractable problem, uncountable is way way more difficult). Knowing shortest paths helps you handle different geometries such as spheres. Knowing the basics of group theory helps you when people talk about actions and don't understand the simplest answers are often to combine simple steps rather than making a complex machine.That's where this book is so beneficial. Once you have an intuitive understanding of these core concepts, you can move forward to understanding its use. The biggest influence will probably be in science journalism, because you'll be more able to weed out crap intellectualism and appreciate/use good, novel findings in science."

It’s essentially a collection of essays, each one addressing a mathematical subject from a new and illuminating angle, all organized from the simplest to the most complex. It’s a well-written, enjoyable read.A chronic difficulty with writing or choosing many nonfiction works is finding the right balance between informational density and readability. To put it another way, how much work should it demand of its readers? And I’m talking about useful work, to grasp and contemplate the book’s meaning, not the gratuitous toil demanded by faulty organization, poor or deliberately abstruse writing, or inept or absent editing. Finding a balance that satisfies most readers or even a majority of them is probably an impossible task.I found this book a bit too easy. Each chapter contained a small epiphany or two but little of real use. The tone was gentle and avuncular rather than challenging, as if the book were intended for mathophobes. It’s a mathematical diversion or amusement, and I suspect it was intended to be just that. Actually, I was looking for some lighter reading to sandwich between two books I knew would be hard if rewarding work, but still, for me it was too easygoing. But I can hardly fault the author for doing a good job with a book that wasn’t quite my cup of tea."

If I have read this book at school, my life would be a lot easier and I would not have to spend hours memorizing various mathematical theorems. Steven Strogatz explains difficult concepts (as Gaussian function, differential calculus, limits, etc.) in simple and understandable language. With this book you can see the physical meaning of math concepts, their application in real life, because math is everywhere around us. Mathematics permeates everything in this world, including ourselves, but unfortunately, very few people understand this universal language well enough to appreciate his wisdom and beauty. You will make many discoveries and learn many surprising stories about the mathematical science. Steven Strogatz - the one teacher of mathematics, of which you dreamed of at school. A teacher who is able to spark interest and instill a love of his subject to life. In this incredibly easy and fascinating book, it gives us all a second chance to be acquainted with mathematics. This book is a must read for everyone. Those who are not familiar with mathematics - to meet her near, and those who love math - happy to read about the ""queen of the sciences."""
58,0547517653,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5889085-h-wesselius,3,"The Joy of x began as a series of columns which quickly becomes apparent. This is both good and bad. It keeps the chapters short and simple yet the book lacks any coherence. In high school, I was good enough at math to have a teacher recommend I choose it as major. I declined and instead pursued history and then philosophy. When reading this book, I'm glad I did. Strogatz does little to increase my appreciation for math other than a tool to solve problems in manner to satisfy a man with slight autistic tendencies. Ironically I now teach math and science and not history in middle school.Some of his columns/chapters do have an appreciative teaching quality but too many seem abbreviated and leave the reader wondering. And some just don't explain well. For example his last chapter on the Hilbert Hotel. I've read far better explanations of infinity and its paradoxes."

The book is a highly readable, very interesting story of math from simple to complex, with real life applications and bits of history and pop culture references.I find math fascinating. Although I am not detail-oriented enough to be really good at it and flamed out after BC Calculus, I always sort of wished I had been able to continue to higher math because I like the theory and logic of the whole thing. Reading this book gave me lots of insights into the way even higher math works and why it’s relevant.{Read my full review here}"
