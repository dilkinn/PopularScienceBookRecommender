0,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/267189-todd-n,2,"Timothy Ferriss spoke at a management meeting last week where I work. A few of the managers came back pretty impressed, so I cadged a copy off of a manager and skimmed/read it one sitting Friday night.The effect of this book is like being trapped in a room with a manic-depressive during the manic part of his cycle. Imagine a cross between Brad Pitt in 12 Monkeys and a late-night infomercial. Then add a dash of narcissistic personality disorder to get an idea of the tone of this book.This book is one in a series of books lately -- including Rich Dad, Poor Dad -- that damns the middle class for a lack of imagination as demonstrated by showing up for work every day and upholding the social contract, among other things. The middle class, far from being admired for being the people that the economy and that this country is built on, should be pitied as they pathetically roll down 101 in their Civics and Jettas to their white collar jobs. Why build a career when you could be selling can openers at a profit through the miracle of AdWords?Offered as an example of the breakthrough thinking in this book is the time the author won a kickboxing championship by reading the rules, finding loopholes, and then winning on a technicality. It's hard to imagine an attitude further from the Renaissance concept of virtu than this.The part of the book that I greatly enjoyed concerned ""time management"" and gave valuable tips on how not to be such a fucking patsy at work. I put ""time management"" in quotes because he believes that time management is part of the problem. He offers great advice on handling email (check only twice a day) and handling it (send clear if-then emails). He also gives great advice on how to make yourself valuable and productive enough to negotiate a better work-life balance, assuming you have the talent and energy to pull it off. But in this day of telecommuting, this is really less radical than he makes it sound. He makes a good case for quitting any job that doesn't allow working from home on a regular basis.Another highlight of this book is a reprint of a hilarious article from Esquire about outsourcing personal chores to India. It's too bad that the rest of the book couldn't take on the same humorous and likable tone while making its sometimes valid points.I guess you could sum up this book like this: ""There's no TEAM in I."""
1,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2055931-jonathan-el-bizri,1,"EDIT: I've left my original opinion below. However, as time has passed, I don't really think I can recommend this book as anything but entertainment. Anything useful has been written elsewhere, better, and by people who aren't lying to you.-----I hesitantly recomend this book. The reasons why are towards the end of the review.The douchebaggery and straight up disengenuity espoused almost drips off the pages: quite remarkable even in the self-help, think-outside-the-box, start-your-own-business genre. Much of what Ferris recommends just plain doesn't work (I'm talking from experience). Other things are slightly ridiculous: an entire chapter is spent discussing how one can get people to stop bugging you at your cubicle by lying to their faces about how busy you are, or using other, more passive-aggressive methods to avoid them. Yet more suggestions are even more unethical and unsound: how to get your boss to sign you up to work at home, so you can go off and get your job 'done' in an hour a day and then get on with pursuing your just rewards. Apparently, as long as no one realizes what useless timewaster you >used< to be, Ferris thinks it is perfectly acceptable to use this new found time to your own ends, as long as no one catches on.According to Ferris, we should all use methods to arbitrage the actual productivity of others - such as email friends and colleagues for information rather than finding it ourselves, despite the fact he also espouses avoiding all such requests from others, getting them to 'channel' their communications into forms that you can either ignore or answer as quickly as possible, preferably through an executive assistant. As far as that secret 'get rich quick, live on the beach' lifestyle he promises? It involves the same arbitrage, only commercially. In other words, we should all start websites that dropship stuff and by google adwords and we'll all be rich. Life doesn't work like that: someone has to make shit, and the web is already saturated with stores.Why do I recomend this book anyway? Well, despite the shitloads of pie in the sky bad advice, and the loads of leeching & douchebaggery that Ferris seems to think he is the original source for, there is a lot to be learned in regards to automating and simplifying one's life, and practicing and developing an enterpreneurial outlook to improving one's situation.So, read between the lines, recognize the Ferris is an untrustworthy weasel frat boy out to promote himself and sell books. But, take note that while the lifestyle he espouses in his book just doesn't add up, his overall philosophy has served him well, and there is definitely utility in the tactics that serve this get-someone-else-to-do-it-for-you life strategy. "
2,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/623773-emma,2,"At first I thought this was the bee's knees, toes, and ankles. But as I read further I began to realize that this guy ""wins"" by cheating, ""delegates"" by leaving everything in the hands of his $5/hour personal assistant in India, and sells books by promising to tell you how to get rich, and delivers a book on how to get everyone around you to be really annoyed with you for shirking any responsibility. He encourages you to lease expensive cars so you can feel like you are living the ""life of your dreams"". And then he puts Walden in his list of resources. I'm confused. I guess he's saying that if you really want to drive a fancy car, then make that your priority, and then when you can afford to lease it, you'll be happy. I'm hoping that would then teach you that maybe a car is not the most important thing in your life and you might want to spend your $2500 a month on rent, food, health insurance and the like. So you don't have to live in Borneo in order to drive your new car.Reading this book made me realize that I already have a life that involves meaningful work, setting my own schedule, and choosing whatever projects I want to do. And oh yeah, passive income. No, I don't drive a Ferrari and vacation in Argentina because the exchange rate is awesome. But you know? I don't really want to.I agree with some of his instructions on automation, especially the importance of not having decision-making bottlenecks. However, if you care about the reputation of your company you might want to have *some* input on its day to day operations. I guess now we know why he is described as a ""serial"" entrepreneur on the book jacket.I give him points for being honest. If someone wanted his kind of lifestyle, this would be a fairly good roadmap. Except for one thing: his sales ability. Which he doesn't really teach in this book. He definitely has a different take on business and the point of life, and perhaps it is useful just in that sense. He is definitely marching to the beat of his own drummer. I just am not sure I want to march with him."

4,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/880021-david-sasaki,2,"I don't know how else to put it. Timothy Ferris is a douche. There is, in fact, an entire genre of blog literature that explains why Timothy Ferriss is a douche. Even New York Times columnist Frank Bruni got in on the action. Since I already heard Ferriss' insecure egocentricity on full display during his Long Now talk, I came to this book expecting a self-obsessed hustler to peddle his ""you-too-can-be-like-me"" vision. But I still wanted to read the book. I wanted to understand why it became a bestseller and why Ferris, the arch-egocentic, has become so influential among ambitious American men of my generation. (If you haven't heard of Ferriss before, you probably don't spend much time reading tech and entrepreneurship blogs.)What I didn't expect was to come to feel a deep sympathy for Ferriss. Despite the fact that he's a jerk, he isn't a terrible writer and the biographic sections of the book are rich fodder for psychoanalysis. Like Ferris, I also grew up with an instinctive, acute resentment of authority and hierarchical structures. It is still the most defining characteristic of my personality, but I have learned to control the resentment and anger as I have matured. Like Ferriss, I too was also extremely motivated and reasonably precocious. This combination of wanting to accomplish so much while spending most of my energy rebelling against the institutions around me led to constant anxiety and insecurity. ""Does not fulfill potential"" was scribbled across all of my report cards, which led me to rebel against my teachers and parents even more, all the while internalizing the basic notion that I was letting people down.Like Ferriss, I knew that I didn't want to define my life by others' expectations. I wanted to find my own path and define my own expectations. Part of that — like Ferriss — was to travel the world. That is where our paths began to diverge. Ferriss embraced a deep individualism that prioritizes self-improvement as the definition of success. Among his conclusions: Don't search for meaningful work; find a way to make as much money in as little time as possible, and spend the rest of your time having fun. There is no meaning in life; what we really want is excitement, not 'meaning.' Don't let others interrupt your path toward personal perfection; if they start blabbering, cut them off and return to focusing on yourself.Ferriss is obsessed with his own image. He constantly reminds the reader that he is a world champion of kickboxing, the winner of a tango championship in Argentina, a polyglot, a motorcycle racer, a chef, and a weight-lifter. But he is driven only by extrinsic motivation. He does not appreciate the ""craftsmanship"" of his pastimes; that is, in the words of Richard Sennett, ""the desire to do a job well for its own sake."" For Ferriss, it's all about winning a trophy, bragging to his friends, or checking something off his to-do list. The collective, the individual, and the twilight of the elites Why has Ferriss' vision of ""the good life"" proved so appealing among my generation? Why has the perfection of the self become such a popular pursuit? I am easily persuaded by Christopher Hayes' argument that the rise of American meritocracy over the past fifty years has led to extreme, individualistic competition among ambitious elites at the expense of our concern for collective well being. In order to be successful in America today you have to focus on yourself. The idea of placing one's community (or one's work team) ahead of one's self is passé. David Brooks has written a lot about the individual versus collective world views. From China, he penned a column noting that Asian economies are challenging the assumption that a culture of individualism creates incentives for greater economic growth. Then, following President Obama's second inaugural address (which he calls ""among the best of the past half-century""), Brooks examines the pros and cons of the individualist versus collectivist society. It is the cultural debate that underlies almost all other contemporary political debates. Like Ferriss, I too am deeply individualistic. The day after I graduated from high school I packed up all my belongings and drove to Alaska to spend six months by myself. I wanted to disconnect from all institutions, responsibilities, and expectations. But unlike Ferriss, during my 20s I came to a deep appreciation of the satisfaction that can come from participating in a community that isn't defined by hierarchical structures or individual achievements. I am speaking of my time working at Global Voices, which finally gave me a productive channel to focus my energy toward the goals of a greater community. There is satisfaction that comes from individual accomplishments. But, in my experience, nothing is as satisfying as building something together as a team. I fear we are losing the ""craft of cooperation."" If there has one thing my generation has learned, it is self-promotion — and no one can out-self-promote Timothy Ferriss. I hope that one day he can take a break from perfecting his self in order to experience the pleasure of cultivating community."
5,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1613125-craig,1,"Instead of focusing on this book's lame contents (it was really bad) I decided to share my review of how it was otherwise used in the hopes that it might inspire others.First of all, I found the book's paper a little rough in texture. This eliminated it from being used in the outhouse or camping, if you know what I mean. The raspy paper DID, however, have just the right stuff to be 'ripped and rolled' into some really effective starter wicks in the old fireplace. Went up like a charm and led to a toasty warm fire in no time. Very little smoke produced and it left a good, clean ash.The pages and binding that remained sat limply and dejected by the hearth for much of the evening before inspiration struck once again. I tore the front cover off (I am reluctant to burn colored ink in my fireplace -- call me old-fashioned) and ripped it into some smaller pieces to fold and wedge into a drafty window to help keep it closed. I made sure to have the outer cover facing outward to better repel any moisture that might attack the paper from the window seam. Again -- like it was MADE for the task!Finally, and I'm not proud of it -- I like to minimize my footprint on Mother Earth -- I had to let the binding go. No good for burning and I doubt even a hungry squirrel would find it appealing. It was dropped in the trash by the light of the crackling fire on that dark snowy night.I sat by the roaring fire as light sleet pellets tickle the window, pondering the fate of the environment. With so many copies of this book very likely suffering some form of destruction around the globe what's a species to do?"
6,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/314539-maria-andreu,5,"A few weeks ago in NYC, I sat with two of the smartest people I know at a cool brunch.""But explain it to me,"" I said. ""Just what is it about the 4-Hour Work Week that we haven't already seen?"" Having a background in a ""work-smarter-not-harder"" industry (the coaching industry), what I'd heard about 4HWW had not impressed me as anything particularly fresh and new.""Well,"" said one friend, ""It's just never all been put in a book like this before.""""Okay."" That didn't sound so compelling to me.""Well,"" attempted the other. ""It's Tim, too. His personality. The way he gets things across."" Still unimpressed.But here's the thing - two people I really believe in and trust were telling me I HAD to read this book. So I sucked it up and ordered it from Amazon (who, I believe, I single-handedly keep in business, though my scant GoodReads list may not yet reflect it).So I decided to give it a shot and ate it up in a weekend. A fun and easy read. The premise is basically this: so many of us ""follow the rules"" and strive to tolerate the best job we can get for 40 years, holding off for retirement. Tim Ferriss, the 30-year-old author of this book, posits an entirely different worldview and a straightforward plan for achieving living it - set up automatic profit centers, and take ""mini retirements"" throughout your life (which he does, and explains in fun and interesting detail. He's studied tango in Argentina, martial arts in Berlin. Cool reading). The thing I most enjoyed about this book were the practical tips. I was familiar with many of them, having an internet entrepreneur background, but still found plenty of interesting information to make it worth my while. Lots of good detail on the travel side too. He gives you not just the theory, but the web addresses and the exact plan for setting up your own online business and ""mini-retirement-lifestyle.""It's interesting to look at the negative reviews of this book. A lot of them sound like, ""Yes, that would be nice, but..."" A careful read of the book should push you out of that ""it could never work for me,"" mentality. Worth giving a shot."
7,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,5,"I found this book on a recommendation from a good friend, and if it wasn't for that I might have put it down right away, because the tone is very markety, and the author makes a lot of big claims with little substance.That being said, the author must be a smart guy because there is a lot of good stuff in this book.Big Takeaways1. Most of us have the idea that we are supposed to work until we are 60, then retire and live the good life. Tim does a great job pointing out how backwards that idea is, and gives lots of suggestions for how to change your life to accommodate. He calls those who have done so the ""New Rich"", as they are rich in life - which is not related to being rich in dollars. 2. Take 'mini-retirements' throughout your life instead of planning to retire at the end of your life (which I probably wouldn't do anyways). This means every 5 years take a year off to go on a big adventure. Tim's point is you don't need to be rich to do this, and gives a lot of advice on how to go about it. I don't think he'll convince too many people, but it does sound like he's starting to have a following.3. Be a business owner - not a business runner. One gives you lots of free time - the other consumes your life (which I can currently attest to :)4. Time is your most valuable asset. Tim gives a lot of good tips for time management - which aren't unique, but every time you read them helps you. The ones that stuck out for me were:  - only check email 3 times a day at set intervals - outsource everything you can to 3rd parties (like a virtual concierge in India who works for $5/hr) - batch activities like paying bills for max efficiency - give employees autonomous rules/guidelines - avoid meetings whenever possible - use emails instead (works wonders)5. Try to start businesses that can be completely outsourced after you've set them up, so they run on auto-pilot. The author did it with a nutrient company - I'm dubious on this one though.6. 80/20 rule. 80% of your revenue probably comes from 20% of your customers. You can save a lot of time and make more money by focusing where it matters - on the 20%. This applies to most things in life, and although I've read it before it was a good refresher.7. Reach out to important people. Don't be afraid to reach out to important/famous people for advice. They are often more accessible than you think. Tim had good tips for this - like always uses phone's and not emails.8. Avoid excessive information: too much information input can overload you, so avoid reading news on subjects that don't relate to what you do. If something important happens in the world you will hear about it - or its good conversation when you meet with a friend (""whats new in the world?"")"
8,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/566769-rasmus,2,"Although mr. Ferriss has some good ideas and goals, there is one word that describes why, I am not a fan of this book: Scumbaggery.While I totally agree with Tim Ferriss, when he says that most meetings are useless and should be avoided, I cannot agree with his recommendation of making up excuses and lies, in order to leave early or not show up. This is just one example of behavior recommended in this book, and it quite frankly disgusts me.I am all for automating the dull aspects of my life, taking on personal assistants and applying to 80/20 principle where ever it fits, but I never ever want to do so at the price of my own dignity. The book has good ideas but is ultimately written for people without scruples of any kind.The author brags about winning a martial arts contest by bending the rules. He's being a scumbag and encouraging others to follow in his footsteps. I'm sorry, but that's not me."
9,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1696949-j-f-penn,5,"The book that changed my life a few years ago. My aim was to be location independent, after a number of businesses and investments that tied me to one place. 5 years later, I am location independent and a full-time author-entrepreneur. This book helped me see it was possible. "
10,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/278544-kara,1,"I just started this book, and I can't even finish it. Aside from the author grating on my last nerve with each page turn, I find his outlook on life to be overly fantastical. This book appeals to people who are working in dead end jobs that are hellish to say the least, and offers a way out to people who have lost hope. But I'll tell you something. If making a ton of money, working a 4-hour work week, and living like a millionaire were easy, everyone would do it. The fact that he's one of FEW that do, tells you that it's not for everyone. He takes you through an exercise that makes you write down your worst-case scenario of things that would happen if you just quit your job today to live like this. I'm not sure how he can just sit there and think that losing your home, going bankrupt, having your credit ruined, etc. isn't ""the end of the world"", but it's damn near close. Something tells me he's never had to deal with anything like a mortgage or the a home foreclosure.I saw him on the Today Show once with Donny Deutsch who vehemently disagreed with everything this guy had to say. Donny, who is one of the ""living dead"" according to Timothy Ferris, is also a highly successful businessman. Just proof that life is what YOU make of it - not what someone else tells you to. Read this book if you think your life is totally in the toilet and you have no other recourse. Just make sure you realize you'll be one of about 1% of people who can actually make this work..."

Because of the mild distaste I experienced reading the book, I took the time (wasted no doubt, in this lexicon) to count quotes. There are plenty. 92 from men, 7 from women, 2 from fictional characters (1 each Yoda and Calvin: note, males) 2 inanimate objects (1 each Fortune Cookie and AT&T), 1 Chinese Proverb, and 1 from an Italian rap group.Guybonics.

A surprised cliché—because I really didn’t expect to join the cadre of readers whose lives were challenged and even changed by this book. I’m an efficiency nut, so I figured there might be a few good tips in here for streamlining my workflow (and there were). But what I wasn’t expecting was a call to reevaluate my life, my work, and my direction. I read it at just the right time, when I was shifting focus on projects anyway and ready for an overhaul. I filled up pages of notes reading the opening chapters and ended up with actionable daily, weekly, and yearly goals. Call me clichéd again: I highly recommend this book."
13,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7986781-heidi-the-reader,3,"""I've spent the last three years traveling among those who live in worlds currently beyond your imagination. Rather than hating reality, I'll show you how to bend it to your will. It's easier than it sounds.""Timothy Ferriss promises the stars in the sky in his new-classic business/self help book, The 4-Hour Workweek. Though he gives some good productivity tips, he fails to provide a true road map to freeing yourself from the 9-to-5 grind. Partially, this is because there is no real road map to doing this.But he does detail how he found his way into a life of his dreams. Readers can take whatever lessons and information from that as they will.After Ferriss relates a timeline of his life story, he begins by detailing his ""DEAL"" plan to a four hour work week which consists of ""definition, elimination, automation and liberation"". Each step of this process, he says, helps guide the reader to a new world of free time. Though, he admits, traditional bosses may have serious problems with your new program and, perhaps, you should go more ""DELA"". Yes, understatement.""Resolve now to test the concepts as an exercise in lateral thinking. If you try it, you'll see just how deep the rabbit hole goes, and you won't ever go back.""He examines the concepts of ""busy work"" and suggests boiling your workload down to the most important tasks you complete. Then, just do those as fast as possible. Don't allow yourself to be derailed by the internet or chatty coworkers. (Not a friendly method, but Ferriss seems to have his eyes on the prize rather than concerning himself with making friends.)Out of everything he suggests in the first part of this book, I was most taken with the idea of only checking your email once a day or week. There is a definite time-suck there that maybe I have been blinding myself to.After that, Ferriss enters more conceptual territory with an idea about creating a business for yourself that essentially runs itself or can be run by someone else, cheaply. For example, a website that sells something awesome. But, what exactly that something or muse is, that's for you, the reader, to discover on your own.It reminded me of Godin's Purple Cow: Transform Your Business by Being Remarkable. You know an awesome product or ""purple cow"" when you see it, but how exactly to make one isn't a clear thing. Interesting idea, but necessarily helpful for those looking for actionable items to improve their work life.The most useful part of the book, in my opinion, is his encouragement to create a dream plan by ""dreamlining"". Write down what you want to do. Create a timeline. Crunch the numbers. It may cost less than you thought and, with it on paper, it takes on a bit of reality already. If you don't get started, how do you know what you might accomplish.""It's lonely at the top. Ninety-nine percent of people in the world are convinced they are incapable of achieving great things, so they aim for the mediocre. The level of competition is thus fiercest for 'realistic' goals, paradoxically making them the most time-and energy-consuming. It is easier to raise $1,000,000 than it is $100,000.""Ferriss' tone in this book has been criticized by readers and I see what they mean. Some of his ideas are alienating. Sometimes he seems to say: I've done this-this-this and this, and it's so easy that if you can't figure it out too, especially with the book I've put in your hands, then you must be either complacent or dumb.But I took this book to be written by someone who dared, a nod to Brené Brown, greatly. Ferriss believed his life could be something other than a slog and yours could too. He's written down some tips to help you along the way that he discovered through real life trial and error. Read it or not. He'll be over there, living the life of his dreams.Recommended, with reservations, to folks interested in life-hacking their work/life balance. I think we can achieve whatever dreams we set our minds to while still being friendly."
14,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3399794-naveed,1,"This book is garbage. I donated it to my local library shortly after completing it. First off - the number of plugs Ferriss puts in his book is unbelievable. He's clearly getting a small cut from each of these people who want to ""advertise"" in his book. Secondly - he talks mostly about himself throughout this book. As opposed to Guy Kawasaki who might actually give instructions, and most likely will inspire, Tim Ferriss is so insecure about himself that he has to talk about his own dance skills before he gets into the meat of the book. This is the plan that Timmy here recommends - get your company to let you work remotely. Once they say yes (because that's just SO easy for everyone apparently), then you stop actually delivering results because now you're working from home, you outsource all your tasks to do (yes he really tells you to outsource ALL your job work), you travel to countries where the dollar is quite strong, and then in your spare time on a beach lagoon you create a product that can sell. You sell this product in exclusive magazines and TV - you don't try and mass market it because then it becomes a commodity. By only advertising in select places, you control the price forever, as he says. Bear in mind - you're doing all this because your company is willing to turn a deaf ear to your lack of results. Wait - there's more. Instead of creating a product - which can be easily replicated - create something else - INFORMATION, he says. Create an instructional DVD or CD (and of course he shows you the best places to produce them for you), or perhaps write an instructional book, and then sell this book to the masses. I'm sitting there reading this book and it occurred to me - this guy just DID EXACTLY THAT to me! He created so-called information, marketed the hell out of it via a blog and a catchy title, and then I lost my $19.99 to him. So I've been made out like a fool, and it was so easy that he explains how everyone can do it. This book is so filled with garbage that Tim Ferriss actually spends several pages in his book writing a line by line SCRIPT that you can use with your boss when you persuade them to let you work from home. Save your time and your money. Guy Kawasaki is better - start a good business, claim tax benefits, and work hard, and you'll be happy. Did anyone really think you can make enough money to live and support a family when you only work four hours a week? Pure garbage."
15,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2270248-kyle,1,"I am always interested in life-hacks that can make work more productive and leave more time for leisure so this book grabbed my attention. Little did I know that reading it would feel like listening to a confessional from someone who will leave no corner uncut. If you have no qualms about out-sourcing work and under-paying people to do it, then this book may be for you. If not--and you have no anthropological interest in the delusional contours of petty bourgeois entrepreneurial capitalism at the dawn of the 21st century--then avoid at all costs. "

It's often hard to think outside the box and imagine your life as you'd really like to live it, and Ferris does a good job of shaking things up.That said, many of the tactics Ferris suggests are morally questionable. You'll get more out of the book if you have no qualms about calling in ""sick"" at work, hiring overseas assistants at below minimum wage to do your busy work, setting up fake ebay auctions and canceling them at the last minute to assess consumer interest, etc. At one point, Ferris encourages people to aggressively look up the personal email addresses/ phone numbers of famous successful people to get them to be mentors. Later on the book, Ferris gives his strategies for outsourcing his phone calls/emails and avoiding all but absolutely necessary calls. So is it okay to demand other busy people's time but not his?There are some good life hacks here that might save time, although not as much as the title claims. He claims that you can get a week's worth of work done in less than a quarter of time, but the only solid suggestions I gleaned were 1)check email less often 2) don't multitask, and 3) avoid meetings like the plague. Good tips, but they won't bring you down to a four hour work week unless you were absolutely hopeless before.So it's worth reading once for the tips, and I do intend to avoid multitasking and check email less, as he suggests. But much of Ferris' strategy relies on getting others to do your work for you. If everyone started doing it, the world economy would come to a screeching halt."
17,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/991168-amber,4,"Reading the first third of this book was one of the most self-indulgent activities I’ve ever done. (And yes, I read fiction.) It was so nice to hear that someone else in the world doesn't understand why we spend so much time on meaningless meetings and other time-fillers when there are so many meaningful things we long to do.This book is worth reading though there are a few things you'll have to endure to finish it:-potty-mouth words-author-coined terms and antonyms that include the word “rich” (ug. is this some kind of prerequisite to publishing a business book?)-and I’m sorry to tell you there are also self-help action plans at the end of every chapterBut my friends, it is WORTH it. Ferris starts with a message that rings true right to your soul. He says working nonstop for 45 years and then retiring and doing nothing makes no sense. He says you should figure out what dreams would fulfill you and then work on making enough money to accomplish those. And then he makes other completely sane statements that few people have been bold enough to make. It is moving, it feels revolutionary. Ferris then goes on to tell you task for task how to build a business you can run with just a few hours a week from anywhere in the world. Though I admire Ferris for being so bold as to back up his promise, and for actually filling the book with some meaty details, I have to admit the book often degenerates at this point and reminds me of ""How to Get Anyone to Do Anything"" (is that the title?). And although Ferris seems to miss the point that fulfillment can come from things other than international travel adventures (he mentions serving in charities abroad, but seems to overlook being kind to and serving the people around you), I still love this book. It wakes you up, and honestly, I think it would only benefit the world if a few more adults did interesting things and had an adventure every now and then instead of reading a lot of email and watching a lot of T.V. and news.I'll end by sharing one of my favorite parts:Challenging the Status Quo vs. Being Stupid1. “Retirement Is Worst-Case Scenario Insurance…: in this case, becoming physically incapable of working and needing a reservoir of capital to survive.”2. “Interest and Energy Are Cyclical…: Alternating periods of activity and rest is necessary to survive, let alone thrive. Capacity, interest, and mental endurance all wax and wane.” p. 313. “Less Is Not Laziness…: Doing less meaningless work, so that you can focus on things of greater personal importance, is NOT laziness. This is hard for most to accept, because our culture tends to reward personal sacrifice instead of personal productivity.” p. 324. “The Timing Is Never Right…: The universe doesn’t conspire against you, but it doesn’t go out of its way to line up all the pins either.”5. “Ask for Forgiveness, Not Permission…: If it isn’t going to devastate those around you…Most people are fast to stop you before you get started but hesitant to get in the way if you’re moving.” p. 336. “Emphasize Strengths, Don’t Fix Weaknesses…: It is far more lucrative and fun to leverage your strengths…The choice is between multiplication of results using strengths or incremental improvement fixing weaknesses that will, at best, become mediocre.” p. 347. “Things in Excess Become Their Opposite…: Too much, too many, and too often of what you want becomes what you don’t want. This is true of possessions and even time.”8. “Money Alone Is Not the Solution…: In part, it’s laziness. “If I only had more money” is the easiest way to postpone…self-examination.” p. 359. “Relative Income Is More Important Than Absolute Income…: Relative income [measures both] the dollar and time.”10. “Distress Is Bad, Eustress is Good…: [Be] equally aggressive in removing distress and finding eustress.” p. 38"

(I mean, since stocks aren’t doing that well, why buy when the market is low, am I right? What a maroooooon.) This single 30-year-old also gives advice on relationships and raising kids.

20,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1182271-aaron-minks,5,"One of the few books I have read more than once. Timothy Feriss does an excellent job of explaining the lifestyle and methods of the new rich. Not only that, but he provides web addresses, phone numbers, and more for manufacturers, drop shippers, and mentors. This is a life changing book for any person involved or interested in business."
21,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3006762-r-b-kiernan,1,"The book should be entitled, ""Everything that's Wrong with this Country."" All you need to do is cultivate ignorance, outsource everything, and never think for yourself. If you have absolutely no ethics whatsoever and want to con the masses, then you too can Get Rich Quick. Here's how:1. Pretend you're an expert on... anything. He specifically explains that it doesn't even matter what you might or might not actually know. You do this by repackaging the works of others and selling ""your"" ideas on-line -- to the gullible masses. Seriously, he begins by admitting he first made his fortune selling (allegedly) nutritional supplements that cost almost nothing to make and weren't based on science, but were then hyped to the point the uninformed public was paying through the nose to get it. This gave him ideas on how to further hype his message to an even larger audience, without bothering to sell anything tangible. Just tell them how they, too, can get rich quick by pretending to actually know something. He then gives advice about ""paraphrasing and combining points from several books,"" borrowing from the public domain, and/or compensating some other ""expert."" This way, you don't need to be bothered to actually learn anything, which brings me to step #2.2. Stay uneducated. This is in the chapter entitled ""The Low Information Diet."" He admits he doesn't bother staying abreast on the news or any other kinds of current events -- even to the point that, during election seasons, he simply asks his more educated friends about whom will win their votes and then votes for those candidates. Not kidding. He justifies this by saying how the time it takes to, you know, LEARN THINGS, is time that could be spent running a business on autopilot or having fun. Apparently, not knowing a damn thing is a virtue he calls ""Cultivating Selective Ignorance."" I prefer to call it, ""The Suicide of Democracy."" If having an educated and well-informed populace is fundamental to having a flourishing democracy, this is how we'll end up with a plutocracy where the stupidest few prey on the desperate and stupid masses, while outsourcing all the jobs they might create. This brings me to point #3.3. Outsource everything -- including your brain -- to a 3rd World Country: He hires virtual assistants in various 3rd World Countries, especially India, who are then given fabulous access to all of his personal information to the point they can pretend to be him and make all of his personal and business decisions. They send all of his correspondence, including e-mails and anything of an official nature (which causes me to assume they wrote this book for him. They certainly wrote many of the excellent reviews on Amazon). Personal business which can be done remotely are always done by them. As he states he can't be bothered to think for himself, it shouldn't be surprising he isn't interested in working for himself, either. Hey, what could possibly go wrong by hiring complete strangers and giving them all information about you in order to think for you, do your work and run your errands? Finally, point #4:4. Avoid those who want knowledge: If you can't be bothered knowing anything, why should they? Whether it's your boss or your client, do everything in your power to avoid those people because of how they drain your time. The boss wants you to attend a meeting? Just tell him you're too busy and further kill morale by then asking those other suckers - aka, co-workers - for a quick breakdown of what happened. Clients? Don't get back to them right away, if ever. If they demand to actually know something, have those remote virtual assistants send them just enough to get them to shut up.There are a couple, minuscule, points the author makes that are reasonably valid, such as: It's good to streamline your many processes and it's good to have solid goals. Also, I could say that the book begins by being very motivational. If I were critiquing this on just the first few pages it would likely have 4 stars. As it's written, the unethical, stupid and lazy b.s. kills any chance of this even getting 2 stars.I wish I hadn't bought this on Kindle.I wish I had read the bad reviews, first."
22,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1586355-chad-warner,4,"Timothy Ferriss explains how he freed himself from the rat race and slashed his working hours by delegating, outsourcing, and automating his businesses. He spends his new free time living on his terms, which for him means traveling the world. He wants you to do the same, and provides the motivation and action steps to do so. The basic message of this book: take shortcuts.In most cases, those shortcuts involve working smarter. In a few instances, however, Ferriss promotes what I would consider questionable or unethical behavior (such as telling ""half-truths"" to your boss or others, or taking advantage of loopholes in rules). Ferriss comes across as someone I could never fully trust, and thus wouldn't want to emulate entirely.Ferriss says that “Becoming a member of the NR [New Rich] is not just about working smarter. It's about building a system to replace yourself.” Ferriss calls this system Income Autopilot. He says the path to wealth and freedom is to own, not run, a business. An owner has people and systems do the work, while someone running a business is another cog in the machine.Ferriss advocates creating a product business that you can quickly scale through delegation and automation. He discourages service businesses because they’re not as easy to scale. He says that if you have a service business, you should convert it into a product business by turning your services into information products like ebooks, webinars, audio recordings, etc. I found this an interesting point, because my web design company, OptimWise, is a service business, and I’m looking to maximize profits with the least effort.One of Ferriss’ main ideas is that rather than postponing fun activities until retirement, you should take several mini-retirements that are weeks or months long, throughout your working life. This book was part of the reason that I quit my 9-5 job to start OptimWise. I wanted the freedom of working when and where I wanted, so that work fits around life, not vice versa. I really liked The Parable of the Mexican Fisherman referenced in this book.I really liked Ferriss' advice about going on an information diet. I’ve tried to follow his advice by frequently unsubscribing from email newsletters and RSS feeds. After reading this book the first time in 2008, I stopped reading the newspaper and news sites, and replaced them with NPR’s daily 5-minute news summary podcast.Ferriss advocates effectiveness in place of efficiency. He says to eliminate all the unnecessary busyness that takes up most of our time, and focus on the tasks that actually matter.Ferriss certainly presents an extreme example of the New Rich lifestyle. What if you love your job and have no desire to leave it? This book is still worth reading for the lessons about prioritization and time-management.Notes• DEAL: Define, Eliminate, Automate, Liberate.• People don’t want to be millionaires. They want the millionaire lifestyle. You can have it without being a millionaire.• Effectiveness is more important than efficiency; doing a few things effectively is better than doing many things efficiently.• The seeming lack of time is actually a lack of prioritization. Focus on the important.• Use the Pareto Principle and Parkinson’s Law to limit the tasks you undertake.• Consume information only when the need is immediate and obvious. Use “just-in-time” learning.• Eliminate before you delegate.• Don’t let people interrupt you. Force people to define their requests before you spend time on them. Empower others to act without interrupting you.• Batch routine tasks. Check email and phone messages only at predetermined times.• If you have a service business, sell information products (ebooks, audio, video, etc.) for $50-$200 (a price high enough to increase the perception of quality)."
23,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49415231-amir-tesla,4,"Wow, this book literally equipped me with a new pair of eyes. The 4 hour work week basically means automating and delegating task as much as possible. This would give you enough freedom to start a new business.Another amazing insight of the book helps you escape the 5-9 routine. How? Well, it teaches you clever tricks (which is to be played on your boss). To summarize 10-20 pages, you call in sick for 2 days. You show up on day third and show how significantly you have been productive at home, then you propose a trial of 2 weeks to remote-work 2 days a week. By proving your productivity, you will gain a full-time remote work. So you can spend your weeks where ever you want while doing and enjoying your job. I have oversimplified the whole process, but, you get the idea. I highly recommend this book if you seek more freedom and aspire to run your own business. Aside from these, the book is filled with numerous productivity hacks which constituted a remarkable journey for me a productivity addict."
24,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1120545-chip-and-katie-moore,2,"Overall, I appreciate the idea he brings up in the fact that people waste their days with nonsense (this may come from the fact that I worked in the government for years). As a computer guy, I also appreciate the fact that many people don't fully harness the power of auto-replies, faqs, macros, scripts, batching, etc. to eliminate a good 80% of their work in an office environment. That being the case, the idea of doing all of this doesn't work everywhere (only certain office/sales jobs I suspect), and no boss I've had has ever really appreciated the work I went through to be more efficient either. Even when my work propagated to others and our unit had plenty of free time, all that happened was more filler was added to our workload to make us look busy, or our staff was assigned elsewhere to places not as efficient. So, I'd recommend following the advise he offers for being more efficient and less plugged in, but not necessarily making it known you're doing so unless you're forced into a corner.The other part of the book espousing the benefits of Direct Marketing are much like the ideas of Rich Dad/Poor Dad for real estate - cute ideas, and I truly believe they will work for some, but not everyone has what it takes to get in on these 'get-rich-quick' ideas at the right time. I feel like success in these field requires a type of personality not everyone has, or wants to have (he references the 'Girls Gone Wild' videos as a good example of direct marketing)?? That may be a true example - but all the money in the world can't make taking advantage of a bunch of drunk girls appealing to me - so, for me it's not a good example.I'll end by saying the book is short enough to warrant reading. It has some interesting enough ideas peppered throughout that if you can plow through the stuff that you don't like, get it out from the library and read it or flip through it at the book store to see if you get anything from it, but don't necessarily buy thinking it will change your life."

So far, I have only two: Rich Dad Poor Dad and this one. Though Rich Dad introduced me to the concept of owning assets that pay you to free your time, 4-hour workweek dispels a lot of myths about the need to make millions to live the life that we all dream about. In actuality, its a lot closer than we all realize.Everyone should read this book. Almost every single one of my friends has gone through the book. Some with criticism, but the rest gave it good reviews. Get the book, it will deliver a message you should really chew on. "
26,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2512574-jami,1,"I figure, having been unemployed most of this year, I'd see if there were any suggestions in this book that I could actually apply into the kind of career I actually want to do. Well, that and it was free on a holiday promotion. There are words to describe my opinion of this book, however most of them would break the terms and conditions of this site. Suffice it to say, it's one big sales pitch for being an egomaniac, passive agressive jerk. It boils entirely down to outsource or eliminate anything you can, any way you can, handwaves at ""creating"" businesses with no actual, practical advice on how to determine a market need (which is the hardest part of any business: Figuring out what's needed in the first place!), and then spend lots of your time places where the exchange rate makes you comparatively rich.Not even worth free."
27,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81446-kim,2,"Ok, if I ever met this guy (and I could have because he participated in a celebrity date auction in SF some friends and I were jokingly considering attending), I KNOW I would not like him based on his voice in this book. However, he has about 3 points I took away, and I can appreciate him for that: 1. Don't waste time trying to accomplish things that don't help your bottom line 2. More time given to do things makes more time to procrastinate 3. ""Batch"" activities at one time to get them done faster (i.e. check email once a day maybe). If these lessons stick, then I can see myself raising the stars. Otherwise, the messages in this book really weren't applicable to anyone in a caring, teaching, or hourly profession. This talked about marketing and selling things to make a buck, when many, many people don't do that and don't aspire to do that. There are many professions the author ignores. Maybe I wasn't the right audience? I certainly am not going to outsource all my emailing to India and hire a personal assistant just so I can effectively practice the art of delegating (that was a long chapter), because that just doesn't sit well with me. I also am not going to spend every moment of my free time traveling the world just to accomplish brag-worthy feats instead of spending time with my family and friends (that was a pretty long chapter too), because that just seems sort of empty. But again, I guess I am not the right audience."
28,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15715846-rosie-nguy-n,4,"This book is not for those who are loving their full time job, or experts, as the tricks in the book maybe viewed as cheating from the people who have tried so hard and spent so much time to thrive and become specialists in their areas. Yet I have no problem with that. Yeah, Tim Ferriss is an aggressive and competitive guy. Some of his actions mentioned in the book may make people feel not comfortable, and prone to oppose to his arguments. But the things he said make sense to me, and gosh, he is hilarious. Plus, it's cool that the book gave me more ideas to improve my writing style. Brilliant. "
29,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6557396-donna,1,"4 Hour Work Week is about adopting a new mindset completely toward your work/life balance. The author insists that the reader should not tie making money to working 8 hours a day, that’s a waste of your life! For the author there are more satisfying ways to be financially stable and live a life of freedom.... that is the major theme.. .... but the book got pretty technical and involved about entrepreneurship and making a plan at the end - I felt totally out of my element, felt overwhelmed by the changes I had to start making, clearly I needed to read more books before I got started .. I guess I’m just not interested in business .. Still working 40 hours a week :((( fukk "
30,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2377230-emily,2,"This book is ridiculous. 90% of the book is just Ferriss talking about all the great things he's done while on vacation and how great of a businessman he is. Problem is - most of his advice is really general or not helpful/applicable to most situations. For example, Ferriss spends a couple chapters bragging about how he never answers a phone call from a number he doesn't recognize and trains his assistants to respond to all his emails as if it's really him replying. That's all great (maybe?) if you run a large company and have other people to answer the phone or write your emails. It doesn't work at all if you're trying to grow a small business. A few things I did like - the 80/20 rule - that generally 80% of effects come from 20% of the causes (example - 20% of your customers might be responsible for 80% of your sales). I also liked some of his comments about email - such as only checking at certain times each day to avoid being constantly interrupted. Basically I got maybe 2-3 takeaways from the book, but I don't recommend it."
31,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,3,"In the last few years, I've sold all my possessions; lived in three different countries and traveled through a half dozen others; took a year off as a ""mini retirement""; started my own company; worked completely remotely; and wrote two books. In short, I've done most of the stuff Ferriss recommends in this book, long before I actually read this book. I bring this up because I feel like I am uniquely qualified to make the following statement: Tim Ferriss' book does a great job of showing you the *value* of this sort of lifestyle, but it VASTLY understates the *costs*.Examples:* Starting a company is a massive amount of work. Figuring out the legal details is hard (and lawyers are expensive). Figuring out the tax and accounting details is hard (and accountants are expensive). Figuring out a product that people want to pay money for and is profitable is hard. Hiring people is hard. Marketing is hard. Sales is hard. And despite all of this hard work, the vast majority of new companies fail. Don't take my word for it. Go speak with 100 small business owners in any industry and find out how many of them found it ""quick"" or ""easy"". Ask how many of them work just 4 hours per week. Ask how many of them live worry-free and don't bring their work home with them. * Moving around the world is a massive amount of work. Selling everything you own is hard. Finding a safe and comfortable place to live in a foreign place is hard. Making friends in a new place where you don't speak the language is hard. Learning a new language is hard. Figuring out health insurance, local laws, and taxes--especially if you are running your own company while living abroad--is hard. Figuring out visas and work permits is brutally hard. In fact, in most countries around the world, unless you take a full-time (40h/week) job with a local company, and that company secures a work permit for you, you won't be able to legally stay more than ~90 days. That's enough for a vacation, but not to move somewhere.Perhaps most importantly, despite all of this hard work, most people that try to achieve this lifestyle... Will fail. Ferriss succeeded not because everyone else is an idiot or because he has discovered a secret formula, but because a) he's a white, privileged, American male, b) he got lucky, c) he's willing to use shitty, unsustainable practices to make it happen. In fact, I'd even go further and say that if everyone could achieve his lifestyle, it would be a disaster. Examples:* He recommends starting shitty little companies to make passive income (e.g. he sells some snake oil supplement called BrainQuicken) and working only 4 hours per week; if everyone did that, no one would ever create any thing meaningful in the world. No great company, product, or innovation has ever been built the way Ferris describes. Also, he contradicts himself repeatedly: if you do the math on all the work activities he says he does per week, it adds up to VASTLY more than 4 hours. And that doesn't even take into account a) the learning curve to get good at those activities, and b) all the activities that he doesn't mention, such as taking the time to write a 400+ page book. * He recommends checking email exactly once per week; if everyone did that, the smallest email exchange would take months. He contradicts himself repeatedly on this point too, at times saying he checks email 3 times per day, at other times saying he checks email from his virtual assistant nightly, and at still other times, talks about using phone calls instead, which in my experience, are VASTLY more distracting.* He recommends that everyone tries to work remotely; if everyone did that, you'd quickly realize that it takes more than an occasional Skype call to make it effective. If 99% of the company is in an office but one or two people are remotely, those two remote works become outsiders. They are never part of the lunch time discussions, the hallway chats, the impromptu meetings, and all the other in-person interactions where the real business gets done. In most cases, they become isolated, irrelevant, and ultimately leave or get fired. Building a distributed company requires changing the culture to focus around writing everything down and async communication. It's hard to get right and it doesn't work in all industries. Moreover, while I love remote work and have built a completely distributed company, it's not without its downsides. Face-to-face conversations are fundamentally different than Skype calls and while remote work gives you the ability to focus and avoid distractions, you lose the serendipitous interactions which lead to some of your most important ideas.* He recommends not checking the news and just relying on your friends to tell you what's important; if everyone did that, we'd all be totally ignorant. And guess what, he contradicts himself here too, as Ferriss posts on Twitter multiple times per day, which means he spends quite a bit of time every single day staring at a newsfeed.* He recommends against reading too much, suggesting you should read ""just in time"" rather than ""just in case""; if everyone did that, we'd be even more ignorant. What Ferriss forgets is that you don't know what you don't know. If you don't know a piece of information exists, you won't know to seek it out ""just in time."" That's why reading broadly and gaining exposure to new ways of thinking is *essential* to success and not something to be avoided. Yet again he contradicts himself, as his own book is full of quotes from a number of other books of all sorts of disciplines, and on top of that, he has a recommended reading list at the end.OK, obviously the book has a lot of problems, but having gone through all the caveats and warnings above, as much as it hurts me to admit it, I have to say it: most people would benefit from reading this book. Ferriss may hide the costs from you, but he does a superb job of talking about the value of time. This is the one truly non-renewable resource in the world and this book does a *superb* job of making you appreciate that fact and teaching you how to be more efficient.Be sure to skip the introductory chapters, which sound like an infomercial, full of boasting, chest thumping, ""order now and your life will be changed forever"", self-help book tropes. Get past that, and you'll discover some real gems, and some serious motivation for changing how you live and work:* Retirement should be a worst case scenario. Instead of using the best years of your life to work and save money for old age, where you can't enjoy it, take mini retirements (e.g. 3 - 6 months) on a regular basis. I started doing this a few years ago and it's life changing.* The worst-case scenario with most career and lifestyle decisions is not that bad; the risk is not that high; and the timing is never right. In short, shut up and do it.* Follow the 80/20 rule. Find the 20% of tasks you do that bring 80% of value; alternatively, find the 20% of tasks that eat up 80% of your resources. Eliminate the waste accordingly. As a programmer, I'm always on the search for efficiency, whereas I see many other folks get stuck in the same time-wasting routines just because they've always done it that way.* Batching. As a programmer, I'm keenly aware of the overhead of multi-tasking (i.e. ""context switching"") and have been batching my work in years to become vastly more efficient. I check my mail, email, and voicemail at set intervals rather than whenever it happens. I prefer asynchronous communication (e.g. email) for everything so I can respond to multiple messages in batches. I do all my calls and meetings on 1-2 days per week and block out the other days for focused, uninterrupted work (e.g. coding). * Virtual assistants. This was a new one for me. I've always done everything for myself, but I'm realizing now that there is a ton of work I do that could be handled just as well by someone else. For example, scheduling meetings, filling in details in a contract template for a customer or employee, researching simple questions, responding to spammy/marketing emails, and so on. Hiring a full-time assistant for my small company would be too expensive, but a part-time, virtual assistant seems like a fantastic idea.* Negotiating tips. Ferriss seems to understand human psychology very well and has lots of great tips on negotiating. For example, he recommended steps for asking your boss to allow you to work remotely are brilliant: first, have the company invest in you (e.g. get them to pay for trainings) so you seem more valuable; next, try to work from home without official permission (e.g. stay home sick for a couple days); then, show your boss how productive you happened to be on those days, and ask for a revocable trial period to work from home a couple days per week (this keeps the risk very small from your boss's perspective); be even more productive when approved; after a little while, show the increased productivity as a reason to expand remote time. What a great approach! He also has wonderful tips on negotiating deals, including a list of simple, but effective questions. Examples: What would I need to do to make XXX happen? Under what circumstances would you do XXX? You must have made some exceptions in the past, right? * The book contains a huge collection of valuable resources and links for traveling, saving money, working remotely, testing business ideas, and much more. I had heard of many of the tools, but still found quite a few new ones, such as the virtual assistant services and expert services that journalists reach out to for quotes/opinions (e.g. ProfNet). You can find the list here: http://tim.blog/4-hour-workweek-toolsFinally, as always, I've saved some of my favorite quotes from the book:“For all of the most important things, the timing always sucks. Waiting for a good time to quit your job? The stars will never align and the traffic lights of life will never all be green at the same time. The universe doesn't conspire against you, but it doesn't go out of its way to line up the pins either. Conditions are never perfect. ""Someday"" is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you. Pro and con lists are just as bad. If it's important to you and you want to do it ""eventually,"" just do it and correct course along the way.” “People will choose unhappiness over uncertainty.”“The opposite of love is indifference, and the opposite of happiness is boredom.” “It's lonely at the top. Ninety-nine percent of people in the world are convinced they are incapable of achieving great things, so they aim for the mediocre. The level of competition is thus fiercest for 'realistic' goals, paradoxically making them the most time and energy-consuming.” “If we define risk as ‘the likelihood of an irreversible negative outcome,’ inaction is the greatest risk of all.”“The fishing is best where the fewest go, and the collective insecurity of the world makes it easy for people to hit home runs while everyone else is aiming for base hits.”"

Because there are some fantastic 5 star recommendations that I will follow, but the whole ethos of Ferriss and his army is antithetical to everything I believe in: 5 star tips: 1. For me, the most enlightening parts were how to deal with assistants and give instructions. I already have an assistant, but I have not yet given effective instructions and follow up and this will help me do that. 2. Scheduling all calls to a once a week window. And emails to twice a day. The one thing he doesn't explore is how to decide on stuff. Like ""dealing with emails"" isn't just about shooting back answers but responding to invitations and stuff. I already say no to pointless meetings and calls, but how do you decide on events and other engagements? I really liked Essentialism on that front. I feel like most of the oppression from my email inbox has less to do with answering people, but deciding what to do. 3. I already do most of the other ""hacks"" like avoiding meetings etc. 1 Star:1. I think reading this book will definitely make you more efficient at work and maybe better at marketing your wares on the unsuspecting, but it will not make you a better human or even a happier one. Seems like Ferriss is constantly trying to ""hack"" and be more efficient by pushing off his chores onto other less fortunate people or just getting out of stuff. What about community? Wasting time in meetings with people not to be efficient, but to make eye contact and support and build friendships? What about wasting your days in community groups and leagues and inefficient communities because life is about building and loving within our tribes? In other words, Ferris wants to be an efficient and rich and successful island. But I'm not sure that's the point of life. 2. Most of his lifehacks border on the edge of ethics. Sure, it works if just he does it, but if everyone is constantly looking for loopholes, what happens to social trust and cohesion? 3. Because I read this late, this felt more like an explanation for all the douchebags techbros as opposed to a how-to guide. I get it now. "
33,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22788-brian-lehnen,3,"It is nice to know that somebody is out there attempting to shed some light on the American rat-race lifestyle... Although this book has its obvious flaws, namely:1. Author is an ivy league entrepreneur (of course he's not worried about money).2. Many of his ""time-saving"" work tips have no relevance in many fields of work. In fact, I cant really see how they would work unless you already have some independence in your job.3. The Get-Rich-Quick internet start-up company info. is mostly nonsense. Seems to me the author made a quick buck peddling supplements over the internet... success rate on this has to be what.. 3%? I would suggest taking a panning-for-gold approach to this book. There are plenty of great tips/tricks to freeing up some personal time for yourself or learning to be more efficient at work. Even if you only come away with a few nuggets of great information the purchase is well worth it. This should be required reading for all managers. "
34,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1546372-ashley,1,"edit-- also, the whole ""don't read books- it's a total waste of time"" thing was pretty bizarre. you know, considering I was reading a book he wrote. He specifically mentioned non-fiction books being useless, but said that his book was okay, because it was recommending ""immediate action""...okay...whatever. ((although later on he referenced a number of non-fiction books, so yea...kinda weird))I'm just going to pretend this whole thing was a work of satire. That's the only plausible explanation for the existence of this book.  ---A few weeks ago I had put myself on a list to read the ebook version of this. I had completely forgotten about it until I got an email this afternoon telling me it was my turn. I almost just cancelled my hold, but decided ""what the hell- might as well browse through a few pages."" So I did. I skipped some of the stuff about finding automated sources of income because I thought the whole idea was absolutely idiotic, but other than that I read all of it.My one thought upon finishing the book? ...seriously?! This dude is like freaking Walmart in human form. cut corners wherever you can. outsource and exploit the knowledge/labor/ignorance of other people. Automate your income so you basically don't have to lift a finger, but somehow the money still comes to you instead of making all of your workers rich. Walmart might be super cheap/efficient, but everyone HATES being there. Small businesses do all of the heavy lifting themselves and have to deal with a lot of crappy stuff that pops up, but their customers are generally happy, and more importantly, the employees are far happier.Is there good information to be found here? Sure, there were a few good things. But honestly? I would HATE to think about living in a world where everyone read this book and decided to put it to the test. The vast majority of the book pushes selfish, lazy, and inconsiderate practices. I mean, the guy actually suggests that you leave your binoculars at home when you go to Costa Rica on a bird-watching trip. Why? Because other people there will have binoculars with them, and you can use theirs! ...so it's okay for them to have to purchase and pack their own stuff, but you're just gonna mooch? I sure as hell wouldn't want to hand over a pair of binoculars to some sweaty stranger in the jungle. Get your own, buddy. If you have the means to finance such an extravagant vacation, I'm sure you can spare the expense. And if you're not packing it just due to inconvenience, well...that's life. Deal with it. Come prepared, or do without. ((oh, that's right. He only HAS the means to pay for such a crazy vacation BECAUSE he exploits people...duh! I forgot, this is America, where hard work means absolutely nothing when you're up against lazy manipulative system-players. The people who do the work rarely reap the rewards))This guy seems to be ALL about not carrying his own weight. Why should he? Other people will do it for him!The absolute BEST element of the book is that he fails to realize that if everyone followed his ideas, NOTHING would ever get done. He tells people to outsource/automate everything so they don't have to think about it...but there are people that he's outsourcing TO. It might be a great idea, but it just comes off sounding like he thinks he's important enough to have a cushy life with everyone working for him, instead of taking a little bit of time to do stuff himself. Want to learn how to clean your house better?DONT! pay someone else to do it!Don't want to put in the time to educate yourself about political candidates?DON'T! Just email your slave-to-the-news-media friends and have them give you their opinion on the matter. Just to be safe, go ahead and watch the debates- but ONLY the debates, anything else would be overkill- because everyone knows the debates are super accurate and the candidates would NEVER say something just to get elected.You shouldn't aspire to work for yourself...no- that's thinking too small! Aspire to have people working FOR YOU!What kind of insane slavery mindset is that? Live some cushy lifestyle while paying people to do your dirty work and tasks that are just too boring/upsetting/repetitive for you?The entire thing just read like a how-to manual on taking advantage of everyone around you and making them work for your benefit. There were a handful of things he suggested his readers do (like calling important/successful people before 8:30am and after 6pm so you can talk to THEM and not be bottlenecked by a receptionist) but then said they should NEVER accept someone else doing the same to them (""who needs to call me after 8pm? I'm not the president- there are no real emergencies. It can wait"" and his general avoidance of meetings/phone calls in favor of quick emails...that he checks once a week, if that)""Don't let people ramble. Don't say ""how are you"" but 'how can I help?'""...seriously? How the hell does he make friends? I mean, to an extent I get doing this in the workplace- especially customer service jobs, but with the way he was writing it sounded like he was suggesting people avoid interacting with their bosses/co-workers at all costs. I would HATE to work with such a self-absorbed person. Is he efficient? sure, probably. But is he enjoyable to be around? probably not. Does it REALLY take that much time out of your day to hear a coworker say that they're doing great before they get straight to the question?Ugh. I'm rambling. But this just seemed like the biggest load of selfish crap I've ever read. Do I think people should conform to 9-5 jobs just because that's how it's always been done? Absolutely not! I'm ALL about self-made people doing their own thing...but it's hard to respect people who aren't actually DOING much of anything, instead choosing to sit at the top and watch other people make money for them. ...God forbid those people want to email him and ask him a question about how he wants his business run *rolls eyes*yuck.The only thing worse than those ""fat old men in BMWs"" he referenced in the beginning of his book are the ""Lifestyle Design"" yuppies he's training who are deluded enough to think think they should totally be able to jet around the world without doing much work. Work is totally boring and such a buzzkill...let other people deal with that. Just focus on having fun at their expense, and you'll be much happier, and life is ALL about being happy!Yepp. This dude is absolutely insane. He's loving his life and living in a way all of us dream of living...but I'd hate to have to put up with him in real life."
35,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/147289-jason-pettus,3,"(Reprinted from the Chicago Center for Literature and Photography [cclapcenter.com:]. I am the original author of this essay, as well as the owner of CCLaP; it is not being reprinted illegally.)If I was in the mood to be deliberately cruel, I suppose I could sum up the four main steps of the insanely popular ""lifestyle management"" guide The 4-Hour Work Week thusly: ""Step 1: Stop reading the news! That whole pesky 'being an informed citizen' thing is just getting in the way of you becoming one of the New Rich! Step 2: Outsource an Indian secretary! It only costs pennies per hour and it makes you feel like a big man! Step 3: Vacation in third-world countries! Your American 'F-ck You Money' goes a lot farther, and they don't arrest you just for having sex with 14-year-olds! Step 4: Come up with some stupid piece of crap that no one ever really needed in the first place, then relentlessly deluge your sheeplike customer base through informercials and spam lists! And by the way, did I mention to BUY MY NEW BOOK 'THE 4-HOUR WORKWEEK' YET? B-a-a-a-h, sheep! B-A-A-A-A-AA-HHHHHH!!!!!!""But then, this isn't exactly fair to a book that actually does have some legitimately smart advice to impart, even if it is wrapped mostly around the kind of Bushist late-capitalism U!S!A! assh-le rah-rah horsesh-t that makes the rest of the world hate us (it's no surprise, for example, that this first came out exactly one year before the Financial Meltdown of 2008); for example, the whole reason I read this in the first place is because it was passionately recommended to me by a vagabond internet pen-pal of mine, a perpetually broke hippie-style constant world traveler who's about as far away from a Naperville soccer mom as you get, yet intensely loves this book just as much as that soccer mom does. And like I said, that's because this how-to guide from motivational speaker and martial-arts champion (!) Timothy Ferriss actually does contain some quite great common-sense advice about life and how to live it better, if that is you can separate it from the Randomly Capitalized Buzz Terms (TM) that choke this manuscript like the plague: for one example, he rightly argues that the very concept of ""rich"" is by definition a relative term, a word that many middle-classers automatically equate with ""freedom,"" ""security"" and ""excitement"" when in fact these are all separate concepts, and that you don't necessarily have to be a millionaire to have such ""rich person"" experiences as hiring private planes to take you to your vacation in a homey bungalow on a tropical island, as long as you're not too picky about the size of that plane and the location of that island. Combine this then with such other practical advice as setting up automated revenue streams in your life as much as possible (which like I said can be interpreted pessimistically if you want, but could also mean something as innocent and creative as iPhone apps and Etsy stores), and it's easy to see why this has become the big hot book in the last couple of years among the perpetual millions who dream of ""Zero Management (TM),"" ""Income Autopilot (TM),"" ""Mini-Retirement (TM)"" lives. Often silly but at least a brisk read, this is one of those titles to check out of the library and quickly scan through on a rainy weekend (or even better, just read its Wikipedia entry and be done with it).Out of 10: 7.5 "
36,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/622976-joy,2,"So glad I got this book from the library. If I'd purchased the book I would have felt cheated out of money, not just time. Really, this is a book with a great title but it's more a brag book. There was so much talk of self indulgence, living the 'rock star life'. So much talk in fact , it is almost laughable at page 272 he devotes 4 paragraphs to service. Which he defines as ""doing something that improves life besides your own."" It was a lame afterthought.In my opinion - using Mr. Ferriss's 4-Hour Workweek principles - he would not allow for a spouse, children or family. I guess the jet-set 'New Rich' can have it's limitations."

SO many people who are moving to far-flung locations so they can enjoy their life, etc. I'm curious and slightly envious. Now I get it - they are all reading this book! The basic idea is to move to a low cost area (or country) and then find some entrepreneurial job that can be done remotely in four hours a week. Plus the real secret is that you hire a virtual assistant in India for $5/hour to do all your work.Also, you are supposed to stop checking your email so much. So maybe you live somewhere with not-great internet so you can only be on the computer four hours a week and your assistant does everything?Is this really a viable plan? If so, someone please report back."
39,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24866027-will-once,2,"It's an outrageous claim - you can escape the 9 to 5, live anywhere and be rich ... and all by working just four hours a week. Can it possibly be true?Well, yes and no. The trick (according to this book) is to sell something to lots of people for far more than it's worth. What we have here, my friends, is the spammer's bible.The secret of this book is buried in the middle in a chapter called ""income autopilot I"". The idea is to sell something that doesn't have much of a production cost, say a website or an ebook. To do this you need to become an expert. But don't worry. Apparently you don't have to become much of an expert. You simply need to know more than your target market and appear to be credible.In my print copy, the secret is on page 168. There are three main ways to get ""expert status"":1. Create the content yourself, often by paraphrasing and combining points from several books on her topic;2. Repurpose content that is in the public domain3. License content or compensate an expert.In other words, cheat. Pretend to be an expert when you are not. Steal other people's work. Sell second-hand substandard pap to a gullible audience. Apparently ""expert status can be gained in less than 4 weeks"". Yeah, right. The next time I want a doctor or a dentist, I'll ask for one with only four weeks training. I'm sure that will be fine.The rest of the book is how to manage time and sell this wafer thin content. Set up your website and lie back on a tropical island as the profits roll in.Hmm. It is at this point that anyone with an ounce of common sense will spot the fatal flaw. This sort of trick will work and does work for a short amount of time and for a small number of people. In these infant days of the internet, people are still finding niches where they can sell this phoney content. But the niches don't last forever. The trick is only a short-term thing. Sooner or later a real expert will wander along and kick all the wannabe experts into touch. We also find that phoney experts compete against phoney experts. There are big bucks to be made from the first to try this sort of spammery, but it won't last indefinitely.So why the 2 star ""It's okay"" rating? Why am I not ragging this book with a one star ""It's rubbish"" rating?That's because there are some good ideas in this book. They are no doubt stolen from other people, but there are some nuggets in there. Things like outsourcing much of your life, saying no, the pareto principle, Parkinson's law. You have to read through the breathlessly hyper prose, but if you persevere there are some ideas here that could be adapted to a more honest lifestyle.You probably won't be able to give up the 9 to 5 but if you follow some of the more honest ideas you should be more effective and happier in that 9 to 5.Just don't expect a four hour week, unless you are prepared to be an ace spammer. And even then don't expect it to last forever.2 stars. Doesn't deliver on its main promise, but there are some good ideas. Probably stolen. Maybe one to buy if you don't mind handling stolen goods."
40,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16337783-eugenia-turculet,5,"*Spoiler Alert*This book is not about working 4 hours and making a living out of it. However, it is useful if one wants to optimize time and other resources in life in order to design a lifestyle that overcomes the 9 to 5 anguish. 3 main ideas I took from this book:1. Mini retirements, or 1 month to a few years long vacations are not only desirable; they're necessary for reminding one's self the purpose of living, the importance of learning(be it a language, an instrument or making wine) and the relativity of the things we deem important.2. Everybody is wasting time, so instead of admiring people that are always busy, we should admire those that have the right priorities and get to their goals the most effectively.3. Being rich is not about money, it's about personal freedom. Regardless of one's career, not being locked to a single place, social circle or source of income is crucial in creating a life that is fulfilling and meaningful. Being rich shouldn't be a source of guilt, neither should be the path towards being rich, because only when we enjoy our lives, we are able to inspire other people towards achieving their goals and adopting a lifestyle that gives more for less."
41,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33637824-thomas,5,"The 4-Hour Workweek by Timothy Ferris is an impressive culmination of years of trial and error and quantifiable results. The entire read has zero fluff. In fact, Mr. Ferris' work is so substantial it could be considered a reference piece and not a casual read. I started by reading the summary edition, then an out-dated hardback copy I picked up used. The contents of the entire book were so compelling that I purchased the newest and expanded edition right away. It's notable that most of Timothy's focus is on changing the readers mind concerning societal models for work, play, finance, and most importantly, retirement. Your thinking must change first or the rest won't work. This book has effectively encapsulated the very real potential of the internet revolution and it's limitless possibilities. Congratulations to Timothy Ferris for a very helpful and eye-opening recounting of his experience and techniques. I've begun following his blogs and podcasts also and find them just as informative and helpful. If you give credence to my opinion at all, definitely read The 4-Hour Workweek by Timothy Ferris right away. Really. Right now."

The first 1/4 of the book is filler...plenty of little tidbits and setting the stage with the author going on and on [and ON AND ON AND ON] about his tango dancing or trip here or eating there...like anyone cares! Do yourself a favor and skip 80% of the book while looking for the 20% that has anything whatsoever of value to add.The author makes a big to-do about the 80/20 rule...yeah, it's worth mentioning but is that really new? Then he goes on to waste 80% of your time by droning on for what could have taken only 20%. The rest of the garbage is a tirade about his own self to the point of tedium."

It comes up often from friends who think they're going to find some get-rich quick scheme and game the system. I guess when I look back at the aggregate group of folks that have hyped this book, it ultimately makes sense. Their personalities are often aligned with Ferriss' and that's not necessarily a compliment.If you work a purely sales role, this book might be tempting, especially if you are ok sacrificing integrity in the process. But if you work anything beyond a remedial job, this book may not work for you. How does Ferriss propose anyone achieve a true 4-hour work week? He hires virtual assistants, lies to his main employer about how much he works after getting permission to work remotely, and uses dropship tactics to sell goods online.Maybe it's because I have a background in insurance but my mind only went to the risks of this proposition (even if your job was such that it fit this type of model). A short list of questions that came to mind:- How is your boss not going to notice that you work on a totally different time window due to the timezone difference?- How do you program a virtual assistant to have the years of background knowledge you do, to answer questions only you could answer given your business accumen?- How is your employer not going to realize you're overseas especially when it comes time to file taxes - How much is Ferriss' liability insurance for his various businesses and the risk of lawsuit when you have a virtual assistant doing your bidding?- How does London make the cut of a cheap place to 'semi-retire' and live abroad?- Why would Ferriss think someone could pull off this level of a scheme but not know that they should probably google currency trade rates before calculating cost of living abroad? That's 5th grade level common sense.In other areas the book just felt outdated- I googled a few of the websites Ferriss mentions and most look like they haven't been updated since the 1990s, could be smart money saving move on their part, but made me think that the sites just weren't that great and thus couldn't afford basic UI upgrades that are nearly free these days with the likes of squarespace- Mentions not bringing a computer abroad, and that you should use a virtual machine to log into your home computer in the US - without ever mentioning where your computer would be hooked up since he said you should move all of your belongings into storage - and BTW this could be grounds for firing if you work for any high-level security company such as within the healthcare industry.I've gotten a little lost in the weeds here, but the book is just off-putting. And Ferriss' whole premise is that you can cheat your way into hacking life. Other reviewers have done better than me in summarizing why this is so slimy. If you are 'this good' at your job, you're probably due for a promotion. Get yourself into a job that can't be automated, that is the best bet for long-term job security. Or completely get out of the rat race all together and go be a nomad in Thailand who can lay on the beach all day for very little. This idea that Ferriss proposed with virtual assistants is just dumb and reflects his character more than anything.I know several people in real life who are like Tim Ferriss, who are preoccupied not in actually becoming an expert or legitimately skilled in anything, but only care about how they are perceived, the true 'fake it till you make it' folks who actually never get to the make it part, and live in perpetual fake-it. But every common connection I have with them sees right through it too. They're not actually fooling anyone, they're alienating themselves from the world and burning bridges in their wake, ruining relationships with people who will never want to work with them again."

Add 50 examples of wildly successful people (most of whom have no last names), and you have a formula for a bestseller.This much of the formula isn't too inimical and would place this book among the rank-and-file of its genre. However, the formula for success that this book prescribes entails either starting a turnkey operation or else making yourself unneeded at the workplace without leaving clues to indicate your disposability.What really turns me off of this book, though, is the author's values. Cheating your employer, slandering the Japanese, refusing to learn the alphabet in kindergarten… These things are all portrayed as earmarks of success.Ferriss decries meaningless marks of success, but multiple times he vaunts his victory in the Chinese national kickboxing tournament, a victory won by finding loopholes in the rules instead of by actually kickboxing. Hardly a meaningful victory."

Maybe it would examine some big questions! Is the work we're doing at our 9 to 5 really necessary to the world? How can we change current labor laws to improve the worker's quality of life? Is the cost of living keeping people from taking time off work? And why should people ever have to work more than one job, anyway?Well, no! None of that! Instead it was basically about how you, an individual who wants to drink champagne and live in a ski chalet covered in coconut oil at all times, can live your lavish lifestyle until death by outsourcing your actual work to other people in developing countries and paying them less than their labor is worth. There were some other frills, too, like how to How to Become a Top Expert in 4 Weeks, How to Look Fortune 500 in 45 Minutes, etc. etc. But TLDR you can have it all if you keep other people poor—something everyone knows already."

You're part of the few who get to experience this again for the first time!Tim Ferriss redefines what it means to 'work' in a 9-5 grind. While most of the book is anecdotes from Tim's own journey, there is so much to gleam from this book.Firstly, the '4-Hour' is an exaggeration, Tim Ferriss even acknowledges this - it's just part of the shock-factor marketing that catches the eye. The entire last chapter really summarizes this eloquently - it's not about reducing the overall 'work hours', but rather increasing the efficiency of work in the least amount of time possible - what matters most is enjoying the time you put into anything, work or otherwise.This is definitely one of the top 5 books that I can safely say provided me with a paradigm shift.4.48 / 5"
47,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5299935-alexander-fedyunin,2,"Maybe there are a few good ideas, but when you are reading about ""stop read some boring books"", or ""those books which waste you time"", the best idea is to stop now with that book. So I've done at at 25%. Enough."
48,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5818273-alex,4,"By the end of this book I felt Tim Ferriss to be almost a kindred spirit. As a meta-learner myself, the how-to sections of this book on creating a passive income stream were far more in depth than I would have expected (though I do wonder how well those same companies are performing now, 8 years after this book has given them such high profile publicity).Will the directions in this book lead to freedom from the 9-5 rut and free up tens of hours of your week to spend on more fulfilling pursuits? Absolutely they will. Will most people who read this book follow those directions? Absolutely they will not. But that shouldn't be taken as a negative against the book. It is more a comment on most people's abilities to follow through with their goals to realise their greatest potential.The main take-aways from this book are that self-discipline and religious application of a few insightful principles will improve your personal and professional life immensely. In a nut shell these are: the 80/20 rule, Parkinson's Law, the power of outsourcing cognitively menial tasks, and absolute vs relative income.The 80/20 rule is that 80% of X comes from 20% of Y. In one case, X might be your gross profit, and Y would be your customers. X could also be customer complaints. The rule is ambivalent to positive or negative application. Once you recognise this and make a judgement call that being rich in time is both more fulfilling and productive than being rich in money, you can prune the 20% bad clients or 20% poor revenue streams or 80% most unproductive hours of your day and come out ahead. The learning outcome here is that sheer absolute dollars values in your bank account aren't the sole measure of success, nor should they be.Parkinson's Law is a compliment to the 80/20 rule: work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion. But the converse is also true, that work contracts to fill time as well. Nothing hones the mind's priorities and creativity more than an impending deadline. Keep this in mind when giving deadlines to others and especially to yourself. Don't give a week to complete a task when a day would suffice; don't give a day when two hours will suffice. A major theme of the book is outsourcing of tasks that take up mental RAM without paying their way for the attention they eat up. Tasks such as scheduling appointments, replying to email, and repetitive work that just requires any old set of two hands to get the work done, but not necessarily yours. Hire a virtual assistant (VA) in the developing world from a company with a delightful name like Your Man In India to do it for you at a fraction of the cost you're getting paid to do the work yourself. The time freed up by outsourcing your less cognitively demanding work is then meant to be repurposed to more emotionally and financially rewarding pursuits. Admittedly, this will apply to some professions more than others. Like much of this book it's aimed more at middle-management white-collar professions as a target demographic, but people in other walks of life will be able to adapt it for their purposes in creative ways also. The last big idea is absolute vs relative income. Take two hypothetical people, Vince and David. Vince works 10-15 hours per week and earns $40,000 per year. David works 80-100 hours per week and earns $200,000 per year. Who is richer: Vince or David? By the standard definition of 'rich', David is clearly richer to the tune of $160,000 annually. But Ferriss isn't talking about being rich in absolute dollar amounts. He refers to a concept of the 'new rich', people who are rich in time. Perhaps Vince has a passive income stream (a 'muse') that requires minimal upkeep, and steadily grows due to online word of mouth. Vince's income isn't tethered to his physical presence or effort in order to sustain it, and will make him $40,000 every year so long as his product is desirable. David on the other hand may have a highly stressful job that is unfulfilling, requires his physical presence, and is difficult to outsource. Furthermore, the ephemeral nature of Vince's online business allows him to be 'in his office' anywhere in the world so long as he has a smart phone or a laptop. David's might require him to be in a building in a single city in the world, and the terms of his employment may keep him there for years at a time. In terms of free time and autonomy to self-develop and explore the world, Vince is clearly richer than David, and likely a much more self-actualised individual. Whose blood pressure would you rather have?The last chapter of the book covers how to deal with the existential angst that might creep in once you've achieved the dream and severed yourself from the bonds of compensation-for-physical-effort. Removing work doesn't automatically make you happy. It leaves a void of 40-100 hours a week of free time in its place. Without carefully planning your 'escape' you could find yourself horribly depressed. All in all, I found this book to be a great read. There's a lot to learn in here, and more about self-discipline than you might think from the cover. Ferriss is a post-dotcom millionaire, and his success seems entirely replicable if the standard entrepreneurial advice is followed: find a need, and fill it. Clearly there's much more to it than that in the details, else we'd all be rich (or 'new rich'), but the broad strokes are sound. Even if you don't manage to escape the 9-5 completely, if your job lends itself to a remote-working arrangement, there's a chapter on how to convince your boss to let you work from home. You're not going to be the next Larry Page, or create the next AirBnB, but being rich doesn't have to mean a 9-figure bank account. It might mean $50,000 per year in passive income. A YouTube account with 100,000 subscribers earns USD$100 in a single day in ad-revenue alone. If you're using that exposure to sell a product you can exceed this by a factor of ten or more. Being sponsored by companies like Audible, or directly by fans through Patreon, are other ways of bridging the gap until your revenue stream is replacing your weekly wage."
49,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2622717-hal,2,"So here's what Ferriss suggests in a nutshell:1. Take stock of your life and possibilities and conquer your fears by naming them.2. Optional: If you are an employee, use time management techniques to increase productivity and negotiate a remote working agreement, to avoid having to do nine-to-five face time.3. Use your copious new-found free time to start a profitable company.4. Treat said company to ruthless automation and outsourcing so that it runs itself.5. Bazinga.The book hits you so hard in the face with pep talk and all the miraculous things you can do with your life after you've made it to step 5 that it's not clear at first sight why we shouldn't all be able to pull it off. In my case, explaining the book to a friend helped:It all hinges on step 3. Neither Mr. Ferriss nor anyone else in this fair world has the magic recipe for starting a successful company, and his advice on this is sometimes insightful (aim for a $50-200 product price tag to weed out the annoying, hard-to-service bargain-seeking customers as well as the equally care-intensive high-end customers), often mundane (aim for a high markup) and sometimes downright ridiculous (make an information-based rather than a hardware product because the former is harder to copy -- excuse me?).My guess is that Ferriss had the overworked and over-worried successful entrepreneur in mind for this book (aka himself a few years ago), someone who already has built a profitable company -- and with that premise the remaining message makes perfect sense: stop being a control freak, remove yourself as a decision bottleneck by empowering your employees, embrace minor screw-ups as inevitable. Take your money and enjoy life. Bravo! Good message, good vision, not very novel or surprising but solidly argued.Hence my tip: Get advice elsewhere on how to start a successful company, and once you've got this going, come back to Ferriss' lessons.Oh, and don't read this book if you have high moral standards or similar baggage: However hard he tries to come across as your friendly neighbourhood writerman, Ferriss lacks the humor and self-reflection to notice when he's just being a jerk. Example in case: In the beginning of the book, he proudly recounts how he rigged his grades at college: first exam that came back with less than a stellar mark, harrass your professor for many hours on end with painstaking questions -- to understand exactly what the professor expects in the future, and to make him think twice before giving you a less than perfect grade again. Respect Mr Ferriss, you must be so proud of yourself and your ingenuity. What a revolutionary insight, to break free of this cumbersome limitation of fairness. If only everyone was as smarty-pants as you are, our societies would be better off.*Comments while reading*- First 20 pages or so: Example after example of people who've freed themselves from 40+ hour work obligations to travel the world and live high life. Very nice, but I want to know: How did they make it happen?- Then, Ferris exposes his main points of how and why to make the 4h workweek happen. Sounds good, can't wait for the details!- Even though he doesn't like to call it time management, he goes on at length about how to manage your time, minimise interruptions, and so on. This has been covered in detail elsewhere and well before (""Never Check E-Mail in the Morning"" and its brethren) *yawn*- The part about (mostly Indian) Virtual Assistants is interesting. I am lacking a bit of perspective here, though. I get the impression more and more that Ferris' approach is amoral in the Kantian sense: If all'd be doing as he says, the system would collapse.- Ferris recommends using geo-arbitrage and third-world wages to get the grind work done and reap the benefits at good value-for-money ratios, but what happens as third-world wages and living cost catch up with ours?- Overall, there is a strong undercurrent of ""gaming the system"" here, which I don't particularly like.- These blog posts tacked to the end for the expanded edition are quite a fashion theses days, and a nuisance if you ask me: the entries suffer from common blog ailments, such as being only loosely related to one another, not thought through and in need of editing, while lacking the one blog standout feature of being fresh news."
50,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/111566858-greta,1,"The four-Hour Workweek is a self-help book by Timothy Ferriss, which deals with what Ferriss refers to as ""lifestyle design"" from the usual path of work life to retirement.He claims, that we are wrong in our perception of having to work all our life's just to retire when we are older. Instead we should space out work intervals with vacation intervals all through our life and use outsourcing and delegation to passively make money to finance the entire thing, while working ourselves as little as possible. Becoming the ""new rich"".I do credit Ferriss for the creativity of engaging in this mind game - but that is really all it is. Tim Ferriss was thirty years old when he wrote the book, an elite graduate from Princeton University, who was making money like crazy and building immense financial securities. He claims that he was unhappy with his work life and felt overworked, which is why he introduces the idea of planning mini retirements.With that he plays to the unhappiness, fears and fantasies of people mostly in the middle class and completely ignores that our entire economy is build on them, not bailing on their work but sticking to their responsibilities. Other than acknowledging their effort, Ferriss basically pities them for showing up every day, not abandoning their families and giving back to the society.Ferriss introduces many fictional questions to ask yourself, to find your real passions and the fears that hold you back from realizing them - arguing that the worse outcome isn‘t as bad as you think and reversible, but the examples he provides are delusional. He is a jung, rich and independent man, providing a freedom, others simply don‘t have. He has no idea about the true losses and reachable goals of others.He does have good points on time managment:He introducing the Pareto principle, claiming that 80% of the effects are caused by 20% of the effort and distinguishes between being effective and being efficient. He talks about the known fact that we always need as much time as we have, the importance of priorities and the danger of multitasking. But those are not his ideas and much better discussed in other books.One of the things that struck me the most was his promotion of selective ignorance.He purposely doesn't read non-fiction books or watches the news. He claims that everything that wouldn’t affect our success in this very second, would be completely irrelevant. Three days before voting, he consults friends on their opinions, asks some strangers in a foreign country who they would vote for, watches the TV duell and is happy with his complete shallow, non-reflected and third party based vote. He has a degree from an elite University he doesn't even understand democracy.Then he praises the goal of outspacing and delegating your task to underpaid Indian workers, playing hard on globalization and completely ignoring the effects on the local economy, not to talk about Indian work conditions. In the rest of the book he goes on in depth about giving detailed advice on how you can scam your employer into making this all work, which steps exactly you have to plan to cheat and lie yourself through life. When you don‘t work yet, or not in an environment that fits to his description-it makes completely no sense, otherwise it‘s just highly unethical.I can‘t really take this book serious. No one want‘s work for work sake, but the guidelines Ferriss introduces aren‘t the answer and highly hypocritical. By looking at it with a lot of abstraction, you can find some underlying inspirational thoughts on doing more of what makes you happy and making it a more fundamental part of your life and work choices. That‘s fine - But over all I was more annoyed."
51,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/676310-joy,3,"I received Timothy Ferriss’ hot, new bestseller “The 4-Hour Workweek” for Christmas and, cautiously optimistic, proceeded to read what I hoped would not be yet another rendition of a worthless get rich quick scheme. While at times a bit pompous for my taste, I found the author succeeded to deliver readers a realistic, executable plan that, with the right amount of effort, could actually work. Unlike many others who have taken their stab at the genre, Ferriss does not package a timeless, one size fits all solution. Instead, he urges readers to assess their personal goals and systematically assess, through use of tools and templates in the book and on the sister website, what exactly it is that prevents realization of those goals. What I found most compelling is that he does this within a context that challenges the widely accepted retirement framework that the vast majority of us submit to today. With the advent of the internet and globalization, Ferriss maintains that the employable population is increasingly being filled with people who no longer are satisfied with the school, work 30+ years, and then retire model. Unlike our parents and grandparents, who were largely concerned with maintaining a stable 9-5 job and saving money for retirement, Ferriss argues that the younger generations crave more of a work-life balance in every day life. Ferriss proposes a solution to those who want to join what he calls the “New Rich,” whom the internet and other human advances have made into very curious beings, who demand more flexibility, and who have figured out how to travel now, not 30+ years down the line. The goal is not to save the world, but to maintain a steady cash flow to support a more balanced life filled with things like shorter, more productive work schedules and “mini-retirements.” The main point of the book is to actually do the exercises and complete the templates in order to figure out your own personal path to freedom. However, once that is all said and done, the real challenge is coming up with that cash cow idea that will support your new lifestyle. Ferriss suggests going into the products versus service industry, as providing a service is typically a more time-consuming endeavor. He even gives marketing, pricing and supply chain tips to set you on your way. Overall, I was impressed with Ferriss’ unconventional stance and determination to not only live a more balanced life, but help others do the same."
52,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3907888-anthony,2,"This guy is an major a-hole with a few smart ideas. As another reviewer put it: this book is like being trapped on an airplane sitting next to a bi-polar business dude, going through his manic phase. His advice to the world is basically to imitate himself, make some dough and travel. but don't do any work, just out-source it all to India. I am not kidding. He does offer a handful of good time-saving advice. Stuff like ""don't check your email too often."" But really his message boils down to: you should start selling some crap online, preferably the kind of junk that you see on informercials like ginsu knifes, blu blocker sunglasses, exercise vitamins etc. A load of junk basically. So, if that's your sort of thing and easy $ is the bottom line then this is a 5 star book for you. Otherwise, it's kind of depressing, BUT it does give you a lot of insight into how a business person thinks, and what it's like to have zero scruples. The funniest/saddest part of the book comes near the end, where in a strange and awkward chapter the author blurts that really all along he just wanted to be a writer not a businessman. And that once you make your fortune, you too may be wracked with strange feelings of boredom, ennui, and a curiosity about the meaning of life, and ""what does it all mean?"" but that it's best not to think about such questions because they cannot be answered.*One interesting note: scanning other reviews I notice that again and again people write stuff like ""It's hard to like this book because immediately you just don't like the author."" I've never see that in a review before, this guy get's that every other review. I bet he is lonely. Despite all of the motorcycles he races and cities he goes to."
53,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/164828-todd-mitchell,4,"It took me less than a week to read even the expanded version of 4-Hour Work Week. This wasn't for lack of content, but for a combination of speed-reading reminders and rants about focus and Getting Things Done (GTD). In all honesty, I started this book with ill intentions. I'm often skeptical of anything too many people get excited about and author Tim Ferriss fits the bill. Still, I figured if I wanted to bag on the guy I was going to do the homework first. I'm glad I did. While I don't buy into all of Ferriss' ideas, the book was a real page-turner. It's almost a perfect split of legitimate ideas you can use to increase productivity and stories of success and attainable luxury that invoke feelings similar to if you were reading about Narnia. I love the idea of dropping the excuses and doing what you've always wanted, but I've done more of these wild bucket list items than many and I don't totally agree with the level of ease the book describes. Further, if the typical employee tried many of the virtual assistant/remote work ideas presented in these pages they may very well be dismissed and perhaps even prosecuted. I certainly couldn't get away with it in my government contracting job but I couldn't have pulled it off in my prior high-security IT positions either. The author admits the techniques aren't for everyone, I would guess they aren't for that many people at all. These things said, don't put me in the haters category. I'm behind the spirit and intentions of this book. After finishing it, I don't even mind the trend of young professionals looking to Ferriss as a sort of role model, having seen where his heart is. "
54,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/274099-ruben,4,"Hmmm. What an interesting book! I've seen tons of criticism about this book, mostly centered on the unrealistic tasks Ferriss challenges you with. That's my favorite aspect of this book: that status quo is status boring, and you should do your dreams today instead of when you retire. We don't try new things because we know that the old things work. But if you're sick of the old thing, it's lame to say, ""Well, 28 more years and I can go anywhere and do anything."" Is it practical? Yes, if you do it. The nitty-gritty--the part where he talks about starting up a small company to fund your dreams--will either excite you or bore you. I haven't done this yet, so I can't say whether his professional advice works or not. His other points, about emphasizing your strengths, is helpful. I've been wanting to study Chinese, but I never got past the second lesson in my book because I have no real use for it. On the other hand, I've already gotten past that point in Portuguese (I started two days ago) because it builds on my familiarity with Spanish and French, and there's a Brazilian student in my class who I can practice with.It's not the kind of book that's going to be helpful for everyone, as opposed to something like Getting Things Done, but you'll certainly find something here that'll change your perspective for the better."

The book provides an almost exhaustive list of the tools, resources, and strategies necessary to do something with your life NOW.One amazing quote by Joseph Campbell Tim Ferriss cites toward the end of the book really gave me the jolt:""People say that what we're all seeking is a meaning for life. I don't think that's what we're really seeking. I think that what we're seeking is an experience of being alive.""Get out of the 9-to-5 grind. Don't put off your dreams.

Why should we wait until we are old to enjoy what life has to offer?I like the idea of taking a month or two off and exploring something new, interesting and educational. This can be done individually and as a family. I also thought Ferriss' time saving tips can be applied not only to a work, but even to running a household. I didn't really agree with his values and how life is great when you are living like a rock star in South America, but to each their own."

Most of the 'mobility' tips do not apply in my case, since I happen to live AND earn in one of those 'ridiculously cheap' countries.There was no little escaping from this book. Since I have a work/ organisation/ near burnout crisis each year in June (comes with the territory), I tend to google for tips and motivation, and The 4-Hour Work Week reached me in small, irritating snippets. 1. The principles seemed tempting, but unenforceable in my profession, as evidenced by numerous comments on the irrelevance of the Pareto Principle in education. You just have to put in the hours, even if you do that by Skype; most of the valid exams need to take place in teacher's presence; you can't tell 80% of your students to just get lost; on most levels of education, 'automation' such as peer assessment simply doesn't work (on others, it can be used, but will not replace teacher's assessment). The ugly: some issues just can't be dealt with ""intensively"" - as evidenced by joking, but telling questions on the author's on the release date of The 4-hour Baby.The good: Ferriss' elimination tips are quite inspiring even to non entrepreneurs. They're good reminders to not increase one's workload automatically and unreflexively, as teachers often do. In the words of Anne Taintor:http://s30.postimg.org/f5qt0jw5t/magn...I decided to implement some of the ideas I previously had that would make students more responsible for their learning and material preparation (with me interfering and supplementing whatever information they might have left out, that is). I also thought I might revise class rules as a set of basic rules + Frequently Asked Questions in an attempt to make them more independent. 2. Something about the approach to work this books represents seems, frankly speaking, immoral to me, and not just me. This piece by Penelope Trunk is a classic by now: http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2009/01...This piece by Jennifer Dziura https://medium.com/get-bullish/a5e5f4... is much more recent and contains a sentence that says it all:If you seem to be “getting everything you want,” you should probably examine whether you’re getting it at someone’s expense, or whether you’re just constantly, in small ways, making the world worse.3. When I was a kid, I read and anthology of science fiction stories, including a story (I can't recall the title) about a society of the future in which people removed the obstacle of the decision making process (the decisions in it are taken instantly, which results in living an equivalent of an action-packed lifetime in just one night. Tim Ferriss reminds me of the protagonist, as his aim seems to be to live as many lives as possible in one lifetime. Somewhat unsurprisingly, I remember his blog post about his panic attacks (which I can't locate now), which somehow makes sense. To be fair, he also urges the reader to slow down and savour life, but somehow hmm.The (completely unexpected) good:- 'It is vain to do with more what can be done with less."" - William of Ockham; not a a bad motto to work by.- I was surprised by his stress on do-gooding, volunteering and making donations.- Dreamlining - I was surprised by how much my dreams are time-dependent instead of money-dependent.Now, I think, time to read this, for balance: In Praise of Slowness: Challenging the Cult of Speed"

Tim Ferriss discusses real, practical strategies for cutting loose from the traditional working world, and living a lifestyle with less work, more time for important things, and the ability to travel the world.I liked this book quite a bit. I'm not sure how useful most of it will be to me, but it sure makes me dream about what *could* be. ""If only I had an idea for a business...""Mr. Ferriss not only provides philosophical and psychological reasons for getting your employer to let you work at home, but he talks about how to set up your own business that requires minimal interaction and will be able to support you as you live in different countries.I had only two problems with this book:1) While Mr. Ferriss rightly disparages working your ass off so you can enjoy your retirement (referring to it as ""deferred life""), he does seem to make the assumption that you'll be able to alternate work and ""mini-retirements"" forever. Frankly, I'm guessing that when I'm 75, I'm not going to be terribly effective at working at all. I'm disappointed by his lack of consideration for care during my waning years. Maybe he's a proponent of ice floes?2) Tim Ferriss's biggest fan is Tim Ferriss. It was a bit unseemly how often he talked about how great he was. I understand that he's trying to convince us that if he could do it, we could too, but I'm tired of hearing about how he won a tango competition, dined at 5-star restaurants, or practices martial arts. If his personality in real life is anything like he comes across in the book, I suspect that I wouldn't get a word in edgewise if we were hanging out.Ok, bonus problem: He uses the term ""muse"" to refer to ""an automated vehicle for generating cash without consuming time"". Every time he uses it, it's jarring, because I know what the term actually means.Anyway, those faults aside, this book contained tons of great information for entrepreneurs and people who are looking to cut loose from the daily grind. Lots of great information here. Highly recommended for anyone who has ever had dreams of doing something different with their work life."
66,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28646-bryan,4,"I had been reluctant to read this as I assumed it was written by a spoiled and out-of-touch entrepreneur. Recently, however, a friend pointed out to me that an author I liked had been on Ferris' podcast. I listened and enjoyed the conversation they had. I continued listening to subsequent episodes, and decided that in spite of my irrational prejudice, I was starting to like him more and more. This book is a bit dated now, and does in places come off as brash and irritating, yet it's quite positive and an open challenge to live life on one's own terms. As a result it's inspirational, and it gives some insight into how differently people can think about risks and resources. In certain ways I wish I'd read it earlier, as it would likely have saved me a few years spent obeying societal dictates in a career to which I was not particularly suited. But I think without the good impression left by the compassionate and sometimes fascinating interviews Ferris does on his podcast, I might have been less receptive to the book's tone."
67,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18908489-alexander-svanevik,4,"Hard to rate.No doubt, this book has had a huge impact on many people's lives. I personally know people who have basically changed their entire lifestyle after reading Tim Ferriss' book.I read it in Spanish, so I won't comment on the language.Stating the obvious, the title doesn't really deliver on its promise. However, that doesn't mean there isn't plenty of practical advice on how to question (and perhaps improve) your own lifestyle.The hardest part for me to swallow is the total inconsideration of other people that Ferriss has. Waste other people's time so you can save yours? Go for it. The world simply wouldn't work if everyone acted according to Ferriss' advise.The strongest parts of the book are 1) the focus on essentialism, and 2) the questions the author asks you to ask yourself, and the exercises he recommends.All in all, this is a modern classic packed with practical advise which is worth the read. But please take the advise with a pinch of salt."
68,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14858185-steven,2,"For the most part, this book is fake. There are a few decent delegation and time saving tips, but you don't succeed by working 4 hours a week or 40 but 60-80 hours a week. Otherwise, you just get left behind by those who do."
69,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/557179-jocelyn-bailey,3,"My bizarre love affair with business and self-help books continues! The first time I saw this book, it lay on the desk of a ridiculous person who somehow clearly hated working but also made his life much, much harder by attempting to do everyone else’s jobs in addition to his own. Maybe he really did need this book. But as far as I know, he continued to micromanage everyone despite this book’s best takeaway being the “art” of delegation. I decided to download the audio of this book after listening to the BY THE BOOK episodes about it. I’ve had a rough time staying on top of my work lately and hoped maybe I could get a helpful word or two about getting things done. Boy did I get a word. 4-HOUR WW is equal parts ridiculous, genius, and unintentionally entertaining. The audiobook reader’s voice stressed me out beyond belief, but I loved it. Useful aspects of this book include the discussion of Parkinson’s Law (absolutely true), the 80/20 rule, the time-suckage of email, and generally useful points about the kinds of customers that aren’t worth having. There is some wisdom here. But ultimately, most working people—whether small business owners or corporate employees like me—cannot take most of these steps and wouldn’t have the means to do so anyway. That many people take actual satisfaction in their work and that many employers view their employees as more than human drones are truths completely glossed over. And it should go without saying that if everyone approached their work life this way, then capitalism would fail faster than a speeding bullet. Wait a minute...Is capitalism a Ponzi scheme?This book also got weirdly existential in the end, but I’ll leave that one mostly alone. I didn’t really sign up to get “meaning of life” advice from Tim Ferriss, kickboxing “expert” and meditation extraordinaire; but I suppose if you’re willing to take and leave parts of this book (which I clearly am), it’s not a bad thing to be reminded that you are more than the job you do. This book has no balance whatsoever, but whatever. I laughed a lot while listening and putting together my patio furniture. And maybe I will try to check email fewer times during the day."
70,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41350064-juli-hoffman,5,"This book does NOT teach you how to be a millionaire. If you're looking for THAT book, keep walking. This book DOES teach that wealth isn't all about money, it's about creating time to do the things you love. There's an example of a fisherman in this book. He doesn't have much in the way of material things, but every day he gets to hang out with his friends and family. He fishes a little. He takes an afternoon nap with his wife. He plays in a band in the evening. He's living like he's retired while he's young enough to enjoy it. This man is NOT a millionaire, but he's rich in the things that matter. This is the ""New Rich."" They are everyday people who are getting out of their comfort zones in order to enjoy life NOW, rather than waiting until the end of their days.I took away a lot of good ideas from this book and it did give me the courage to try some new things in my own career. A few years ago, My husband and I took a step back from the workoholic path. We don't make as much money as before, but our quality of life is much better. For years I've been playing around with some ideas to bring a little passive income into our household. This book gave me the courage to pursue this goal. Will I succeed? I have no idea! I do know that I'd rather live for experiences, time with the people I love, rather than killing myself trying to earn enough money to buy more things.Thanks, Tm Ferriss, for sharing your journey!"
71,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42182887-sipho,3,"This contemporary classic is a manifesto for lifestyle design. The thesis is simple: you can live like a millionaire, without actually being one. The 4 Hour Work Weeks touches on a variety of topics including automation, offshoring, delegation, minimalism and productivity. Key Takeaways  Definitions The New Rich have a different mindset to the typical employee or business owner. The New Rich: - have others work for them - distribute recovery periods and adventures (mini-retirements) throughout life - recognize that inactivity is not the goal and instead prioritise doing what excites them - focus on establishing a steady cash flow first, and then a big payday later.Everything popular is wrongRetirement is worst-case scenario insurance. Interest and energy are cyclical - alternate between work and rest. Doing less is not being lazy. The New Rich measure their contribution in results, not time. Laziness isn’t working less; laziness is letting circumstances define your life for you. The timing is never right. Whatever you want to do someday, just do it now. Ask for forgiveness, not permission. Emphasize your strengths, don’t fix weaknesses - this often provides a multiplier effect, while trying to fix weaknesses typically leads to only incremental improvement.Money alone is not the solution but relative income is more important than absolute income. Relative income measures both time and money. A person working 10 hours a week and making $10,000 is richer than someone working 80 hours a week and making $100,000. Embrace good stress instead of avoiding stress altogether.Most people are convinced they can only accomplish mediocre things. There is therefore more competition for mediocre goals. Elimination 80% of results come from 20% of actions. Ask yourself the following questions what 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness and what 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness?Be difficult when it matters - eg when it comes to protecting your productivity. Automation Build up a solid weekly income, independent of your day job:Step 1: Pick a reachable niche market. Find a market by defining your customers, and then designing your product around them. Preferably you must be a member of said market. Step 2: Brainstorm products whose benefit can be explained in one sentence or phrase. - The product should be expensive enough to sell fewer units, create higher profit margins, and attract lower-maintenance customers – but not so expensive that customers want to speak with you before buying. - The product should take less than 4 weeks to manufacture - The product should be fully explainable in an online FAQ. The easiest type of product to create is an information product – low-cost, fast to manufacture, and time-consuming for competitors to duplicate. If you read the top three books on a given subject, you’ll know more about the subject than 80% of the relevant population, thereby qualifying you as an expert. The person with the highest credibility will sell the most, not the person who knows the most about the subject. To establish credibility:1) Join 2 or 3 trade associations with official-sounding names.2) Read the 3 top-selling books on the topic and write a one-page summary of each.3) Go to the closest university, put up posters advertising a free seminar on the subject, and give the seminar using the summaries you’ve written.4) Call up a local branch of a well-known company and tell them you’ve done the seminars at the university and that you’re a member of the trade associations. Explain that you’re trying to gain speaking experience outside of the academic setting.5) Leverage your trade association membership and speaking experience to get an article published for a trade magazine. The only way to test if anyone actually wants your product is to ask people to buy it. Create a basic one-to-three-page website, put up a Google AdWords advertisement and use the response to test whether people will buy.  Liberation A 5 step process for getting your employer to let you work from home permanently:1. Increase investment - get your employer to first invest in you to increase their cost if you leave. For example, ask if the firm has any additional trainings available to employees and take them.2. Prove increased output offsite - call off sick for two days in the middle of the week, double your work output on both days, and make sure to demonstrate and record it with an email trail. 3. Show the business benefit - position remote working as a business benefit, not a personal perk. Bill more client time, complete more projects, or otherwise demonstrate quantified improvement. Explain the increased productivity as less time commuting and fewer distractions. 4. Propose a trial period - Informally mention to your boss how you were sick those two days and didn’t expect to get anything done, but were actually twice as productive. Ask if you could try working from home for 2 days in the next two weeks. When your boss objects, acknowledge his concerns and propose working from home only one day a week instead. 5. Expand remote time - Continue to excel on your work-from-home days and drop your in-office performance to heighten the contrast. Ask for another trial period with an extra two days at home. After your boss has gotten used to this, ask for a full-time remote trial of 2 weeks. Conclusion There are as many gems in this book as there is questionable advice. I am not too sure about Ferris' idea to essentially automate your life through offshoring daily tasks. This seems to be going too far. I was also particularly irritated by the fact that he highlights ""most countries in Africa"" as not ideal locations to travel to and work from because of the risk of kidnapping and terrorism. Seriously? Those 2 sentences near the end of the book pretty much ruined the rest of it for me, and thus 3 stars.That said, the chapters on Income Automation and productivity are well worth reading as these are the most practical I think I have read in any work. Other than that...meh."
72,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/65849150-kelsey,3,"The extended edition is recommended as it updates many of the author's early ideas with more recently relevant tools and tips (original text released in 2009). Be warned, the audiobook is fine overall, but because lots of chapters list resources and websites parenthetically in the middle of a sentence or idea, you'll often find yourself repeatedly being read the ""www dot so-and-so dot com forward-slash home forward-slash news forward-slash whatever dot html"". Also, keep in mind that some of the tools the author mentions, while useful, may have been made obsolete when compared to some other things we have that we didn't commonly use in 2009 (like cloud computing versus working locally) or more efficient products have perhaps been released. Overall, good ideas and a recommended read for anyone who runs their own side hustle or fledgling business.As someone who does virtual assisting, I was disappointed about how much Ferriss underscored the perks of having a VA from India or another far off land. While differences of time zone (you can send off tasks at the end of the day and wake to find them completed) and spend (you often pay less than US standard wages for the same work) may be beneficial to an entrepreneur, I think this sort of thinking is dangerous to tout as THE way to succeed while delegating work. VAs come in all shapes, sizes, and skillsets, and opting to only hire non-domestic VAs with cost as a primary driver undermines the quality work that can be done by anyone ANYWHERE. If they're remote, why do they need to be in India? From Ferriss' telling, it seems cost is the only thing that really drives that desire, and I find that disappointing. It's like telling an artist you can buy the same thing at Walmart for $15...it undermines the craft and good work that anyone can do and comes off as a bit tone deaf and opportunistic in a world where Americans know that off-shore labor is often cheaper because it doesn't actually meet the needs of the worker being paid low wages. I'm not saying foreign VAs don't deserve pay and opportunity; I'm saying those looking for assistants should consider how best to support the HUMAN who needs the job.So, that being said, if you'd like to hire a virtual assistant, consider ALL virtual assistants, not just the ones you can pay next to nothing to do all your bitch work while you sleep. /endrant"
73,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5820202-koen-van-den-eeckhout,2,"Positive points: I strongly agree with some of the principles in this book, especially the Pareto principle and Parkinson's law, which can make your approach much more efficient.Neutral points: Ferriss uses a writing style balancing between motivational and arrogant, often crossing the line towards the latter. Nevertheless, it kinda fits the 'fuck it' theme of the book and easy to get used to. The book reads very quickly.Negative points: besides feeling outdated already (Blackberry? Yahoo shops?), Ferriss often crosses the line towards the downright unethical. Several pages on how to be widely regarded as an expert without being one, or marketing techniques which are pretty much illegal (e.g. selling items on eBay without having them)."
74,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28602450-vladyslav-sitalo,3,"The style of the book is somewhat annoying but if you overcome this annoyance this book has something to share with you.--It's a fun fact that I've decided to read this book around the same time as Elon Musk's biography.And as both of the books is fresh in my mind, I can see two drastically different approaches to life from Elon and Tim.Tim is asking reader to dream big set impossible goals and than talks about buying a car or going to some nice place to live.From my perspective ""big"" is what Musk is doing - to transform car and space industries is big, to give humanity ability to travel to Mars is big, to minimize risks from superintelligent AI is big.Buying a Ferrari eh, it's kind of mediocre.I'm not saying that goal to buy Ferrari or live in constant travel or enjoying yourself in any other way is not a worthy goal, just saying that, well, it's not ""big"".It's happens to be true that my sentiments and goals is much more aligned with the Musk's vision. So this fact immediately questions the applicability of suggested techniques as THE way to achieve your goals if they are really big. (What would you set you month input goal if your actual goal is to go to the other planet (really really expensive) or achieve personal immortality (not technologically feasible right now, but it's plausible that it can be achievable in the nearest 50 years. And you can actually work on advancing scientific research/industry/public appreciation to make it feasible sooner then later)? )And so getting back to the comparison between Musk and Ferriss lifestyle - you can see big difference in them - you can probably characterize them as ""4 hour workweek"" vs ""4 hours to sleep"" or by goals ""go to Mars"" vs ""sip wine and play guitar with my amigos"".Do you have to adopt the work style similar to Musk's to achieve really big things? Well, I don't know, but Musk is succeeding and it is sensible to take him as an example at least to some extent.That said, I would admit that the lifestyle, proposed in the book is by all means more interesting and richer on life experience than your average one. Though, important thing to notice is that, unfortunately, this kind of lifestyle is not sustainable for majority of the population (you can tell this by simply looking how much people is employed as VA/outsources/etc for sustaining it for one person). Also despite described drawbacks this book contains a lot of great advice. For example - call to eliminate waste work and focus on the most efficient approaches is obviously applicable almost to everyone and everywhere (and the book provides you with recomendations and options on how to actually do that).I was always for elimination of unnecessary stuff/work/interruption. But Tim here is also talking about an information limitation. And I have to admit that I'm and informational addict in a way :). I don't read news, newspapers/magazines, I don't watch TV.But I totally into reading books, listening audiobooks/podcasts and reading interesting articles on the web. The book convinced me to limit time for email/social networks to two limited periods during the day. And i think it's a great practice. I've also become more picky regarding articles that I read.But, that said, constant learning and self education is one of the values that I practice and want to excel in. And you can't learn new things without getting info about them :).More on positive side:Facing your fears as a way to make a better decisions is really interesting technique.Tim is advocating lean approach to building business and it resonates with Lean Startup approach but applied to non-tech business which is interesting.He is questioning a lot of ""common sense"" assumptions and encouraging people to do this more often. I think that this approach can lead to better society in general.Also Tim briefly advocates ""choice-minimal"" lifestyle. Characteristic quote: ""Fast decisions preserve usable attention for what matters""I have this problem with choice anxiety - I just have to choose the best option, but I've been noticing and regarding this as a problem because I'm spending too much time focusing on minor decisions and I think there is better use for this time. The book do not address problem in depth but have a reference for ""The paradox of choice"" https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1... which I intend to read.Also I would recommend http://thewirecutter.com for people with similar problems as at least a partial solution that can eliminate/mitigate your choice anxiety for a lot of products.More on the downside besides the style:One thing that remained in my mind as bluntly stupid - house that just stays there, and guy is loosing money on it for some mysterious reason (it's not like it would take any amount of time to ask VA to rent it/find a good agency to work with).Tim is constantly overconfidently saying stuff about everything in the world. That's annoying, especially considering that what he is telling often is not entirely? True And he is almost never giving any quantifiable data to support his claims.Other thing Is confused thinking on some topics, for example thoughts on charity/service work. If you actually want to do some good (and not just feel good about yourself) look into https://80000hours.org/ project or http://www.givewell.org/."

Tips and tricks on how to trick your boss into thinking that you're putting in the agreed hours while actually outsourcing it all, really?It also feels a bit outdated, but that's hardly the books fault.

80,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16366211-ro,5,"What I like about this book is that it introduces a lot of new concepts for me - for a better (work) life, while also challenges my existing concepts on (work) life.I am particularly intrigued by the New Rich concept that defines “riches” not in having millions or billions, but more on the use of one’s time / having time freedom. “Those who abandon the deferred-life plan and create luxury lifestyles in the present using the currency of the New Rich: time and mobility.”While it would help to have millions and billions, often we are trapped in this rut of wanting more and pushing off “living in the moment” until we believe we have enough. And you guessed it, that day of having enough, never comes (unless you have a mindset shift). The most mind blowing thing is that the author shows how everyday ordinary people can & do have the means to live luxuriously but are held back by their limiting beliefs that they need to have more, work harder and join the millions and billions club.The author introduces several business models, tips tricks and tools that you can use to “eliminate” and “automate” your work - to free up your time; something you can immediately apply into your (work) life if you wish. 	i.e. 80/20 Pareto’s law According to the 80/20 rule: 80% of results are from 20% of action80% of outputs are from 20% of inputs80% of consequences are from 20% of the causes 80% of profits are from 20% of products and customers A practical use of the 80/20 rule is to ask yourself: 1. Which 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness?2. Which 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness? The book further highlights on our insistent need to “be productive"", which only leads us to fill our time with xx just to “feel productive”. If we reassess our daily to-do list and eliminate all the unnecessary time fillers, we can free up our time to do productive fulfilling things - things we truly enjoy.For example, the “mini retirement” concept talks about how instead of saving up our entire life’s savings to spend when we retire, why not use that money throughout your life and have what the author calls “mini retirements”. This way, you can truly enjoy life while you are young and in your prime, rather than wait until the time is right, which again may never happen. This definitely challenges my personal limiting belief - as I am one of those people who likes to wait until it’s the right time. The book ends by touching on some psychology and self help (my favorite topic) - that even after achieving the “4 hour work week” and have all the time in the world to do what you truly enjoy. Don’t expect all life challenges to just disappear. It is not easy to just ""wind down and enjoy”. Hence why being rich and depressed, successful and depressed are all too familiar. “Man is so made that he can only find relaxation from one kind of labor by taking up another” - Anatole FranceYou cannot just transition overnight from being a goal oriented high-performer to appreciating life in the moment. Although it is not impossible to do both, unraveling such habits take time - just like anything else in life; “leaning to replace the perception of time famine with the appreciation for time abundance is like going from triple espresso to decaf”.Recognizing this is the first step.Appreciating time abundance and living in the present doesn’t mean we should just sit on our butts and do nothing either. According to some of the most fulfilled people interviewed for the book’s case studies: 1. continual learning2. serviceare two commons factors for a fulfilled life. And I absolutely agree, I find my life the most meaningful when I’m continuously learning and can be of service to the world. I like that this book falls not only into the genre of business and entrepreneurship but also philosophy, psychology and self-help - which I think are intricately linked. In order to be well-informed, you need to be able to evaluate things from different perspective.Most of what is said in this book is no new news. I believe most of us are already familiar with the idea that we should enjoy life and live life in the moment but through seeing it from the author’s lens, the author’s way of getting things across that help sharpens my vague understanding of things - and honed down the messages for me even more. Definitely a good read on my list!Edit: I’m surprised this book receives a lot of negative reviews - mostly from people questioning Ferriss’s ego, and his “unethical” ways of doing businesses such as outsourcing help from virtual assistants in third world countries, who charge less.I did feel put off reading it because I had read these negative reviews prior to starting, but I’m glad I gave it a go anyway because I still learned a lot from the book and did not share the same negative sentiments towards Ferriss.I didn’t see this book as a guide on how to get rich quick etc, but rather more like an introduction to a lifestyle different from the accepted norm and more like a motivational tool / insights into Ferriss and others’ success stories. And not to defend Ferriss (although that is probably exactly what I am doing) - there is no need to be holier-than-thou. I don’t think the author is recommending us to take advantage of cheaper labour in poorer countries but rather how money can go further there, hence why they charge less.I am not sure if it’s fair to compare hiring virtual assistants in third world countries who charge less - to slave labors or garment workers for example. Yes, the rate is lower than developed countries but the overall expenses are lower too.Plus it's a question about the whole system we are inMoral contradiction / ethical dilemma There is a section in the book that addresses exactly this: Service for the right reasons: to save the whales or kill them and feed the children?“Service to me is simple: doing something that improves life besides your own.This is not the same as philanthropy. Philanthropy is the altruistic concern for the well-being of mankind–human life. Human life and comfort have long been focused on to the exclusion of the environment and the rest of the food chain, hence our current race to imminent extinction. Serves us right. The world does not exist solely for the betterment and multiplication of mankind.Before I start chaining myself to trees and saving the dart frogs, though, I should take my own advice: do not become a cause snob.How can you help starving children in Africa when there are starving children in Los Angeles? How can you save the whales when homeless people are freezing to death? How does doing volunteer research on coral destruction help those people who need help now?”Children, please. Everything out there needs help, so don’t get baited into “my cause can beat up your cause” arguments with no right answer. There are no qualitative or quantitative comparisons that make sense. The truth is this: those thousands of lives you save could contribute to a famine that kills millions, or that one bush in Bolivia that you protect could hold the cure for cancer. The downstream effects are unknown. Do your best and hope for the best. If you’re improving the world–however you define that–consider your job well done.Service isn’t limited to saving lives or the environment. It can also improve life. If you are a musician and put a smile on the faces of thousands or millions, I view that as service. If you are a mentor and change the life of one child for the better, the world has been improved. Improving the quality of life in the world is in no fashion inferior to adding more lives.”Service is an attitude.”"

Timothy Ferriss comes from a different background: after selling his first company for a bunch of billions, we jump into a digital nomad lifestyle. He considers that his decisions are extendable to the middle-class and the people working 9-17, and addressing this he fails miserably. Is two different rivers with different water. But there is however a lot of important information and philosophies we can extract from this book.Timothy dedicates an important part of his book to talk about Virtual Assistants and popular places to hire them. This is a useful information to start with, but most of the rules we later on talks about are about common sense (do provide them with clear orders, leave everything written, give them freedom to expend money until certain amount...). Many of the websites and ideas about reselling are useful and not that well known.The book in general challenges you to move out from your comfort zone and take risks, which is by itself a vary valuable reason. ""The 4-hour workweek"" title is misleading, since as Tim himself recognizes is not about the money you have earned, but about the freedom you now have and the mobility worldwide. If I would be a boss with responsibility over other people, I would be worried if many of them were reading it. I actually quit my job before finishing it.As a side note: Tim writing's style is very selfish and self-centered. But that does not mean a star less for me"
82,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/747419-jason,3,"So far, not yet having finished this book, it seems like he created it for those who are: 1. in the sales of PRODUCTS industry, and 2. of those people, for those who are in a management/ownership position. For those who are in a service-oriented industry, his tactics do not seem to apply. Some of his tips do have merit however, such as keeping distractions to a minimum by only checking email and phone messages sparingly and delegating smaller tasks not absolutely necessary to other people to better utilize ones time on priorities. We will see if there is more to his book after I'm finished though before I give my final rating.After reading it, I think that I'm still in the same mindset as before. It was written seemingly for those who do not like their job. For those of us who were lucky enough to choose a profession that we actually enjoy, this is probably not the quintessential book of choice. It is packed with situations that are 99% ""not going to happen,"" such as the ""ask your boss if you can just work from home"" scenario. If I were to even try to ask my boss about that, he would just say ""I don't think so"" before 10 words were out of my mouth. The latter half of the book DID make me want to travel more, but the very end just seemed a bit preachy. All in all, I could see how this could possibly be inspiring to some, but not to most."

I needed to be reminded of that.....Why I wanted to give it 5 stars - because I am re-entering the workforce after many years and I got caught up in the hype ""I know everything you need to be successful! This is wonderful! And this is wonderful! And you will not be fulfilled if you don't do all of these wonderful things!!"" But then I realized I am the fisherman in Ferriss's book. I have a very strong sense of community and family and I don't need to outsource my whole life to love my life. Do I want to go to the Azore Islands and reconnect with family and do family history? I do. And thanks to this book I will make it a goal. However, I will not cut corners, look for loopholes or be unethical to do so. Enter the 2 stars. Nor do I need to travel the world to live a fulfilling life. I have everything I need right here.

It is not complete, definitive or anything like it.There are better books about all the finer points:— stoicism— minimalism— productivity— marketing— traveling the world.BUT.This one puts it all together. This book is what made me dare to defy what was conventional and expected.To dream about finding a job with purpose, and living life on my terms. It is a game-changer - and still has the potential to be.It is not a definitive guide of any sort. But it is an invitation to explore. An invitation to think about what are your values (is it travel? is it to spend time with your family? work with something you love?) and rehearse worst-case scenarios.And, most importantly: to dream and try and live the ""best-case"" scenarios.For me, the truth is this: this book changes lives.

96,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64009217-jonathan-donihue,4,"This is a difficult book for me to review. The subject matter is complex and multifaceted and so doesn't lend itself to easy critique. That being said, I'll give it my best.The 4-Hour Workweek is primarily a self help book. It follows the typical format and layout of most modern self help books. If you've read many of these, you'll recognize the pattern and, if you're at all jaded by the genre, the formulaic pattern may turn you off. I urge you, however, to look beyond the pedestrian presentation and consider the content. It will, no doubt, surprise you and may even help you achieve some of your dreams.At its core, this is a book about how to let go of the ""work for work's sake"" mentality and take practical steps to free yourself from the pointless grind of mundanity. The overall emphasis is that wealth isn't about how much money we have or how many things we accumulate, it's about how we spend our time. Mr Ferriss makes the assertion, again and again, that we are truly rich when, and only when, we are living vibrant and fulfilling lives. On this, I agree with him, wholeheartedly!On a practical level, The 4-Hour Workweek offers many concrete ideas, plans, and resources to help the reader identify what is important to him or her and take steps to realize those things in his or her life. There are long lists of useful web pages, books, professional services, and detailed game plans to help the reader succeed. On an emotional level, there are inspirational quotes and first person success stories scattered throughout the book to inspire the reader to take action NOW! The most often referenced resource is to Mr Ferriss' blog, which contains articles, first person success stories, and podcasts that are designed to help the reader follow through and succeed.In spite of all the good stuff, however, I do have a couple of criticisms:First, I read this book as an audio book. In my opinion, it needed some serious reworking to be suitable for the audio format. At least 10% of the book consists of long lists of websites and resources which, although valuable, are impossible to absorb, inconvenient to refer back to, and mind-numbing to listen to. These lists could have been cut out entirely with a reference to a single web page for more information.Second, although I like many of Mr Ferriss' intentions, the means he recommends for achieving the desired goals are often unethical. Lying to bosses, co-workers, friends, and even family seems to be easy for him and he has no problem recommending that tactic to his readers. He also recommends spending as little time as possible on work projects citing the 80/20 rule. What he fails to see is that time spent on the details is often the difference between quality and mediocrity. It's easy to see the poor results of this approach when you look at the thoughtless, formulaic format of the book, the failure to rework the book to make it more suitable for audio, and the haphazard layout of his blog. I agree that it's good to cut out unnecessary tasks from one's daily agenda, but I don't think that tasks that contribute to quality are unnecessary.Finally, Mr Ferriss recommends that people outsource as much work as possible to overseas, virtual assistants. While I think that this is potentially a good idea, Mr Farriss neglects to suggest that the reader investigate the working conditions of the overseas workers and he offers no resources to the reader to help them to make sure that they are working with ethical overseas companies. This is a major oversight. The fact that he didn't address this issue at all makes me wonder if he even cares about it. My complaints aside, I believe that this book is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to live a more fulfilling life. I will be purchasing the Kindle version of The 4-Hour Workweek, if only to have an easy and convenient access to the sizable bibliography and lists of resources. The 4-Hour Workweek was obviously a huge undertaking and Mr Farriss deserves respect and success for offering it to the world."
97,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114658853-charles-lau,3,"	I’d recommend this book with some reservation. Ferris argues against the typical lifestyle of delayed gratification--specifically, working a 9-5 job and then retiring when you are older. Although people can technically be millionaires (or rich), they often don’t live like millionaires until they retire. He proposes a term called the “New Rich,” which is a new way of living that focuses on maximizing time efficiency/effectiveness and relative income rather than absolute income. Furthermore, the New Rich focus on living life to the fullest through sprinkling mini retirements throughout life. The book is about becoming part of the New Rich through a four step process called DEAL (Definition, Elimination, Automation, Liberation). 	I found that most of the value of the book came in the “elimination” chapter. Our mind is filled with so much information, and it makes sense to only focus on what is meaningful. To do this, here are some principles. Pareto’s Principle: 80% of the outputs result from 20% of inputs. If you run a company, it is likely that 20% of the customers are producing 80% of the profits. Thus, to be more effective, cut off customers that are both annoying and not in that high-yield group. Goal is always: maximum income from minimal effort. This principle can be applied to other domains as well including what 20% of things are causing 80% of my happiness. Do a Pareto’s Principle reflection monthly for business and personal life. Parkinson’s Law: a task will be perceived as more important in relation to the time allotted for its completion. To increase focus and fight procrastination, set strict start and end times for tasks. This will force you to focus on the essentials.Develop the habit of asking yourself: “Will I definitely use this information for something immediate and important.” Don’t waste time re-reading material. Check the low-yield time wasters (email and social media) less by having set times to do so.Surround yourself with positive peopleUtilize batching for the distracting repetitive tasks. Ex: don’t do the dishes after every meal. Just wait for it to pile up and do it all at once. Develop the habit of filling in the “ifs” for emails to prevent back and fourth time-wasting. For example, can you meet at 4pm. If so,...If not,...Set a definite end time for meetings to not waste more time. 	Ferris also talks about OUTSOURCING in order to save time. Pay other people to do tasks that you are not very good at or are time drains. Ferris talks a lot about getting a virtual assistant from India (which I think is a bit sketchy), but outsourcing can also apply to a lot of other areas including lawn mowing, video editing, etc.	I like the ideas in this book but I think it is a bit too “out there” and romanticized. Ferris recommends convincing your boss to let you work at home rather than in the office so you can have more free time, but this often just isn’t possible for many jobs. Furthermore, taking mini retirements to “liberate” your life simply isn’t possible if you are kids in school or have in-person work obligations. In my opinion, it is very difficult to automate sustainable streams of income but Ferris makes it out to be pretty simple (if it was so easy, why wouldn’t everyone do it?). I could go on and on about how Ferris’s income autopilot is out of reach for many people. Thus, I think that the book has sort-of a “Clickbait” title. Do not be naive when reading the book. Instead of expecting a four hour work-week, take away the valuable principles of the book which are to automate, eliminate, and live in the present. "
98,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31613827-tessa,2,"2 stars: probably won't implement this in my life.The information: Ferriss' book can be summed up in two points. 1: stop having meetings at work. 2: make sure the people who work under you have the information and responsibility to do their job without you. If 36 hours of your work week consists of having meetings and micromanaging other people, you probably have a bullshit job as per David Graeber's definition. Personally, I don't have any people working under me and don't have that much meetings, so I can't scratch 36 hours out of my week (and this probably also implies that I don't have a bullshit job, so yay). I like some of the tips he gives, and up to a certain point they can be implemented to make your work more efficient, but overall this just doesn't sound like the world I am familiar with.A big downside of his whole theory is that it relies on you working remote so people don't notice you're hardly at the office. This automatically disqualifies anyone who has to be physically present to do their job (bus drivers, nurses, garbage men... I'm seeing a big overlap with people who were praised for keeping society going during the whole Covid-19 period).Next to that, working 4 hours and getting paid for 40 to me kind of, you know, seems like fraud. The counter arguement that you're getting just as much done in 4 is not really an arguement but more a part of the issue. I think a better thing to do, is finding a job you really like or even love. You won't be skiiing in Europe or scubadiving in the Carribean every other week, but at least you enjoy what you do and it gives you a sense of fulfillment. (I know that it's not always feasible to get a job you love, but then again, so is working only 4 hours and getting paid for 40).This all being said, if you take the information with a grain of salt, there is some good advice on how to spend your days with less bullshit work.The last part of the book contained information on wildly differing subjects: from how to buy cheap plane tickets to what to do when you start philosophising about the meaning of life.The readability: it's written quite accessible in the sense that there's hardly any difficult words, things are nicely distributed over paragraphs with whitespaces in between etc. (I have to mention here that I read the Dutch translation).The structure: I guess the overall structure makes sense, but within the chapters, information can be all over the place.Best part: the part at the end about what you could do with a lot of spare time. Makes good daydreaming fodder."
99,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32702223-krista-kosar,1,"I didn't know it was possible to actually get angry over a ""self-help"" book, but here we are, thanks to Tim Ferriss. These are just a few reasons why I couldn't stand this book:1. Tim Ferriss is arrogant. He constantly reminds the reader how great and successful he was and is. He won a kickboxing tournament on a technicality, never got a low score on a college paper because he was that super naggy student every professor hates, and much, much more. It's okay to use yourself as an example in a self-help book, but this is not an autobiography.2. Compassion, friendships, and connecting with other people outside of business relationships is almost nonexistent. Even in the workplace, Ferriss stresses the importance to ""cut the chitchat"" and interrupt people if they take up too much of your time. Of course useless conversations are a big waste of time, but you could at least ask how your subject is doing today, King Ferriss.3. Following on #2, this book is very ""you-centered"". Duh, that's the point of self-help books, but this one did it to an extreme. Sure, there's mention of taking your kids and spouse with you as you traverse the world and blow off responsibilities, and Ferriss squeezes in helping others at the very end of the book, but the majority of it takes the ""me first"" approach. He states that you can give money to charities if it makes you feel good, but you can't fix everything. There is no mention of volunteering your time to causes in your community, nationally, or internationally. Maybe the satisfaction of a job well done without monetary payback would help all the mega-rich feel like they have a purpose in life....4. I'm all for doing what's best for yourself, but not at the expense of others as Ferriss describes. Delegating projects is a big part of cutting back on your own stress and time-wasting, but does that mean the people you delegate tasks to are wasting their own time and being overworked? Are they being paid enough to complete menial tasks? Hm....Why did this book got one star instead of zero from me (aside from the fact that Goodreads makes you rate book reviews)? The questions to ask yourself at the end of each chapter were interesting. If you are an over-worked person who struggles with time management and where to implement time-saving methods, the end of the chapters are good. The rest of the book you can skip.Well, there you have it. My unnecessarily long rant about a useless self-help book that made me angry. 10/10 do not recommend. Thanks for reading."
100,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1588869-duckoffimreading,1,"4 hour work week? Yeah right, more like – pretending to be working while vacationing instead. I’m all for working smarter not harder, but Ferriss’s recommendations include outsourcing your day-to-day to below minimum wage India assistants and gaming your employer’s communication methods (email, phone, etc) to give the appearance of being where he is supposed to be physically, but actually be globe trotting. It’s pretty much delegating and cheating to get ahead. I kept finding myself turned off by his proposals, and trying to open my mind to what he is saying but it all left a bad taste in my mouth. I work for a company that allows me to work remotely, value work life balance and is very family friendly – but I couldn’t contribute what I do in 4 hours a week. Maybe Ferriss just needed to work for a better company? My other takeaway is that Ferriss didn’t really care about the work he was doing, it was a placeholder for anything: selling vitamin supplements, selling French shirts, selling photo shoots so that he could be on perma-vacation. Without bashing this entire book, I did like his idea of mini-retirements and enjoying your life now vs this illusion of traveling in retirement – there are ways I can take more advantage of that. Overall, Ferriss comes across as a know-it-all responsibilities shirker, he thinks he is smarter than the people he works for and doesn’t mind fooling them into thinking he is working harder than he really is. This plan may work for him – but doesn’t work for the vast amount of people in the world…I mean, SOMEBODY has to actually do the work and plus, it just sounds downright unethical."
101,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53202284-chris,2,"This book was frustrating in many ways, but let me start with the positive.There are definitely some valuable things to take away, such as ""Get over yourself and your fear of awkward social situations"" and ""What's the worst that could really happen if you lost your income tomorrow? No really... break it down step by step. Step 1 is definitely not being homeless on the street, and there are probably quite a few steps before that, so you CAN overcome tough times.""With that out of the way... it's so blatantly obvious that this book is just a product coming out of his own strategy to enrich himself. It also seems to be somewhat of an instruction manual for ""How to be a generally unpleasant person"" (I was going to use another epithet, but thought better of it). Some other words that come to mind are ""self-serving"" and ""self-aggrandizing"".So much of his strategy comes from a position of privilege - try talking about becoming the ""new rich"" (oh no sorry, I meant the ""NR"") to people living in abject poverty. Having heard about the book, I never once expected it to literally empower you to only work 4 hours per week, but after having read it and considering the motivations of the author, even the title of the book now leaves a bad taste in my mouth because of it's ""click-bait"" type nature. "
102,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60953683-drew-shealy,3,"Love TF’s recent books (Tools of Titans!), and this is another enjoyable read with comfort-stretching concepts of minimizing the “boring” and maximizing the “exciting” today. Take control and don’t feel constrained to the templated path. Written in an easy to read, exciting, and actionable manner.While overall good, a few things bugged me:1. Some of the idea pitches were written in a very telecommerical get-rich-quick mode: e.g., “increase efficiency by 500% in just 15 minutes.” 2. Some of the ideas seem impractical or even contradicting. Like, pushing for remote work, but then also limiting email communication to once a day (or once a week!) doesn’t seem to support one another. Same thing with avoiding meetings and phone calls and pushing them to email (again, doesn’t jive with minimizing email review). Maybe this is all supportable by outsourcing email activity to an Indian contractor... but I just don’t see that flying for a majority of cases. 3. The “objective” of this book seemed to be mostly about minimizing work activity and increasing world travel. What a great idea!! Though, to me, more focus should be on “filling that newly created void” with an improved state of mind and personal passions.. regardless of location. This was addressed some, but the stronger theme came across as Aruba and Australia and snowboarding... all great, but maybe a shallow objective that also reinforces my point #1 above."
103,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14945161-sandy-maguire,5,"While I didn't like a lot of his business advice, which appears to be ""make up a crap product and then seek rent on it for the rest of your life,"" the rest of this book is great. It feels like a spiritual relative of Sebastian Marshall's Ikigai --- reading this book will have you spending a lot of time pondering ""hmm, what kind of life do I really want to live?"" The answer for most people I've talked to is ""not like this,"" but the fear gets in the way.This is a good book about getting over the fear. It's got helpful little exercises for comfort zone expansion, tactics for dealing with bureaucrats, strategies for building prestige, and lots more. And a lot of prompts for trying to figure out what you'd rather be doing, and for figuring out how to get there from here.The gist of all of it is that people don't really want to be millionaires, they want to have what they assume is the millionaire lifestyle. So computer how much money per day you'd actually need in order to live how you'd like, and then work towards that number. Waiting to live until you're too old to appreciate it is a crap strategy."
104,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7118702-loy-machedo,3,"Wow! What a book! Goodness me!It took me 3 glasses of ice cold water just to cool myself down after I completed reading the whole book at one go. In fact, after reading the book back to back, I had to take a late-night nap for an hour just to let all the information settle down. And once I woke up, I had to ask myself, what in the world actually happened?This is one of those rare books that comes out once a while where either the information is too good to be true or something one must do to find out if is possible or not. In fact, when I googled the possibility of find some harsh critic of this book, to my utter surprise, I didn’t find many. In fact, I didn’t find any. Lets see what does this book say that has taken me out of my balance. Tim Ferriss’s DEAL which stands for:1)	Definition – Defining what you want, what keeps you happy, how much does it really cost and ways how you can achieve it easily and in the cheapest manner possible.2)	Elimination – Eliminate emails, phone calls, focus on managing time and not time management, follow the 80/20 rule.3)	Automation – Get your sources of income in automatic gear while doing what you love and pay your expenses automatically without having to waste your time actually going around paying them. More like delegation. 4)	Liberation – The act of finally doing it – doing what you love and living it. His book is more a call to action rather than a sit back, relax and enjoy process. It is one of those books that challenges you to go against the grain – and over here against what society and we ourselves believe in work, efficiency and the path to success. It is more like a new script to success. The part that really got to me was the amount of website references and examples he offered to ground his theory into workable reality. And yes, there are the surprising bits where he states if you were to read 3 of the best selling books from the NYT list on a particular subject, you know much more than 80% of the readership of any magazine. That in itself is a huge market. And that in turn makes you an expert whereby you can market what you know and sell your services on the worldwide web – which I have seen with my own eyes happening and people making money, at least in the short term. And he has been even more generous to give the step by step process of one can cut short the path towards becoming an online expert to getting one’s first book published.But now here is the big question. Is it possible for everyone to do this and succeed?Let us assume 8 billion on the planet, if all were to do this, how many would succeed?What if every publisher tried this new technique of getting their book published – by following Tim Ferriss technique – would it give everyone a chance of success? Say 100% of those who tried it? Say 50%? Or we cannot be sure?Or let us go one step further to something simpler and to what I can relate to easily. The ‘expert’ phenomenon. Lately with the dawn of google and facebook as the internet dominators, almost every tom, dick and harry I have known have started following, using and abusing the sellers technique of having a landing page, calling themselves ‘internet or SEO experts’, having websites, testimonials, videos, a selling price starting at 9,000 dollars discounted step by step to 900 dollars and then going down to 90 dollars. And when you thought that was it, he would add with it 10 new freebies each worth 10,000 dollars a piece (a collection which includes useless webinars, chats, copy-pasted material as a pdf file and yes power-point presentations to motivate you). So now you have 100,000 dollars worth of freebies for purchasing 90 dollars worth of material. But wait! Because you are the early bird, he is now giving it to you for 59 dollars only – a one time fee and money back guarantee. But this offer is only valid for the first 19 people only.Trust me – I have seen this happen. No sooner does the sales guy try to complete the last sentence, a theatre of nearly 2000 people, almost every single person jumps to their feet and takes advantage of this ‘special-offer’. Fast forward 12 months later, nothing happened.All the sales talk and all the fluff just vanished into thin air. So did the amazing sales guy.Now what am I trying to imply here?All these short cuts and feel good principles are great. It may work for one person. But the probability that it would work for each and every single person is just not possible. Imagine having a planet where there are no blue collar workers – everyone is on a holiday somewhere in the world, not picking up their phone, not checking their emails but working only 4 hours a week. How would this life go on? What about Doctors? Engineers? Scientists? Movie Directors? Teachers?Imagine all of them working only 4 hours a week. Not possible. Not practical. Not probable. So what is my verdict overall?A great ambitious, honest project compiled together by a rather eccentric and bold enterprising thinker with a one-size-fits-all theory that may not work for everyone. A book you must read not once but many times over and yes, you must do it to know if it works or does it not. I would conclude stating this is another Dr. Atkins concept or one of those 6 minute killer abs machine. They came, they caused and revolution and then subsequently vanished a fond foolish futile memory. Tim Ferriss is something like that. Great advice. Good stuff. However, too grandiose to take you to the promised land. More like a book that would give you a high but over time may not be able to sustain its intoxication. Remember – he is richer and working 4 hours a week because you paid your money to buy his book and get him there. Overall 6 out of 10 and yes, surprisingly, I do recommend this book!"
105,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28788642-szymon-warda,5,"My expectations for this book were low. More, or less on the level: Let's get it over with. It is short so I will someway survive the overhyped content.And to my defense: there is a lot of hyperbolic content that sounds like taken from an MLM gathering or a TV market commercial.Some of his ideas were more applicable when the book came out.BUT. And this is the BUT I didn't expect.The book has some very strong points and gives a lot to think. Especially for a generation that grew up hearing that unemployment is sky high, but is not living in a completely different economy.It gave me a lot to think about and changed my mind in an unexpected way. This is what I like about books - broadening my perspective."
106,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30115192-kaveh,4,"So this book really resonated with me, even though I completely understand how it may not do that with everyone. The title makes you think that this book only is about how to minimize and make your workload as efficient as possible (to able to squeeze it into a 4-hour week). But includes advice about that you should read Seneca, and learn new languages with all your freed up to expand your mind. Wasn't really expecting that just by reading the title, right?In the end, no book of this kind will tell you only things that you didn't know. But to me, it was really useful to read this book, in a time were I feel disoriented about what the purpose with the whole concept of ""career"" really is. And Ferriss input about making your whole life a long retirement really makes sense, at least if you're working with something information focused (i.e. not manual labor etc.)."
107,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15145792-john-hawkins,5,"There are not a lot of books that actually change your life, but this one did the job for me. I run my own business and because of what I learned in this book, I could take a month off and everything would keep right on rolling along in my absence. I have a team of people that work for me in India. I've set everything up to maximize the value of my time & owe Tim Ferris a debt of thanks for that. His book was a difference maker for me."
108,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27332705-derek,4,"It's so easy to see why a lot of people will read this and go bullshit, not possible! A lot of what's in this book isn't easy to swallow. it's not designed to be so. Tim's writing is insightful, and blunt and lacks all traces of mollycoddling. There are no grey areas where words like motivation and inspiration are thrown about. it's about deciding what you want and working (not so hard) to design that desired life. Definitely worth reading/listening to again."
109,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5328312-theresa,4,"This may be the only self-actualization book you ever need. Ferriss gives you step by step instructions on how to work less and live more. Living more includes travel, learning and spending time with the people you love and people you find really interesting!I am not a salesperson or a risk taker, but according to Ferriss, I don't have to be. His Q & A (questions and actions) give steps to move people out of their comfort zone. This includes negotiating a remote working situation as an employee - you don't have to be an entrepreneur. There is a large section on international travel as well. On the whole, I think his advice is sound and amazing for those willing to take it. Even if you take baby steps it could (and will) decrease your time at work and increase your time living. "

Had I got off my ass and read it back then (like I should have), it would've been an instant 5 stars for me.In 2019 however...not so much. 3 stars feels fair. Why? 🤔Much of the advice—especially with regard to tools and techniques—is now redundant.Much of what's in here has been discussed to death on Medium.com.Much of the recommended tools are incumbent residents of the Internet Graveyard.That's not to say this isn't a good book. Or that the advice given wasn't effective at the time. Far from it. It's just... times have changed. 12 years on, the principle scaffolding of the book remains intact—it just needs a little refresher, that's all. It's wishful thinking on my part, but I'd love to see the trend of hip-hop sequels reach the non-fiction scene. In other words, The Four-Hour Workweek Part. 2 please, Timbo. 🤓The key takeaway is to outsource. Outsource everythang, ya'll. 🏝"

112,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80141752-iryna,5,"Had mixed feelings reading this book. Didn't know what to expect from it but was a bit surprised to find out there is so much about outsourcing. For me personally it doesn't work as a manual for life but it made me start re-thinking what and how I'm living my life. I would consider this book as sharing personal experience and what worked for Tim and others, but you should concentrate on what works for you.Being sociable person and and learning from others I realised that I don't want to work from home all the time (or other place) and travelling is not my main goal but this book helps you to start asking yourself right questions to figure out what's important. This is one of the books I would want to re-read in the future."

118,0307353133,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75776454-julia,1,"A shallow, snobby know-it-all provides life advice. The way he looks down on anyone earning less than $1000/hour angers me to no end, especially since he is an over-privileged kid who caught a lucky break. Grateful? Of course not. T. Ferriss is more occupied with his status symbols and his so-called achievements than providing any piece of useable advice. He might have accomplished a lot on paper, but is not accomplished. My favorite example here is when he became the Chinese kickboxing champion by cheating on his weight and just chasing his opponent away. This victory, along with all others, stems from bending rules rather than a true talent, and the 4 hour work week from outsourcing tasks to students (not paid) or assistants (with an hourly salary far below $1000). I'd be curious to see how Ferriss would get along in his world if his minions would take his advice and stop working for such a low fair. All in all, it's a lot of hot air, and the book a total waste of time."
