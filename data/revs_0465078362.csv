0,0465078362,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,4,"Lee Smolin is one of the most interesting and controversial figures in modern physics. Establishment physicists often call him a maverick or worse. I am one of many laypeople who think that he's telling it like it is, and the mainstream people are full of s...trings. When he wrote this book, around 1999, I think he was more part of the mainstream. He presents several different approaches to the very difficult problem of unifying gravity and quantum mechanics. It's clear that his heart belongs to Loop Quantum Gravity, but he tries to be as even-handed as possible. He ends up on an optimistic note, and says that he thinks there will be a real unified theory within the next 10-15 years. Something will work.Alas, in The Trouble with Physics, seven years later, one of the first things he did was to retract his earlier prediction, and in the most categorical way possible. ""We have failed."" Sobering words. "
1,0465078362,http://goodreads.com/user/show/693262-huyen,2,"a nice, easy intro into quantum gravity for the interested: http://homepages.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/~visse...This book isn't too bad but I don't think I retain much. the feline analogy and cosmological evolution are cute ideas, and the black hole stuff is fascinating. but much of it is extremely speculative and cryptic rambling. Or maybe I just get more cynical of theoretical physics day by day. That's fine, and at least Lee Smolin acknowledges that it is speculative, but at least don't be so incredibly optimistic when you don't have a single suggestion for an experiment that can verify or falsify your theory. Quantum mechanics and general relativity are both excellent theories, but when they combine, the infinities explode in your face. Quantum gravity has got physicists banging their heads into the wall for the last 50 years and his overt optimism slightly bugs me. Quantum physicists (including string theorists) adore their theory so much they're willing to mutilate general relativity one way or another to pursue their cause, general relativists hold GR so sacrosanct that they can curve quantum mechanics to fit their theory (sorry for the pun). Somewhere in the middle is lattice theorists who annoy both camps. So basically, nobody really knows exactly how to solve this conundrum.  I'm not hugely a fan of a theory that can't be tested. Stuff like Hawking radiation or gravitational wave might be extremely hard to detect, but at least physicists have built the acoustic equivalent of Hawking radiation (http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/...) and (arguably) figured out how to detect grav. waves. This guy has no similar suggestions of that sort, except for the deviations of photon paths across large distances. Hm... He seems to have held favorable views of string theory at that time, on which he has changed his mind. Last month was the 25th year anniversary of the resurrection of string theory, and you can notice the lack of celebration in the string community. He does admit in chapter 11 that nobody even knows what string theory really IS or what its basic principles are, there are hundreds of consistent versions of it and ""what we have is a long list of examples of solutions to the theory; what we do not yet have is the theory they are solutions of"". The major problem with string theory is that it's so loose that whatever experiment data you come out with, some string theorist can claim he predicted it. But Lee Smolin certainly taught me something very honorable about a theoretical physics career. That when you reach the forefront, you have to accept to take hazy paths that no one's taken and can be deemed ridiculous or obscure and perhaps risk wasting your entire career pursuing something wrong. And you will collaborate, compete, argue, disagree, be proven wrong, admit you're wrong, but that's an unavoidable part of progress, to put down the post ""don't go there"" on the wrong paths so some giant can find the right way to get there some day. "
2,0465078362,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,3,"According to Smolin, there are three ""roads"" currently leading to a theory of quantum gravity: the first road begins from quantum theory and adds relativity (string theory), the second begins from general relativity and adds quantum theory (loop quantum gravity), and the third rejects both and tries to consider the question from first principles. (This third road is basically not discussed, and later in the book the third road becomes thermodynamics of black holes and the ""holographic principle"".) There are a few mentions of other approaches such as Alain Connes' non-commutative geometry and Roger Penrose's twistor theory, but none is actually explained. Smolin himself worked for a time on string theory, but today is identified with the loop quantum gravity approach. As of the time this book was written (i.e. about fifteen years ago; I haven't gotten to anything more recent yet, since I'm reading the library's astronomy and related physics books chronologically) about ninety percent of those working on quantum gravity were committed more or less strongly to string theory as the sole viable approach, so Smolin's views are in a minority, and much of his book is arguing that minority approaches should be encouraged (and funded). Looking on Amazon at his later books and the reviews of them, I get the impression that he has continued to move further from the mainstream.Late last year, I read Smolin's Life of the Cosmos, and was very impressed by his approach and his use of philosophy, and the clearness of his explanations of the basic theories such as general relativity and quantum theory, the Anthropic Principle, and the questions which they raise, and though I was not convinced by his speculative theory of cosmological natural selection, I was intrigued by the idea. Of course, I'm very much a layman when it comes to physics and astronomy, so my opinions don't count for much except for my own view of the world. Much of my popular science reading in the past few months has favored string theory (e.g. the awful Hyperspace by Michio Kaku, and the excellent The Elegant Universe by Brian Greene) so I was looking forward to reading this account and learning about the alternative(s). Unfortunately, this is a much less well-written book than Life of the Cosmos. It does cover many aspects of modern physics and cosmogony that I was unfamiliar with, and it begins well. In the first section, called ""Points of Departure"", Smolin emphasizes the relational aspects of space-time as constituted not by absolute space and time (he argues that many relativists ignore the basic breakthrough of relativity, using it to derive local geometries of space-time which are then treated as absolute backgrounds in a non-relativistic manner) nor even by relations among things (either particles or strings) but by relations among events or processes. (Surprisingly, he mentions Hegel and Heidegger but not Whitehead in this connection, but this is a much less philosophical book than the earlier one, at least in terms of discussing writers who would be called ""philosophers"".) The second section, ""What We Have Learned"", discusses the history of loop quantum gravity theory (partly from a personal perspective) and has chapters on the entropy of black holes and a chapter on string theory as well. The problem is that I got no real understanding of what LQG is actually saying. He does tell us (over and over, the book is very repetitive) that space (and time? he doesn't discuss this) is discrete rather than continuous, and that the loops are also discrete. But he never really explained what they are, except that they are ""like"" the discrete lines of magnetic field in a superconductor. The ""glossary"" at the end of the book defines ""loop"" as ""a circle drawn in space""! That's the whole definition of the most important concept in the book! The problem may be that he is so involved in the theory that he doesn't realize the lay reader (for whom the book is supposedly written; this is explicitly a popularization and not a book for physicists) has no idea of what LQG is, and probably doesn't know a lot about superconductors either, so he assumes that the analogy will make everything clear. It doesn't, at least to me. He claims that he has been very evenhanded in discussing the three ""roads"", and particularly that he is fairer to string theory than string theorists are to other approaches (this at least is true, since I've never read a book on string theory that mentioned any alternative except leaving the standard model of quantum theory as is), but the chapter on string theory basically is just about what's wrong with it (not background independent, not testable -- though neither is LCG, not unique) and I would not have understood it without having read other books on the subject. The chapters on black holes and their entropy were the most interesting part of the book, and the ones I got the most out of, but here again he alternates between beating the horse with simplistic analogies and just assuming advanced ideas without explanation. There is no math in the book, and this may be part of the problem, since these ideas make little sense in purely descriptive language.The last part of the book explains the ""holographic principle"", whines a bit about how non-string-theorists aren't taken seriously enough (or paid well enough) and then gives his conclusions on what the final theory of quantum gravity will look like: LQG (no surprise) will be the basic framework; it will involve discrete space; it will make extensive use of the holographic principle, and generally will be based on what observers in different places can actually observe; it will borrow ideas from other approaches such as non-commutative geometry and twistors; string theories will turn out to be approximations to the true theory on the assumption of various fixed space-times. This will all be developed (and possibly empirically confirmed) by about 2010, or 2015 at the latest. (While I haven't read the latest developments, I am fairly sure we're not that far along -- which may be why his latest books all have phrases like ""the crisis of physics"" in the title.)To sum up: an interesting book about an interesting subject, but not well written and not a good introduction to LQG, which is the main reason for reading it; I hope one of the later books on my list will give me a better idea of alternatives to string theory, as well as where we actually are now. (I know at least Penrose's book on twistor theory will cover that approach, IF I can understand the math -- he claims the book teaches all the math needed, but I'm skeptical, even though I was a math minor in college.)"

Everybody knows that the quantum phenomena violates SR. Quantum electrodynamics shows that “virtual particles” do not care for anything of old causality based physics, but are best described on the basis of chance and necessity of dialectics – two widely differing world views.Most forces - chemical, electromagnetic, weak and strong nuclear etc., forces are supposed to be mediated by the exchange of virtual particles between mass centres; some of those virtual particles are well known. If the gravitational force is similarly due to the exchange of virtual gravitons, then there is no reason to believe that they should follow SR."
4,0465078362,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12541461-betseak,3,"Since Lee Smolin has been one of the leading figures both in the string theory and in the theory of loop quantum gravity, I hoped this book would clarify some questions I was left with after reading Carlo Rovelli's Reality Is Not What It Seems: The Journey to Quantum Gravity. I think the main reason both the books failed to do the job is the fact that I lack the adequate background to understand what is really meant by ''strings'' and ''loops'' in the two main approaches to quantum gravity. I find the concept of the loop quantum gravity particularly interesting but it still remains unclear to me what is really meant by ''quanta of space''. As for the third road, I found the chapters on the holographic principle, inspired by the black hole thermodynamics and the Bekenstein bound, highly interesting."
5,0465078362,http://goodreads.com/user/show/206483-dj,4,"Lee Smolin stormed his way onto my fantasy grandfather list the fateful summer of 2008 when I realized physics and I were more than just a fling. His The Trouble with Physics was a fatherly introduction to the current state of the edges of theoretical physics and I was hooked. Needless to see, I was ecstatic to find ""Three Roads to Quantum Gravity"" under my Christmas tree this year and devoured it on plane ride to Thailand soon after.""Three Roads to Quantum Gravity"" is Smolin's briefing to the public on several current approaches to the quest for the unification of quantum theory and gravity. It weaves a tale that passes through quantum information theory, cosmology, and many other delicious details but, importantly, begins by focusing on the fundamental qualities that he believes any current theory should possess. The book is openly biased against the somewhat publicly alluring string theory, and I recommend that any reader complement this dish with a side of Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe.Smolin's criteria run something like this. The theory must be background-independent. It must be a physics based on relations, not on absolutes. Processes, not objects, must be fundamental. This gels with the idea of a human being as a pattern of information and not a specific set of matter (guess what percentage of your atoms are recycled every two weeks). The theory must accommodate many different observes. The finite age of the universe and special relativity's upper bound on speed mean that no one in the universe has access to all information available and each observer indeed has a different picture based on their location. Black holes place additional information boundaries throughout the universe. A single observer's ""information space"" might look somewhat like a sphere of Swiss cheese, the holes representing black holes, the cheese representing areas which the observer may receive information from, and ""beyond the cheese"" as the space from which information hasn't had time to reach the observer just yet.This last problem has an interesting parallel in theories of the brain. Sensory information propagates to each of us at very different rates light faster than sound, sound faster than smells (particle diffusion), etc. Signals in the brain also travel at finite speeds (far slower than the speed of light). These finite speeds apply to both sensory information and ""decisional"" information other areas in the brain. This means that different parts of the brain have access to different information at any given time. Future theories of consciousness may very well have something powerful to say about about observer-dependent physics (and vice versa).Continuing our discussion of information in the universe, Jakob Bekenstein's studies of black hole entropy have led to the recently popularized holographic principle - a surface bounding a region of space contains all the information contained within. Information is ""projected"" from the 3D interior onto the 2D boundary. Whether to view the 2D projection as fundamental and the 3D interior as ""derived"" or vice versa is still (as far as I know) an open question for theory. Bekenstein also placed a boundary of the possible amount of information represented, suggesting a quantization of space. In this picture, geometry can be viewed as defining the information channels of the universe.One final fascinating theoretical nugget that Smolin presents is that accelerating observers are granted a window into the quantum fluctuations of space in the form of experiencing a hot photon gas whose temperature is proportional to their acceleration. The basic idea is that quantum fluctuations normally go undetected since they have no energy but when you accelerate ""fast enough"" your relative motion allows you to experience them as having an energy. You experience this random motion as heat."
6,0465078362,http://goodreads.com/user/show/246177-rob,3,"this book is so dumbed-down that i seriously considered putting it on the ""non-fiction for humans"" shelf. the absolute nadir came when he used as his analogy for the superposition principle of quantum mechanics a mouse which, when eaten by a cat, might turn out to be either ""tasty"" or ""yukky"". Yukky? Yukky? forget that it's universally spelled ""yucky"". but he hammers away at his analogy and the reader is subjected to the word ""yukky"" several times over a few pages. but thank the lord most of the fingernails-on-the-chalkboard stuff like that is in the first 60 pages, and after that the book is pretty informative, although he does have some rough spots. also mildly interesting were some of his narrative sections about his own work and the culture of theoretical scientists. sadly, he seems ridiculously optimistic about how soon he and his colleagues will finally work out the correct theory of all fundamental physics."
7,0465078362,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6265174-erickson,4,"Excellent book describing how the routes to quantum gravity work in rather precise but laymen terms. The human elements are also very clearly done. However, there is clear ""side"" taken in making loop quantum gravity sound ""better"" than string theory, which from what I know on technical level they are both stuck in equally critical stalemate (maybe I am wrong). But otherwise it is a good exposition, especially when Smolin laid clear the ""philosophy"" behind doing science - what are our biases, etc."
8,0465078362,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37763623-dipanshu-gupta,4,"My professor asked me to starting reading literature for writing my master thesis, so I perused the library for some interesting reads. And oh boy, did I hit gold. Masterfully written by one of the people deeply invested in solving the problem of Quantum Gravity, Smolin takes a broad view of the possibilities. His writing is awkward when trying to do philosophical science but when he gets to the gritty areas, his analogies are beautiful. He talks about Loop Quantum Gravity, String Theory and other approaches as ""the three roads"". My biggest lesson was that these roads are not exclusive but complementary. Bridging ideas and successes from wide approaches is the key to understanding quantum gravity. I have learned deep lessons and acquired good writing material from this book. Would recommend to anyone vested in the problem of quantum gravity. While Smolin comes off as a sanguine person (he predicts the final form for QG to be settled by 2010 and at most 2015; the book was written in 2002), his lessons are key to understanding nature. "
9,0465078362,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37678060-gary,4,"Lots of great thoughts, but wordy like a thick hedge is dense. It’s not the scientific terms so much as not well-edited. If this were half as long and covered the same ideas, it would be twice as readable. I’ll be reading it again, but dreading some long passages, yet looking forward to the science and ideas. "
10,0465078362,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"Smolin describes his thinking about how quantum theory (micro level) might be linked to Einstein’s gravitational theory (macro level), to become “a quantum theory of gravity.” His argument is by no means easy for the lay reader to follow, so what follows may not be an accurate rendering. At the minutest level of reality (spacetime on Planck scale) are strings (“a string is actually made of discrete pieces, called string bits, each of which carries a discrete amount of momentum and energy”). Particles come from the different vibrations of strings and particles interact with particles through “splitting and joining.” Smolin then argues that strings (actually, “string bits”) are more fundamental than particles and that, with such strings, “On the Planck scale, space appears to be composed of fundamental discrete units.” From that observation, Smolin goes on to say that at the core of subatomic reality there are no things in space. There are only interactions, relationships in motion, which are constant. Presumably, this means that things continuously come into and go out of being. These processes do not occur on or within a backdrop of spacetime. Rather, these processes create space (distance between interacting particles – via fields?) and time (the measure of distance between interacting particles). There is, in other words, no static point in spacetime: “Neither space nor time has any existence outside the system of evolving relationships that comprises the universe.” Space is filled with the interactions described above in what Smolin calls the “atomic structure of space” through various forms of radiation (light traveling through space; cosmic rays; cosmic microwaves from the big bang). Although Smolin does not say this explicitly, all of this, collectively, appears to constitute the fabric of spacetime (related to dark matter and energy?) that is at the heart of Einstein’s general theory of relativity (larger masses depress spacetime and “attract” smaller bodies), though this gets confusing when Smolin states elsewhere that space is “empty” and, from Newton, that “gravity pulls on mass.” Moving from the micro, atomic level, Smolin believes that all of space and time is a swirl of these relationships, with one thing causing (creating) another, in a perpetual process. There is never a moment in time or point in space; there’s only an event of the present that is preceded by events of the past and that cause (create) events of the future. This is described in Figure 10, P. 58. Each event has its own set of past and future linkages; outside of this “cone” of interaction, other separate events occur, each with its own set of past-future casual linkages. In Smolin’s words, “Time and change are not optional, for the universe is a story and it is composed of processes. In such a world, time and causality are synonymous. There is no meaning to the past of an event except the set of events that caused it. And there is no meaning to the future of an event except the set of events it will influence. When we are dealing with a causal universe, we can therefore shorten ‘causal past’ and ‘causal future’ to simply ‘past’ and ‘future’….There is time, but there is not really any notion of a moment of time.”* *In elaborating, Smolin’s vision stands in stark contrast to Plato’s notion of the Real. “The idea of a state in Newtonian physics shares with classical sculpture and painting the illusion of the frozen moment,” Smolin writes. “This gives rise to the illusion that the world is composed of objects. If this were really the way the world is, then the primary description of something would be how it is, and change in it would be secondary. Change would be nothing but alterations in how something is. But relativity and quantum theory each tell us that this is not how the world is. They tell us – no, better, they scream at us – that our world is a history of processes. Motion and change are primary. Nothing is, except in a very approximate and temporary sense. How something is, or what its state is, is an illusion. It may be a useful illusion for some purposes, but if we want to think fundamentally we must not lose sight of the essential fact that ‘is’ is an illusion. So to speak the language of the new physics we must learn a vocabulary in which process is more important than, and prior to, stasis.” "
11,0465078362,http://goodreads.com/user/show/217696-jim,4,"Either I'm getting progressively dumber, or the books I'm reading are getting progressively harder for me to understand. Hopefully it's the latter of the two. I enjoyed this book in principle, however there was a lot that I had trouble understanding. I think I was able to grasp the basic ideas behind most of the theories mentioned, but some of the finer details may have been lost on me.Still, Smolin does give very detailed explanations for the different versions of String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, M Theory, The Holographic Theory and other ideas such as Spin Networks and Spin Foam.If you've got a basic understanding of the ideas of quantum physics then I think you'll enjoy this book. If you know nothing about quantum physics, then save this book for a later date."
12,0465078362,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7180442-evan-macbeth,2,"It's a complicated subject, no doubt. And Smolin does his best to make it narratively accessible. That being said, this book is disjointed and a bit impenetrable, not because Smolin doesn't understand the subject matter. He clearly does! But because his explanations of that subject matter don't seem to answer some basic ""why?"" and ""how?"" questions.But then again, I'm not a physicist so I am probably not the best person to judge."
13,0465078362,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13629722-carl-stevens,4,"Do you know a similar book with a little more technical detail? This was an excellent popular treatment of quantum gravity and related topics but I have read several popular treatments now and find myself wanting to dust off my old math texts and go a little deeper. So if you know something that would challenge someone with a math background comparable to a math major in his junior year, please let me know."
14,0465078362,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10477769-h,4,I love Smolin's style of writing. A worthwhile read for those interested in the diversity of the field and the questions being tackled.

16,0465078362,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27078182-austin-barselau,2,"Writing about complex topics, not to mention quantum theoretical physics, is tremendously challenging. Distilling dense, abstruse, and highly mathematized information down to the comprehension level of the average reader is a feat in itself. This is why good popular science- writing that can be accessed and enjoyed by that layperson- is scarce. Far too many academics fall prey to the so-called “curse of knowledge,” or the inability of the expert to condense and summarize information to novices. Perhaps they fail to understand the material well enough- if they can’t explain it simply, can they even explain it at all? As Einstein once stated, “if you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.”Lee Smolin, a theoretical physicist at the Perimeter Institute, wrote Three Roads to Quantum Gravity several years back to bring to the public eye recent developments in theoretical physics. Discovering quantum gravity has been an especially troubling problem for physicists; reconciling gravity with quantum mechanics is the largest obstacle to completing the Standard Model. Smolin, writing in 2000, argues that there are realizable solutions to this quantum mystery. He finds three “roads” to reconciliation. The intent of this work is to demonstrate them to the average intelligent reader. The first road is loop quantum gravity (LQG). It conceives of a complex configuration of quantized loops, captured through the mind-numbing formulations of the so-called spin network. A spin network is formed when loops are combined, producing a shape. Smolin played a large role in fleshing out LQG; in fact, several pages recount his formulation of the theory, along with his fellow colleagues. The second road is the more commonly known string theory. This theory, while sharing some similarities with its LQG counterpart, is premised on a different theoretical structure. In order for this conception to work, space-time must be absolute rather than relative. In other words, it assumes a fixed background for the equations to work. Smolin disagrees with this notion- his first chapters are devoted to undermining this absolutist view of the universe. Smolin argues that the universe is entirely relational. This means nothing exists outside of it, no backdrop on which to impose order. Space cannot be defined without considering its contents. He likens the geometry of the universe to that of a sentence, writing that, as “a sentence has no structure and no existence apart from the relationships between the words, space has no existence apart from the relationships that old between the things in the universe.” This is called “background independence.”The final road Smolin describes, albeit briefly, is the one of the renegade. The followers of this path reject the assumptions of the first two; they find themselves rejecting the entire mathematical edifice, while laboring over the larger philosophical questions of ‘What is time?’ or ‘Why do we exist?.” Smolin says that few travel this path; it is much easier to work with established theories and models rather than reject them wholesale.Smolin vigorously treks the first path. At times, he goes out of his way to criticize the members of the string theory field for dwelling on incorrect assumptions. Yet he argues that more collaboration is needed. The way he describes the formative years of each field, from the mid-80s to the mid-90s, suggests an almost tribal mentality among members of each group. “Each group was successful in solving problems it set for itself,” he writes. Each side played lip service to the other. What they were not doing was collaborating. “During this whole period, for example, there was not a single person who worked on both theories. Many seemed to make the understandable mistake of confusing the solution of part of the problem of quantum gravity with the solution of the whole problem.”Despite his critical remarks about the closed mentalities of both fields, Smolin is by nature an optimist. He believes we are on the cusp of figuring out how to reconcile gravity with quantum reality. By the end of this century, he predicts a unified theory will be a fixture in high school physics classes. Generally, Three Roads to Quantum Gravity straddles the line between polished academic writing and engaging popular science written for the lay individual. In the end, it accomplishes neither. What results is an eclectic assembly of thoughts, theories, and personal history, interlaced with not-so-descriptive models and overly simplified analogies. There is no unified theme in the book: an introduction to the “three roads” is described in the preface, and he only goes on to write about the first two. I had to go back and find where he mentions the third path. The writing is mostly dry- it is plain boring academic writing severely lacking in humor or vivid imagery. Smolin is no Brian Greene. Greene’s use of elaborate analogies and colorful imagery makes him one of the most respected writers in the field of popular physics. Smolin, on the other hand, struggles to come up with engaging explanations and analogies. For example, he describes quantum superposition with a cat eating either a tasty or a “yukky"" - yes he uses that spelling- mouse. In his discussion on the holographic principle, he describes the interaction between a “Thing” and a “Screen.” Judging by these sorry examples, Smolin could learn a thing or two from Greene’s writing style. This book also reads like an assemblage of notes, packed into three semi-cohesive sections. He lingers on black holes and thermodynamics in a few chapters, skips to quantum field dynamics in another, and then goes off the rails when discussing the holographic principle. He notes that the book was writer for “any interested reader,” yet takes the liberty to include mathematical equations and excessively complex models in the chapters. In the end, the final product is a hodgepodge of his own personal research, long-winded plugs for his beloved LQG and general but not too immersive discussions of topics on the cutting edge of the theoretical physicist’s equation sheet. In the end, where there should have been a meticulously-tied arc of consistency and coherence throughout the book, is instead a poorly knotted bow with several loose ends. Smolin does an average job of connecting with the reader. His writing is generally insipid, and contains a few too many complicated models and aggressively simplified analogies. At times he tries to hard to engage the reader, and other times his work is lifted off into abstraction and arcane digression. In other words, he falls prey to the curse of knowledge. On the whole, I am glad to say that I can understand some of the more recent developments in the quest to complete the Standard Model. Smolin’s optimistic temperament provides some hope that it will be accomplished soon."
17,0465078362,http://goodreads.com/user/show/310403-kyle,4,"Not the typical quantum trip down the garden path leading from Aristotle, Galileo and Newton to Einstein, Bohr and Heisenberg. Instead Smolin waves his hand out the window as he Ferraris by classical and early mechanics gardens to take us for a spin on each of the three roads that will get us to his horizon point, quantum gravity being taught in high school classrooms by the end of the 21st century. To get up to speed, he takes the cat out of the Schrödingerian box and gives them some mice to eat, talks of strings, loops and knots (dangled in front of the cat, no doubt, with a tasty mouse in its mouth) before screeching into a hard turn with his holographic principle. I’d like to claim I have understood what it means to only have access to what on the screen, the circular base of a light cone, while the event (aka The Thing) remains out of reach at the cone’s vortex. Perhaps the grandchild students of my current elementary students will be able to talk M Theory like it ain’t no thing, but if we can create virtual particles, possibly even virtual light, then who’s to say there ever was or will be the Thing. Anyhoo, lots more that I want to learn about holographs and the shape of reality. Looking forward to finding out what Smolin’s sailing buddy Rovelli has to say. He probably drives a Lamborghini!"
18,0465078362,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61065620-jason-bennett,3,"Decent read for an inspiring string theorist.Good to hear about the other options.Background independence is the most successfully conveyed concept of the text. I wish non-commutative geometry was selves into though. It was mentioned quite a bit but left out in favor of explaining what a relational theory is. And even that explanation was lacking because of no attempt to explain topos theory. But then again, topas theory in quantum gravity is not well-received by the community and so I have no desire to go learn about it.

31,0465078362,http://goodreads.com/user/show/122235--uht,5,"This is one of the small list of books that has forever changed my paradigm. Unlike the other ones, I was aware of the paradigm change as it was happening and I could not put this book down.""...the first principle of cosmology must be 'There is nothing outside the universe' . . . This first principle means that we take the universe to be, by definition, a closed system. It means that the explanation for anything in the universe can involve only other things that also exist in the universe . . . If something has a position, that position can be defined only with respect to the other things in the universe. If it has a motion, that motion can be discerned only by looking for changes in its position with respect to other things in the universe.""Space is, therefore, a network of relationships.Secondly, any observer within the closed system is observing a system of which she is a part. The act of observation changes the closed system, which is the founding principle of quantum mechanics. This is the most simple and profound explanation I've ever heard of this phenomenon.Further, space is a set of processes, not things. These processes are ""transfer[s] of information."" Smolin believes that space is discrete, i.e. that it is made up of elementary parts, which he calls ""elementary events."" The Planck scale is the measure of these events. Space being discrete means that this region of 'space' represents a finite number of events and that a finite amount of information is contained in it. By information, he means that a finite number of yes/no questions may be answered about that elementary unit.Further, the presence of matter, changes the PRIORITY of causes in this event-driven model of space. I've typically heard this referred to as the shape of space-time, but Smolin, having redefined space as a network of relationships (and I think ""changing, contiguous relationships"" is implied, due to the nature of life), shows that matter simply rearranges the relationships.I love this view of space and it fits everything I have studied about everything. In particular, it reminds me of Bertrand Russell's epistemology. At first Russell seemed to be saying that we could only *know* relationships, but he then radically redefines ""me"" as a set of changing relationships. Smolin takes this one step further, redefining all that exists as a network of relationships affected by the observer.A couple more unrelated but cool observations:""It is commonly assumed that anything that is observer-dependent is subjective, meaning that it is not quite real. But . . . in a universe defined by [the theory of relativity], something may be both objectively tru and at the same time knowable only by some observers and not others.""""So, in the end, the most improbable and hence the most puzzling aspect of space is its very existence. The simple fact that we live in an apparently smooth and regular three-dimensional world represents one of the greatest challenges to the developing quantum theory of gravity. If you look around at the world seeking mystery, you may reflect that one of the biggest mysteries is that we live in a world in which it is possible to look around, and see as far as we like. . . the greatest gift the quantum theory of gravity could give the world would be a renewed appreciation of the miracle that the world exists at all, together with a renewed faith that at least some small aspect of this mystery may be comprehended."""

Unfortunately, this is an old first edition I've been reading; what happened in the following 17 years, and why hasn't that unified theory still hasn't come about? I really must get hold of the up-to-date edition...... The 2017 edition is exactly the same except for an additional chapter describing what progress has been made in the intervening years. The answer seems to be not much."
34,0465078362,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23888196-rama,4,"An Introduction to Loop Quantum GravitySince the postulation of theory of relativity (theory of cosmos, which describes the structure of space and time), and quantum mechanics (laws of microcosm, which describes atomic structure, nuclear forces, and nature of basic component of matter); physicists until now have struggled to explain gravity (which is a manifestation of spacetime fabric in presence of matter) in terms of quantum mechanics (quantum gravity). In this book the author attempts to explain three different approaches to quantum gravity; Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), Superstring - M theory (S. -M), and Blackhole Thermodynamics (BT). While each takes a different starting point, they all agree when viewed on Planck scale, and they also view space and time are not continuous, and space is composed of discrete units. LQG gives us a detailed picture of these units in terms of spin networks, where as S.-M theory proposes continuous space in terms of a continuous string (with compactified extra dimensions) made of string bits, which is governed by uncertainty principle. BT theory states that amount information in any given space is finite and is proportional to the area of the boundary of the region in Planck units. The author is a pioneer in the field of LQG and provides the reader with a good introduction of the theory in a non-mathematical form and then compares with S.-M and BT theories. The book is described in three parts; the first part is a general introduction, which describes historical development of three theories, the second part introduces LQG and then compares with S.-M and BT theories, and the final part attempts to unify the three approaches into a single theory using Holographic Principle. The author gives us several interesting accounts of physicists working in these fields are in a climate of mutual ignorance and complacency with the belief that their theory is correct and others are wrong. There are instances when one group can't solve certain problems, and they seek the help from the other camp. The author also briefly explains other theories such as Twister theory, and Non-Commutative Geometry. This is one of the few books I have read which describes LQG in some detail, although there are several books in literature, which describes S.-M theory. The author is very honest in comparing the three approaches to offer the best explanation for quantum gravity. Anyone who wants to understand LQG must have this book. "
35,0465078362,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1330476-kev,5,"I cannot adequately express how amazing this book is. If you are at all interested in physics -- and I am! -- this is a very important one to read. If you read ""The Evolution of Physics"" & ""Relativity: The Special & General Theory"" by Einstein, ""Chaos"" & ""Genius"" by Gleick & ""Feynman's Lost Lecture"" by the Goodsteins, then, read this one ... you will be in a position to reevaluate all of the known unviverse as we understand it right now. I think this one is better by far than Greene's ""Elegant Universe.""Here's the skinny. Space is not continuous or smooth. On the Planck-scale it's discrete & granular. Choatic Complexity better describes this than anything previously. The General Theory of Relativity holds true. The Einsteinian Quantum Theory holds true. The Heisenbergian Uncertaintiy Principal holds true.Spacetime is whatever it needs to be to understand the phenomena we wish to examine. All theories of the physical universe that are spacetime bakground dependant are incorrect -- NOT unuseful, just not complete yet. Only theories grounded in spacetime background independence will stand the test of time & pragmatism.The universe is irreducably geometrical from the tiny Planck scale to the limits of macrocosmology.Smolin makes plain the limitations of the String Theories & Loop Quantum Gravity Theory & then links them in an amazingly deft manner usng simple geometry!The implications of this are simply staggering. Theology, philosophy, ethics & metaphysics must respond to this reality. By corrollary all theologies, philosophies, ethics & metaphysics that are background absolutist dependent are incorrect. Only those that explore background absolutist independence will stand the test of time. This means that as the advent of the Age of Reason put away the physical world Platonic/Aristotlean view, it now puts away the theological, philsophic, ethical & metaphyical Platonic/Aristotlean views. Again, this doesn't mean they are unuseful, just incomplete. The time for the invention of a New Materialism is at hand. Sorry about the bad news. Don't shoot me; I'm only the messenger."
36,0465078362,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6059871-vicky-chijwani,4,"A good way to get up to speed on (almost) the latest physics, after you've worked your way through the thicket of relativity and quantum physics. Although I must say, the sheer abstractness of physics today kinda dampens my enthusiasm for the subject.What follows below is basically terse notes for my future self:- Why is quantum gravity important? General relativity and quantum mechanics are simply incompatible. GR does not take into account the role of the observer, while QM accepts Newton's view of absolute space and time.- 2 major theories: string theory and loop quantum gravity.- String theory posits all particles are produced by different frequencies of vibrations of a single fundamental unit that looks like a string.- Loop quantum gravity (LQG) quantizes space itself and derives a minimum possible area and volume (called the Planck area/volume). The structure of space at this level is described by a spin network (basically a graph) where nodes are Planck volumes and edges are the intervening Planck areas.- String theory is more popular, but Smolin thinks it's at a higher level than LQG. Ultimately he thinks the final theory will pull in aspects of both, because each suffers from a problem the other doesn't have: string theory is ""background dependent"" which means it pretty much kicks relativity in the nuts (by assuming absolute space and time apparently), while LQG suffers from a lack of a way to describe general relativity in terms of it.- This book is 14 years old, and a lot must've changed (including the author's opinion, apparently)"
37,0465078362,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6191810-michelle,4,"To start this review off, I must say that I was impressed with how well this book was written. Being a high school student with no prior knowledge of quantum gravity or quantum mechanics, I was pleased that this book was written in a way that I could actually understand the content and learn from it. Also, Lee Smolin's ""Three Roads to Quantum Gravity"" not only taught me about today's groundbreaking physics, but has also sparked my interest in pursuing further knowledge in the fields of theoretical physics. This book discusses how scientists are working to create a ""theory of everything"" by combining Einstein's theory of general relativity with quantum theory. No prior knowledge of these subjects is required to understand his explanations and conjectures, because Smolin does an excellent job defining everything for the reader. Smolin also describes three approaches to reaching an understanding of the structure of space and time on the Planck scale, being string theory, loop quantum gravity, and black hole thermodynamics. All the approaches have their own issues, such as how string theory is background-dependent while space itself is background-independent. However, all three approaches yield the same result: that space is finite. Though nothing can be determined for sure due to the current inability to prove these theories incorrect, all of the theories proposed in this book provide great insight into the structure of our universe."
38,0465078362,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1072527-nicholas,4,"An amazingly lucid book evenly dealing with different approaches to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity in a theory of quantum gravity. Smolin is very straight-forward and presents his ideas in an interesting, provocative and intelligent manner. I've struggled to understand how space can be quantized for three months, and I think I finally have some solid explanations. Smolin also does well with the Holographic Principle, which is about a difficult subject as you can come by in modern physics. The main reason I bought the book was for a clearer understanding of Loop Quantum Gravity, which is Smolin's specialty. Sadly this is the one chapter that I felt was lacking. I don't know if it's the subject, or just Smolin, but every other approach to quantum gravity was very easy to understand in plain terminology. Perhaps he's so close to the LQG approach he doesn't know how to give it a non-technical treatment. Moreover, the chapter is filled with anecdotes that detract from the presentation of ideas. I liked the fact that Smolin proposes an open mind for both the general public and the community of theoretical physicists in the pursuit of a quantum theory of gravity. He rightly asserts that the practice of jealously guarding one approach over others rather than an open approach to all methods is stifling and will only hinder scientific progress."
39,0465078362,http://goodreads.com/user/show/34340409-sanjay-varma,2,"It's not a bad book. He writes clearly enough. I was able to follow him for half the book. He introduces a concept that space-time is not continuous but is made up of discrete units. He speculates that each unit of space-time is extremely small and related in size to Planck's constant. And from this idea he goes on to explain several scenarios in which more space-time is spontaneously created. As someone who has enjoyed reading the empirical philosophers like Descartes, Hume, and Kant, whose theories are founded on the assumption that space-time is continuos, I found it utterly fascinating to consider whether space-time is discrete.Then I lost interest. He weave a lot of ideas into this book: String theory, the holographic universe. I found it a bit off-putting that Smolin had to refer to three speculative theories in order to justify his own ideas. I also didn't enjoy his writing style which alternated biographical and conceptual chapters. He ends up sharing credit with a lot of people, but that didn't help me to understand these concepts."
40,0465078362,http://goodreads.com/user/show/353587-ethan,4,"Some sadness. The very first words on the back cover of the paperback edition, after PHYSICS, are: ""The Holy Grail of modern physics is the theory of 'quantum gravity'. It is a search for a view of the Universe that unites two seemingly opposed pillars of modern science..."" et cetera. Let's unpack these two sentences. The first mentions the Holy Grail, which I think is not the right analogy for a mathematical description of spacetime. I seem to remember the Holy Grail as the one identified by Indiana Jones as the unassuming ceramic cup Jesus drank out of. No disrespect to Jesus, but it's a bummer that Basic Books feels like they need to market Lee Smolin the way they market the Da Vinci Code.The book itself is delightful. I like this Lee Smolin.Many worlds, with a hypothetical observer outside them? No, one world, with many observers.The universe is made of processes, not things."

Most of the ""physics for non-physicists"" books I'd read were a bit dated (In Search of Schrodinger's Cat, A Brief History of Time, etc.), so I'd needed something a bit more contemporary. I found Quantum Gravity to be very informative and enlightening, and what seems to be a very good advanced introduction.The author gives a very solid and understandable overview of the main avenues of theoretical physics that are attempting to solve Quantum Gravity. I suspect that the book therefore is an excellent precursor to a more detailed book on QCD, String Theory, or Field Theory. That being said, I don't think it is a good first read for someone interested in the topic. It might be best to seek out a book that goes into more detail into the basics of Quantum Theory or Einstein's Relativity before reading this book."

Is the fabric of space infinitely divisible, or is it ultimately made up of ""atoms"" - tiny chunks of space that can never be split?This question may seem almost unanswerable. But as physicist Lee Smolin writes in Three Roads to Quantum Gravity , some of the newest ideas in physics are pointing to a surprising answer: space and time do indeed appear to be made out of such atoms. In explaining why, he offers a tour by a skilled teacher through some of the boldest and most beautiful ideas of modern science. This includes the memoirs of famous physicists and through and interesting explanations of the though process of physicists.

Lee Smolin is probably the best of popular physics writers today, with a very firm grasp of his field of expertise, and an even-handed, detailed treatment of 'competing' models of unifying theories. He's also a refreshingly honest doubter of the superstring hype that pollutes much of pop-physics these days. This book isn't so much a declaration of his preferred ""road"" to quantum gravity, but a summary of the three prime paths (at the time of publication), as well as a clear and well-written work illustrating the problems associated with each.

On the other side of the spectrum, if you search for Quantum Gravity on Goodreads the second result would lead to this one:.The Quantum Bomb of 2015 changed everything.
