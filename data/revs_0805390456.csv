0,0805390456,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69589444-jen,5,"In keeping with my ghoulish experiments on the elasticity of Goodreads reviews, I have provided a handy dandy guide to would-be scientists who wish raid these three volumes for all their willy bits. I have crafted a list of brain specifications for multi-tiered appreciation. It’s worth noting that these lectures are uneven in terms of difficulty, and that someone without a background in mathematics can appreciate some sections, particularly in volume one, just for the conceptual upgrades that Feynman is known to sling with such frequency that you might begin to suspect this inexhaustible supply is the result of communion with a Terence McKenna style entity of animal crackers and Morphic Resonances. But I digress, precipitously, to imitate what happens with the physics on offer, because they get steep, and you’re almost guaranteed to experience some nasty cyanosis if you have no grounding in numerical witchcraft. It should go without saying that if you’re a Ramanujan type autodidactyl creature, or you share Feynman’s connubial bliss with McKenna-fauna, then you’ll find these specs/ergregia cum laude all things Dick (Feynman), rather pedestrian. But, before you go; a few comments. First, that’s technically bestiality, even if your corporeal form remains in the lazy boy while your mind strokes Baphomet’s Caduceus. Second, why you would deign to subject yourself to the meanderings of this little idiot is, perhaps, as baffling as your fetish for Éliphas Lévi’s imagery while high on Psilocybe azurescens.Minimum specs:A commitment to casting down all shibboleths of superstition regarding how loaves of bread move along incline planes. The fortitude to accept that you will frequently find yourself out of your depth. A willingness to avail yourself of other resources should you stumble over something so badly that your junk looks like an exploded hotdog. A passion for understanding how the universe works. High school algebra/physics. A mental emetic for purging abstractions in the event that your neurons go critical. A family member with an engineering background who can kindly offer advice (in my case; my dad. Who was also very understanding when, as a wee lass, I took apart a barstool over the course of days by working the screws with my nubby fingers, hid the nuts and bolts in my mouth, then buried my head in the pillows of the couch. A red flag behavior that persists to this day, indicating some bizarre oral fixation has been recently indulged, I urge you to keep your extrapolations pure, but you probably can’t help yourself now.)Medium specs:A willingness to work out many problems related to the topics being discussed (you’ll have to seek out supplementary material) in order to make sure you’re not just gaining superficial understanding. Feynman can make things sound much easier than they actually are for us pudding brains. It’s critical to do the work. The lectures were intended for Caltech students, (no slouches, those), and, by Dick’s own admission, many of them became lost trying to drink from the fire hose. You and trig need to be exchanging sexual favors on the reg. College physics/calculus (differential equations for mechanics and dynamics, vector and multidimensional for electricity and magnetism). Controlled amounts of attention enhancing pharmaceuticals. Someone willing to strike you with a kyōsaku (encouragement stick) when you find your mind wandering. Partially digested coffee cherries freshly defecated by an Asian palm civet.High specs: Mescaline. (100 mg mescaline hydrochloride (HCl), 111 mg mescaline sulfate or 85 mg mescaline freebase to establish foundation). Small Athame Ritual Dagger (for complex geometrical approximations). Altar constructed according to Fibonacci Sequence. Serpentis Leviathan Cross Altar Tapestry Banner (self-explanatory). Sigil of Astaroth (there are some patches for this at any Hot Topic if you don’t have the resources to craft a shield). Lemegeton Goetia Ritual Circle (embroidered cloth or crude approximation drawn in earth at your own risk, as entities can be extremely detail oriented). Goth Long Matte Black Press On Nails Witchy Hecate Hex Halloween Horror (non-negotiable) Skull Bowl (you’ll probably want this in resin, as genuine human skulls often cast suspicion). Baphomet Horned God Goat Skull Ritual Goblet (assorted candies). Black Mini Taper Spell Candles (naturally). Brass Candle Snuffer With Wood Handle (classy). Cast Iron 6 Inch Wide Mouth Mini Cauldron (mostly vodka). Charcoal Tongs With Inscribed Pentacle (for the nips). Incense (mask scent of daemon smegma). An example ritual for summoning Maxwell’s Demon follows:Cast the CircleUsing your wand (athame, finger, slide rule etc.). Start in the north, envision you’re drawing up the quantum vacuum energy of the universe, coalescing in your ritual implement of choice, then, pointing said device toward the earth, draw down the collective bombardment of neutrinos in your local area. (It’s perfectly normal if you don’t feel anything during this torrential rain of subatomic particles, but trust me, I have it on good authority that it’s happening.)Walk around once, saying:I conjure the Circle of Power, by my factorization and by my largest prime,I conjure the Circle of Power, a boundary between numerator and denominator;I conjure the Circle of Power, a sacred space for calculations;I conjure the Circle of Power, to shelter us from negative energies of innumeracy;I conjure the Circle of Power, to contain the derivatives and integrals within;By the powers above, and the powers below, I close this circle- so mote it be!The following chant for Maxwell’s Demon should be uttered in the likeness of Oppenheimer in the famous clip where he quotes the Bhagavad Gita.

1,0805390456,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84658-kristopher,5,"I recognize that few will purchase this, but it is the most incredible set of explanations of the basic principles of physics by the most infectiously charming and lucid teacher of it. It has a great conversational tone and is thereby quite readable. Feynman provides excellent examples and thorough explanation. He also gives his honest opinion (as always) to anything controversial. Just a great read if you are curious about such things."
2,0805390456,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20378185-armineh-nouri,5,"It took me about a year to finish all three volumes, after which I can say I have followed and remembered roughly 20% of Feynman's endless derivations. Nevertheless I have immensely enjoyed every page. I once read an article by an educator who advocated for early teaching of concepts related to infinitesimals and transfinites, exponentiation and concepts related to rate of growth and decline in nature. Her idea was that math and science teachers often follow a chronological order, based on the history of science and the order in which various concepts were discovered and evolved. Instead they should follow a logical order, beginning with ""fundamentals"" instead of ""basics."" To me, Feynman's book wholly represents this idea. The content is organized really well, so it makes it easy to follow the big pictures even if details are getting lost here and there. To anyone who might not have the time to go through all volumes, I highly recommend chapters 1-6, 37-38, and 52 of the first volume, chapters 1-4, 18, and 30 of the second volume, and chapters 1-8 of the third volume."

5,0805390456,http://goodreads.com/user/show/260292-erik,5,"I used to see this on people's shelves when I was a kid and always wondered what was inside the ""three red books."" Well the short answer is: everything. It's a great way to learn physics Feynman's way, which means very little problem solving but a lot of deep comprehension and a thematic approach to physics. Meaning: he shows you certain paradigmatic problems which illuminate the physical world and which you can use over and over again. Also he shows you advance peeks at more advanced science, which you will certainly not get in most undergrad physics textbooks. Caveat: Feynman is not so deep philosophically. His take on relativity is strictly for calculational purposes and even in quantum (his specialty) you will find very few deep philosophical insights into the theory besides just: ""shut up and calculate!"" He seemed to be allergic to mixing philosophy and physics but sometimes it is unavoidable."
6,0805390456,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1847668-yanni,5,"Wonderful! A high-quality work for the undergraduate of brilliant quality. First rate stuff, but DO NOT READ if you want to get a good degree these days, since the methods of introducing some of the subjects in these works is quite different to how physics is taught today - particularly the 3rd volume on Quantum Mechanics....I always love these deep insightful lectures - such a completely original mind. Not always easy to follow... But, these were delivered at Caltech, perhaps the finest place in the world to study physics at the time (apart from in Russia, with Lev Landau), so the standards were pretty tough - and even then, many of the students complained that these were too ""off beat"" for them to be able to swallow and regurgitate in their final exams. You have been warned! But real wisdom isn's always ""easy"" and does take time to digest and should not really simple be puked out into an exam paper. Sadly, in today's world, when university lecturers are marked on their performance by the students, such works of genius like this would never arise in our society where everyone has to pass."

11,0805390456,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17161968-fergus-murray,4,"Although the Feynman Lectures are not always well-pitched for their intended undergraduate audience, the author's explanations of many physics topics are unsurpassed. The writing is lucid, well-structured and authoritative, and only let down a little by Feynman's occasional failure to appreciate the difficulty of the concepts he is setting out."

13,0805390456,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54135119-bogdan-teodorescu,5,Best physics lectures ever.
14,0805390456,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3391082-5dd,5," I didn't learn about this wonderful set of lectures until a year or so after starting my graduate work in engineering. As such, I egotistically assumed that I probably already had a firm grasp on practically everything in the three volume set. After all, it's supposed to be a Freshman-level introduction to Physics, right? No. Wrong. Very, very wrong! Feynman's perspective and his intuitive insight to physics was unlike anything I had ever been exposed to. In fact, it is probably unlike anything that has ever occurred because Feynman was one-of-a-kind. As it turned out, I learned far more about physics from Feynman's ""introduction"" than I had learned in 4-5 years of course work up until that time.  Although the topics discussed in Feynman's ""Red Books"" are the same as those discussed in the typical three semester series of introductory Physics, each lesson is presented at a much higher conceptual and philosophical level. Remember, this is Feynman we are talking about; one of the greatest physicists of all time. His idea of an introduction to physics presupposes a mastery of at least one year of calculus and a solid semester of differential equations. Thus, any student lacking these prerequisites is encouraged to look elsewhere for an introductory treatment of the subject.  On the other hand, students in possession of these prerequisites won't find a better overview of physics anywhere. Feynman's intuitive understanding and insightful perspective of physics is absolutely incredible. In fact, it may be completely unparalleled. In this three volume set on physics, one is frequently rewarded with a glimpse into the mind of a true genius. What could be better than that? I will go so far as to say that a serious student of physics can obtain a complete theoretical education of the subject by studying (and understanding) no more than the following: 1. Feynman's Lectures (a 3 volume set), 2. the Course of Theoretical Physics by Landau and Lifshitz (a 10 volume set), and 3. the numerous mathematical concepts that are referenced by each volume of these two works, which are available from a study of Arfken, or even better, Morse and Feshbach. I am certainly not implying that this is easy, since a true mastery of all of these texts would probably require 5-7 years for a very good student."
15,0805390456,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8660547-ka-yap,5,This book Provides some wonderful and accessible explanations. This is not a good standalone physics textbook but a great accompaniment to one.

If you read the bio's for the US Physics Team, you will regularly find the sharpest high school minds have been inspired by reading Feynman's Lectures. It is inconceivable that one single person, Richard Feynman, can know/understand this amount of material and explain it all so thoroughly. You really need to have taken Physics already prior to diving into these volumes to fully appreciate the clarity that Feynman conveys on these topics.You can actually see this entire 3-volume series online at https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/Feynman has another book called ""Six Easy Pieces"", which is directly taken from these lectures:Six Easy Pieces (1994)Chapters: Atoms in motion = Lectures Chapter 1 Basic Physics = Lectures Chapter 2 The relation of physics to other sciences = Lectures Chapter 3 Conservation of energy = Lectures Ch 4 The theory of gravitation = Lectures Chapter 7 Quantum behavior = Lectures Chapter 37"

Such insight.Here is an example from Ch 25, modeling the shock absorber in a car, with an electrical circuit:From section 25-4: http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.ed... ""Suppose we have designed an automobile, and want to know how much it is going to shake when it goes over a certain kind of bumpy road. We build an electrical circuit with inductances to represent the inertia of the wheels, spring constants as capacitances to represent the springs of the wheels, and resistors to represent the shock absorbers, and so on for the other parts of the automobile. Then we need a bumpy road. All right, we apply a voltage from a generator, which represents such and such a kind of bump, and then look at how the left wheel jiggles by measuring the charge on some capacitor. Having measured it (it is easy to do), we find that it is bumping too much. Do we need more shock absorber, or less shock absorber? With a complicated thing like an automobile, do we actually change the shock absorber, and solve it all over again? No!, we simply turn a dial; dial number ten is shock absorber number three, so we put in more shock absorber. The bumps are worse—all right, we try less. The bumps are still worse; we change the stiffness of the spring (dial 17), and we adjust all these things electrically, with merely the turn of a knob.This is called an analog computer. It is a device which imitates the problem that we want to solve by making another problem, which has the same equation, but in another circumstance of nature, and which is easier to build, to measure, to adjust, and to destroy!""NO other text book does this application-style so well."
26,0805390456,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1596119-michael,5,"I think physicists are geeks. Feynman is far too fascinated with obscure physical phenomena for a normal human. But hey, so am I. These lectures have some math in them, but mostly they are just packed with insight. They are a whirlwind tour through some of the most fascinating things about the world.Now, I don't like most physics books written for a popular audience. These weren't. These were written for physicists who want to take a break from the drudgery of their usual work and look at things they are probably already very familiar with in a way that will leave them thinking deeply about the world again."
