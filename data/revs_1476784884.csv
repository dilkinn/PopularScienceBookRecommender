(She is amazing)don't expect this to be a book like Erich From's The Art of Lovingit is about Mathematics of loveMathematics is the language of the universe!and yes, in theory, you can define what is love and how to solve its problems using only math.however practically, you can only implement math to situations that their data is achievable.Hannah Fry created an entertaining and at the same time thoughtful page-turner.She said something very beautiful for the introduction ""My great hope is that a little bit of insight into the mathematics of love might just inspire you to have a little bit more love for mathematics.""I think this is enough to explain the main purpose of the book.Contents:chapter 1: what are the chances of finding love?chapter 2: how important is beauty?chapter 3: how to maximize a night on the town?chapter 4: online datingchapter 5: the dating gamechapter 6: the maths of sexchapter 7: when should you settle down?chapter 8: how to optimize your wedding?chapter 9: how to live happily ever after?"

3,1476784884,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3234882-nina,3,It's a read in one sitting book. I liked it but was looking for something more profound. More cute than revelatory.

It‚Äôs good that I am for this one, too, because this work of Hannah Fry‚Äôs is awesome. (I could stop here, but I won‚Äôt, as I‚Äôll have to give some evidence as to why this work is awesome. Also, yes, I‚Äôm using the word awesome deliberately. I promise.) Where to begin? This work is a great addition to her TED talk about the mathematics of love, which is also fantastic because there are different points of emphasis in the talk as there are here, but you could consider it an introduction or preface to the book! The talk itself introduces much of what is in the book as well. (I won‚Äôt go into great detail about what is in the book, but it involves mathematics and love ü§î)This book makes some mathematical subject matter more accessible to a wide audience (myself included, because I am not a mathematician) and it is presented in an entertaining manner. While I‚Äôm certain that maybe I‚Äôm overlooking certain specific aspects of things, I‚Äôm not embittered because I don‚Äôt hold specific texts to an unreasonably high standard or give ratings based upon what I like, but rather is it good within the context of what it‚Äôs talking about and in the manner it‚Äôs presented in? In this case it‚Äôs a resounding ‚Äúyes!‚Äù I was entertained, it was easy to read, and I found myself looking certain interesting pieces up on the internet that were mentioned throughout.

It was in the stress of I do so, I will become more robot I already am, and my math-driven life will collapse to a mad scientist we all warned about. But reading this book gives me a different side, as far as I was 100% familiar with the theories, I find my freedom and chooses should start after the Math-driven decision or at least quantified to not get out of control. It is fun to read and fun to follow. I may write a general application later base on this book to come up with visualization or toolkit which can do the math algorithmically."
6,1476784884,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60814908-meghana,5,"The only problem i have with this books is that it's too short!Absolutely loved this from the start to the finish.I was inspired to buy this after listening to Hannah's TEd talk here and also some other videos featuring her in this math-youtube channel I subscribe to called numberphileI was expecting to see her deliver these nuggets of math wisdom in her witty and humorous style in the book (as she does in her videos) and boy did she deliver!The book mainly deals with the traditional concept of 'love' and everything that goes into/comes along with it and how although it may seem chemical or intuitive, most things we feel are in fact governed my math principles: It could be compatibility score calculation in online dating websites, approaching someone at a bar using Nash Equilibrium, using General Algebraic Modelling Systems to determine, how many people should you send wedding invitations to, to name a few.While I admit the book is not a sort of 'tell-all' that will give you a step-by-step algorithm on HOW to actually go about having a happily ever after (to be honest, this is a little bit what I was hoping for, myself), it does reveal a lot about human nature and how in spite of all the chaos and randomness, love indeed follows a few predictable patterns, that the author has managed to tease out using mathematical tools. This is similar to another book i loved: Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (a book about behavioral economics),but Hannah's narration and the fact that she doesn't shy away from mentioning some of HER dating disasters as well, is what won me over.I do wish there was a bit more actual math involved and we actually get down to the nitty-gritty of it, but I guess I would have to read Dr. Hannah's scientific papers for that. But this also means you need not have a STEM degree to pick this one up, although if you DO have one, i believe you would enjoy this just a little bit more. (Something like A Brief History of Time)Overall, this book gave me the feeling that this was a dinner coversation with Dr. Hannah Fry, and me - the forever alone single friend pouring out my woes - and the gentle eyed, red haired Dr, pretty much giving me the 'there are many fish in the sea' speech, except she has mathematically backed proofs which she is silently dumbing down for me (but in a nice way, not a condescending way).Well, a girl can dream!5 stars."

10,1476784884,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7907737-john,5,"First TED book I have read and will try to hunt down more. This is basically Hannah's TED talk, but the book goes into more detail. A funny and interesting read."
11,1476784884,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33925705-shahriar-kabir,5,"Boyz! Someday I topped the mountain of fascination to mathematics by the tender age that wonder can work. By now the mountain appeared up in the sky so large that I'm on the landing point. Not for the love of mathematics but for the love it can be a short guide to geeks‚Äîa lifelong planning course though; what demands more elaborations for sure! This love is that ""love"" boys! Primitive‚Äî what we all really want to mean, the ""heart"" that never beat but we think so it does. In the social world not to be criticized and to do criticize we enlarge the meaning of love. It's the knock of the race surviving. One thing in this book missing is there's no rough sheet to keep your experiment data down. It's a book of tutorial too‚Äî a bit joke. Seriously! :PAnybody can try figuring out. Cause, Lady writer wrote this for the gents!My next target is then‚Äî Act like a lady, think like a man (Steve Harvey).

12,1476784884,http://goodreads.com/user/show/73915421-q-t-pi,3,"I didn't necessarily find this book helpful but that's unfair to the book since I wasn't exactly looking or expecting it to help me. What I did find was a thoroughly entertaining non-fiction read that attempted to quantify something most people consider to be a gut feeling: Love. Now the whole book was not about finding the one. Though it did touch on the mathematics on how to improve one's odds to 37% by rejecting the right amount of people by a certain age. The comparison of popularity on social media to sex partners and using that sort of analysis to statistically trace the spread of STD was interesting and logical. The section on marriage lost me.Using Game theory to pick up women was kinda funny. it looked at men and women as two competing sides and men had to impress a woman with gifts, but the gifts had to include the man or else the woman could just take the gifts and move on. So rather than buying her jewelry, which she could snatch and never talk to the man again, it would be best to take her on vacation, or out to dinner. My favorite part of the book was when it covered John Nash. I am familiar with Nash Equilibrium, but I obviously first recognized the name from the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind when Russell Crowe strategized with his friends on picking up women. They couldn't all compete for the same woman because they would get in each other's way and then they would be rejected by her friends because no one wants to be a second choice. Here's the clip.I would recommend anyone who wants to see something they here about on a daily basis in a different light to see if their library has a copy of this book they can check out. I wouldn't recommend buying the book though unless applying statistics to everyday life is your passion. "
13,1476784884,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6022914-james,2,"My second free Blinkist audiobook summary. To celebrate Valentine's day, they offered up a book exploring the mathematics of love, marriage, dating, sexually transmitted diseases and how many people to invite to your wedding. Fairly low-brow in places (if that's what you like) it has a tendency to assume that treating the search for a partner as a strategy to plan and follow is automatically the way to go - neither discussion of the Nash equilibrium, nor the section on game theory provided much in the way of criticism. Also, the scientist discussed in the first section sounds like a right dick - no wonder he can't get a date!"

Mathematics is about abstracting away from reality, not about replicating it. And it offers real value in the process. By allowing yourself to view the world from an abstract perspective, you create a language that is uniquely able to capture and describe the patterns and mechanisms that would otherwise remain hidden. 
 I don't really know what I was looking for. Maybe a more technical version of Modern Romance (which I loved). I really liked Hannah Fry's Hello World: Being Human in the Age of Algorithms, and I was not disappointed by this one; just, it was out of my field and I couldn't appreciate it as much. Instead of trying to ""explain"" love like Modern Romance did, The Mathematics of Love took instead several equations and explained them using ""love"" examples. I can say they were very easy to understand and that requires some talent! I really, really liked the explanations of complex math, but I'm afraid I didn't enjoy as much the rest of the book; I found it lacking of the thing I expected the most, and that is the relationship between love and math. As I said, I don't think there's nothing inherently bad in this book, it just wasn't what I was expecting it to be. What I loved and made me extra sure I'm now a Hannah Fry's fan for life, is her humour and perspective on life. Even if it was very sad not having useful math on same sex relationships, I liked that she had them into account and apologized on behalf of people that worked on the studies. I only hope to have mathematicians like her to work on capturing more aspects of reality in the future! Overall, a nice book and a 10/10 recommendation if you're interested in math, especially if you are not an expert but still want to learn some fancy equations! "
23,1476784884,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10027414-helen,3,"This is an interesting book - a followup on a TED talk - that discusses the application of mathematical methods to analyzing data on human relationships. The book is easy to read, despite introducing various equations and mathematical concepts that may be unfamiliar to the reader. The idea that math can make sense of seemingly irrational choices/behavior, further proving how endlessly useful math is, is actually an effective device to somehow humanize math itself, make it less daunting and more approachable, which was one of the purposes of the book. My own experience with math is that I passed the Regents in HS - but after that, I never studied the subject. The closest I came to studying math was a baby physics class I took in college to fulfill a science requirement for the English major I was pursuing, and despite dutifully memorizing the formulas, I was unable to plug info from word problems into the said formulas, and thus had to drop the class. Any abstraction, or cryptic symbolic denotation of information seems beyond my abilities. Years later, I took a class in C but that too was essentially a disaster. I still do not know why instructions or procedures that are not written in plain English seem to be a stumbling block. I don't hate math - I enjoy arithmetic calculations. But the shorthand of combining various concepts or numbers into symbols and then using other seemingly alien symbols to manipulate them, still is off-putting. The great thing about this book is that it takes a subject everyone is familiar with (thus everyone knows about, has direct experience with) and plugs data from studies into interesting equations and charts that make sense of the information. It's one tiny step in the direction of making math less mysterious - especially since the data consists of things or behavior we're all familiar with. The author also uses humor in the form of ""randomly"" selecting names of people/couples in her examples that refer back to pop culture figures, so you also get a few laughs of recognition, appreciating the joke, from reading the book. It is a well-written, clearly presented book, which you can read in one sitting. The illustrations were also nice - graphic art representations that resemble simplified poster art of people in various stages of meeting and so forth, with more abstract symbols occasionally alongside - perhaps to visually associate that there probably is a mathematical ""order"" or pattern even to the seeming chaos of finding a significant other and so forth. There's an interesting discussion of the simple algorithm the mathematicians who founded OkCupid use to determine compatibility and suggest dates. Of course, even with this, there's no way of knowing if the person you meet is anyone you might want to meet even if your tastes, political views, and so forth, are similar. She says that many who do marry these days met on an online dating site; on the other hand, the divorce rate seems unaffected by the rise of online dating and marriages resulting from it - the ""enhanced compatibility"" that's delivered by online dating, hasn't seen a drop in the divorce rate. How to stay together, and who is likely to stay together, is the topic of the final chapter - which follows a very interesting chapter on wedding planning. The pattern of escalation in arguing is shown to be similar to tension leading to nuclear war, with a negative comment leading to much more negative result than a positive comment. Positive comments built step-wise in smaller increments to a positive conversation in comparison to negative comments which can plunge the conversation into an abyss of negativity (what the author calls a spiral of negativity) much more rapidly. The problem is, the participants are starting from inherent mistrust - if they have had problems - and so bona fides have to be proven all over again, thus the baby steps of building trust or even having a positive, validating, healthy conversation - whereas negativity once again simply confirms the pre-existing or established negative view of the other and thus the rapid, steep fall-off of the conversation into a pit of negativity. It is more difficult (or slower) to build up trust once it's been broken whereas the slide into negativity is almost immediate after one negative comment is rapid and unfortunately for many couples, irreversible. An outbreak of anger is an elemental emotion that is probably akin to the rapid expansion of fire - it's possible though that anger may be ""useful"" if both parties know their relationship cannot last, in that it affords a useful springboard into the next phase of their lives, and can give each former partner a target of blame/recrimination and so forth. This sounds like an ugly picture of divorce - but it might give each ex a structure or provide a seemingly rational reason as to why the marriage foundered. Had the couple gotten along up until they broke up, then there would always be the question as to why they broke up, if they were getting along. The author states that couples that do argue, and let anger out all along instead of keeping it bottled up, are more likely to stay together. Thus, it's not necessarily the always ""calm"" couples that are always in agreement that stay together - there's nothing wrong with having disagreements, as long as they do not get out of hand, or lead to ongoing bitterness. It may be healthier to have disagreements in the long term, rather than keep conflict bottled up. This was a thought-provoking book that should be of interest to anyone interested in how math procedures/equations/methods can make sense of data on human relationships - and definitely makes math itself less ""forbidding"" or mysterious.

(I‚Äôll link a few of her videos at the bottom of this review.)She is one of my absolute favourite celebrities: she talks about such interesting stuff, articulates it brilliantly, yet also is absolutely HILARIOUS and can make me laugh until I hurt. She has recently published a new book called ‚ÄòHello World‚Äô, which is about the pros and cons of human/algorithm behaviour. Given that she is publishing her third book, I thought I would start off with reading this one.What a joy. Given how short it is, anyone could just devour this in one swift day but I am very glad I didn‚Äôt. It is the sort of book which, after every chapter, actually makes you want to STOP and contemplate what has been said. Usually, I am the sort of reader who likes to gobble up books very quickly so for me to deliberately slow down and think about every page is incredibly rare. Whilst this book does have its silly moments which hold it back from being a genuine romance self-help book (not a complaint by the way - I LOVED all the silly parts!), some parts of it could probably help some people in life! At the very least, it is a very funny and informative read about how game theory can be applied to romantic situations and the mathematics of human psychology within relationships.Chapter 1: What are the Chances of Finding Love? - in which she discusses romance criteria and using algorithms to predict how many potential suitors there are for you in the world. Chapter 2: How Important is Beauty? - The ‚ÄúDiscrete Choice Theory‚Äù is explained. Very interesting stuff!Chapter 3: How to Maximise a Night on the Town. - Is it statistically more likely for you to succeed if you are the one asking the other person out or if you just sit back, wait for people to come to you, and then get the option to accept or reject? The answer is here!Chapter 4: Online Dating. - Mathematical tips for choosing the best profile picture. (I kid you not.)Chapter 5: The Dating Game. - What men have to do to impress and ensure for the best results; the ‚ÄúEligible Bachelor Paradox‚Äù - yep, that genuinely exists - and the mathematics of infidelity. (Including a discussion on the ‚ÄòPrisoner Dilemma‚Äô and how it relates to that!)Chapter 6: The Maths of Sex. - Explanation of the mathematical ‚Äòsex network‚Äô and how to track down ‚Äòhubs‚Äô to statistically prevent the spread of STDs. (As Hannah strongly emphasises at the beginning of the chapter, the ‚ÄòMaths of Sex‚Äô is not there to help you get better at it!)Chapter 7: When Should You Settle Down? - This contains a mathematical problem I had heard of before and is still one of my favourites: the Secretary Problem and the 37% rule. Applicable to all areas of life, not just romance!Chapter 8: How to Optimise Your Wedding. - How to use probability to invite the right number of guests to ensure against over/under-attendance...and also how to use probability to help out with the table planning to ensure for greatest happiness of guests. (As she quite rightly points out, you don‚Äôt want any brawls outside the building between the guests on your big day! I wonder if she‚Äôs seen Four Weddings and a Funeral? One of my favourite films which I also recommend a lot, but I digress.)Chapter 9: How to Live Happily Ever After. - The Marriage Equation which prevents divorce!I read most of this book in physical format but some parts I did listen to on audiobook. The audiobook is narrated by Hannah Fry herself, which makes it a million times more enjoyable. The only problem with the audiobook is that there are quite a lot of graphs and tables to look at; even though Audible said a PDF would be provided for reference, when the book arrived in my library, there was no such PDF.

It talks about finding a partner either by direct meeting or online and till the whole run up to organising marriage. Mathematically speaking it deals with concepts of differential equations that deal with arms race. Game theory, stable marriage problem, optimal stopping ,constrained optimization and gives an overall picture of it. As a student studying these concepts just as is this book was a fresh perspective from an application perspective. A must read for a fun perspective on mathematics."

Nicely written and effectively explained. "

The book expands a bit on Fry's TED talk and adds new elements, but you will know the most interesting bits if you've seen the video. Just a note here: if you're looking for a love manual, go somewhere else. This is much more a book on the love of math than the math of love."

So aim high, and aim frequently: the math says so."" Other part:""Now, I always thought that good relationships were about compromise and understanding, and so would have guessed that it was best to aim for a really high negativity threshold. A relationship where you give your partner room to be themselves and only bring up an issue if it becomes a really big deal. But actually, the team found that the exact opposite was true. The most successful relationships are the ones with a really low negativity threshold. In those relationships, couples allow each other to complain, and work together to constantly repair the tiny issues between them. In such a case, couples don‚Äôt bottle up their feelings, and little things don‚Äôt end up being blown completely out of proportion. This isn‚Äôt the end of the story, however. Living happily ever after isn‚Äôt just about being comfortable complaining. For a start, it‚Äôs worth adding that the language you use in your conversation should still be open and understanding, and there‚Äôs always more room to respect your partner as an individual, rather than allowing yourself to feel like the victim of their behaviour. But I for one like the idea that mathematics leaves us with a positive message for our relationships, reinforcing the age-old wisdom that you really shouldn‚Äôt let the sun go down on your anger."""

It's written in a very playful spirit, and the writing is laugh-out-loud funny in places. Fry covers everything from strategies for optimizing your online dating profile, to making marriage last, and her conclusions are actually pretty compelling, especially as the math tends to support strategies that already seem sensible, such as gathering up your courage and striking up more conversations to increase your odds of success in hooking up with someone you're actually interested in. Fry's mathematical recommendations are occasionally counter-intuitive, though, such as her conclusion that your optimal online dating profile pic is actually one that shows your unique looks, even if that includes baldness, a big nose, or extra weight. This is a TED Book, and it reads like a TED Talk. It's light and fun and delivers some interesting aha's, and Fry's enthusiasm for her field of study is hard to resist. I think it might be a fun book to put in the hands of a geometry- or calculus-hating teenager who finds math irrelevant or worthless. This might change their thinking a bit."

52,1476784884,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3167433-sharla,5,"Even though the title sounds relatively cheesy, I loved this book from beginning to end. It was a love story about mathematics, embedded within a thematic exposition of how math can articulate the abstract concepts around human emotion and partnering. The author's tone was the perfect balance of presenting authentic logic and scientific concepts but in a lighthearted and simple to grasp perspective. Her examples of how to use the concepts were funny and relatable, and really made the complexity of the math easy to understand. I chuckled many times, and swooned often at the beautiful ways in which she described the elegance of math. Some of my very favorite quotes:""Mathematics is the language of nature.""""Mathematics is about abstracting away from reality, not about replicating it. And it offers real value in the process. By allowing yourself to view the world from an abstract perspective, you create a language that is uniquely able to capture and describe the patterns and mechanisms that would otherwise remain hidden.""""...mathematics has a beauty that encapsulates the realistic, the idiosyncratic, and the abstract."""

The math rules for placing the wedding guests around tables and the divorce prognosis are quite inspiring. Not least, the analysis of being active and passiv is very interesting. However, the probability theory applying in choosing a partner sounds fishy. It is cruel to give up a loving boy only because ‚Äûaccording to my calculation my idealst boyfriend will appear three years later‚Äú. For math, it is just an unpredictable error, but for me, it may be a huge regret. Besides, how romantic it will be if love can be calculated?! Common sense tells us, the more men one knows, the more possible one finds the ideal one. But it is very conditional. Sticking to the principle blindly is definitely a waste of time and energy. And flirting can be very difficult for some people too. Fortunately, there are so many other interesting things in our loving modern world. :)"

This was an audiobook for me, read by Fry herself ‚Äì usually, I groan when I discover ‚Äúread by the author‚Äù on the disc, but Fry is a master: her voice is seductive and lovely, and she knows exactly how to hit the notes of playfulness, irony, etc. which can sometimes elude a more dispassionate reader. Fry is a computer scientist and mathematician and her subject here is how algorithms can shed light on matters of the heart, from how do you know when you‚Äôve dated enough and it‚Äôs time to get married (short answer: after you‚Äôve reached 31.7% of your dating life, choose the next partner who‚Äôs better than any previous partner) to the benefits of a wingman and how to select one. It‚Äôs all very entertaining if perhaps a bit superficial, but it whet my appetite for her more ambitious audiobook, Hello World, which I will be looking forward to next.Grade: A-"

Much of the ultimate advice can be found in any self-help book (be more open-minded with what you're looking for, be yourself, make the first move, etc), but Hannah Fry shows statistical and algorithmic evidence for why those lessons tend to work empirically.*Note: this book does not guarantee you will find love, date well, or marry at the right time. There are real-world limitations to what math can do. There will always be an uncontrollable X factor in any relationship. But, as Fry quotes from a statistician, ""All models are wrong, but some are useful.""References to the studies mentioned are found in the back, and I plan to delve further into them.Recommended for those who love patterns, and those who need dating advice."

The book has the interesting premise. It is less of an instruction manual of guiding you in the area of love, but more of a recording of statistical observations of areas related to love, and generalising these into the most appropriate mathematical models, then using these mathematical models, to come up with some hypotheses about human behaviour with regard to love. If Aziz Ansari's Modern Romance is a general qualitative investigation into love, this book would be its general quantitative investigation equivalent. Highly recommended for those who had enjoyed that book. "

It would either be good or cheesy or intellectual or disgusting... This book is not exactly an intellectual read or a moral one... There were some decent calculations. Then it headed to strategy, very similar to the whole pick-up artist stuff, on how to find and nab someone for sex - and I thought to myself, great, a woman writing a book about how men can trick and use women at the most efficient pace. The author I suppose ran out of relevant things to say about love (misleading title pet peeve) and more to say about using people for sex. Very disappointing actually, although I suppose useful for the average manipulative loser. The book is not totally bad, there were good parts, but I can't think of anyone who would benefit by reading this."

Hanna writing has a conversational tone that's a joy to read. Her love of math is obvious and it shines through in the prose. It is a light read that will leave you with a smile. If you have an hour to kill and aren't looking for a mental strain, this is the book for you.Unfortunately, the book's title is rather misleading. There are no proofs and not so much as a mention of an ultimate equation. It's difficult to ascertain who would benefit from reading this. For those who already understand the underlying math, the book's thesis is banal. Anyone wishing to gain a deeper comprehension of the math will be sorely disappointed as Mrs. Fry goes out of her way to avoid any scholarly details.In conclusion, the book only rates three stars. It's well written and entertaining but wholly lacking in depth."

This comes from human natural react to genetic mutation.-Anyway in real life, people are also drawn to asymetrical characteristics. We all have certain personality traits we find particular attractive in a partner (such as easy-going, or determined etc). They are reflected in our preference for different faces.-Decoy effect (the behavior when people making decision based on the options available to them at the time) can be applied in your personal life in many way including how to choose friends to make you more outstanding in the eyes of others.-In order to maximize your chance to win in situations where multiple adversaries compete against one another for some sort of pay-off, apply game theory, approach first, aim high, aim frequently.-Online dating doesn't always work well because its algorithm bases on calculating what characteristic we want in future partner, the problem is that we don't really know what we want until we find it in the case of love. Based on Okcupid statistic result, afraid of being rejected and humiliated, people often hesitate to approach the one that they consider the hottest. Hence, showing what make you different including the thing that some people might not like appears to be a good strategy in dating online.-In a connection network, finding the hubs is critical and one of the ways to detect them is to ask for the partner of the targets. This simple yet effective method has been used to understand epidemic and STDs.-In a situations when a host is searching for something and want to know the best time to stop looking (such as in the case of when to settle down to marriage), reject the first 37% candidates (or first ones in 37% of your total timeline), pick the next one you prefer above all other. This strategy will maximize the chance you win the best options.-Data shows that good relationships are the ones with low negativity threshold mean that couples allow each other to complain and work together to constantly repair the tiny issues between them.

I did enjoy it, however, and I can hardly mind the lack of proper proofs in a popular science publication.Unfortunately I have read a translation, so I was unable to read Hannah's witty and funny writing in her own words, but even in translation the humor is not lost.

The Mathematics of Love provided some neat insights into romance. It discussed why you should approach girls at parties (rather than try to have them approach you), how to mathematically plan a wedding, and two important equations to use in a relationship. Fry didn't go too deep in the math, which I was fine with since I cared more about the results than the proofs. It's a pretty quick and not mathematically challenging read. I'd recommend this to anyone interested in math, love, or psychology."

Although I wouldn't consider myself a math-phobe, I'd have to say I'm not conversant in anything beyond algebra 2. I was completely out of my depth when Ms. Fry included the equations that supported her points, but luckily these were balanced by very amusing insights and examples, such as how to seat Bruce, Luke and a Dalmatian puppy at the same wedding as the Joker, Darth and Cruella ... you gotta love it.

Dr Hannah does not go on to present universal mathematical laws for a brilliant love life, instead she is showing how mathematics can be relevant even to something that is classically seen as polar. She has presented some elementary models, discussed some complex models, tales of mathematicians who actually employed such models (and had great success) and at the end discusses how maths can really help us and why not to get careless with it. The book is interesting and amusing with some real, backed-up conclusions. Rating: 7/10"

I haven't done much maths since high school, but I still think that it's really interesting and important and Hannah Fry excels at elucidating that. I loved how she offered lots of practical advice, was pretty upfront about heterosexual research, and used a lot of disciplines--psychology, sociology, biology etc.--in addition (lol) to maths to understand how relationships work. the book was definitely geared to western ideas and norms of romantic love, but that is okay!

Unfortunately though when I read this book there was nothing new that I hadn‚Äôt heard her already explain so it was kind of disappointing. I also think a lot of the ideas in this book sound nice as theories but aren‚Äôt very practical. I don‚Äôt see how you could accurately predict the percentage of people that would find you attractive, or how likely someone is to come to your wedding, and if those figures aren‚Äôt right then the whole equation is useless.

That is, it explains phenomenon in human relations in mathematical models, but does not attempt to advise how to best conquer the dating scene. I feel like many of the book's low reviews came from people expecting the latter. If you approach the book with the correct mindset, it is pretty interesting. However, it is expensive, given the length. "

The author makes statements based on mathematical theories but then applies them to romantic scenarios as though they are facts, without considering the myriad of additional factors that could negate the assumption. It's frustrating because many of these hypotheses could be tested, but the author either fails to take this additional step or does not report them."

This book, I think, is a successful attempt at doing just that. And if you're not here for the math (you monster!) it is still an entertaining book from start to finish."

I would have preferred a lot more detail. "

I think there are a few minor mistakes in the book, but none that detract from the book. And as a bonus, one of the footnotes even made me laugh."
86,1476784884,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2347646-arlette-sjerp,4,"This book was such an easy read, which I hadn't really expected from the title. It's also very funny, and the author receives bonus points for using names from Friends and Harry Potter for her examples - oops, I'm sorry, I meant completely randomly chosen names, of course. Very much worth reading!"
87,1476784884,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33596716-thegirlwhoreads,1,"Disappointing. Read it only if you're interested in the mechanics behind dating sites or maybe a cursory understanding of some mathematical concepts such as Game Theory, Drake's Equation etc. I didn't expect it to be profound or anything but still, this felt like a waste of paper. "
88,1476784884,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3460646-butterfly92,4,"I only decided to read this book because it was my ""suprizing"" daily reccommendation on Feb 14th. I did enjoy it because it had some quite interesting facts and data on the topic. It also makes me laugh how people still think they can predict/calculate love. As if!"
89,1476784884,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31654568-reem-hk,3,"Pretty easy to read; however, I wouldn't connect these two topics, I feel like they're too different to be compared. The mathematical examples referred to were interesting though, but not the most necessary to explain the point. I just didn't get the point of the book."
90,1476784884,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35196943-malie,4,Love me some algorithms with humour thrown in. A very short book; would have happily listened to Hannah Fry reading for her own work for 6x longer. ‚ÄòHello World‚Äô by the same author is less niche and highly recommended.
