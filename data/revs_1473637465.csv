0,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may,3,"It is not easy to say anything bad about this book. Not because there aren’t issues with it - there are - but because this was Rosling’s last passion project that he completed while battling through his final months with pancreatic cancer. If you are unmoved by his son’s final words, then you are a much stronger person than I am.Mr Rosling is indeed passionate about his work.  Factfulness is a highly-accessible, informal read in which the author frequently delights at the progress made across the globe. And progress has definitely been made. Perhaps the most shocking fact this book reveals, for me, was how many people truly seem to believe the world is in a worse state than it was decades, or even centuries, ago.Rosling constantly reminds us - a little condescendingly, if I'm honest - that even the smartest of smart folks get his little questionnaire about the state of the world completely wrong. Factfulness has a very similar premise to Pinker's  Enlightenment Now, though Rosling's work seems much more rooted in numbers and solid facts. I like numbers. Numbers do not lie. However, the way they are presented, the emphasis placed on certain numbers over others can be misleading. Despite cautioning against certain misconceptions, Rosling et al often uses these misconceptions to their own advantage.One example is this question:
In all low income countries across the world today, how many girls finish primary school?A: 20 percentB: 40 percentC: 60 percent
There are a few problems with this. You can probably guess that the answer is C. The way this question is written is deliberate: Is it 20%? No! Is it 40%? No! Oh my goodness, it's a whopping 60%?!But let's take a second look at this. Firstly, what is a ""low-income"" country? We are never told. I combed through the notes and appendices at the back to make sure it wasn't clarified somewhere. It could be what Rosling refers to as ""Level 1"" but, as he already told us, even some people at Level 3 are below the U.S. poverty line, so who knows exactly what constitutes ""low-income""? Secondly, what is ""primary school""? This differs from country to country. In some countries with middle schools, primary schooling might only be up to 7 or 8 years old. And, thirdly, the deliberate format of the question seeks to play up the 60% statistic. This still means that hundreds of millions of girls in ""low-income"" countries (40% is HUGE) receive no or incomplete primary education, and we can only know that 60% finish some kind of primary schooling of unspecified length. The book is split into sections, dismantling various kinds of misconceptions based on human instincts to generalize, fear and blame. What's strange, though, is how the authors often fall prey to the same instincts. Rosling cautions us to not give weight to averages - because they often hide a spread of values - but the majority of his graphs and charts use averages. The argument is built on averages.Additionally, he spends a whole page discussing the limitations of Wikipedia, noting a particular case where Wikipedia was missing 78% of a list of terrorism deaths in 2015. He then proceeds to use Wikipedia as a source ten times.The book's argument is far stronger when it focuses on things being BETTER rather than good. It might be difficult to convince me that 60% of girls finishing primary school is a positive statistic, but showing an increase in the numbers over time - slow or otherwise - is much more convincing. And, as the Roslings conclude, things are getting better by most measurable standards across the globe.I do also think something huge is missing from this book and it is an integral part of the misconception and misrepresentation of the state of the world. It seems like Rosling was a good, kind person. Which is possibly why he failed to consider a little something called motive. Why might someone want to present the ""developing"" world as terrible and backward and incapable of ever modernizing? Perhaps some do indeed wish to believe that western hegemony is “natural” and that the rest of the world is backward. Could it be that part of the misconception is rooted in the old imperialist notion that the rest of the world can't possibly be as good? Isn't America held up by the insistence that it is ""the greatest country on earth""?Rosling suggests that the western dismissal of ""developing"" countries as destined to stay the way they are because of their ""culture"" is caused by mistakes made by innocent human instincts. A skeptic might wonder if it is really all an innocent mistake.I've said more than I meant to here, but I guess it's the kind of book that encourages you to think about things. For that, at least, it deserves three stars.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"
1,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62787798-bill-gates,5,"I talk about the developed and developing world all the time, but I shouldn’t.My late friend Hans Rosling called the labels “outdated” and “meaningless.” Any categorization that lumps together China and the Democratic Republic of Congo is too broad to be useful. But I’ve continued to use “developed” and “developing” in public (and on this blog) because there wasn’t a more accurate, easily understandable alternative—until now.I recently read Hans’ new book Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World—and Why Things Are Better Than You Think. In it, he offers a new framework for how to think about the world. Hans proposes four income groups (with the largest number of people living on level 2).This was a breakthrough to me. The framework Hans enunciates is one that took me decades of working in global development to create for myself, and I could have never expressed it in such a clear way. I’m going to try to use this model moving forward.Why does it matter? It’s hard to pick up on progress if you divide the world into rich countries and poor countries. When those are the only two options, you’re more likely to think anyone who doesn’t have a certain quality of life is “poor.”Hans compares this instinct to standing on top of a skyscraper and looking down at a city. All of the other buildings will look short to you whether they’re ten stories or 50 stories high. It’s the same with income. Life is significantly better for those on level 2 than level 1, but it’s hard to see that from level 4 unless you know to look for it.The four levels are just one of many insights in Factfulness that will help you better understand the world. I’m excited that Hans’ publisher Flatiron Books plans to donate 5,000 copies to Books for Africa and Reader to Reader—two organizations that encourage reading in underserved communities. Hans worked on the book until his last days (even bringing several chapters with him in the ambulance to the hospital), and his son Ola and daughter-in-law Anna helped finish it after he passed.The bulk of the book is devoted to ten instincts that keep us from seeing the world factfully. These range from the fear instinct (we pay more attention to scary things) to the size instinct (standalone numbers often look more impressive than they really are) to the gap instinct (most people fall between two extremes). With each one, he offers practical advice about how to overcome our innate biases. Gates Notes Insiders can get a free preview of the gap instinct chapter.Hans argues that these instincts make it difficult to put events in perspective. Imagine news coverage about a natural disaster—say, a tornado that kills 10 people in a small town. If you look at only the headlines, you’ll view the event as an unbearable tragedy (which it is). But if you put it in the context of history, you’ll also know that tornadoes today are a lot less deadly than they used to be, thanks to advanced warning systems. That’s no consolation to the loved ones of those who died, but it matters a great deal to everyone who survived the tornado.In other words, the world can be both bad and better. That idea drives the work Melinda and I do every day, and Hans articulates it beautifully in Factfulness. It’s a great companion to Steven Pinker’s 
 Enlightenment Now
 (although Hans is a little less academic than Pinker is). With rare exceptions, most of the miracles of humankind are long-term, constructed things. Progress comes bit by bit. We’ve cut the number of people living in extreme poverty by half over the last twenty years, but there was never a morning when “POVERTY RATES DROP INCREMENTALLY” dominated newspaper headlines.Another remarkable thing about Factfulness—and about Hans himself—is that he refuses to judge anyone for their misconceptions. Most writers would beat people up for their ignorance, but he doesn’t. Hans even resists going after the media. Instead, he tells you about the history of his own ignorance. He explains that these instincts make us human, and that overcoming them isn’t easy.That’s classic Hans. He was always kind, often patient, and never judgmental. He spent his life not only understanding how global health was improving but sharing what he learned in a fun, clear way with a broad set of people. If you never met Hans or watched one of his many TED talks, Factfulness will help you get a sense of why he was so special. I wish I could tell Hans how much I liked it. Factfulness is a fantastic book, and I hope a lot of people read it."
2,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,2,"78th book for 2018.I hate TED talks. This book is mostly like an extended TED Talk. Ipso facto I mostly hated this book.Rosling's central thesis is that in most measures of human development the World is much better than we'd think. That part of the book I enjoyed, though the data backing this up could have been presented in a far shorter book. Rosling spends a lot of time talking about the important people (e.g., bankers, Davos, bankers at Davos, TED talks) that he's presented this findings too. And he repeats and repeats and repeats his horror that people are so so ignorant not to know ""basic"" facts about the World (like probable demographic shifts over the next 100 years). This is all tedious and doesn't really help. He also gives a series of annoying tips about how to read statistics. The central problem with his optimistic World view is that it ignores all the declining global environmental indicators. This is not a side issue. Environmental indicators are declining precisely because the World is developing and consuming more and more (which is not to say that most of the damage is done by the most developed). It is an impossibility that most people in the World can reach Rosling's Stage 3, let alone Stage 4, with current technologies. The World couldn't even survive the World population eating meat at the same rate as people in Europe, the US or Japan, let alone adopting the rest of their lifestyle.I agree entirely with Rosling's point that people will want to reach Stage 4 (and have a right to do so), but his sort of glib analysis of how everything is getting better, allows decision makers in the West to continue to ignore this issue and live in the vague hope that a techno-fix will arrive just in time. I have no doubt this was why Rosling was so popular at Davos. 2-stars."
3,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25493797-khurram,4,"A very good book, with a very important message about finding facts from data, and more importantly finding the truth in all the information fed to us.This is the a last effort from Hans Rowling, and him long time contributors (family). It contains real stories and new ways of looking at world data as well as new ways of thinking.The message I really took away from this book is the world is not perfect. We have a lot of work to do, but to not forget all we have achieved, to take encouragement from this, to continue to improve."
4,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,1,"To me, this is the prime example of why the replication crisis is the next big thing and how biased some fields of sciences have already become to culminate in such extremely suspicious examples of: “Go on, everything's great, here, look at the facts and studies I collected and did to proof what I think is true.“ This thing is really dangerous because it uses instrumentalized science towards a certain consensus, nothing more than hiding an agenda behind manipulated facts out of context, it does nearly anything criticized in the debate about the replication crisis good science shouldn´t do.It´s both my first and possibly last 1 star rating and my farewell from reading anything heavily influenced by politics, economics, statistics, faith,… because it destroys the reputation of and trust in science by misusing methods because of egoistic interests. The conversation about it has become so toxic and useless that I quite kind wanted to draw a final line, after I had to do the same with many political and economic themes to avoid waste of energy in useless debates, and will focus instead on the true, natural sciences, where nobodys´ beliefs to have the ultimate solution and is instead modest, self-reflecting, open to criticism, and grateful to be part of a line of giants that built the modern world. Instead of inventing BS theories to destroy it.Shall people debate, fight, and finally kill over theories that are not proven if they wish, I see much more sense in exploring the wonders of nature and awakening interest in them instead of continuing the debates of narcissistic, egomaniac old man who believed they invented theories of everything. Each one of them for themselves, without even recognizing that there can´t be so many absolute truths. No physicist, mathematician,… would ever do something like that because they know that the rules of nature are not fully understood and that they could do research about a theory that could turn out wrong. See the difference?One of the craziest things about it is that so many facts are ignored and that alternative government and economic models never mentioned, his whole work looks like a status quo advertisement with avoiding any kind of criticism and that he was adored in Davos and similar circles should say the most about what his main fans intended with spreading his words. The frightening thing is that onesided propaganda like this has read such a widespread, penetration rate, and overrepresentation in biased mainstream news media and books, that both alternatives and solutions to the real, massive problems are ignored. Remember nature destruction, social inequality, developing countries, incarceration rates, the sixth mass extinction, radicalization, opioid crises, climate change, weakening of democracy all over the world,… Rosling is driveling about inequality, habitat destruction, climate change,... and how huge these problems are while he is exponentiating them by delaying and preventing change and cementing the bad status quo. The sad thing is that I am sure that he thought about himself as a good person, that he didn´t understand the mechanisms of power that influenced his work, how he was instrumentalized himself. He certainly was no bad human because he did work in healthcare in Africa, quite kind of split personality that didn´t know and understood that his agenda caused the suffering he tried to reduce. The objective worldview he imagined having and spreading is a symptom of that problem. It would interest me how people that haven´t been born in wealthy nations see this.That poor people in Africa now have 50 to 75 cents more per day or that we gave them some drugs and contraceptives after refusing it for decades, that´s the big deal. Not mentioning why they are poor in the first place included or why more and more people are poor in the rich, industrialized countries impoverished from the point on Keynesian economics was weakened with the rise of neoliberalism in the 70s. Looking at the statistics, the time between WW2 and the beginning of the destruction of welfare state, social justice, functioning democracy,.. in the 70s, those were the best time for many humans who could earn a living, weren´t incarcerated or so indoctrinated that there was even an open debate about those things, not like nowadays where nobody mentions any alternative to the system of self destruction. Many were shocked by Friedman and Hayek before they became famous and influential, because their ideas were so sick and inhuman, giving predators license and help against the weaker and poorer ones with the help of the same state they want to be crushed. It´s as if one has kids and finds it completely ok when the strongest and the smartest kids of the whole school form a kind of oligarchy, control the teachers and principal by lobbying, and grade themselves, while bullying more and more basic, before normal, rights out of the oppressed majority, killing some of them in the process or making their lives so miserable that they can´t survive without basic human needs. What is still the difference between a dictatorship and neoliberalism except that the goddess/god emperor is not such a dishonest lier and openly says what she/he thinks and that everyone making problems will be exterminated instead of doing as if she/he is a good person? But as so often, the stupidest and most destructive ideas are the most successful. The character question is especially interesting in this one, because I like to listen to TED talks, etc.during everyday activities and housework and it´s amazing how much arrogance and self-importance, many seem to see as charisma, can float out of one persons voice. This is Ayn Rand always smiling and with friendly fairytale teller style or Officer Barbrady with his trademark „Move along people nothing to see here“ or any government in the history of humanity telling people that they are competent, all is fine, there is nothing to worry, and certainly no problems because all is getting better. I´m sick of this stuff, it made me quit mass media and news a few years ago, quit friendships with humans who are sadly part of the problem and became ignorant to a level that was unacceptable and dangerous, and meanwhile, it infiltrated so many humanities that I can´t even read a few pages without getting confronted with this BS. He was a regular speaker at Davos, the world economic forum, anything neoliberal and anti-welfare state possible, who do people think benefited the most from his appeasing, condescending drivel and lying with statistics? Anyone except for the already rich and mighty? Come on, this dude did nice, but he is like Milton Friedman, such a gentle, calm, always smiling, never angry guy, so friendly to his students. Humankind, what´s wrong with you…I would be so interested to see how future history in a few centuries will talk about this era and if they would extrapolate how many people have been killed by this kind of economic policy we are practicing for over half a century now and that is destroying the planet.Sorry folks, this is one of my last rants, I am sick and tired of this and want to focus on true science and great fiction instead, not this disturbed fairytales for adults who never had the chance to built a free opinion because most of the media they consume to stay informed and get educated avoids any criticism of the current economic system.Because of much talk and discussion about the replication crisis with friends and in general, I will add these thoughts to all following nonfiction books dealing with humanities in the future, so you might have already seen it. Sorry folks, this is one of my last rants, I am sick and tired of this and want to focus on true science and great fiction instead, not this disturbed fairytales for adults who never had the chance to built a free opinion because most of the media they consume to stay informed and get educated avoids any criticism of the current economic system.Without having read or heard ideas by Chomsky, Monbiot, Klein, Ken Robinson, Monbiot, Peter Singer, William McDonough, Ziegler, Colin Crouch, Jeremy Rifkin, David Graeber, John Perkins, and others, humans will always react to people like me, condemning the manipulation Rosling was practicing with terrifying success, with anger and refusal.These authors don´t hide aspects of the truth and describe the real state of the world that should be read instead of epic facepalms like this. They don´t predict the future and preach the one only, the true way, ignoring anything like black swans, coincidences or the, for each small child logical, fact that nobody knows what will happen, and collect exactly the free available data people such as Rosling wanted to ignore forever.Some words about the publication crisis that even have some positive points at the end so that this whole thing is not that depressing. One could call the replication crisis the viral fake news epidemic of many fields of science that was a hidden, chronic disease over decades and centuries and has become extremely widespread during the last years, since the first critics began vaccinating against it, provoking virulent counterarguments. I don´t know how else this could end than with nothing else than paradigm shifts, discovering many anachronisms, and a better, fact- and number based research with many control instances before something of an impact on the social policy gets accepted. A few points that led to it: I had an intuitive feeling regarding this for years, but the replication crisis proofed that there are too many interconnections of not strictly scientific fields such as economics and politics with many humanities. Look, already some of the titles are biased towards a more positive or negative attitude, but thinking too optimistic is the same mistake as being too pessimistic, it isn´t objective anymore and one can be instrumentalized without even recognizing it. In natural sciences, theoretical physicists, astrophysicists, physicians… that were friends of a certain idea will always say that there is the option of change, that a discovery may lead to a new revolution, and that their old work has to be reexamined. So in science regarding the real world the specialists are much more open to change than in some humanities, isn´t that strange? It would be as if one would say that all humans are representative, similar, that there are no differences. But it´s not, each time a study is made there are different people, opinions, so many coincidences, and unique happenings that it´s impossible to reproduce it. Scandinavia vs the normal world. The society people live in makes happiness, not theoretical, not definitive concepts. One can manipulate so many parameters in those studies that the result can be extremely positive or negative, just depending on what who funds the study and does the study wants as results.  One could use the studies she/ he needs to create an optimistic or a pessimistic book and many studies about human nature are redundant, repetitive, or biased towards a certain result, often an optimistic outcome or spectacular, groundbreaking results. Do you know who does that too? Statistics, economics, politics, and faith.  I wish I could be a bit more optimistic than realistic, but not hard evidence based stuff is a bit of a no go if it involves practical applications, especially if there is the danger of not working against big problems by doing as if they weren´t there. A few points that lead away from it: 1.	Tech2.	Nordic model3.	Open data, open government 4.	Blockchains, cryptocurrencies, quantum computing, to make each financial transaction transparent and traceable.5.	Points mentioned in the Wiki article6.	It must be horrible for the poor scientists who work in those fields and are now suffering because the founding fathers used theories and concepts that have nothing to do with real science. They worked hard to build a career to just find out that the predecessors integrated methods that couldn´t work in other systems, let's say an evolving computer program or a machine or a human body or anywhere except in ones´ imagination. They are truly courageous to risk criticism because of the humanities bashing wave that won´t end soon. As in so many fields, it are a few black sheep who ruin everything for many others and the more progressive a young scientist is, the more he is in danger of getting smashed between a hyper sensible public awareness and the old anachronism shepherds, avoiding anything progressive with the danger of a paradigm shift or even a relativization of the field they dedicated their career to. There has to be strict segregation between theories and ideas and applications in real life, so that anything can be researched, but not used to do crazy things.I´ll add some replication crisis points in the comments, because there is no space left here."
5,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6603759-misericordia-the-serendipity-aegis,5,"This is either a very cruel book or a very fair one, and I'm not sure which one. On the one hand, the author is extremely sharp in that he realizes that bisection of the world is severely crippling to rational thinking process. When it becomes 'us' and 'them', most of our thinking processes will be black and white colored, or rather discolored. What we keep missing is that this world is complex and multifaceted enough to fit into no nice and tidy boxes. So, understanding that there are more than 2 ways to live and more than 2 types of countries and more than 2 political parties and more than 2 ways to have a prospering state governance and ... and ... and ... is precious. And it's hindered by the tribal 'us'/'them' classification.He's also very right about our usage of outdated statistics and our lack of understanding of how data works.He's very wrong about diminishing the role of mass media in development of generations of people who - know next to nothing on the scientific way of thought, cannot think for themselves, cannot see neither the big picture nor the small one;- are gullible (i.e. my 'friend' writes anything on Facebook and I go on to believe it...);- cannot distinguish between horrible, questionable and reliable sources of info (feel free to use your own classification here), i.e.: Facebooks posts, World Bank data, blog entries, articles from around the web, research of different types and other stuff - everything gets lumped in these modern heads and become a congealed mass of truth, lies, wishful thinking, misrepresented info, incomprehensible blabber...Basically, people don't know how to use healthy skepticism for the info they are being spoon-fed. The don't even realize they have this option. Some guy or gal with PHD and a bunch of publications supposedly said this and that to some blogger or journalist and this becomes the new evidence of anything: - hackers, Russian or otherwise,- chemical weapons of varied countries, - health benefits of anything, - freethinking and progressive nature of [place your religion/persuasion/political inclinations here], - bloodthirsty and dated and inhuman nature of [place your religion/persuasion/political inclinations here]... ... and this becomes the new truth, right until the new information fad comes in vogue. I don't get the reason why the author suggests chucking the 'developing'/'developed' countries significators in favor of 'Levels' 1 to 4. Probably I should read way less trash but I immediately had a flashback to Districts in Hunger Games. Anyway, why 4 groups? Why not 5? Maybe 3 would have been less confusing? Or could it be that 10 might have allowed us to explore the shades of human misery and else in more relief? Why 4? Also, the author is making a big deal out of the fact that most world's population seems to be living in the middle class... To me, the author's description of the 'middle class (Lvls 2 and 3) sounded like something not exactly from Dante's Hell but very close to it. Basically, he proves that 6 bln out of our current 7 live in various shades of misery, from abject to hopeful, which is not as ground-shaking realization as he might be thinking. The difference is that when we think of middle class, we almost never think of it in terms of his Lvls 2 and 3... Our perception is strongly rooted in what he puts in the Lvl 4 bucket. So, we are not really always thinking of the middle class, when we are thinking of it, and our perception should be more humble and terminology more precise."
6,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,5,"Rosling writes about the most important things in the world and does so in an accessible and entertaining style. He busts myths using facts. This is what non-fiction is supposed to be. Much of what ""everybody knows"" and that we read in the news every day is wrong, because hardly anyone bothers to do reality-checking. This is a recurring problem in non-fiction books, including ones about science. So, when finally someone is exposing ignorance, clarifying truth, and exploring logical implications, I am going to give him 5 stars. Gapminder and this book are great gifts to the world. Rosling will be missed. Viva facts!"
7,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23082940-justin-tate,4,"It's a shame I rarely pick up nonfiction, because I always enjoy it when I do. The premise of this one is to debunk common misconceptions people have about the world and explain how a mindset shift toward facts solves a lot of everyday problems. It's mostly optimistic, because that's what the facts are saying, but he addresses the woes too. The problem is, when asked about important world trends, nearly everyone has the wrong viewpoint. Even experts. His mission is to examine why this is and help get people out of the funk.I'm an analytical guy, so I rarely jump to extremes or find myself enraged by the news. But still, when quizzed, I also answered most of the basic fact-based questions incorrectly. It's a big world out there and so much of the good news isn't dramatic enough to break through the headline stories about plane crashes and murders.Having read this book, I feel like I have a better understanding of the power of small improvements over time and how to filter out the theatrics from the facts. He also provides some great resources where you can go if you actually want to look for facts and not narrative.Recommended for sure, but giving 4 stars instead of 5 because around the halfway point I did feel like he began beating a dead horse. The examples became too similar and lost their zeal compared to the eye-opening punch of the earlier segments. Still, it's a well-written, short book that made me feel more educated. Can't ask for much more than that!"

9,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81878289-mats-mehrstedt,2,"In the last decades of his life Hans Rosling (1948 – 2017) made a world-wide career lecturing to large corporations, Wall Street bankers, hedge fund managers and gatherings of Nobel laureates and heads of states such as in Davos, about the statistics of the world. Rosling´s son invented a software so that you could present statistics with moving, shrinking and growing bubbles in different colors, which made an otherwise boring subject highly entertaining. The program could even be sold to Google.Now, if you want to make a lot of money with people like this, you better tell them what they want to hear, or the invitations may dry up. Rosling´s message is that everything is getting better. Did you know that the number of extremely poor people have halved in the last 20 years? Did you know that the majority of the world´s population do not live in poor countries but in middle-income countries? Did you know that 80% of the world´s 1-year-olds have been vaccinated (against “some” disease)? Everything is getting better. At a slow pace, but it is getting there, so there´s no need to worry. Unless there is an outbreak of Ebola or some such thing.Rosling is not lying. Everybody can check these statistics themselves on the internet. But, as it is with statistics, you pick some and leave others out. And then there are those less-than-scientific value judgments. What is a “middle-income country”? If you look closely, if you make more than 2 dollars a day you are already there, according to Rosling. Now, if you are lucky, you might even be able to buy a bicycle and go into town and maybe even get a job in one of the garment factories! Imagine that! Progress is there! That progress is so slow that your generation and the next few ones may not live to see it should be of no concern.Why do the Africans risk their lives as refugees in the middle of all this progress? Because the EU won´t allow them to come by plane. Yes, that is a small part of the answer, but just a very small part and it does not explain why people leave their countries in the first place when there is no war.In the middle of the book Rosling has two honest pages about an African woman who talked to him after one of his lectures. She said Rosling was a good talker but he had no vision, which he found unfair. Then she said “Do you think Africans will settle with getting rid of extreme poverty and be happy living in only ordinary poverty?” She said his attitude was the same old European attitude Africans had lived with for centuries. Now, it honors Rosling that he mentions this, but he did not learn anything from it, obviously. On the very next page, as on all the others, he keeps going on as before.The over 1000-year-old nordic Edda says “One thing I know that never dies – the judgment over a dead man”.Hans Rosling was born in a working class family. He did many great things as a doctor in Africa and India. But he should have closed his ears to the siren call of fame and Big Money. He became a tranquilizer for the ruling class."
10,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen,5,"This is probably one of the most important books available today. Why? Because our world is desperately in need of a shared sense of reality, and it's very important that this reality has a solid grounding in science and reason. The book is not without its controversy. The charts and graphs mostly come from UN and World Bank statistics. Many people will argue about the ""factfulness"" of the various datasets presented in this book-- after all, your faith in the science and facts of these books also assumes your faith in the institutions collecting data (over and above other institutions like your local church). But if you do have faith in these institutions, then you'll see that just because the institutions and the data aren't perfect (just like many other things in modern life) they are improving. The relentless pursuit of progress also extends to our statistical understanding of the things around us. For my part, one of the most striking things about the book is how uncontroversial its assertions are...and how simple the statistical facts of the world can be rendered. At one point in the book, the author asks harder epistemological questions. For those who have a more mystical understanding of vaccinations, chemicals, and even modern science, the author asks ""What evidence would make you change your mind?"". Regrettably, for most of the world, the answer is this: ""If the answer benefits my tribe and its particular world-view, then yes, easily accepted....oh, and by the way, I'll use the open-mindedness of non-tribal people against themselves by sewing the seeds of skepticism while continuing to build walls to protect my tribe's worldview."" Will you ever be able to convince a climate change skeptic to accept climate change? My own very controversial answer is this: Only if you can co-opt their tribe. That is very different than getting a tribe to buy into the shared world of factfulness. My best guess is that this method of argument works within a worldview of competing tribes: Your tribe will have beneficial treatment, jobs, and prestige within this world and protection from other tribes. (Notice how the language of shared humanism is absent and the language hierarchy of tribes is emphasized).A true understanding of science requires that we always regard truths as provisional and that we look for falsifying evidence. My fear is that eventually the world will become so polluted by tribal world-views that all forms of shared factfulness will become polluted by tribalism. Zero-sum competition will lay waste to the public utility that is a shared fact-based world. There is one very controversial assertion in this book that I would like to reflect on. At several points, the author asserts that our current methods of pursuing progress are working. Child mortality rates are falling, crime is falling, battle deaths are falling, and national economies are rising out of poverty. I don't doubt the assertion within the framework of the book, but I do wonder about our current moment in history. A time when: 1- populism2- social media enhanced sectarianism3- the displacement of localisms by globalization 4- and discontent with the vast changes in technologyare leading to the most difficult problem of our time: tribalism.  As tribalism increases, our modern scientific tools for tackling climate change, political violence, disaster relief, and the fragility of the global economy deteriorate. As they deteriorate, zero-sum competition between tribes looks more logical. The tools of tribalism are becoming more visible: demonization and humiliation of enemies, the hoarding of resources, and the use of conflict over cooperation. This is not a problem I'm ready to answer right now, but Rosling's thesis that public education may restore our confidence in these tools and roll back tribalism does provide some hope if not a sufficient political answer to our current moment in history.

11,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25605420-apoorva,5,"Factfulness is written by Hans Rosling, a doctor, a researcher, and a lecturer in global health along with his son Ola and daughter-in-law Anna Rosling, both of whom were responsible for compiling the data. The data is presented in the form of bubble charts, graphs and it’s verified by international organizations.The aim of the book is to fight ignorance and dramatic worldview with well-researched facts and global statistics. This book starts off with a quick 13 question quiz to test how you see the world in general. The author then proceeds to explain the world and banish misconceptions using different instincts.
Key points 
 :
When you use the GPS in your car, it is important that it is using the right information.
It’s obsolete to divide the countries into developed and developing countries. The majority fit into developed countries. It’s proper to classify countries into 4 income levels starting from Level 1 that has poorest countries to Level 4 that has richest countries.The majority of people live in the middle and the author explains how life looks like on all levels based on his interviews with people on all levels. This new way of classification helps to understand the world in a practical way without any prejudice and misconceptions by dividing the world into two categories. You can look at the lives of people on different levels by visiting Dollar Street, a project where lives of about 300 families in more than 50 countries have been photographed and documented.
Warning: Objects in Your Memories Were Worse Than They Appear.
The author dispels the negativity instinct i.e. ‘Things are getting worse’ by presenting the improvements that happened and those that are taking place actively. Some improvements are happening so gradually that they’re inconspicuous so it’s easier to dismiss them. Small advances go unreported by the media but these changes add up in a long run. Also, people tend to glorify their pasts. I’m sure you’ve come across people who start the sentence with ‘In those good old days’, this only strengthens the negativity bias.
There’s no room for facts when our minds are occupied by fear.
The attention-grabbing news is the one that generates fear in our mind. The author explains why and how our fear instinct is invoked and urges us to understand the difference between what’s frightening and what’s dangerous as it leads us to shift our attention from something that’s risky to something that’s mildly harmful.This can cause people to make rash decisions by calling on our urgency instinct. Thinking about the worst case scenarios only makes people take quick decisions without thinking critically. 
The world cannot be understood without numbers. And it cannot be understood with numbers alone.
The size instinct leads us to get things out of proportion by shifting our focus to an individual entity. It’s important to compare a lone number with another to get a clear image for eg. We should compare data from the present with the past. Also, the most important thing is to understand what the numbers explain about the real world.The generalization instinct leads us to group together things which are unrelated and on a large scale, it forms a stereotype that can cause people to draw wrong conclusions about a certain entity. The author also illustrated how the cultures, religious values, people and nations constantly changing and progressing.
If you really want to change the world you have to understand it.
The single perspective instinct leads people to conclude that all problems have a single cause and they blame a singular identity like the government or the management while reality is much more complex than that. It’s better to be open to different ideas.
Conclusion
 :
Still I’m possibilistic. The next generation is like the last runner in a very long relay race.
The author is candid while putting forward facts and he has used experiences from his life to present his ideas. He also admits the mistakes he made in the past due to ignorance and his instincts which make reading the book an interesting experience. While reading, you can just feel how dedicated he is to his work.I don’t mean to be dramatic (!) but reading this book has really been an eye-opening experience as I got to see the world from a fresh perspective. Journalists and documentarians prefer to tell stories that create conflict and hence, they should not be relied upon to show the unfiltered picture of the world.Despite explaining how media is responsible for presenting the distorted view of the world, the author does not blame them; he blames the different instincts that guide people. In order to break away from those instincts, he urges us to constantly keep updating our knowledge and changing our views in accordance with the newly discovered facts.This book does not try to make us see the world through rose tinted glasses, far from it. The author admits that the world is still bad but there’s no denying that it has gotten better and it is getting better. This was a very insightful and informative book. I believe this book should be read by everyone.."

He had so many bright ideas. I was deeply saddened to hear of his death and I immediately shied from the postmortem released books. I did not want to be reminded. Eventually I realized my foolishness and this week I've been reading ""Factfulness"" while at the same time listening to Rosling's memoir on audio.We need to learn to hold two thoughts in our head at the same time: the world has gotten a lot better, and some things are still really bad. At the start of the book is a quiz with 13 questions, on which most people across the world score worse than if they had guessed at random. As an example, question 2: where do the majority of people live? A. Low-income countries B. Middle-income countries C. High income countries.Although I managed a high score, much because I grew up in a poverty level 2 country and saw it move to 3 within the span of a decade, this was still an incredibly insightful and useful book. It is one that everyone should read. It presents facts and anecdotes, and most of all, tools to better understand the world.Tools for factfulness:1. Gap - check for the majority2. Deterioration - expect bad news3. Linearity - not all lines are straight4. Fear - evaluate risks5. Size - put things in the right perspective6. Generalization - question your categories7. Fate - observe slow changes8. One-sidedness - get more tools9. Blame - avoid pointing fingers10. Emergency - take small stepsThe world is no longer divided into rich and poor. This category is no longer meaningful. Rosling identifies four categories depending on income. The people in the different categories live in a similar way regardless if it's China or Nigeria, Egypt or USA.Don't stress. Check your facts. The world is better than it's ever been. This does not mean there are no things to combat, it simply means that fewer people die from preventable disease than before. Mortality and births are down. Read this book, your life will be better for having done so.If you only read one book this year, or in a decade, or your life, let it be this one."
13,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37962925-scott,2,"This book came highly recommended by The Economist, amongst others, though to me it was unsurprising, lacked particularly interesting conclusions, and felt rather tedious. The work begins with a quiz consisting of 13 questions. The author claims that a 2017 study asked the same questions to 20k participants, and on average respondents got a mere 2 of the first 12 questions right, with one participant of 20k getting 11 of the 12 correct. However, my own results showed 10 / 13, and when I shared the quiz with three friends, their scores were between 8 & 10 of 13 correct. So, perhaps continuing to read the book was a mistake - effectively what follows is a question-by-question review of the statistics behind the answers - perhaps enlightening if you manage only a couple of correct answers, but rather dull if the questions seem humdrum. There are several points which dull the book: 1) assumption of linear progress - essentially the book assumes that the significant progress on key indicators is monotonically increasing with time into the future (i.e. the African middle class has increased by X over the past Y years, and at current growth rates the middle class will be Z). 2) abuse of averages - the author notes the danger of using averages to describe populations without understanding the underlying distributions, then proceeds to barrage the reader with averages while offering little sense of the underlying distributions, and so failing to address key underlying questions (is the progress indicated the result of economic growth? Mass migration to cities? Other factors?) 3) correlation is not causality - there seems to be a consistent tendency to obscure when the discussion is seeking to illustrate correlation and when he argues for a causal relationship, and as a result, it is fails to offer a compelling case for causal factors and, in many cases, even to consider underlying drivers of progress (and, therefore, to consider risks to such progress). In summary, if you score poorly on the quiz and could use a summary glance at key development statistics and how they have evolved in recent decades, this can be a useful primer. Otherwise, flip through the summaries at the end of each chapter, understand his argument that data is a better indicator of reality than media, and call it a day. "
14,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28913298-shalini,5,"""Factfulness"" is one of the most influential books published in 2018. The greatest deal about it is not the facts or fancy numbers & graphs (I still love them) it has, but that how it teaches one to think logically by taking everything to the basics rather than already starting with an opinion or using analogies to reach a conclusion. Hans Rosling wrote this book when he was on his deathbed, diagnosed with incurable pancreatic cancer. The only thing that made this drastic change in his personal life bearable was the book. He didn't live long enough to read the final draft, to get the book published, to see it become a massive success or to bliss over people reading it generations after generations. Being a doctor, Rosling spent his whole life working for the underprivileged and the unfortunate ones in different countries of the world. He was a visionary who saw the world different from us; and this is a chronicle of the success stories, experiences as well the failures that he shared with the world.STRONGLY RECOMMENDED for everyone.If you want to understand the world or improve your rational thinking, this could be one of the books to start with."
15,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,1,"“Factfulness’ is about you being convinced to view through rose-colored lenses each metaphorical cup of water provided by NGO/government/charity is half-full! The respectably-sourced graphs and charts included show the economic, health, and wealth status of the people of earth are ever climbing higher and higher statistically, so the author concludes it is logical to project that the wealth, education, and health of even the lowliest, most impoverished, most despised and ignorant classes of people will be in the future equal to that of Bill Gates some day! Hallelujah! Smart mansions will be in all of our futures! Each of us will be smart and educated as Ph.D. graduates of a college with the stature of Yale or Harvard or MIT! There will be unlimited electricity, pure water on tap, elaborate heating and air filtering and and robotic devices to make all of us as comfortable as rich men are today! All of us will have walk-in closets the size of ballrooms, filled to the brim with hundreds of dresses and suits and shoes each costing $50,000 (current dollars) a piece because of the couture sewing and materials! We all will be able to possess gorgeous works of art, and the most rarest of food delicacies with exotic ingredients, with music in the background provided by musicians of spectacular skill! All of us can fly and visit foreign countries on private jets, experiencing exotic cultures, foods and sights with beautiful healthy companions serviced by the best plastic surgeons and doctors giving the best preventive dental and healthcare!Oh, wait. Snap! These graphs are about what percentage of people sleep under a roof even if it is only tin or plastic, or eat at least once a day, or whether they earn at least enough money for a couple of buckets of water, and some electrical power a day or a visit from a traveling nurse once in awhile. Some school at least was available for most kids for up to nine years, whether books and pencils and computers were there or not. People do not really need to know more than basic reading and writing, right? That all counts as a higher quality of lifestyle, if surviving on the minimums required for happiness and health are met, right? Besides ignorance is bliss! It has been proven over and over people are happy with just the basics of life. The elites are successfully eliminating poverty, misery, and ignorance! These poor folks (by Western standards, but not by local standards) have twenty-four hour reliable electricity to look forward to someday, right? even if not now. Some day all third-world middle-class folk (by local third-world standards) will always have clean water on tap, garbage pickup and recycling, consistently supplied twenty-four hour power for refrigerated foods and medical serums, and top world-quality health care like all of the upper classes all over the world.I answered the author's questions in the beginning of the book about factual world knowledge all correctly, so I guess I understand and have retained what I have learned from studying past UN surveys correctly similar to the author, and perhaps more knowledgeably than most. However, confidence about the future of Mankind seems much more uncertain to me than what the authors or elites believe. Elites and many in the more privileged middle-classes, at least based on this book, think underplaying suffering and lack of resources is a good thing! It is a Good if you have electricity four hours or less a day! It is a Good if you were allowed to go to school for nine years! It is fantastic if you have something to eat at least once a day or someplace to call home, even if it doesn’t have a legal title or plumbing! Who cares if you prefer medical care based on home remedies and witchcraft because of your 9th-grade education and lack of money for extras like a real hospital with working MRI’s or antibiotics or medicines? Or that the roads are full of holes, if they exist at all, the air is unbreathable, dead animals lie in gutters everywhere alongside garbage? You are better off than last year, and you are certain to have improvement next year, despite global warming and growing environmental degradation. Statistics don’t lie! Especially projections made on the most positive of guesses, ignoring many other ongoing conditions like the environment and government instability and culture wars. If you can’t finish your homework because the power is unreliable or goes off at 7:00 pm, not to return until 1:00pm tomorrow, well, be happy, don’t worry! You got a few hours of juice for refrigerators or light! If your food is simple without much varied nutrition, hey, you ate something filling! Maybe the droughts will stop instead of slowly getting worse year after year. Elites will for sure provide something, whatever it may cost you to get. If you live in one of the millions of shacks without a house address, running water or a toilet, at least you got a tin roof or a plastic sheet which keeps the mud floor from flooding more than a couple of inches! Maybe the NGO surveyors will find your ‘house’, or whatever, next year along with the garbage collectors, plumbers, and professional construction workers!"
16,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/70250942-mora,4,"I got this as an ARC from Goodreads Giveaways (do you know happy that made me? It is true I had a 20% chance of getting it, as opposed to the 0.0118% chance most of these giveaways have, but still. My first ARC! All the imperfections and missing dates and awkward formatting was very endearing).Anyway, I'm not usually a reader of nonfiction, but this seemed interesting, and I obtained it, so obviously I read it. It was actually really good. Rosling was a very interesting narrator, which I decided pretty early on (as in, page three), because he starts out with talking about sword swallowing and then goes on to tell us about how he occasionally does it at the end of his lectures. That immediately was very endearing, considering the last nonfiction book I read was Outliers by the esteemed but irritatingly condescending Malcom Gladwell, and Rosling did nothing to take away my respect throughout the book. He is very passionate about his subject, and he brings in tons of experiences he's had as examples, which adds both interesting details and credibility.I just like his voice, okay?This may be because I did agree with him on a lot of topics. (Okay, that probably plays a rather prominent role.) I'm big into looking at all the facts and evidence available first before jumping to conclusions, and one of the things that irritates me the most is when people are presented with absolute evidence and still go on pretending it doesn't exist. The facts are right there, people.(To quote Tamora Pierce (in a review for a nonfiction book (shh)): ""You can smack some people in the face with a haddock and they’ll still call it a mouse if a mouse is what they want to see."")I'm also very interested in the environment and consumer trends and could connect this book a lot to one of my classes, in which we learn about such things, so it was interesting to get a perspective on the same topics we were studying that was a lot more in-depth and a lot more interesting than my textbook.(The Gapminder website is pretty cool too.)One of my favorite concepts from Factfulness was ""possibilist"".""People often call me an optimist, because I show them the enormous progress they didn't know about. This makes me angry. I'm not an optimist. That makes me sound naive. I'm a very serious 'possibilist.' That's something I made up. It means someone who neither hopes without reason, nor fears without reason, someone who constantly resists the overdramatic worldview. As a possibilist, I see all this progress, and it fills me with conviction and hope that future progress is possible. This is not optimistic. It is having a clear and reasonable idea about how things are. It is having a worldview that is constructive and useful."" Also, another favorite quote: “Educating girls has proven to be one of the world’s best ideas ever.”I would highly recommend this book. I already have, actually: ""Oh, you should read this book! In April. When it comes out. Or you can borrow my copy if you simply cannot wait that long!""I had lots of feelings with this book - not the fiction pull-the-heartstrings feelings and more the this-is-good-and-logical-and-makes-me-happy feelings. Why is logic so hard for some people to understand?The most helpful view presented, actually, was the view that things can be ""both bad and better"". The world can be improving, but that's not to say there is nothing negative in the world and that there are not terrible things and people are not struggling. Things can be bad. But they can also be getting better. I feel like that kinda sums up the book itself."
17,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/745598-christine,5,"I won a copy of this book from Goodreads Giveaways. This is honestly one of the most eye-opening, opinion changing books I have ever read. Especially in today’s political climate, everything feels like the worst case scenario and it can be hard to know what to do without losing hope. Factfulness gives real, data-based information about how we use information and how to do that better. It is frank and it is real and I have never felt so empowered in my life. The tips and explanations in here are so useable and so relatable and so simple, I can start using them right now and I feel like I’ll have need to use them forever. Seriously, this feels right now like a must read book. "
18,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,5,"Factfulness joins the ranks of worldview-changing books I heartily recommend to everyone. It offers an updated global perspective on economic development, health, and other key markers of wellness. One of the myths Rosling (and his co-authors Ola Rosling and Anna Rosling Rönnlund) sets out to dispel is the notion of ""developing nations"" versus ""the developed world"". Those categories cause us to picture the world as a collection of ""haves"" and ""have-nots"" with a large gap in between. This might have been the case in 1965, but is not relevant to today's world, and the media have done a poor job of updating our understanding. Rosling demonstrates this progress with data and recommends an alternate model, parsing populations in terms of four economic levels, irrespective of which country they exist in:- Level 1 is extreme poverty, barely surviving on $2 per day or less. At this level you are likely barefoot, eating a diet of a simple dietary staple that lacks the full complement of nutrition you need. You walk long distances for dirty water, you cook your food on a basic wood fire, and sleep on a mat on the ground.- Level 2 finds you still in poverty, but with $4 per day you enjoy a markedly different daily experience. You'll have basic shoes and can even save up for a bike, you'll be cooking with gas, will have a slightly varied diet, your family will have a toothbrush to share and and a mattress to sleep on.- Level 3 (up to $16 per day) allows you to access running water, the chance at saving up for a motorcycle, cooking on a basic stove, enjoying a varied diet and a lack of food insecurity, a frame to put your mattress on, and everyone in the family gets their own toothbrush.- Level 4 (up to $32 per day and beyond) membership means you can buy a car, have water running in your own house, your stove and oven are fixed appliances, you have a nutritious and varied meals, sleep in a nice bed, and your family's toothbrushes might even be electric.These levels are consistent no matter where you live, and each country has a mix of residents from these levels, though the averages change. Only a billion of the world's population suffer in level 1 conditions (terrible, but a marked improvement from the past), some 3 billion live in level 2, 2 billion in level 3, and 1 billion in level 4. If we start to think in these categories, we can be more strategic in our aid, but also in supporting growing markets: many companies don't realize there's so much room for expansion in these ""undeveloped"" countries.Rosling begins the book with a 13-question quiz to gauge your knowledge of global vaccination, literacy, health, education, etc, and this review may already have primed you to perform better than most audiences he has encountered (and if you're familiar with Steven Pinker's excellent book Enlightenment Now you'll be even better primed). Funny enough, it's often the most educated audiences that have the worst intuitions about the world in these terms. Rosling regularly compares everyone's performance to that of chimpanzees, just to show that our intuitions are often worse than blind guesswork.The book is organized into chapters addressing instincts that lead us to think wrongly about the world, and Rosling uses data and anecdotes from his decades of work as an international doctor/researcher to reset our intuitions. There are ten instincts addressed: gap, negativity, straight line, fear, size, generalization, destiny, single perspective, blame, and urgency. I will resist spelling them out here, but they are valuable heuristics for evaluating what we see and hear. Rosling is hoping that, by being aware of our limitations and knowing which questions to ask, we will live lives based on ""factfulness"": the stress-reducing habit of only carrying opinions for which you have strong supporting facts.Sadly, Hans Rosling died of pancreatic cancer before this book was released. It was written as a joint effort with his son Ola and daughter-in-law Anna, co-founders of the Gapminder Foundation that pulled together many of the statistics used here. They completed it after his death, but it is written in his voice: serving as a final message to the world from a remarkable educator and human being.Silly side note: In my Christian upbringing, there was a popular praise song, Take My Life, with the lyrics: ""Faithfulness, faithfulness is what I long for / Faithfulness is what I need / Faithfulness, faithfulness is what you want from meeee...."" As you progress through the song, you swap out holiness, righteousness, and anything else your worship leader feels like throwing in. Every time I see this book, my mind starts automatically singing this song with ""Factfulness"". My friend Carrie (who gifted the book to me) said she did the same thing."
19,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739465-monica,3,"Why do I get the feeling that I was just reading a book about the wealth gap posing as a book touting good news about the world? Hans Rosling was a doctor who spent his life working on world health. He has travelled the world and met all manner of people and determined that the world isn't nearly as bad off as it feels. He studied the reasons behind that and thus created a foundation to get the word out. He did several TED talks and worked with one of his sons and daughter-in-law to write the book.Rosling et al are so frustrated about the narratives around the world that they made up a word and determined that the reason for this misinformation is based upon basically the lack of will of the wealthy nations to logically think about, analyze and vet the information it receives about the world. Rosling breaks it down to 10 reasons (view spoiler)[: And his solutionsAs you can see, Rosling freely provides the graphics to the public to advance his findings. Hey, it saves me time/space in the review so thank you Roslings! (hide spoiler)]In general, I liked the book and Rosling points out things that should be pretty obvious to folks who can look at things outside of their own bubble. Basically, he asks that we look at things in perspective. Most of what people know about the world is based upon when the information entered their consciousness. If you recieved information about the world in the 80s, it tends to stick there no matter what has happened in those 30 years. For those of us who live in wealthy countries, we tend to look at things through our own framework and perspective. What poverty looks like in for example the United States and what poverty looks like in less wealthy parts of the world are two very different things. Rosling urges that we get rid of ideas like ""developed"" and ""developing"" countries and use a different measure. He recommends a hybrid from the world bank and divides the world in 4 categories based on income. Level 1-Extreme poverty <$2/day Level 2 Between $4-$16/day Level 3 Between $8-$32/day and Level 4 Wealthy Above $32/day. Rosling does a good job of describing each of these categories and what it means to live within them. The way these categories are laid out makes sense in worldwide terms and by these measures you can see how things get perceived etc. By these measures Rosling says that about 1 billion people the world live in extreme poverty and even that measure is steadily decreasing. Rosling says Level 2 and Level 3 represent middle income status and anything at Level 4 and above is a wealthy country. And thus you have a guideline to how Rosling concludes that the world really is better than people believe. Rosling is trying to explain to vastly wealthier countries (even he acknowledges that if you are reading his book you are probably in Level 4 country), that the world is not as awful or backward as we think. And he's right about that (as demonstrated with numerous examples in the book such as education, vaccination, access to clean water, safety, access to electricity, access to internet and telephones etc). I have a few issues with the book. First is cherry picking statistics. Granted he is writing a book about perspectives and it just doesn't invite trust when he specifically states that ""only 9 percent of the world lives in low income countries"". See what he did there? As a reader you are supposed to assume that everyone that lives in a low income country is extremely poor and that people who live in middle income countries all live above the poverty line. But a few pages later he says that one billion people live in extreme poverty. I would guess that is because that adds up to a little over 14% of the world population; a rather dramatic contrast to 9% live in low income countries. But truthfully, statistics are used to influence perception or to help move people towards their point of view. Rosling is betting that you did not learn anything from his book. In order to accept a lot of what he is positing, you cannot analyze some of his stated statistics too closely. It's a bit of a slight of hand. Next it feels like he lets the Western world off the hook. No need to be too concerned about what's going on in other countries they are doing better than you think . His example of an Ebola outbreak in the Congo was an example. Written as a success story about how these countries are more than capable of handling these things; even better than wealthier countries. It smacks of ""We've done our job here, no need to look harder (or further invest)"". Also, thank goodness the wealthy invested here so they are no longer need. Additionally, Rosling fan waves income disparity. He implies that the vast income disparity between nations is no real problem at all. Just look at it differently. For me there was an immediate comparison to the 1%. In the ""Western"" world by Roslings measures (which are similar to the classifications in the World Bank), we are so much more wealthy than Rosling's ""middle income"" countries, that it is not a gap, it's a chasm. And that same chasm exists between middle class in the US and wealthy. There is so much more wealth in the US than in Level 2/3 countries that it is nearly impossible to imagine what the middle class life is (as defined by Rosling) and how to survive/thrive in that environment. Among the extremely wealthy are good people who are helping worldwide. Medicines Sans Frontier, Gates Foundation, Clinton foundation ect. Unspoken but subliminal is ""Don't ask much more of the rich (like and additional 2% tax for example), they are giving their fair share in philanthropy"". And also unspoken but a corollary is that poor people in wealthy countries aren't poor (regardless of the fact that to survive in the significantly more expensive, wealthy country $16/day is extreme poverty) because look the rest of the world is considered middle class at $8/day. Bah. I didn't fall for it. Just a different bubble. On the whole a very mixed bag. I think he is right about a lot of his thoughts about how to look at the world. He makes great points about the corporate media shapes the narrative; and that the view is very different due to income disparity; and that humans seek bipolar understanding so that it's ""us and them"", ""right or wrong"", ""true or false"" so that we can take sides conflict; and humans tend to see things with a negative bent; and that comfortable people rarely bother to analyze or update the sources of their beliefs. Truthfully there is no doubt that the contributions and donations by the extremely wealthy people, corporations, organizations, foundations, and countries worldwide has elevated the standard of living around the world in very significant ways. They have made the world a better and safer place. But I don't respond well to what began to feel like subliminal persuasion about ""all the good things the wealthy folks are doing and we should not judge them; its all helping the world"" vibe. In the end Rosling comes across more as a capitalist than a world heath worker. And the omitted analysis (and statistics) is as telling as the ones that are included.Almost 3.5 StarsRead on kindle."
20,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This is a fascinating book about how we think about the world, and many of the ways in which we think incorrectly. To start off, the reader is encouraged to take the Factfulness quiz. It consists of thirteen multiple-choice questions. Most people do worse than pure chance, i.e., a chimpanzee could achieve a better score! It goes to show how our thinking about the world is stereotypical, and not in accordance with the world as it really is.This book has much in common with a couple of books by Stephen Pinker; The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined and also  Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress. Hans Rosling argues that the world is a much better place, in many ways, than it was just a few decades ago. Not better in all respects, but in many important aspects. The problem is that most people do not realize just how much better it has become--we still have stereotypical views of most of the world's population, and the trends that are happening now.The author offers advice on how to think more clearly, for example, ""avoid lonely numbers."" That is to say, do not place much emphasis on single numbers, because without some context, they do not say much without at least one other number for comparison. Rosling gives many concrete examples of things to keep in mind, when trying to make sense of trends, statistics, and numbers. The book is filled with anecdotes that show how generalizations can lead to faulty thinking--I just love the story about a student rushing to an elevator, stretching out her leg to keep the doors from closing. That is a perfectly OK thing to do in Sweden--but not necessarily in India.And, the author relates some anecdotes where he, himself was thinking incorrectly. He is humble enough to show that he sometimes makes these very mistakes, as illustrations of faulty thinking.While the book is fun to read, and very engaging, it does have some problems. It seems to be a bit repetitive at times, and maybe even a bit preachy. Nevertheless, it is worth reading, and probably everyone can learn a great deal from this book."
21,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4252261-tom-la,5,"I knew I would have enjoyed Factfulness but it’s even better than I thought. Rosling sounds a bit like Steven Pinker but without all the philosophical and historical bias that ruins Pinker’s books. The core message though is the same: the world is getting better, not worse. This is NOT a half-glass-full view. In fact, Rosling repeats over and over that he does not see himself as an optimist. Rather, he wants to help people see the world through data and facts. Given my hate for the distortion of reality operated on a daily basis by the media (always done - decades before “fake news”) I loved Rosling’s main point which is encouraging people to THINK properly and factually about our world, in a way that is not polluted by the screams of the media, by bias or by artificial narratives. And that is very, very difficult for everyone today. To think straight when the media are using all the possible techniques to make us think in a twisted and superficial way is difficult. Here is a quick summary of our “10 Dramatic Instincts” as listed by Rosling (and 10 reasons why we are wrong about the world):• The Gap Instinct: We tend to divide things into 2 distinct groups and imagine a gap between them.• The Negativity Instinct: We tend to instinctively notice the bad more than the good.• The Straight Line Instinct: When we see a line going up steadily, we tend to assume the line will continue to go up in the foreseeable future.• The Fear Instinct: We tend to perceive the world to be scarier than it really is.• The Size Instinct: We tend to see things out of proportion, over-estimating (a) the importance of a single event/person that’s visible to us, and (b) the scale of an issue based on a standalone number.• The Generalization Instinct: We tend to wrongly assume that everything or everyone in a category is similar.• The Destiny Instinct: We tend to assume that (a) the destinies of people, cultures, countries etc. are predetermined by certain factors, and (b) such factors are fixed and unchanging, i.e. their destinies are fixed.• The Single Perspective Instinct: We tend to focus on single causes or solutions, which are easier to grasp and make our problems seem easier to solve.• The Blame Instinct: When something goes wrong, we instinctively blame it on someone or something.• The Urgency Instinct: We tend to rush into a problem or opportunity for fear that there’s no time and we may be too late.What surprises me in reading some negative reviews here is how much many people LOVE to cling to their negative and pessimistic view of the world — they can’t stand a book like this because they find the author too hopeful and optimistic. Which is missing the point of the book (and of being human, in my view). Rosling had a larger than life personality. You can see his energy in his TED talks, but it’s something that clearly comes through even from the pages of this book. You can’t help but laugh at the monkey face symbol that’s present on many of his graphs, to indicate the point where a chimp would have scored in a survey (of course, by giving a random answer out of three). Some reviewers took offense “Oh, he thinks everyone is an idiot!”. No no no no, again, you’re missing the mark by a mile: this is not about dissing or even about ego-mania. Sure everyone likes to toot their own horn, but this is clearly done in good spirits, it’s the product of a very playful, child-like and enthusiastic personality. Here is a quote from the book that I found powerful: “Forming your worldview by relying on the media would be like forming your view about me by looking only at a picture of my foot. Sure, my foot is part of me, but it’s a pretty ugly part. I have better parts.” Also, for something a bit deeper: “Being always in favor of or always against any particular idea makes you blind to information that doesn’t fit your perspective. This is usually a bad approach if you like to understand reality.”"
22,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1639329-erik,4,"“We’re all gonna die,” whispered the young knight next to me.Twenty seven thoughts raced across my mind. First, knights weren’t as advertised. Did this one really use the word ‘gonna’ instead of ‘going to’? And what about this contraction ‘we’re’? I would’ve been expecting something like, “We shall all perish!” Pfft. Dissapoint. Second, I hadn’t had my breakfast, and I’d always sworn not to die on an empty stomach. Third, I suddenly realized that stars were basically transmutation machines… did that mean stars could be considered philosopher stones? The other twenty four thoughts involved a menagerie of cat gifs, black holes, machine learning, and other such miscellanea. But most importantly, one of them involved a plan.I stepped forward to the Bridge of Death, before this wizened creature who had ejected several previous knights over the edge. In his craggy voice, he challenged me: “Who would cross the Bridge of Death must answer me these questions three, ere the other side he see.”Plan in mind, I boasted: “Ask me the questions bridge keeper, I’m not afraid!”“What is your name?” he spoke.“Sir Erik, of Goodreads.”“What is your quest?”“To write thoughtful, yet entertaining book reviews, for the titillation and cogitation of my fellow Knights of the Round Library.”“What is your favorite color?”“What do you mean favorite color? Favorite color of an apple? Favorite color shirt? Favorite color of hair? –And would this be the hair color of a man or a woman? And if a woman, what is her age, what is her nationality, and what is her relationship to me? And, indeed, what is my mood upon viewing this hair color – for if in depressive mood, the color must be bright, but in manic mood, it must instead be something earthy to ground me?”The bridge keeper looked at me, confused, and said,And *pooft* off he went over the side of the bridge. Plan: Successful.When my students ask me this question about my favorite color (or some other overly simplistic query), and I offer a similar response to the above, they look at me annoyed and say, “Jeez, why do you have to be so extra?”I look at them with a raised eyebrow and reply, “Why do you have to be so simple?”#If there’s any one theme to Factfulness, it’s this: Neither people, nor the world, are simple. So don’t treat them as simple. Instead, learn to see and embrace the complexity in both yourself and the world at large.In particular, Factfulness aims to disabuse readers of the simplistic notion peddled by the media (news, film, TV), politicians, and even well-meaning activists that the world is far worse than it is and is getting worse. It isn’t. Point in fact, human civilization – on average – is probably the best it’s ever been. Yes, ever. Chances are high, if you’re reading this, you live in a part of the world experiencing a golden age of peace, technology, and plenty.The way Factfulness accomplishes this is by (essentially) advocating for a scientific mindset that relies on data rather than instinct. Specifically, Factfulness identifies TEN instincts (or biases) that lead us astray. These are…The Gap Instinct: This is the simplistic instinct to polarize categorization (aka the fallacy of false dichotomy). Good or evil. Rich or poor. Correct or incorrect. In reality, most things fall somewhere in the middle.The Negativity Instinct: This is the simplistic instinct, which was evolutionary useful for survival, to find negative events more dramatic and interesting than positive ones. And thus our news and stories tend to be skewed towards the negative rather than the positive. Good business, maybe, but not an accurate depiction of the state of humanity.The Straight Line Instinct: This is the simplistic instinct, what David Hume once invoked when he discussed his famous Problem of Induction, to assume that past trends continue into the future unchanged. However, this is false. The world is always changing, and majority of trends are best modeled with non-linear curves.The Fear Instinct: This is the simplistic instinct to magnify the dangers of the things we fear and minimize the dangers of the things we do not fear. For example, in the US, terrorism has resulted in 3,662 deaths in the past 36 years – or about 100 deaths per year. On the other hand, traffic accidents result in 40,000 deaths per year, or 400 times the deaths due to terrorism. So why this weird conservative push to ban immigrants from terrorism hotspots? If safety is our goal, wouldn’t it make way more sense to ban immigrants from countries with poor driving records?The Size Instinct: This is the simplistic instinct to think we understand numbers better than we do. In particular, single numbers are far less useful than rates. For example, did you know that India puts out 1.6 BILLION tonnes of Carbon per year? That’s 320 million elephants worth of carbon! Clearly, India is problematic when it comes to climate change.But are they?India’s carbon usage PER CAPITA is only 1.2 tonnes. The US carbon usage is fifteen times that, at 16.6 tonnes per capita. So between these two countries, who really should be expected to reduce their emissions? Who shares a greater blame for climate change and needs to lead the wold by setting a better example? [On this note, I would direct anyone serious about doing their part to UN's Climate Neutral Now program. Choose to be the hero, not the villain.].The Generalization Instinct: This is the simplistic instinct to create excessively large categorizations or draw conclusions from insufficient data. We might well call this the ‘-ism’ instinct, as it’s responsible (with help from confirmation bias) for maintaining racism, sexism, and all the other -isms of the, um, I was gonna say rainbow but somehow that doesn't fit... what's the opposite of a rainbow? A big pile of unicorn turds? Yeah. That'll do.The Destiny Instinct: This is the simplistic instinct to view the world as unchanging, or destined to be the way it is. For example, many Westerners assume Africa is somehow destined to be a war-torn, impoverished continent. Not so. By the middle of the century, Africa will almost certainly house some of the fastest growing economies – and business people would be fools to miss the investment opportunities.The Single (Perspective) Instinct: This is the simplistic instinct to extend expertise beyond its domain or to assume that just because a solution worked in one instance, it will therefore work in all. For an example of the former, take this quote from Neil deGrasse Tyson: “Kids are born curious about the world. What adults primarily do in the presence of kids is unwittingly thwart the curiosity of children.”Now I like Neil deGrasse Tyson, but he's an astrophysicist and I'm pretty sure child psychology isn't part of the astrophysics curriculum. Maybe he's right, maybe he isn't. But there is absolutely no reason to believe any part of that quote just because he's a celebrity scientist who knows a lot about astronomical phenomena.P.S. He isn't right. The only adults I've ever seen who limit the creativity of children don't do it unwittingly. They do it on purpose, and often for the best of intentions. For example, parents teach their children they cannot leap off a building and fly away like a bird. Generally, this is a good thing to know: human beings don't fly with our bodies, we fly with our minds, as true of adults as it is of children.The Blame Instinct: This is the simplistic instinct to assign blame (or credit) to individual people or initiatives. For example, many US voters vote out (or in) a president on the basis of the health of the economy. In reality, the president has little to no control over it. The systems of our civilization are ultra-complex and interconnected, and they function (or fail to function) because of the deeds of the many, not the few.The Urgency Instinct: This is the simplistic instinct to believe quick action is better than no action. In reality, and to borrow one of my favorite quotes, “The easiest way to do something is properly.” Taking the extra time to do something right is nearly always the best way to do it.And those are the ten instincts, each of which has its own chapter. Obviously, Factfulness goes into far greater detail, and each chapter is further spiced up with interesting charts and graphs, as well as anecdotes from the author’s time as a doctor and a lecturer.Now I'll be the first to admit I'm not a huge fan of non-fiction. Too often, I find it lacks voice, which makes the reading experience rather sterile. Not so here! There’s a distinct feeling of the author speaking to you, personally, and he’s not afraid to reveal his own fears and motives. Because of this, Factfulness manages that fine line between informative and entertaining, making it a light yet thought-provoking read.On the other hand, I would be failing Factfulness's affirmation of complexity if I let its flaws pass without comment. For example, the book begins with - and is structured around - a questionnaire meant to demonstrate the average person's ignorance of the world, but some of the questions are suspect. Here’s one: “Where do most of people live in the world?” [A: Low income countries B: Middle income countries C: High income countries.]”It’s a problematic question because the definitions of “low” / “middle” / “high” are ambiguous. Are they being defined statistically along a normal curve? That can’t be, because that would make the question pointlessly tautological: the answer would, by definition, be 'middle.' So how are they being defined? The author claims the “correct” answer is B – but relative to basically anyone reading the book, the real correct answer is A. Because how he defines “middle” income, as $2/day to $32/day is AT ITS HIGHEST ($11500 a year) below the poverty line for higher income countries – which is how the vast majority of respondents would define low income.In another example found within the Urgency Instinct chapter, the author makes a rather poignant confession. He admits to panicking and instituting a quarantine that causes a group of accidental deaths, the results of which he witnesses first-hand. He realizes he's to blame and thinks he made the wrong call. In fact, he's engaging in a bit of hindsight bias. Easy enough, looking back after he learns there was no actual need for the quarantine, that he should have chosen otherwise. But in the moment, with the information that was available? He chose to play it safe, and that was probably the best decision. I daresay most readers, unburdened as we are by any sense of guilt, would agree. This muddies the chapter as a whole. It's important to realize that it's true that many bad decisions are made because ""leaders"" are trying to avoid the appearance of inaction. But it's also important to realize that essentially every decision you ever make will be made with incomplete information and that there truly do exist situations in which doing nothing is the worst thing you can do.These are of course not the only do issues the book has, but there really aren't that many other flaws. Even with the rare stumble, the author makes a clear, intelligent, humble case that most of us (including leaders and experts) simply don’t have an accurate view of the world. In this age of the internet, globalization, and science, we can and should do better."
23,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13298726-michael-perkins,4,"“I really do believe that our attitudes are shaped much more by our social groups than they are by facts on the ground. We are not great reasoners. Most people don't like to think at all, or like to think as little as possible. And by most, I mean roughly 70 percent of the population. Even the rest seem to devote a lot of their resources to justifying beliefs that they want to hold, as opposed to forming credible beliefs based only on fact.”― Steven Sloman, The Knowledge Illusion: Why We Never Think Alone============It's a constant challenge to get our facts straight. Like most readers and others the author has challenged, I flunked the test at the beginning of the book. Early in the book, he makes it clear he is not an optimist, never mind an idealist. He simply demonstrates what accurate data shows us about the world and the good news is that the world is improving. This does not mean, the author makes clear, that there are not serious issues in terms of politics, racism, and climate change. But we shouldn't be pessimists, but stay after these problems.As readers learn what they don't know, the author explains why. He calls them instincts that can get in the way of finding out what's real: opting for melodramatic explanations, the ""us vs them"" gap perspective, negativism, seeing all data as a straight line, allowing fear to cloud our judgment, over-generalizing, seeing everything through a single ideological lens, blaming.In the pursuit of educating others, he does not agree that the means justify the ends. He articulates something about Al Gore's mode of presentation that I agree is wrong. I have seen two polar opposite and unfortunate reactions to Gore's worst case approach in ""An Inconvenient Truth""----backlash skepticism and defeatism. I recall Gore being interviewed by Anderson Cooper on CNN. Anderson showed the documentary animation of the worst case flooding of the entire state of Florida. Anderson was skeptical and I thought it made Gore look absurd. Rosling writes:“We need to create fear!” That’s what Al Gore said to me at the start of our first conversation about how to teach climate change. It was 2009 and we were backstage at a TED conference in Los Angeles. Al Gore asked me to help him and use Gapminder’s bubble graphs to show a worst-case future impact of a continued increase in CO2 emissions.But I couldn’t agree to what he had asked. I don’t like fear.Fear plus urgency make for stupid, drastic decisions with unpredictable side effects. Climate change is too important for that. It needs systematic analysis, thought-through decisions, incremental actions, and careful evaluation. And I don’t like exaggeration.Exaggeration undermines the credibility of well-founded data: in this case, data showing that climate change is real, that it is largely caused by greenhouse gases from human activities such as burning fossil fuels, and that taking swift and broad action now would be cheaper than waiting until costly and unacceptable climate change happened. Exaggeration, once discovered, makes people tune out altogether.I insisted that I would never show the worst-case line without showing the probable and the best-case lines as well. Picking only the worst-case scenario and— worse— continuing the line beyond the scientifically based predictions would fall far outside Gapminder’s mission to help people understand the basic facts. It would be using our credibility to make a call to action. Al Gore continued to press his case for fearful animated bubbles beyond the expert forecasts, over several more conversations, until finally I closed the discussion down. “Mr. Vice President. No numbers, no bubbles.”To be absolutely clear, I am deeply concerned about climate change because I am convinced it is real— as real as Ebola was in 2014. I understand the temptation to raise support by picking the worst projections and denying the huge uncertainties in the numbers. But those who care about climate change should stop scaring people with unlikely scenarios."" ======"

When things are getting better we often don’t hear about them.- Step-by-step, year-by-year, the world is improving. Not on every single measure every single year, but as a rule. Though the world faces huge challenges, we have made tremendous progress. This is the fact-based worldview.- our surveillance of suffering has improved tremendously. This improved reporting is itself a sign of human progress, but it creates the impression of the exact opposite.- the image of a dangerous world has never been broadcast more effectively than it is now, while the world has never been less violent and more safe.- Assume You Are Not “Normal” and Other People Are Not Idiots- There has been progress in human rights, animal protection, women’s education, climate awareness, catastrophe relief, and many other areas where activists raise awareness by saying that things are getting worse.- If the pharmaceutical companies were better at adjusting their prices for different countries and different customers, they could make their next fortune with what they already have.- We need Olympic Games, international trade, educational exchange programs, free internet—anything that lets us meet across ethnic groups and country borders."

It is the most compelling, well-reasoned, and readable argument for a positive mindset about the world that I could possibly imagine. And it makes the compelling case that -- far from popular opinion -- we MUST praise the good we've already achieved if we want to have any hope of keeping the momentum going. If we don't know what works, how will we keep innovating on top of our successes? Burning it down and starting over is the narcissistic response to frustration with the world. It says, ""No one has known how to achieve a better world, but *I* do."" This is not just wrong; it's selfish. Truly selfless humanitarianism demands that we understand the successes of generations before us (and of our contemporaries!) so that we can build a better world. Anything less is selfishness. This book makes that so clear, I walked away from it motivated, heartened, and hopeful. Buying a copy for everyone this Christmas. Thank you, Roslings, for your incredible work."

""Everything you do and are now is wrong and here's why."" When someone comes at me with that kind of message, I tend to get very defensive. But I always kept reading because what he says makes so much sense. So much of what we think we know about the world is just wrong or at least badly slanted. But to truly effect change in the world we need to be able to deal with it as it truly is. Facts. Data. Openness to other viewpoints. Those are what Rosling is selling. And he's very good. This book is an easy read, well written, accessible. If you can get past your ego, I really recommend this book. "

This book should be mandatory reading for all politicians, journalists, businessmen, scientists, educators, in short, everyone who plays a role in how we view the world. Because Rosling convincingly demonstrates that we stubbornly stick to all kinds of wrong ideas. Even the most intelligent people have a wrong assessment of demographic, economic, social and cultural evolutions.The nice thing is that Rosling states ten instinctive causes, such as binary thinking, assuming that trends always continue in a straight line, and so on. And he constantly illustrates this with very concrete examples, often from his own experience. In addition, he also provides very useful tips to remedy it, which he summarizes under the heading ""factfulness.""The latter is somewhat misleading. Rosling naturally emphasizes the importance of factual material. But then he is not just talking about facts or figures. Because as the Italian writer Pirandello once wrote: “a fact is like a bag; it only stands up if you have put something in it.” And that filling up, that is done by placing them in a certain context, comparing them in the right way, and selecting them correctly in the first place. And Rosling gives the necessary tips for this in a very didactic way. This is actually a much better work than Dobelli's The Art of Thinking Clearly: much less whipped up learning, much more down to earth and hands-on.Rosling's global message is that the world is in much better shape than ever before. In a much shorter way than, for example, Stephen Pinker (The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined, he illustrates this on the basis of a whole host of data and figures. And he is not afraid to knock down sacred houses: he warns climate change activists (with whom he clearly sympathizes) that they are smashing their own windows by sending panicky unfounded data into the world. Rosling died in 2017, what a loss! Fortunately his legacy is continued through this book and through the Gapminder site. Very recommanded!"
32,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,3,"This is both a useful book and a simplified one that never questions its westernized assumptions. Hans Rosling, a Swedish professor of public health, armed with decades’ worth of UN statistics, wrote this book (with the assistance of his son and daughter-in-law, who published it after his death) to convince people in rich countries that the rest of the world is better than we think, and that several logical fallacies prevent us from seeing it that way.On the one hand, he’s absolutely right. Insulated in our well-off countries, we tend to learn about other places only from the news, which generally reports only the most dramatic, i.e., the most tragic and appalling stories. We struggle to see members of “other” groups as non-uniform and to believe their cultures can change in the way our own have (in fact, many societies around the world are changing and developing much faster than western Europe and the U.S. did). As a college student who only knew about Africa from the news, I remember thinking that one couldn’t afford to care what was going on there because it was only one horrible tragedy after another. In reality this is far from the truth, and I have to credit my world books challenge (to read a book set in each country in the world, with a preference for books by authors from the country; I’m up to 165 out of 201 now) for showing me a more accurate picture of what everyday life around the world is like. But UN statistics also show that the world is improving in many ways, such as widespread access to electricity, primary education, and vaccination against deadly diseases. And yet, many people in rich countries don’t know this and even believe the world is getting worse.But there’s a lot Rosling misses too. His quizzes to test people’s knowledge of the world (one of which is included at the beginning of the book, and which distinguished audiences at his talks have consistently flunked) are designed to encourage wrong answers. Let’s look at the first three questions:1.	In all low-income countries across the world today, how many girls finish primary school?A: 20 percentB: 40 percentC: 60 percent2.	Where does the majority of the world population live?A: Low-income countriesB: Middle-income countriesC: High-income countries3.	In the last 20 years, the proportion of the world population living in extreme poverty has…A: almost doubledB: remained more or less the sameC: almost halvedAnswers: 1. C; 2: B; 3. CRosling emphasizes throughout the book of how badly people answer these and similar questions. But many are designed to fool you. Question 1, for instance: leaving aside the issues of what constitutes a “low-income country” and “finishing primary school” (different countries’ educational systems being different), this question cues a negative answer because its options skew so negative. The incorrect answers set a lower bracket in test-takers’ minds, suggesting that 60% is a very high number indeed. When all we’re really saying is that something over half of girls in poor countries go to school at least until, what, age 11 or so? – an achievement, absolutely, but one leaving lots of work still to do. I wonder, if test-takers were asked to produce their own answer rather than seeing these suggestions, whether their guesses would be much higher. And then too, despite all the logical fallacies listed, one Rosling doesn’t mention is the fear of being labeled “naïve” for believing positive things about the world; might some test-takers’ answers be influenced by the desire to come across as jaded and cynical rather than as privileged Pollyannas?Question 2 is an issue of definitions. Rosling chides people from wealthy countries for seeing everyone else as simply “poor,” despite their differences, but viewed from a wealthy country, everybody else is in fact “low-income.” Rosling divides the world into four income levels. Level 1 means living in a mud hut or flimsy house without electricity, traveling only on foot, and spending the vast majority of one’s time fulfilling basic needs: fetching water, gathering firewood, cooking over a fire pit, etc. Level 3 means having consistent electricity and running water, having access to some form of motorized transport such as a motorcycle, having many modern conveniences and kids in school, but still having to work very hard for what you have and falling short of Level 4, where you don’t have to worry about basic needs, have a car, can fly somewhere for vacation, etc. Certainly the differences between Levels 1 and 3 are enormous, and I think Rosling’s four-level framework is far more useful than the old first-world/third-world or developed/developing dichotomies, but people who answer incorrectly might not be as uninformed as he believes.Question 3, though, is legitimate. Not everyone knows what “extreme poverty” means by UN definitions (living on less than $2 a day), but the basic fact is that standards of living have risen around the world over the last few decades, yet most people in Level 4 countries don’t know it. The book does a great job of driving home the progress that has been made, even while pointing out that much more is needed.But Rosling’s analysis has two major issues. One is that it’s quite simplified. For instance, it's nice that most children in poor countries are in school, but in India, huge numbers of poor children remain illiterate even after several years of schooling. Of course learning can’t be improved without people buying into education, but if education isn’t happening in the schools, their value is limited.And Rosling’s income divisions are quite rough, as I realized when visiting Dollar Street, a site set up by Anna Rosling Ronnlund that compiles pictures of the homes and belongings of people around the world at various income levels. It’s interesting to view, but an issue that quickly becomes clear is that people are classified into Levels 1-4 based on income per person, regardless of the number of people in the household. So, for instance, an American family of four (parents and their young adult children) with an income of $996 per month per person is considered Level 3. Now, living alone in the U.S. on an income of under $1000 per month puts you below the poverty line, with money tight even to meet basic needs, but a family of four with $48,000 a year and no childcare expenses is doing all right, as this family seems to be based on the photos. They’re nowhere near the poverty line, which for a family of four is $25,100. The effect of pooling resources is huge: every home needs a kitchen, for instance, but add several more people to your home and you still only need one kitchen. So the income level cutoffs, which seem useful to describe the rough income levels of different countries as a whole, are far less helpful for individual households.And finally, Rosling assumes throughout the book that development is always good, without ever addressing the question directly. It was interesting to read this book alongside Unbowed, a memoir by a Kenyan activist for democracy, human rights and the environment. As a child, Maathai lived on Level 1 or 2, but that didn’t mean a terrible life; she found enjoyment and pride in cultivating the land, had a large, supportive family, and loved the storytelling around the fire each evening as the family waited for the food to cook. To Rosling though, Level 1 is nothing but suffering, and he never acknowledges any potential downsides to development except for environmental degradation. Now, it’s fair to say that it’s easy to romanticize “a simpler lifestyle” from one’s couch, while parents who have buried three of their five children have no such illusions (one of the key statistics Rosling often uses is child mortality). But loss of family, community and cultural connections can lead to increased mental health problems, while today’s diets, high in fat, sugar, and processed foods, lead to obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and other serious health issues. Rosling, though, paints a uniformly positive picture of modernization without acknowledging its costs.All that said, his description of logical fallacies is still useful. For those still reading, they are below:The Gap Instinct: The notion that humanity divides into two groups, with a significant gap between them, such as “rich countries” and “poor countries.” Countries’ income, like probably most other things, is actually on a continuum.The Negativity Instinct: Paying most attention to negative information, such as apocalyptic news reports, without noticing the gradual improvements that get far less attention but are more impactful in the long run.The Straight Line Instinct: Assuming a phenomenon will continue to occur at the same rate (this one is mostly for analyzing data: world population growth, for instance, is already slowing).The Fear Instinct: People are more afraid of dramatic events that tap into our primal fears of violence, captivity, and poison, than of everyday stuff that’s more likely to occur. This is why American parents won’t let their kids walk places for fear of extremely rare stranger kidnappings, despite the fact that car accidents are far more common and deadly.The Size Instinct: Also about analyzing data: get numbers into perspective by finding something to compare them to, and focus on the biggest items on a list (for instance in a budget) rather than the tiny ones.The Generalization Instinct: Assuming that all members of a group are alike, or that two groups are similar when they aren’t.The Destiny Instinct: Assuming something “will always be” the way that it is and that “culture” is immutable - at least when it comes to cultures other than our own.The Single Perspective Instinct: Using your pet theory to explain everything that’s happening in the world and how to fix it.The Blame Instinct: Looking for someone to blame for a problem can cause you to stop thinking. Looking for the system that caused that person’s behavior can be much more productive.The Urgency Instinct: Decisions made in haste are poorly thought-through; slow down on important stuff.At any rate, definitely an interesting book, and probably especially useful for those whose knowledge of the world mostly comes from the news. Even for those who are more knowledgeable, it’s useful to be aware of the ways your brain can trick you. That said, I think this book should be the beginning of a conversation rather than the end of it."

Hans Rosling thinks he has the answer. Professor Hans Rosling was 'the man in whose hands data sings'. He was dubbed 'a true inspiration' by Bill Gates and became a viral celebrity thanks to his popular TED talks which broke down the statistics behind global health and economics.Before his death in 2017 Rosling spent years asking global audiences simple questions about basic trends. How widespread is extreme poverty? What is life expectancy today? How many children in the world have been vaccinated? He quizzed everyone from medics to lecturers, bankers, political decision makers - even Nobel Laureates. And the results were always the same.""Everyone seems to get the world not only devastatingly wrong, but systematically wrong. By which I mean, that these test results are worse than random. They are worse than the results I would get if the people answering my questions had no knowledge at all.""Identifying key evolutionary instincts that prevent us from seeing the world as it really is, Rosling asks us to fundamentally shift our view of the world - but we have an engaging and entertaining guide on our journey.Just another way of framing Pinker's The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined, and I didn't buy into that either."

One thing is certain that we made miraculous progresses along the way. World has become infinitely better place. Though, that doesn't mean everything's okay or there's nothing to be worried about. Far from it. The problem is that we don't recognize these amazing achievements.We need to keep data oriented, cool-headed analytical mind most of the time. With that mindset, we can overcome anything hopefully. Be prepared for everything for no one knows anything for sure. Be humble and expect mistakes. Nobody is perfect. Though improvement is possible however slow it may be. Be open-minded. Analyze before and then act. Avoid extremists at all costs.We need more facts, more data and little bit of compassion! Here are the 5 most important global issues we should be aware of and worried about (as suggested by author).* Global pandemic* Financial collapse (this is one seems inevitable. Question is when though?)* World war (I want to believe this one is not an issue so baddly!) * Climate change  (this one is real!) * Extreme poverty  (seems like education is the key in the long term.) ------ * Unknown threats (this one is always on the table!)"

It tries to unhinge deep rooted biases that make us feel negative about our times with simple data. Data so simple that most people get wrong, worse than a chimpanzee randomly choosing answers. Data in itself doesn't explain - it is more the human psychology. Hence he talks of the Gap Instinct, the Negativity Instinct, Generalization instinct among others - which is a very rational way of structuring an argument.

38,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7309374-romanas,4,"I have had the opportunity of seeing professor Hans Rosling live at one event. He was giving one of his classic presentations enriched with his famous interactive diagrams. Hans was hastily bouncing around the scene and by using an oversized stick as a prop he was lively explaining how the world works. Which is not how many people think it does. The speech was impressive. The life of professor Rosling was even more impressive, and he shared a great deal of it throughout the years by using his unique technique and tireless enthusiasm making the World a less ignorant place. As with many of his other great endeavors, professor Rosling greatly succeeded of accomplishing his last work, an autobiography of a special kind, written with the ink of factfulness, right before he was hastily forced to leave the stage of life. This is the book that will continue making the impact for generations to come and inspire new thinkers to whom a fact-based approach is central to life and research.Hans Rosling was one of the greatest fighters against ignorance, an impressive educator, a clear thinker, a doctor solving major health crises, Ebola included, and a man with many other astonishing achievements. The book compiles many of those great undertakings. It begins with a quiz where the reader would check the level of his ignorance. Then, based on the quiz results, the less unaware one is about some facts of how the World is functioning, the more important is this book to read. The book is well organized, and naturally for the subject, very rich with facts, which are thoroughly analyzed and augmented with the personal stories from the professor’s life journey. It is a very lively, pedagogic, and important work. By using a clear thinking, sound reasoning, and hard facts, Rosling in each chapter deeply reasons and busts different kinds of our biased instinct. Each chapter ends with the factfulness arguments and important key points, which should be put on the wall and used as a guidance navigating our complex and ignorant World.Hans Rosling's Factfulness, as well as his material on YouTube, is a very important legacy, and a must read for everybody."
39,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20284290-rohan,1,"I admire Hans Rosling and appreciate what he's done for the world, but was deeply disappointed by this book.Factfulness attempts to teach a ""fact-based"" understanding of the modern world and how common cognitive biases distort our understanding of reality. Rosling weaves in lots of personal anecdotes to make his ideas more digestible and relatable.While this book is well intentioned, it may not be a worthwhile read for everyone. If you have some vague knowledge of cognitive biases, what it means to be ""rational"", globalization and the state of global poverty / progress, you can skip this book.The main reason I docked stars from is because it mischaracterizes some dangerous assumptions as ""facts"". Just because the state of humanity has historically experienced ""progress"" (over Rosling's specified time window, according to his definition of progress), it does not necessarily mean humanity is guaranteed to continue to do so. This idea aligns well with the classic investing adage ""past performance does not predict future returns"".Further, Hans Rosling glosses over the issue of sustaining global population growth without providing any supporting facts himself. His justification comes down to ""it will level off at 11bn and be fine, calm down."" This doesn't take into account the increased number of people having newly resource-intensive standards of living. There's a more detailed rebuttal here: https://www.populationmatters.org/pop...Instead of describing reality, this book attempts to interpret it through a biased, misguided lens."

Take out the parts where he praises his son and daughter-in-law, and you have half left. Take out the repetition of the few ideas in it and you have a 20 minute TED talk. And even then, quite a few of the author's rosy conclusions rely on some rather disingenuous abuse of data. For example, the notion that ""most people live in middle-income countries"" is only true when middle-income is defined as earning more than $2 per day and being able to afford a gas canister for cooking. A similar abuse of data arises when he cheerily states that the UN predicts that the additional 2 billion people alive in 2100 will be adults. Of course there will be mostly adults, because that segment spans 60 years, as opposed to the 15 years as children and the 5-15 years as elderly people. It's the same as saying that world starvation is highest between the hours of 7PM and 7AM, and calling that a revelation, when what's really going on is that most people are asleep for the majority of those hours. Kind of a silly book with one or two interesting ideas. Do yourself a favor and watch the TED talk and leave this one on the shelf."
41,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37922611-yedhu,5,"Factfulness is one book I would recommend to anyone who wants to have a clear perspective about the world based on facts. It was written by Hans Rosling; a medical doctor, professor of international health and a public educator. I recently found this TED video; and interesting one which will help you know him better: The best stats you've ever seen. The book is a compilation of his years of research and experience, and is co-written by his son Ola Rosling and daughter-in-law Anna Rosling. I heard about it first when Bill Gates mentioned this book in his blog. He explains how it helped him not to talk about 'developed' and 'developing' countries.We live with misconceptions about the current state of the world. We hear the bad side of everything everyday and we think the world is slowly deteriorating. This over-dramatic view is what Hans Rosling demystifies in Factfulness. He presents why and how we are wrong through a simple quiz and explanations. It doesn't end there. He further dives into what causes these distorted views, how to look out for the warning signs, and how to avoid them.He describes ten instincts, in ten chapters, which are responsible for this. Although these one line explanations is nothing compared to the chapters in the book, if you do not like spoilers, you can skip this part.1. The gap instinct: the natural tendency to divide everything incorrectly into two groups2. The negativity instinct: which always makes us see the negative face than the positive one3. The straight line instinct: the assumption that a straight line will always continue like the same in the future when we look at graphs4. The fear instinct: frightening things that get in our way and blocks rational thinking5. The size instinct: when lonely numbers are presented to us, we wrongly assume the severity of the issue6. The generalisation instinct: which makes us think something that works for someone, works for others too7. The destiny instinct: when people think something will never change because they don't observe gradual progress8. The single perspective instinct: the problem of a single perspective limiting our imagination9. The blame instinct: when we find comfort in pointing fingers rather than finding the root cause10. The urgency instinct: which makes us act fast without thinking, by creating a sense of unnecessary urgencyHe presents every one of these with case studies and beautiful bubble charts. All the facts are backed by data, which are compiled and verified by international organisations. Also, the author is not afraid to admit how he had these instincts in the past, some of which are quintessential and resulted in terrifying repercussions.The chapters are clear, concise and well structured with explanations and data. There was never a dull moment reading this book, and I enjoyed it all of it! I can count the non-fictions I loved from cover to cover on the fingers (The last one was Delivering Happiness, by Tony Hsieh)This book was an eye-opener for me. Also, this is not about optimism. The author himself says he is not an optimist, but a 'possibiist'; someone who neither hopes without reason, nor fears without reason, someone who constantly resists the overdramatic worldview. It doesn't say the world is good. It says the world is both good and bad; they coexist together. The learnings from the book can be applied in about everything in our daily life."

Rosling's questionnaire is brilliant, and I have no doubt that the answers are accurate and *probably* useful. But I'm not sure he is asking all the right questions. Nor that he understands how ordinary ppl can know something and still feel differently, for example.There are some over-generalizations (the implication that all of the US is at wealth Level 4, for example) but there are continual reminders, including an entire chapter, to remind us not to generalize or to over-simplify. There are some undefined terms (what does ""some"" vaccination mean?)Mostly, though, he is indeed very right, and mostly what he discusses is very relevant.Speaking of ""wealth levels"" - his ideas about that, combined with the questionnaire, are worth the book in themselves.Book darts marked:""The number of people on Level 3 will increase from two billion to four billion between now and 2040.

45,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12798350-andrew,4,"Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World – and Why Things Are Better Than You Think, by Hans Rosling, is a book examining ten key issues with Westerners perspective on statistical facts. Rosling is a late Swedish health expert who has traveled the world with a zeal to try and encourage people to be skeptical of journalism, unattributed statistics, and to challenge bias. He has done a large amount of work with NGO's, health units, the UN, businesses and governments globally, and has brilliant insight and perspective on many issues. The crux of this book; doom and gloom prophecies and one sided arguments are logical fallacies. Rosling has developed a test to challenge misconceptions about global issues. For example: ""What's the life expectancy of the world today?"" A: 50 years B: 60 years C: 70 years. With all the doom and gloom about poverty and such today, one might be tempted to say A or B. And most test recipients would agree - Rosling shows that most get this and many more questions in the test linked above wrong (take it for yourself, its a ride). This is due to a number of issues revolving around information bias, human psychology, and Western exceptionalism present in most Western nations today. These biases are as follows:1. The Gap Instinct - our inability to recognize the majority in statistical figures and instead focus on outliers, extremes, or ""fat tails"" in analysis. For example, focusing only on the richest and poorest nations, when in reality the vast majority of humanity is somewhere in the middle.2. The Negativity Instinct - humans uncanny ability to focus on the negative, and our use of this instinct in the media, activism and so on. We see a plane crash story and would assume plane crashes are increasing in our time. Not so, plane deaths have literally never been lower. 3. The Straight Line Instinct - the fallacy of looking at lines as if they will continue indefinitely. The example here is population growth, which is predicted to peter out at around 11 billion people, but which many panic about as growing ""exponentially"" or without end. 4. The Fear Instinct - the instinct to let fear immobilize us. For example, sometimes the rhetoric on climate change (though important) is doom and gloom, and does not actually present or assist in solution building.5. The Size Instinct - 4.2 million children died in 2016 globally. What a terrifying figure, and indeed this is tragic. However, in 1950, 14 million children perished in that year. The number of deaths has fallen rapidly even as the global population has grown. And although the number is still large, we are lost in the negativity of it, instead of focusing on what worked, and how it worked.6. The Generalization Instinct - our instinct to generalize - ex. ""high birth rates in Africa are due to Islamic culture"" - an absolute generalization with no basis in reality. These thoughts make it easy for use to quickly dismiss information, but are useless when analyzing global trends. 7. The destiny instinct - This is the misnomer that if things are or were, then they will be so in the future. Ex. Africa has always been poorer than Europe, and will be so in the future. This rejects the fact that things will change, and that change can be slow. Many African nations (Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia) have standards of living equal to Sweden in the 1980's. The poorest nations of the world have achieved standards akin to India in the 1970's. Change is slow, but change is coming. 8. The Single Perspective Instinct - This one was quite interesting. Cuba claims to be ""the Healthiest Poor nation,"" as its levels of societal health are on par with the United States. Something trumpeted by the Cuban government. On the flip side, Cuba is also the poorest of the healthy. Many of its systems are not on par with that of the US. This is not done, however. The US can also be called the ""sickest of the rich."" Its healthcare is worse than 39 other first world nations, and the fact that its healthcare system is on par with Cuba, a poor, one party state, is embarrassing. It can also be called, the ""richest of the sick"" - remember, things can be analyzed from many perspectives. 9. The blame instinct - This is the fallacy of blame. Its the CEO's fault that a company makes this financial decision! It's Islam's fault that terrorism is an issue! Not so - many companies operate on the whims of their shareholders, and shareholders are diverse. Some of the biggest banks and energy companies in the world have massive shareholdings by retirement investment funds and pension plans. Is it your grandma's fault?? In short, its the systems fault. Don't hate the player, hate the game. By extension, don't target the player, target the system. 10: The Urgency Instinct - Rosling's most hated instinct. Act now before it's too late! This is a fallacy that is particularly active in the media and with activists. Panic sells, and gets people thinking. But it can also harm. We are currently sending millions of blankets and pounds of food to feed Australia's wildlife, horrendously under threat due to forest fires that are probably caused by human driven climate change. Is this going to solve the issue? Is this going to stop the wildfires? Is this even going to be effective?? Will a frightened kangaroo eat airdropped carrots?? Will a knitted blanket really save a koala's life?? If yes, will the saved koala be able to survive in a fire ravaged forest??? Are we even helping???? People mean well, but our urge to act in situations often puts resources in the wrong place, or creates band-aid solutions that fall apart as soon as the next crisis arises. This book was fascinating in many ways. Rosling was a contrarian at heart, but his logic is quite sound. He challenges Western exceptionalism (""if the poor achieve a higher level of affluence, then climate change will become more pressing!"" - exceptionalism and probably closet racism), media and corporate pessimism, and much more. Rosling argues that the world is a much better place to live in than it was 50 years ago. More women are educated than ever before (the global average of time spent in school for men is 10 years - for women its A: 5 years, B: 7 years, C: 9 years, Answer? C.). Less children die of preventable diseases and accidents than at any time in human history. Africa and Asia are not only becoming wealthier, they are emerging as huge markets for most goods and services, and incubation points for innovations and inventions unknown in the West. Although his tone sometimes seems condescending here, his voice and reason are compelling. Challenge everything, be skeptical, and read differing opinions! Challenge your own ideas, read contrarian views, and don't bog down in absolutes! Things change. They get better, they get worse, and often times, at the exact same time. One problem is solved that creates numerous, smaller issues. Rosling argues that we should read the facts, examine data, and ensure we are up to date. Often we will, remember facts about a country or issue and it sticks in our head for decades, even though the nature, facts and issue may have completely changed in that timeframe. This was a really interesting book, and an easy recommendation for those interested in politics, global development, or how humans interact with ideas. "
46,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4651295-jason-furman,4,"Factfullness is getting a lot of attention and deservedly so. A lot of the major points--the majorest being that the world is generally getting better--should be known more widely. And a number of the mental habits it encourages like being aware of biases around small salient events, extrapolations, overly reductive groupings are also worthwhile life lessons. I don't think most of these facts and mental habits will be news to anyone paying attention but it seems like a lot of people have not been.At its best Factfullness is charming, funny and endearing. But at its worst, it is annoying, repetitive, self satisfied and condescending. Also for a book that is called Factfullness it has a decent amount of spin and wishful thinking, including omitting negative trends or interpretations of these trends and thinking that just knowing these facts will have larger and more salutary effects than might be the case.First the positive. Global poverty is down a lot, child mortality is down a lot, 80 percent of the world is vaccinated, fertility rates are down as more women exercise choices and education is up--with the gap between girls and boys substantially narrowed. These are all true. And they often get obscured in the type of news coverage that never has stories like ""300,000 planes landed safely today"" or ""I'm reporting from a country at peace.""Why might these facts matter? I don’t think it is going far out on a limb to say that truth is better than falsehood. These facts certainly give a certain amount of deserved comfort to the general parameters of the broad counters of the global system, including both globalization and also the massive efforts of governments, NGOs and activists on issues like vaccinations and child health.Moreover focusing on facts can ensure that you are not allocating effort and resources to emotionally salient issues like rare, small-scale and costly-to-prevent deaths but instead to major killers that can be really cheap to prevent/treat like diareal disease, malaria, and the like. Much of our spending on homeland security and some of our airplane regulations, for example, may be examples of extremely high cost per life saved in a manner that is not motivated by Factfullness.Hans Rosling is also excellent at skewering the condescension that Westerners (or those on Level 4 in the income groupings that Rosling prefers) towards the rest (those in countries that are on Levels 1 through 3, Rosling sensibly rebuts that notion of a unified concept of “developing”). For example, Tunisia is filled with incomplete houses in poor neighborhoods. Some have ascribed this to laziness and the like, but Rosling talks to people and finds that they know what they are doing and are perfectly rational—without safe savings opportunities they put their extra resources into bricks that they layer on top of their homes so they can’t be stolen, slowly building new levels to their houses. He has story after story like this of Africans, Asians and others being much more rational than they are given credit for.This attitude, however, is what makes it so unfortunate that Rosling spends much of the book condescending to all the people that get the answers to his quizzes wrong. And not just criticizing them for getting them wrong, but arguing that their errors lead them to make major mistakes in their own businesses and efforts.For example, in over a dozen places Rosling talks about how he had to explain to naïve and uncomprehending Western business leaders that the world outside the west was larger and richer than they thought and that they should expand sales and investment into it because of the limited size/resources of the West. Does anyone think that point was lost on Western multinationals? Moreover Rosling is less than Factfull when he keeps using Africa as an example of that overlooked opportunity, extolling how incomes are much higher there than anyone thinks, but never once pointing out an important piece of context that most of these corporate leaders implicitly or explicitly know already: Sub-Saharan Africa is only about 2% of the global GDP. I’m not saying it’s not a great opportunity for some companies, but their not paying as much attention to it may be more rational and fact based than Rosling realizes.Another example is his condescension to all of the activists working on issues. He thinks that people pushing for girl’s education should spend more time talking about how great it is that girls on average get 9 years of schooling, just below the 10 years for boys instead of lamenting how many countries seriously discriminate against girls schooling. But he doesn’t stop to think that: (i) this 9 vs. 10 is an average and he cautions us about using averages that conceal the full distribution, and a lot of countries are on a very bad part of this distribution and (ii) possibly activist groups know what they are doing in how they make their appeals, get support and advance change. To be clear, I think we should keep all these facts in mind, I’m just less sure than he is that this perspective would do more to advance these causes.Finally, Factfullness almost always presents positive stories. The one negative story it includes is climate change and even there the argument is that it is not as bad as you think. For example, incomes in the United States are higher than they were 50 years ago. But they are also growing more slowly than they were 50 years ago which matters to a lot of people. And they are growing increasingly unequally which also matters. And very slowly for people at the bottom of the distribution. Rosling would look at these data and point out the progress not the change in the pace of progress or its distribution. The number of global refugees is at an all-time high (I believe, may not be true as a share of population which as Rosling notes, is how one should do all these numbers). Suicides/drug overdoes/alcohol poisoning are all up, at least in the United States.Most importantly, there is widespread discontent in many Western countries. It is hard to believe that this is just because people are not aware of all of the facts. After all, people are more expert in their own situations than any statistician, including Rosling. If he gave Westerners (i.e., people on Level 4) as much credit as he gives people in the rest of the world he would listen to them a little more instead of just condescend about what the facts say.All of that said, Factfullness is a quick, easy and generally fun read and it is hard not to find Rosling and his life mission moving--along with his death and the finishing of his book and work by his son and daughter in law. You should just read it with the same critical eye that Rosling says you should apply to everything else."

It is teaching without preaching and I’ll admit to having the chance to correct several misconceptions about the world we live in (7 out of 13 at least). Although some of the ideas may be found in other books (e.g. Thinking, Fast and Slow by Kahnemann), in Factfulness they have the advantage of being simple, convincing and practical.

I do agree that capitalism has made the world a much better place but i am very much concerned about certain developments in our society. One should not shy away from problems relating to immigration, fundamentalism or social issues."

Middle of the road: Elitist, untenable, often contradictory analysis of generalized (/dubious and cherry picked) ""facts."" Yet you are bombarded (/beat over the head) with so many ""positive"" facts, that you must admit, the world is not going to hell in a hand basket.
This book, isn't bad per se, and if you're not paying too close attention (and don't mind a little authorial hypocrisy), it can also be inspiring and uplifting. Yes, the news is mostly doom and gloom—that's what sells. Yes, the world is improving ... in SOME respects (species extinction and declining environmental factors are ignored, and views on climate change are specious). If you're easily taken in by lots of numbers that appear to prove a point, you'll love this book. Bill Gates and Obama both loved it, MUST be good, right? *record scratch*Upon closer inspection, the stars start to fall away. You don't have to read between the lines however, to get the feeling you are being talked down to, or condescended upon. Oh, you didn't know this obscure fact? Simpleton! In fact, this book almost reads like an auto-boast-ography of Hans Rosling's life. Good for him! He has definitely achieved a lot in his life, I just didn't realize all of it was so applicable to understanding how much better the world is today. Rosling injects jarring personal anecdotes, accomplishments, and experiences into the book, working hard to draw correlations with more general facts and statistics.Rosling spends a large portion of the book telling us what we don't know, and how we, and the rest of the world are wrong. Fair enough. But he argues that most facts and numbers are not valid because of their averageness and flimsy deductions—then proceeds to provide a myriad of stats and averages, that are also ... *wait for it* ... average and vague! Yes, the world has made improvements. Some of these are covered. I'm not sure I buy all of his associations, and what he interprets from various data sets. It is still speculation, even coming from Rosling.The note from the children at the end of the book was touching, discussing their father, Hans's death and the project of the book they embarked on together. Endearing. There are bright spots in this book, no doubt. There is also a lot of repetition, and self-referential content—it would have benefitted from some serious editing. If I hadn't read Steven Pinker's  Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress only last month, I may have enjoyed this more. Reading them so close together made it seem doubly, or triply repetitive. While Pinker presented his case in more sweepingly philosophical terms, Rosling presents an ample supply of numbers, graphs, and charts—albeit with somewhat questionable interpretations. Taking the advice given in this very book, we have to be skeptical of all numbers and their purported meanings. Mixed in among the stats, and therefore appearing *somewhat* more stalwart, Factfulness also employs a lot of common sense and general platitudes. Summary: Taken with a grain of salt, and allowance for a dying man (/narcissist)'s reflection of life achievements, this book is an adequate reminder that a) we can't trust the news or numbers, and b) things aren't all bad.Basic applied statistics skewed to illustrate the author's point and dubbed: ""factfulness"" (aka, a circus of facts). Nothing new here.[From what I've read/heard, his TED Talks are much better.]"
51,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3677821-pete,5,"Factfulness : Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World – and Why Things Are Better Than You Think (2018) by Hans Rosling, Ola Rosling, Anna Rosling Rönnlund is an absolutely outstanding book about the most important numbers in the world and how most people around the world, including researchers, do not know them.Everyone should read this book. It is superb. This review will try and say why. The book combines an engaging narrative with insight and a plethora of facts about our world.Hans Rosling was a Swedish doctor who worked extensively in the developing world and realised that even he did not know much about how the world has developed. He then started studying the big statistics on the plight of the world. He established the Gapminder Foundation ( www.gapminder.org ) that is dedicated to showing the true state of the world through the big numbers on health, population and wealth. Rosling died last year after a truly remarkable life. This book, written with his son and his son's wife is his last act and completed by them is also a great credit to them as well.The book starts with a quiz, the first few questions of which are here:1: In all low-income countries across the world today, how many girls finish primary school? A: 20 percent B: 40 percent, C: 60 percent2: Where does the majority of the world population live? A: Low-income countries B: Middle-income countries C: High-income countries3. In the last 20 years, the proportion of the world population living in extreme poverty has … A: almost doubled B: remained more or less the same C: almost halved4. What is the life expectancy of the world today? A: 50 years B: 60 years C: 70 yearsThe answers are at the end of this review.Rosling posed 13 such questions to various experts and laypeople around the world and found that people usually do worse than guessing at random. This is a truly terrible result. The book is another attempt by Rosling to get us to understand more about the way the world really is and why we have such a poor grasp of the big, basic statistics of our world.Rosling looks at his own life in Sweden, growing up with a mother who was delighted to have a washing machine that freed up so much of her time that in turn allowed her to read to her son who became a doctor. Rosling then intertwines his own life, and extensive experiences in the third world to show how the world has changed and how it really is. He uses his experience as teacher to doctors in Sweden who want to work in the developing world but know little about the reality of it.The book looks at why people are generally far too negative, how they see trends as straight lines rather than as things that change, how we fear things irrationally, how we generalize poorly, how we rarely think about how the past really was, how we don't get enough perspectives, how we then seek to blame and how people exaggerate negatives and proposes Factfulness rules of thumb so we can better understand our world and the fate of people on it.Factfulness is a deep, moving and fantastic book that really helps to educate people as to what the real state of the world is. It should be read by as many people as possible. Hans Rosling lived a remarkable life working to better humanity. The least the rest of us can do is read this entertaining book to educate ourselves better.( 1: C, 2: B, 3: C, 4: C )"
52,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1139239-michael-austin,4,"Factfulness is the last offering of Hans Rosling's public career. A Swedish medical researcher, Rosling was a special kind of Don Quixote. He believed that most Westerners badly misunderstood the non-Western world, that we were trapped in an early-Cold war narrative of a ""Developed World"" and a ""Developing World,"" and that we were making atrocious public policy based on these bad assumptions.So he spend much of his life gathering data and finding ways to present it to people to disrupt the incorrect narrative. And be became a Ted Talk celebrity--mainly because he was funny, occasionally swallowed swords, and had really good data that he presented in really cool formats. One of the most important things he did for the world is popularize some very sophisticated data visualization techniques. But he had a passion to explain.This book is ostensibly about ten human instincts that make it hard for us to understand the world. But the ""ten things"" is really a marketing ploy. Some of them are really the same thing in a different costume, and they all really boil down to various instances of confirmation bias and availability heuristic, with some flawed intuitive probability reasoning thrown in for good measure.The book is not really about the ten ways we get things wrong. It is about the one thing that we are consistently wrong about: people in the West have a sort of visceral belief that people in ""the Third World"" or ""The Developing World,"" all live with crushing poverty and unchecked population growth. Most of this is based on a very old view of the world, circa 1965, when it really was possible to see some wealthy countries as developed and the vast majority of other countries as lagging behind in almost every measure of human flourishing.This is not true any more. It has not been true for years. But most people in the United States and Western Europe believe it, and we make a lot of global policy based on these assumptions.Factfulness is all about changing the narrative with data. This is a start. Once people in ""developed"" countries realize that other countries are developed too, several things can happen:1. We can recognize that a lot of the things we have tried over the last 50 years to address hunger and poverty have actually worked--so we can do more of the same things to end the poverty (not insubstantial) that remains.2. We can stop treating most of the world as a drain on resources and start taking advantage of the new, rich markets that have emerged all over the world in the last 20-50 years.3. We can address public policy issues like immigration and refugees with facts and data instead of the paralyzing fear that millions of poor people want to come into our lifeboat and sink it.4. We can stop being so damn gloomy all the time about the future, which, in many ways, is really rather bright.I enjoyed the book a lot. Sometimes, the author (authors really, as Rosling died in 2017 and his children completed the manuscript) was condescending, and other times he was gimicky. But the data is real, and the problem is serious, and the book has mostly the right answers to the most important questions."
53,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5148911-devika,5,"If you only have time to read one book, then let it be this one. It is one of the most charming, heartwarming, inspiring books I've ever read. Though rooted in public health, this book shares the common misconceptions we all have regarding our worldview. These misconceptions are called the ten 'instincts', and Rosling discusses these in a very accessible way by combining his research with anecdotal evidence. These 'instincts' can also potentially cause missed opportunities in business as we fail to realise the existence of markets. Rosling is that fun grandpa anyone would love to have, someone who teaches us how to think and shows off his love for the circus with his sword swallowing skills. The book is almost like a series of nice long lectures from Rosling, where he starts you off with a neat little quiz to help you see how further your perspective is from reality. He shows that things can be both 'bad' and 'better', which means that 4 million deaths of children is bad but it's definitely better than the earlier rate of 14 million. He teaches that our sole focus on the problems of the world sometimes heightens our dramatic instincts and makes us forget that some progress has been made. His book made me more hopeful.Fun fact: Bill Gates loved this book so much that he’s gifting a free ebook to all graduates from American universities in 2018. Check out his blog gatesnotes.com for details "
54,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71601-philip,4,"Bill Gates gifted this book to every 2018 college graduate.That made me skeptical of the book. Cui bono, no?I'll give you my skeptical take (as to why I think Bill Gates was predisposed to like the book) toward the end of the rambling review. For now: the book.Rosling's big sell is that we can't break the world down into developing/developed, poor/rich anymore. It's more complicated than that.I've got to be honest. It was a tough sell. That was the hardest piece of the book for me to accept. Here's why: He breaks the world down into four levels. Level one is extreme poverty, level two is poverty, level three is moderate, level four is rich.His argument goes like this: if you're making one dollar a day, an extra dollar a day is a HUGE difference. If you're making $64-100 a day, an extra dollar a day isn't as big of a deal. But it's too big of a jump between the two. The difference between people who make $4 a day and $1 a day is a big difference. (Think about what it would be like if you could suddenly make four times the amount you are currently making.) And the difference between someone making $4 and $16 is huge. The difference in how they can live their lives is huge.His analogy goes like this: if you're on the top of a really tall skyscraper, most all the other buildings look the same in their smallness. But they are not the same. There might be great differences between them.It took me a while to accept this, because I'm here in America in my middle class American skyscraper. And I'm saying, ""You want me to call somebody who makes $4 or $16 a day ""middle?"""" (Personally, I think it's okay to use both categories: Levels 1-3 can still be called ""Developing,"" while Level 4 can be called ""Developed."" Change my mind.Eventually, though, he sold me, and I bought into the book.It's a very optimistic book - and it makes sense. The world may be bad, but it's getting better. Put off the hype and negativity for a moment to realize that we live in the greatest time of peace since the Roman Empire. (Rosling references the video, The Fallen of World War II, which I show to my students every year. It's worth every one of the 18 minutes.)He documents the reasons we should be optimistic. People are living longer. Greater peace. Fewer diseases... And he gives some practical steps to keep in check to make sure you're not giving in to the hype about how bad things are, ""these days."" (Each chapter gives you something new to look out for: The Gap Instinct, The Negativity Instinct, The Straight Line Instinct, The Fear Instinct, The Size Instinct, The Generalization Instinct, The Destiny Instinct, The Single Perspective Instinct, The Blame Instinct, The Urgency Instinct.)I don't think any of these ideas are particularly new. We know that the news sensationalizes things to tell stories. (The Fear Instinct.) We've seen politicians blame groups to gain votes and an advantage. (The Blame Instinct.) Still, he brought them to the readers attention in a new way, and one that stayed on his own topic: the world isn't as bad as you may think it is.I took issue with very little of his data. Sometimes I did. I think Climate Change is a bigger threat than what he makes it out to be - the alarmism of Al Gore to the side. And just because there are fewer Nukes than before... we're still just one nuclear attack away from... well... the opposite of how optimistic this book is.The reason I was skeptical of Bill Gates' endorsement also ties in here. Rosling has a video How Many Are Rich and How Many Are Poor, which is basically his entire ""gapminder"" philosophy. We look at the super-rich, and the super-poor, but we should really focus on the ""gap."" Most people - the VAST majority are in the middle. Ignoring the fact that ""middle"" for him includes people making $4 and $16 a day, I still take issue with it. If you break the world down into where the money is, instead of where the people are, the video would look a LOT different, and my guess is Mr. Gates wouldn't have been promoting the book as heavily.Criticisms aside, the book was good. I'll more than likely use it in my classroom this coming year.And it pointed me to a lot of data that I'd not known about, or forgotten about.Gapminder.World Bank.World Health Organization.United Nations Dept. of Economic and Social Affairs.Center for Disease Control and Prevention.Our World in Data.Child Mortality Estimates.Dollar Street.(I'm hoping to start a spread sheet or web page of sites like these that would be helpful in my classroom. If you have any, feel free to add them in the comments.)"
55,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5995202-isil-arican,5,"“There’s no room for facts when our minds are occupied by fear.” I picked to read this book for two reasons: 1. Hans Rosling was one of my heroes until he passed away. I always admired him, his energy, his enthusiasm and his mater-of-factness. I watched all of his presentations and was lucky to have the chance to meet him in person in 2015. So I wanted to read his book since it was a great summary of his legacy, which I value greatly.2. The previous book I read this year was ""Enlightment Now"" by Steven Pinker, and it had lots of references to Rosling's book, so it was perfect timing. I was not disappointed. Rosling tells the story of his research and his data visualization journey in some striking examples, personal memories and sometimes hilariously funny anecdotes. His overall position might sound too optimistic from time to time, but he is also very open about talking how grim extreme poverty can be, and how we mostly dismiss it when we talk about poor.One thing I loved about this book is that it reminds us to be kind, thoughtful, humble and open-minded. This, in my opinion, is a book that should be read by every skeptic and critical thinking, because it would wake us up from the groupthink we find ourselves in, and put things in perspective.Strongly recommended to all readers.And please take some time and do watch his videos...----------“Human beings have a strong dramatic instinct toward binary thinking, a basic urge to divide things into two distinct groups, with nothing but an empty gap in between. We love to dichotomize. Good versus bad. Heroes versus villains. My country versus the rest. Dividing the world into two distinct sides is simple and intuitive, and also dramatic because it implies conflict, and we do it without thinking, all the time.” “We like to believe that things happen because someone wanted them to, that individuals have power and agency: otherwise, the world feels unpredictable, confusing, and frightening.” "
56,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467890-tristan-eagling,5,"I've been a fan of Hans Rosling since watching his Ted talks almost ten years ago, if you have not watched them stop reading this and go and do it now, you will thank me for it.The first few chapters revisit the same ground , but the rest of this book is more of his inspired take on the importance of data.The book makes you rethink your world view but more surprisingly from a book essentially about numbers is this book makes you well up with emotion. As well as being a clearly incredibility intelligent man Hans was a great communicator and this shines through the pages. There is also a lot about himself , but this is not an autobiography (at one point he mentions getting cancer in his thirties and is it is given all of two lines) but he uses stories to emphasis points brilliantly. One story is so breathtakingly honest and self critical it could only have been written by a dying man and made me have to put the book down for a moment because it was so heartbreaking. I would say that this book should be read by everybody who works in development but it would be doing it a disservice , it should be read by everyone! At least for the next 5 years at which point it will be out of date in our ever changing world, and someone equally as brilliant should write a new version just as Hans would have wanted. "
57,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8622906-simona-paunova,5,"This book comes from an author who has not read about the world but rather experienced it. It's tedious but, it's an eye-opener for things we do see and happen right in front of us, yet most of us are still not aware of their existence. An utter must-read. By presenting real fact-based data, it copes with our misconceptions and misbeliefs, most of them perceived by commonly shared sentiments - an overdramatic worldview, negative instincts or fear. It does not advocate to turn our backs on the problems and the bad things, but to spot the changes and good things alongside them.This book gave me a clear vision and a wider view to the world as it is. An immense self-consciousness. A stimulus to cherish the ""sense of wonder"" and be a ""possibilist"". Because it's neither bad or good, but it's ""bad and better"". Instead of murmuring about the bad things, let's be part of the positive changes. Let's acknowledge the progress and trust the process, regardless of the speed it takes to move further. Let's choose critical thinking over instinctive reactions. Factfulness is a reminder to keep the knowledge about the world always up-to date. ""It is as it is and will always be"" - No, we should not take anything for granted, but rather stay agile and upgrade with newer versions of the knowledge about the world."
58,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13635667-harald-groven,5,"Hans Rosling explains how media bias, ideological preconceptions and statistical illiteracy makes most people (in rich countries) believe in a gloomy and spectacularly wrong worldview. The book carefully explains by data and vivid examples how positive developments are systematically underreported, while disaster news are vastly over-reported. Rosling categorise the 10 most important sources of bias and misconceptions as well as explaining strategies on how to avoid them.This book is a treasure trove of evidence based reasoning, global statistics and myth busting! I read it just after finishing Steven Pinker's Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress. These books have a lot in common, both in goal and tone, but I enjoyed Rosling's book much more.Unless you have watched Roslings famous lectures (available on TED and Youtube), this book will forever change the way you understand global health, demography and development."
59,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5051728-vojtech,5,"Reading this book is like therapy it's so positive. It deals with misconceptions we have about the world, distribution of wealth, healthcare etc. Some have said it reads a little bit like a Ted talk and for better or worse I think this is true. It shows for example in frequent repetition of simplifying phrases such as ""people do worse than chimps at answering certain questions"". But I still think anyway it opens your eyes when it comes to some things. The recommendations at the end of each chapter are usually not super enlightening or surprising to the readers of books about cognitive biases and behavioral economy. But the stories and anecdotes are certainly amusing and the book makes for an entertaining, informative and overall enjoyable read. I think it's already one of my 2019 books I will remember going forward, so if in doubt definitely give it a read!"

62,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3898791-udit-nair,5,"This book presents a refreshing approach to tackle things which confront humanity. It becomes a very essential read because most of us think that the world is a pathetic and miserable place to be in. But contrary to the popular notion we are placed much better than what it used to be maybe even few decades ago. Why one should read this one-1. The book is written in very simple and accessible manner. Though the author cautions everybody from seeing things in simplistic way but he does a great job in conveying his message through simplicity.2. The book challenges our misconceptions and hence it can become a source of introspection and hence progress.3. The book is indeed a great testimony of human progress achieved over years. It places great faith in humanity's ability to overcome problems. Now this faith is not based on wishful thinking but are backed by facts and figures. 4. Which leads me to next good thing about the book. That is the use of facts, statistics and all the bubbles. It is hard to deny the claim when stats are staring right into your ignorance. 5. The author has carefully identified the reasons for our misconception or ignorance. So hence he goes out to list the problems and he calls it the Instincts. Now this follows with solutions to tackle it. For eg he talks about the blame instinct. With corona crisis it becomes more evident. How countries and groups are hell bent on finding a scapegoat to pin the cause on it. Now the way to tackle this blame instinct is to look for causes and not villains. Its important to find the multiple causes which gave rise to pandemic rather than one nation, one group, one community, one action or one person. Same applies for if something good happens. Look for systems and not heroes.The things which I dont agree with the author-1. The very portrayal of grief and suffering in terms of numbers. I do agree that the world is a better place. But it doesn't help a person living in war torn places such as Syria or Yemen or Sudan to know that statistically conflict has decreased. For the individual or groups of people the reality of daily life is unimaginable. 2. The author contends that activists should not create an atmosphere of fear when confronting global challenges such as climate change. I completely disagree with this. Its because even after creating the fear there are leaders across the globe who even deny the threat and the numbers are large. Bureaucracy always reacts to a problem according to the intensity or the fear in the masses. And hence it becomes necessary that people are made aware about the existential threats specially when it comes to issues like climate change. 3. I am also of the opinion that certain amount of negativity is necessary to propel the systems and make it work. Because as we see around humans generally dont act until the threat is imminent or it affects them directly.Because otherwise its business as usual and this type of attitude can be disastrous if extended to ruling and political class."
63,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,5,"Factfulness is yet another great book that everyone who lives in this world should read. And this is coming from a person who has been generally pessimistic about the world. It may appear dichotomous for me to 5-star this book which was supposed to be telling us that the world is better than we think it is, after doing the same to one which told about how humanity made a mess of everything in this world. In fact, it took me a while to pick up this well-lauded title because I was worried that it may paint an overly rosy picture about the world. However, my concern was unfounded. Factfulness did tell me that the world is not bad as I thought it to be, but it also emphasized that while some things are getting better, there remained big issues and risks out there that need to be addressed. And it is by getting facts right and in context that resources and efforts can be directed to fixing the root causes and real problems. Supplementing both Factfulness by Hans Rosling and Humans by Tom Phillips made one of the best and most insightful non-fiction reads I've had of late. Hans Rosling called himself a 'possibilist' - not a pessimist, nor an optimist. Throughout the book, he provided lots of personal experiences and anecdotes. Some of these I could tell were painful for him to recall and share, but it lent a whole lot of credibility to his writing.  There's a lot more to say as I reflect upon what I've gotten out of this book, but I believe that it's best for one to just read it. It is so well-written, well-presented and engaging that it makes for an easy and fairly quick read. This quote from the book pretty much summarised how Factfulness could make us and the world better. 
""I don't tell you not to worry. I tell you to worry about the right things. I don't tell you look away from the news or to ignore the activists' calls to action. I tell you to ignore the noise, but keep an eye on the big global risks. I don't tell you not to be afraid. I tell you to stay coolheaded and support the global collaborations we need to reduce these risks. Control your urgency instinct. Control all your dramatic instincts. Be less stressed by the imaginary problems of an overdramatic world, and more alert to the real problems and how to solve them.

And it is an interesting book, a valuable publication, definitely a book I wouldn't like to miss.At the beginning I wasn't sure that I really like and believe in dividing people in various levels (based on their income, place / country of living...) but ended up having understanding and agreeing with most of the facts in this book. Definitely I learned a lot, changed mu opinion in many things... Liked Hans Rosling's stories based on personal experience, the one about blame is a shocking story but full of truth...A good book, rich on information, well written, valuable graphs and pictures, reads like fiction, unforgettable."

1. In all low-income countries across the world today, how many girls finish primary school?2. Where does the majority of the world population live?3. In the last 20 years, the proportion of the world population living in extreme poverty has…4. What is the life expectancy of the world today?5. There are 2 billion children in the world today, aged 0 to 15 years old. How many children will there be in the year 2100, according to the United Nations?6. The UN predicts that by 2100 the world population will have increased by another 4 billion people. What is the main reason?7. How did the number of deaths per year from natural disasters change over the last hundred years?...
Only 10% of people scored better than random guessing on these questions, the most important trends of the last hundred years. How can it be that we are both 1) a rabidly overconfident species and 2) an extremely pessimistic species that generally gets these simple, objective questions very wrong (doing far worse than random)? Sure, we could just be dogmatic nihilists or idiots, but that doesn't fit that well. 
A stunning 15% of humans managed to pick the wrong answer on all twelve questions. That’s almost impossible for a monkey to achieve. It requires systematic misconceptions. The problem here is not the lack of correct knowledge. The problem is the presence of wrong “knowledge”. To score this bad requires a false perception of the world, that make you pick the wrong answer systematically.
Rosling explains it in terms of cognitive biases: we suffer from a 
dramatic
 worldview, binarised, conflict-obsessed, and blamey. People seem to find Development - the completely unprecedented explosion of survival, freedom, and dignity for the larger part of the entire world! - boring. (You could blame the media, but Rosling persuasively argues that they too are an epiphenomenon of our evolved fear and narrowness.)
Your most important challenge in developing a fact-based worldview is to realize that most of your firsthand experiences are from Level 4 [the top 10% of global income]; and that your secondhand experiences are filtered through the mass media, which loves nonrepresentative extraordinary events and shuns normality. When you live on Level 4, everyone on Levels 3, 2, and 1 can look equally poor, and the word poor can lose any specific meaning... Anyone who has looked down from the top of a tall building knows that it is difficult to assess from there the differences in height of the buildings nearer the ground. They all look kind of small... It is natural to miss the distinctions between the people with cars, the people with motorbikes and bicycles, the people with sandals, and the people with no shoes at all. 
On the shocking lack of empiricism even in the most important places like medicine and policy:
In the 1960s, the success of the recovery position inspired new public health advice, against most traditional practices, to put babies to sleep on their tummies... Even though the data showed that sudden infant deaths went up, not down, it wasn’t until 1985 that a group of pediatricians in Hong Kong actually suggested that the prone position might be the cause. Even then, doctors in Europe didn’t pay much attention. It took Swedish authorities another seven years to accept their mistake and reverse the policy...With my own hands, over a decade or so, I turned many babies from back to tummy to prevent suffocation and save lives. So did many other doctors and parents throughout Europe and the United States, until the advice was finally reversed, 18 months after the Hong Kong study was published. Thousands of babies died because of a sweeping generalization, including some during the months when the evidence was already available. 

Two hundred ninety-two brave young feminists had traveled to Stockholm from across the world to coordinate their struggle to improve women's access to education. But only 8 percent knew that 30-year-old women have spent on average only one year less in school than 30-year-old men.
Bad incentives and noble lies are another reason for the stubborn gloom of intellectuals:
There has been progress in human rights, animal protection, women's education, climate awareness, catastrophe relief, and many other areas where activists raise awareness by saying that things are getting worse.
Relentlessly sensible:
resist blaming any one individual or group of individuals for anything. Because the problem is that when we identify the bad guy, we are done thinking. And it’s almost always more complicated than that. It’s almost always about multiple interacting causes—a system. If you really want to change the world, you have to understand how it actually works and forget about punching anyone in the face. 
I've been studying Development for years and this still taught me plenty. It should shock you into awareness and hopefully more.
Paying too much attention to the individual visible victim rather than to the numbers can lead us to spend all our resources on a fraction of the problem, and therefore save many fewer lives. This principle applies anywhere we are prioritizing scarce resources. It is hard for people to talk about resources when it comes to saving lives, or prolonging or improving them Doing so is often taken for heartlessness. Yet so long as resources are not infinite—and they never are infinite—it is the most compassionate thing to do to use your brain and work out how to do the most good with what you have. 
One of the ""five books that represent my worldview"": moral passion, strict empiricism, psychological depth, existential hope. I picked this rather than Enlightenment Now or Rational Optimist or Doing Good Better or Our World In Data or Whole Earth Discipline (out of the contemporary literature of progress) because it also covers heuristics and biases - and so substitutes / complements Kahneman, Taleb, Hanson, and Yudkowsky, without (what people insist on seeing as) their self-superior wonkishness.
Thank you industrialization, thank you steel mill, thank you power station, thank you chemical-processing industry, for giving us the time to read books. 
In a sense he stays on the surface - this isn't the full radical evolutionary account of 
Elephant in the Brain
, instead just noting some bad epistemic practices and gesturing at evolutionary theory. But that said, there's a ""charity is not about helping"" bit:
If I check the World Wildlife Fund I can see how, despite declines in some local populations, the total wild populations of tigers, giant pandas, and black rhinos have all increased over the past years. It was worth paying for all those pandas stickers on the doors all around Stockholm. Yet only 6% of the Swedish public knows that their support has had any effect.
But despite all the suffering and error and backfiring efforts he describes, he is trying to make you realise how good things could be:
Could everyone have a fact-based worldview one day? Big change is always difficult to imagine. But it is definitely possible, and I think it will happen, for two simple reasons. First: a fact-based worldview is more useful for navigating life, just like an accurate GPS is more useful for finding your way in the city. Second, and probably more important: a fact-based worldview is more comfortable. It creates less stress and hopelessness than the dramatic worldview, simply because the dramatic one is so negative and terrifying. When we have a fact-based worldview, we can see that the world is not as bad as it seems— and we can see what we have to do to keep making it better. 
This, then, is the same message as Sagan, 25 years ago: the emotional gain of reason. ---Misc notes- Binary categories are often unhelpful because they obscure continuum. Rosling ranted against ""developed"" / ""developing"" for 20 years. The World Bank has caught on but the UN haven't.- He is a better messenger for the cognitive bias alarm, for activists anyway, because of his deep credibility: he mucked in to anti-poverty measures for decades. Some of his anecdotes are chilling.
I could tell you countless stories of the nonsense I saw in Cuba: the local moonshine, a toxic fluorescent concoction brewed inside TV tubes using water, sugar, and babies’ poopy diapers to provide the yeast required for fermentation; the hotels that hadn’t planned for any guests and so had no food, a problem we solved by driving to an old people’s home and eating their leftovers from the standard adult food rations; my Cuban colleague who knew his children would be expelled from university if he sent a Christmas card to his cousin in Miami; the fact that I had to explain my research methods to Fidel Castro personally to get approval. I will restrain myself and just tell you why I was there and what I discovered. 
- ""I do not believe that fake news is the major culprit for our distorted worldview: we haven’t only just started to get the world wrong, I think we have always gotten it wrong.""- ""In the car industry, cars are recalled when a mistake is discovered. You get a letter from the manufacturer saying, “We would like to recall your vehicle and replace the brakes.” When the facts about the world that you were taught in schools and universities become out of date, you should get a letter too: “Sorry, what we taught you is no longer true. Please return your brain for a free upgrade.” """
71,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63280509-lindsey-clewett,5,"I love this book. It isn’t often I give 5* but this book is thoroughly deserving. Everyone should read this. Hans starts off with a quiz about the general state of the world with a focus on health and wealth. I won’t give too much away but suffice to say you’ll probably get more than a few questions wrong. I did the quiz with my husband and scored much better than him on most questions because I’d seen the TED talk. So if you don’t have time to read the book, watch the TED talk. But read the book. Hans then talks about how everyone gets the questions wrong, even experts. Why? Because we have a skewed, outdated world view. He then seeks to address this, starting with redefining our definition of the world from 2 categories of developed/developing countries to 4 income levels. Next he talks about 10 tendencies, or instincts, that we employ when judging/thinking about the world, and creating and consuming news and media. He talks about how these instincts help us and are necessary in some situations but are detrimental to learning about the world. And then he gives us tips on how to bypass these and make correct judgements. All of this is peppered with the most fascinating and engaging stories of his life as a trainee doctor in Sweden, a doctor in Africa with Médicin Sans Frontières and a Professor of health. Hans is a great story teller and you get the impression his whole life’s work has led to this moment, the creation of this book, a heap of knowledge and wisdom built up over decades and condensed into an extremely digestible, and highly readable, vital lesson on how to view the world and make good decisions. If you’re not familiar with Hans’ work I fully recommend checking out some of his videos on TED, YouTube or his own site gapminder.org. The book is so much more enjoyable if you can hear his voice in your head. Sadly Hans died last year. This book is an honourable legacy. "
72,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13369978-jana-light,4,"I really enjoyed this book. It reads quickly because of all the graphs, but it is packed with good data demonstrating that the world is better than we think it is. ""Bad, but better."" (My new favorite way to describe the world.) This is a wonderful manifesto for curiosity and letting facts drive our assessment of the world, rather than our limited and parochial world views.I kept thinking of Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow while I read. Kahneman tackles cognitive biases, Rosling tackles bad mental habits. Two books that should be read by everyone. (IMHO)I'll be honest -- I was a little turned off by ""him"" and his voice throughout. It felt a bit too cocky. However, I outright bawled at the postscript, so apparently his stories and anecdotes really generated a tenderness in me towards him. I felt this worth noting, because I don't tend to cry with these kinds of books over an affinity for the author himself/herself."

Should be given out as a general handbook for understanding the world. It does not just break the myths we have from decades ago, but also brings a framework how to be in touch with the reality going forward.My main takeway: Stop the developing/developed countries nonsense, there are regions on the whole spectrum of income, use dollarstreet.org when trying to get an idea how a family on part of the spectrum lives.Also: gapminder.org/tools is a great explorative UI for various world metrics. For example, life expectancy versus total health expenses shows really well the fuckupedness of US health system."

And not because I don't obviously know that we are a better world- a better society- now than say in the Middle Ages. Duh.It is because I'm against the notion that the fact that we've progressed could mean that we should stop seeking an even betterment of the world.I think the premise of this book is used as proof that we are good (not better) in the world and so no changes are necessary.Hans Rosling does present a hopeful panorama (and the book is pretty great) but I think he also presents a case for contentment. And I disagree with that."
77,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47154315-ian,4,"I would have liked to have spent a bit more time on this fairly new book, but alas the library had a huge waiting list of eager readers, so I could not renew it.There is good reason for the popularity and interest in Hans Rosling's book, which he worked on with his son and daughter in-law as a project that arouse from his lifetime of work as a public health official in Sweden.Rosling's thesis is that a huge majority of us cannot answer factual questions about the state of the modern world, which is apparently doing quite well in several important metrics. When it comes to questions such as, what percentage of women have 10 years or more of schooling, what is the average income in India, or what is the child-mortality of Bangladesh, most of us are sadly inaccurate and believe that the world still is what it was when we were taught in elementary school circa 1952. In fact, when he spends the early part of the book posing multiple-choice questions to the reader to show that the world is better off than ever in many measures, Rosling is rather fond of pointing out that even UN officials are typically less accurate in their responses to these questions than the random choices of a group of chimpanzees! Why?! How come our gut instincts are so outdated and false when it comes to the very world we live in?A big part of it is to do with just that, relying on our gut instincts. These tend to be set as the cognitive foundation by our elementary school projects from 30-50 years ago on the ""Third-World"", the news media's love of uniquely bad news (""if it doesn't bleed, it doesn't lead""), and our human tendencies of over-generalizing and being trapped in our own perspective.I think it important to point out that Rosling and his positive fact-finders are not simply some pollyannas saying that the world is just great and everything is getting better. He makes an effort to show that some things are indeed not getting better, such as the threat of climate change and the rise of political violence and terrorism in the last few decades. His purpose, however, is to rouse those of us living in the wealthier parts of the world to snap out of our old worldview and when presented with facts that seem ""unreal"" to actually look at the real data, to think critically about that data, and to ultimately realize that the world is changing in many ways for the better.Interestingly, I find that his advice also works well in this era of ""fake news"", where politicians can spout anything that seems to hold with an unsophisticated, uncritical worldview. Instead, if we again apply Rosling's tenets of looking up the true data, comparing numbers, thinking critically, and being aware of our own internal biases, we can tell which news is ""fake"" and which is not. A handy set of tools that truly can make the world better. Much better."
78,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/565673-nicholas-whyte,5,"https://nwhyte.livejournal.com/3142977.htmlI was a huge fan of the videos of Hans Rosling, who died in March 2017; and I write as one who generally hates vlogging (even though I have indulged in it myself occasionally). In Factfulness, the book he rushed to complete with his son and daughter-in-law when he learned he was dying, he calls on us all to engage critically with news stories and perceptions about the world - particularly about the state of humanity as a whole, most of all the developing economies. The concept of 'Factfulness', clearly intended as a close relative of mindfulness, is defined as :the stress-reducing habvit of only carrying opinions for which you have strong supporting facts.He repeatedly makes the effective point that most people - including the rich, privileged and well-informed - perform less well on a basic test about the state of the world than would a chimpanzee selecting answers at random.If I can boil it down, his first key message is that things are better than they were, but that should not deter us from making them better still. In particular, humanity is healthier, more prosperous, safer and more peaceful than it has ever been, and the greatest improvements have been made in countries which were desperately poor decades ago and have caught up since. BUT, his second key message is that news reports naturally concentrate on the drama of failure and crisis, so it's easy to get the impression that the world is going to hell; improvements are generally gradual (not always - there is the striking case of the recent decrease in birthrate in Iran, for instance, which of course received no international media coverage) while disasters, epidemics and wars fit the news cycle. HOWEVER, thirdly there is a real climate crisis, but we must be careful not to exaggerate it; the facts themselves are worrying enough, without resorting to worst-case scenarios or irrelevant issues (and he has plenty of cites for those).I find this all very attractive. If we are looking for a framework to push back against fake news, Rosling's fact-based approach is a very good place to start. but also, if we are trying to get to grips with crises (of which climate change is clearly the most drastic), it's very helpful to be able to point to the progress that has already been made as well as the further steps that are demanded. Certainly I find it easier to be motivated by the thought of building on previous good work than the notion of crusading against an inevitable fate. Strongly recommended."

If you are a manufacturer of menstrual pads, this is bad for business. So you ought to know about, and be so happy about, the drop in babies per woman across the world. You ought to know and be happy too about the growth in the number of educated women working away from home. Because these developments have created an exploding market for your products over the last few decades among billions of menstruating women now living on Levels 2 [income of $2-8/day] and 3 [income of $8-32/day].But, as I realized when I attended an internal meeting at one of the world's biggest manufacturers of sanitary wear, most Western manufacturers have completely missed this. Instead, when hunting for new customers they are often stuck dreaming up new needs among the 300 million menstruating women on Level 4 [income above $32/day]. ""What if we market an even thinner pad for bikinis? What about pads that are invisible, to wear Lycra? How about one pad for each kind of outfit, each situation, each sport? Special pads for mountain climbers!"" Ideally, all the pads are so small they need to be replaced several times a day. But like most rich consumer markets, the basic needs are already met, and producers fight in vain to create demand in ever-smaller segments.Meanwhile, on Levels 2 and 3, roughly 2 billion menstruating women have few alternatives to choose from. These women don't wear Lycra and won't spend money on ultrathin pads. They demand a low-cost pad that will be reliable throughout the day so they don't have to change it when they are out at work. And when they find a product they like, they will probably stick to that brand for their whole lives and recommend it to their daughters."""
80,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63307890-amy,1,"My favorite thing about this book is that this guy is a quirky sword swallower. Unfortunately, it truly ends there. Anyone that's taken a basic statistics course or a population dynamics course can approach this narrative with an appropriately critical eye. I think that these instincts/trends in human emotion and cognition are real, but his oversimplification of global issues is reductive and un-academic. I think that his arguments would have been much stronger if he had justified them with neurology literature which he is fully qualified to do as a clinician. I especially find fault with his depiction of emphasizing the urgency of climate change as “crying wolf.” I get what he’s saying. He’s trying to say that activists are trying to present the worst case scenario to generate action. Unfortunately, the information he uses contradicts that of leading climate scientists and is not indeed “fact” based. Likewise, his assertion that the link between climate change and migration is “very weak” is preposterous. This man is really comfortable spouting off a string of poorly formulated arguments. What he doesn’t discuss in much detail is that statistical analyses can be cherry picked to support arguments. Your argument can still be poor if you cite data. This is exactly what he has done, but with a grating hubris that his perspective is unquestionably empirical. He also takes a very long time to make each individual point due to his meandering style. I know this is part of the ""I'm writing like I talk"" style, but there's a reason why people like concision. I am honestly shocked that this book got such great reviews."
81,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,4,"Factfulness is basically an information literacy text that takes a hard look at how humans misjudge numbers. I enjoy statistics and have a pretty good grasp of PhD level stats, so I was more interested in the kinds of misjudgments most people make. On this front, the book did not disappoint. Each chapter focuses on a different type of thinking error and covers the territory pretty well. As humans, we like simple explanations that put the blame on a concrete person or entity, even in the absence of conclusive data.The authors’ main point is, assume nothing. Gather data. Summarize it intelligently, then draw appropriate conclusions. As a retired academic, I hope I have largely managed to do this. But I noticed as I was reading the book that we do tend to jump to conclusions based on personal experience and limited data. The Iowa caucuses had a massive technology failure last night and results are as yet unavailable. The internet is rife with assumptions that the DNC was involved in a shadowy plot to undermine one candidate or another. This is hogwash but otherwise intelligent friends clearly believe it. The media doesn’t help as it reports on the technology problem as if it were a major scandal. This situation demonstrates many of the authors’ principles. Use data to make decisions. Don’t be swayed by provocative media coverage. Don’t scapegoat. And so on. I’d recommend this book for anyone with little statistical training who is interested in thinking about how to frame issues based on data."
82,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85511402-taro,1,"Rosling thinks that the statistical data he is using in the book are facts. Many of the data come from the IMF and from the world bank. I don't really think those capitalistic institutes provide really objective data. As Winston Churchill said: The only statistics you can trust are those you falsified yourself.The author claims that in Fukushima nobody died form radioactivity. People were dying from fear of radioactivity. The same claim about the pesticide DDT. Even worse he claims the Vietnam War was not that severe, the country had some longer wars in the history. These statements make me feel sad.One big mistake in this book is the use of the average income to declare the financial state of a country. If there is one rich billionaire living in this country, the average would increase dramatically. Rosling should better use the median income. That means the income, where 50% of the people earn more, and 50% earn less. The median is typically smaller than the average. The so-called facts of this book would look very different then ...The most annoying thing in the book is the use of an exponential scale in the income graphics. If Rosling used a linear scale, then most of the people would live in Level 1, only a few in Levels 2, 3 and 4. Details on this issue can be found in the Web, search for ""Factfulness: Building Gapminder Income Mountains"" of the Stockholm University."
83,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"This amazing book reminds me of Steven Pinker's wonderful book ""Enlightenment Now"". Hans tries to explain why the world is a much better place to live now than decades in the past. Most of us have a distorted view of the world and it's mainly because of our instinctive biases. According to Hans Rosling, the world is not divided in two. There's no gap between the rich and the poor. So maybe you'd better stop using the words ""developing"" and ""developed"". Human beings have a strong dramatic instinct toward binary thinking. A basic urge to divide things into two distinct groups, with nothing but an empty gap in between. We love to dichotomize: good vs. bad. Heroes vs. villains. My country vs. the rest. We are naturally drawn to extreme examples because they are easier to recall. We tend to notice the bad more than the good. That's why the majority of people think that the world is getting worse. We also have a fear instinct. When we are afraid, we do not see clearly. Critical thinking is always difficult, but it's almost impossible when we are scared. There's no room for facts when our minds are occupied by fear. This fear can distort our worldview. Fear that once helped keep our ancestors alive, today helps keep journalist's employed. We need to remember that things can be bad and getting better. "
84,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11438581-sindhura,4,"
The world cannot be understood without numbers. And it cannot be understood with numbers alone.
Factfulness is a great book that explains how our instincts sometimes distort our understanding of our world and why it's crucial to learn established facts that are now reliably and readily available. Our instincts might help in certain situations, but in others, critical thinking beyond emotions is necessary. 
I'm a very serious ""possibilist."" That's something I made up. It means someone who neither hopes without reason, nor fears without reason, someone who constantly resists the overdramatic worldview.
In a world more connected than ever, it's harmful to view each other through old and murky glasses. We often continue to regard the world wrong either because of the exciting news and messages we receive or the way we perceive the stories. The world is continually changing, and it is both bad and getting better at the same time. So, it is essential to develop a factful view of the world instead of a dramatic one. And Hans Rosling makes an excellent case for it in this book."
85,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5687484-ana,5,"I am actively recommending this book to a large number of people - that's how much I loved reading it! One of the main points which resonates with me is that the world has been improving in a significant way in certain areas which tend to be overlooked. It explores approachable ways in which to deconstruct simplistic ideas like 'rich and poor countries', it encourages critical thinking with simple advice like looking at distributions or making relevant comparisons when trying to make sense of data about the world. And it's got charts with clear labelling and titles and drawings and chapter summaries with bullet points and citations and references and all the things I love - it really is a masterpiece of pedagogy without becoming condescending or repetitive.

86,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36137204-carl-rannaberg,4,"Definitely an important book which discusses how our worldview is distorted compared to the actual facts.This distortion happens through the combination of many factors: psychological biases, lack of systems thinking, sensationalistic and negative focus of media, inability to comprehend exponential growth, outdated school programs, half-life of facts etc.One of the key takeaways from this book is that the world is never black and white. It’s always some shade of gray and it’s not monotone. Also averages are mostly meaningless, distribution is what matters.If only the world and local leaders would read this book and apply the methods in their work, we would make a lot less dumb decisions as societies and habitants of the Earth."

I grew in South America; thus, I have a serious love-hate relationship with Médecins Sans Frontières, aka Doctors Without Borders, 2. I am a huge data nerd, and 3. I am smarter than a chimpanzee, at least according to Dr. Rosling's criteria. While this book does a very good job of emphasizing the importance of quality relevant data; it most definitely has its own agenda and tone that was hard to overlook. Nonetheless, I do agree that curiosity and humility are key ingredients to reduce the ignorance of the well-educated 4 level folks. "

92,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3898791-udit-nair,5,"This book presents a refreshing approach to tackle things which confront humanity. It becomes a very essential read because most of us think that the world is a pathetic and miserable place to be in. But contrary to the popular notion we are placed much better than what it used to be maybe even few decades ago. Why one should read this one-1. The book is written in very simple and accessible manner. Though the author cautions everybody from seeing things in simplistic way but he does a great job in conveying his message through simplicity.2. The book challenges our misconceptions and hence it can become a source of introspection and hence progress.3. The book is indeed a great testimony of human progress achieved over years. It places great faith in humanity's ability to overcome problems. Now this faith is not based on wishful thinking but are backed by facts and figures. 4. Which leads me to next good thing about the book. That is the use of facts, statistics and all the bubbles. It is hard to deny the claim when stats are staring right into your ignorance. 5. The author has carefully identified the reasons for our misconception or ignorance. So hence he goes out to list the problems and he calls it the Instincts. Now this follows with solutions to tackle it. For eg he talks about the blame instinct. With corona crisis it becomes more evident. How countries and groups are hell bent on finding a scapegoat to pin the cause on it. Now the way to tackle this blame instinct is to look for causes and not villains. Its important to find the multiple causes which gave rise to pandemic rather than one nation, one group, one community, one action or one person. Same applies for if something good happens. Look for systems and not heroes.The things which I dont agree with the author-1. The very portrayal of grief and suffering in terms of numbers. I do agree that the world is a better place. But it doesn't help a person living in war torn places such as Syria or Yemen or Sudan to know that statistically conflict has decreased. For the individual or groups of people the reality of daily life is unimaginable. 2. The author contends that activists should not create an atmosphere of fear when confronting global challenges such as climate change. I completely disagree with this. Its because even after creating the fear there are leaders across the globe who even deny the threat and the numbers are large. Bureaucracy always reacts to a problem according to the intensity or the fear in the masses. And hence it becomes necessary that people are made aware about the existential threats specially when it comes to issues like climate change. 3. I am also of the opinion that certain amount of negativity is necessary to propel the systems and make it work. Because as we see around humans generally dont act until the threat is imminent or it affects them directly.Because otherwise its business as usual and this type of attitude can be disastrous if extended to ruling and political class."
93,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,5,"Factfulness is yet another great book that everyone who lives in this world should read. And this is coming from a person who has been generally pessimistic about the world. It may appear dichotomous for me to 5-star this book which was supposed to be telling us that the world is better than we think it is, after doing the same to one which told about how humanity made a mess of everything in this world. In fact, it took me a while to pick up this well-lauded title because I was worried that it may paint an overly rosy picture about the world. However, my concern was unfounded. Factfulness did tell me that the world is not bad as I thought it to be, but it also emphasized that while some things are getting better, there remained big issues and risks out there that need to be addressed. And it is by getting facts right and in context that resources and efforts can be directed to fixing the root causes and real problems. Supplementing both Factfulness by Hans Rosling and Humans by Tom Phillips made one of the best and most insightful non-fiction reads I've had of late. Hans Rosling called himself a 'possibilist' - not a pessimist, nor an optimist. Throughout the book, he provided lots of personal experiences and anecdotes. Some of these I could tell were painful for him to recall and share, but it lent a whole lot of credibility to his writing.  There's a lot more to say as I reflect upon what I've gotten out of this book, but I believe that it's best for one to just read it. It is so well-written, well-presented and engaging that it makes for an easy and fairly quick read. This quote from the book pretty much summarised how Factfulness could make us and the world better. 
""I don't tell you not to worry. I tell you to worry about the right things. I don't tell you look away from the news or to ignore the activists' calls to action. I tell you to ignore the noise, but keep an eye on the big global risks. I don't tell you not to be afraid. I tell you to stay coolheaded and support the global collaborations we need to reduce these risks. Control your urgency instinct. Control all your dramatic instincts. Be less stressed by the imaginary problems of an overdramatic world, and more alert to the real problems and how to solve them.

In the last 20 years, the proportion of the world population living in extreme poverty has…4. What is the life expectancy of the world today?5. There are 2 billion children in the world today, aged 0 to 15 years old. How many children will there be in the year 2100, according to the United Nations?6. The UN predicts that by 2100 the world population will have increased by another 4 billion people. What is the main reason?7. How did the number of deaths per year from natural disasters change over the last hundred years?...
Only 10% of people scored better than random guessing on these questions, the most important trends of the last hundred years. How can it be that we are both 1) a rabidly overconfident species and 2) an extremely pessimistic species that generally gets these simple, objective questions very wrong (doing far worse than random)? Sure, we could just be dogmatic nihilists or idiots, but that doesn't fit that well. 
A stunning 15% of humans managed to pick the wrong answer on all twelve questions. That’s almost impossible for a monkey to achieve. It requires systematic misconceptions. The problem here is not the lack of correct knowledge. The problem is the presence of wrong “knowledge”. To score this bad requires a false perception of the world, that make you pick the wrong answer systematically.
Rosling explains it in terms of cognitive biases: we suffer from a 
dramatic
 worldview, binarised, conflict-obsessed, and blamey. People seem to find Development - the completely unprecedented explosion of survival, freedom, and dignity for the larger part of the entire world! - boring. (You could blame the media, but Rosling persuasively argues that they too are an epiphenomenon of our evolved fear and narrowness.)
Your most important challenge in developing a fact-based worldview is to realize that most of your firsthand experiences are from Level 4 [the top 10% of global income]; and that your secondhand experiences are filtered through the mass media, which loves nonrepresentative extraordinary events and shuns normality. When you live on Level 4, everyone on Levels 3, 2, and 1 can look equally poor, and the word poor can lose any specific meaning... Anyone who has looked down from the top of a tall building knows that it is difficult to assess from there the differences in height of the buildings nearer the ground. They all look kind of small... It is natural to miss the distinctions between the people with cars, the people with motorbikes and bicycles, the people with sandals, and the people with no shoes at all. 
On the shocking lack of empiricism even in the most important places like medicine and policy:
In the 1960s, the success of the recovery position inspired new public health advice, against most traditional practices, to put babies to sleep on their tummies... Even though the data showed that sudden infant deaths went up, not down, it wasn’t until 1985 that a group of pediatricians in Hong Kong actually suggested that the prone position might be the cause. Even then, doctors in Europe didn’t pay much attention. It took Swedish authorities another seven years to accept their mistake and reverse the policy...With my own hands, over a decade or so, I turned many babies from back to tummy to prevent suffocation and save lives. So did many other doctors and parents throughout Europe and the United States, until the advice was finally reversed, 18 months after the Hong Kong study was published. Thousands of babies died because of a sweeping generalization, including some during the months when the evidence was already available. 

Two hundred ninety-two brave young feminists had traveled to Stockholm from across the world to coordinate their struggle to improve women's access to education. But only 8 percent knew that 30-year-old women have spent on average only one year less in school than 30-year-old men.
Bad incentives and noble lies are another reason for the stubborn gloom of intellectuals:
There has been progress in human rights, animal protection, women's education, climate awareness, catastrophe relief, and many other areas where activists raise awareness by saying that things are getting worse.
Relentlessly sensible:
resist blaming any one individual or group of individuals for anything. Because the problem is that when we identify the bad guy, we are done thinking. And it’s almost always more complicated than that. It’s almost always about multiple interacting causes—a system. If you really want to change the world, you have to understand how it actually works and forget about punching anyone in the face. 
I've been studying Development for years and this still taught me plenty. It should shock you into awareness and hopefully more.
Paying too much attention to the individual visible victim rather than to the numbers can lead us to spend all our resources on a fraction of the problem, and therefore save many fewer lives. This principle applies anywhere we are prioritizing scarce resources. It is hard for people to talk about resources when it comes to saving lives, or prolonging or improving them Doing so is often taken for heartlessness. Yet so long as resources are not infinite—and they never are infinite—it is the most compassionate thing to do to use your brain and work out how to do the most good with what you have. 
One of the ""five books that represent my worldview"": moral passion, strict empiricism, psychological depth, existential hope. I picked this rather than Enlightenment Now or Rational Optimist or Doing Good Better or Our World In Data or Whole Earth Discipline (out of the contemporary literature of progress) because it also covers heuristics and biases - and so substitutes / complements Kahneman, Taleb, Hanson, and Yudkowsky, without (what people insist on seeing as) their self-superior wonkishness.
Thank you industrialization, thank you steel mill, thank you power station, thank you chemical-processing industry, for giving us the time to read books. 
In a sense he stays on the surface - this isn't the full radical evolutionary account of 
Elephant in the Brain
, instead just noting some bad epistemic practices and gesturing at evolutionary theory. But that said, there's a ""charity is not about helping"" bit:
If I check the World Wildlife Fund I can see how, despite declines in some local populations, the total wild populations of tigers, giant pandas, and black rhinos have all increased over the past years. It was worth paying for all those pandas stickers on the doors all around Stockholm. Yet only 6% of the Swedish public knows that their support has had any effect.
But despite all the suffering and error and backfiring efforts he describes, he is trying to make you realise how good things could be:
Could everyone have a fact-based worldview one day? Big change is always difficult to imagine. But it is definitely possible, and I think it will happen, for two simple reasons. First: a fact-based worldview is more useful for navigating life, just like an accurate GPS is more useful for finding your way in the city. Second, and probably more important: a fact-based worldview is more comfortable. It creates less stress and hopelessness than the dramatic worldview, simply because the dramatic one is so negative and terrifying. When we have a fact-based worldview, we can see that the world is not as bad as it seems— and we can see what we have to do to keep making it better. 
This, then, is the same message as Sagan, 25 years ago: the emotional gain of reason. ---Misc notes- Binary categories are often unhelpful because they obscure continuum. Rosling ranted against ""developed"" / ""developing"" for 20 years. The World Bank has caught on but the UN haven't.- He is a better messenger for the cognitive bias alarm, for activists anyway, because of his deep credibility: he mucked in to anti-poverty measures for decades. Some of his anecdotes are chilling.
I could tell you countless stories of the nonsense I saw in Cuba: the local moonshine, a toxic fluorescent concoction brewed inside TV tubes using water, sugar, and babies’ poopy diapers to provide the yeast required for fermentation; the hotels that hadn’t planned for any guests and so had no food, a problem we solved by driving to an old people’s home and eating their leftovers from the standard adult food rations; my Cuban colleague who knew his children would be expelled from university if he sent a Christmas card to his cousin in Miami; the fact that I had to explain my research methods to Fidel Castro personally to get approval. I will restrain myself and just tell you why I was there and what I discovered. 
- ""I do not believe that fake news is the major culprit for our distorted worldview: we haven’t only just started to get the world wrong, I think we have always gotten it wrong.""- ""In the car industry, cars are recalled when a mistake is discovered. You get a letter from the manufacturer saying, “We would like to recall your vehicle and replace the brakes.” When the facts about the world that you were taught in schools and universities become out of date, you should get a letter too: “Sorry, what we taught you is no longer true. Please return your brain for a free upgrade.” """

Hans starts off with a quiz about the general state of the world with a focus on health and wealth. I won’t give too much away but suffice to say you’ll probably get more than a few questions wrong. I did the quiz with my husband and scored much better than him on most questions because I’d seen the TED talk. So if you don’t have time to read the book, watch the TED talk. But read the book. Hans then talks about how everyone gets the questions wrong, even experts. Why? Because we have a skewed, outdated world view. He then seeks to address this, starting with redefining our definition of the world from 2 categories of developed/developing countries to 4 income levels. Next he talks about 10 tendencies, or instincts, that we employ when judging/thinking about the world, and creating and consuming news and media. He talks about how these instincts help us and are necessary in some situations but are detrimental to learning about the world. And then he gives us tips on how to bypass these and make correct judgements. All of this is peppered with the most fascinating and engaging stories of his life as a trainee doctor in Sweden, a doctor in Africa with Médicin Sans Frontières and a Professor of health. Hans is a great story teller and you get the impression his whole life’s work has led to this moment, the creation of this book, a heap of knowledge and wisdom built up over decades and condensed into an extremely digestible, and highly readable, vital lesson on how to view the world and make good decisions. If you’re not familiar with Hans’ work I fully recommend checking out some of his videos on TED, YouTube or his own site gapminder.org. The book is so much more enjoyable if you can hear his voice in your head. Sadly Hans died last year. This book is an honourable legacy. "

It reads quickly because of all the graphs, but it is packed with good data demonstrating that the world is better than we think it is. ""Bad, but better."" (My new favorite way to describe the world.) This is a wonderful manifesto for curiosity and letting facts drive our assessment of the world, rather than our limited and parochial world views.I kept thinking of Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow while I read. Kahneman tackles cognitive biases, Rosling tackles bad mental habits. Two books that should be read by everyone. (IMHO)I'll be honest -- I was a little turned off by ""him"" and his voice throughout. It felt a bit too cocky. However, I outright bawled at the postscript, so apparently his stories and anecdotes really generated a tenderness in me towards him. I felt this worth noting, because I don't tend to cry with these kinds of books over an affinity for the author himself/herself."

Should be given out as a general handbook for understanding the world. It does not just break the myths we have from decades ago, but also brings a framework how to be in touch with the reality going forward.My main takeway: Stop the developing/developed countries nonsense, there are regions on the whole spectrum of income, use dollarstreet.org when trying to get an idea how a family on part of the spectrum lives.Also: gapminder.org/tools is a great explorative UI for various world metrics. For example, life expectancy versus total health expenses shows really well the fuckupedness of US health system."

And not because I don't obviously know that we are a better world- a better society- now than say in the Middle Ages. Duh.It is because I'm against the notion that the fact that we've progressed could mean that we should stop seeking an even betterment of the world.I think the premise of this book is used as proof that we are good (not better) in the world and so no changes are necessary.Hans Rosling does present a hopeful panorama (and the book is pretty great) but I think he also presents a case for contentment.

107,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47154315-ian,4,"I would have liked to have spent a bit more time on this fairly new book, but alas the library had a huge waiting list of eager readers, so I could not renew it.There is good reason for the popularity and interest in Hans Rosling's book, which he worked on with his son and daughter in-law as a project that arouse from his lifetime of work as a public health official in Sweden.Rosling's thesis is that a huge majority of us cannot answer factual questions about the state of the modern world, which is apparently doing quite well in several important metrics. When it comes to questions such as, what percentage of women have 10 years or more of schooling, what is the average income in India, or what is the child-mortality of Bangladesh, most of us are sadly inaccurate and believe that the world still is what it was when we were taught in elementary school circa 1952. In fact, when he spends the early part of the book posing multiple-choice questions to the reader to show that the world is better off than ever in many measures, Rosling is rather fond of pointing out that even UN officials are typically less accurate in their responses to these questions than the random choices of a group of chimpanzees! Why?! How come our gut instincts are so outdated and false when it comes to the very world we live in?A big part of it is to do with just that, relying on our gut instincts. These tend to be set as the cognitive foundation by our elementary school projects from 30-50 years ago on the ""Third-World"", the news media's love of uniquely bad news (""if it doesn't bleed, it doesn't lead""), and our human tendencies of over-generalizing and being trapped in our own perspective.I think it important to point out that Rosling and his positive fact-finders are not simply some pollyannas saying that the world is just great and everything is getting better. He makes an effort to show that some things are indeed not getting better, such as the threat of climate change and the rise of political violence and terrorism in the last few decades. His purpose, however, is to rouse those of us living in the wealthier parts of the world to snap out of our old worldview and when presented with facts that seem ""unreal"" to actually look at the real data, to think critically about that data, and to ultimately realize that the world is changing in many ways for the better.Interestingly, I find that his advice also works well in this era of ""fake news"", where politicians can spout anything that seems to hold with an unsophisticated, uncritical worldview. Instead, if we again apply Rosling's tenets of looking up the true data, comparing numbers, thinking critically, and being aware of our own internal biases, we can tell which news is ""fake"" and which is not. A handy set of tools that truly can make the world better. Much better."
108,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/565673-nicholas-whyte,5,"https://nwhyte.livejournal.com/3142977.htmlI was a huge fan of the videos of Hans Rosling, who died in March 2017; and I write as one who generally hates vlogging (even though I have indulged in it myself occasionally). In Factfulness, the book he rushed to complete with his son and daughter-in-law when he learned he was dying, he calls on us all to engage critically with news stories and perceptions about the world - particularly about the state of humanity as a whole, most of all the developing economies. The concept of 'Factfulness', clearly intended as a close relative of mindfulness, is defined as :the stress-reducing habvit of only carrying opinions for which you have strong supporting facts.He repeatedly makes the effective point that most people - including the rich, privileged and well-informed - perform less well on a basic test about the state of the world than would a chimpanzee selecting answers at random.If I can boil it down, his first key message is that things are better than they were, but that should not deter us from making them better still. In particular, humanity is healthier, more prosperous, safer and more peaceful than it has ever been, and the greatest improvements have been made in countries which were desperately poor decades ago and have caught up since. BUT, his second key message is that news reports naturally concentrate on the drama of failure and crisis, so it's easy to get the impression that the world is going to hell; improvements are generally gradual (not always - there is the striking case of the recent decrease in birthrate in Iran, for instance, which of course received no international media coverage) while disasters, epidemics and wars fit the news cycle. HOWEVER, thirdly there is a real climate crisis, but we must be careful not to exaggerate it; the facts themselves are worrying enough, without resorting to worst-case scenarios or irrelevant issues (and he has plenty of cites for those).I find this all very attractive. If we are looking for a framework to push back against fake news, Rosling's fact-based approach is a very good place to start. but also, if we are trying to get to grips with crises (of which climate change is clearly the most drastic), it's very helpful to be able to point to the progress that has already been made as well as the further steps that are demanded. Certainly I find it easier to be motivated by the thought of building on previous good work than the notion of crusading against an inevitable fate. Strongly recommended."

If you are a manufacturer of menstrual pads, this is bad for business. So you ought to know about, and be so happy about, the drop in babies per woman across the world. You ought to know and be happy too about the growth in the number of educated women working away from home. Because these developments have created an exploding market for your products over the last few decades among billions of menstruating women now living on Levels 2 [income of $2-8/day] and 3 [income of $8-32/day].But, as I realized when I attended an internal meeting at one of the world's biggest manufacturers of sanitary wear, most Western manufacturers have completely missed this. Instead, when hunting for new customers they are often stuck dreaming up new needs among the 300 million menstruating women on Level 4 [income above $32/day]. ""What if we market an even thinner pad for bikinis? What about pads that are invisible, to wear Lycra? How about one pad for each kind of outfit, each situation, each sport? Special pads for mountain climbers!"" Ideally, all the pads are so small they need to be replaced several times a day. But like most rich consumer markets, the basic needs are already met, and producers fight in vain to create demand in ever-smaller segments.Meanwhile, on Levels 2 and 3, roughly 2 billion menstruating women have few alternatives to choose from. These women don't wear Lycra and won't spend money on ultrathin pads. They demand a low-cost pad that will be reliable throughout the day so they don't have to change it when they are out at work. And when they find a product they like, they will probably stick to that brand for their whole lives and recommend it to their daughters."""

Anyone that's taken a basic statistics course or a population dynamics course can approach this narrative with an appropriately critical eye. I think that these instincts/trends in human emotion and cognition are real, but his oversimplification of global issues is reductive and un-academic. I think that his arguments would have been much stronger if he had justified them with neurology literature which he is fully qualified to do as a clinician. I especially find fault with his depiction of emphasizing the urgency of climate change as “crying wolf.” I get what he’s saying. He’s trying to say that activists are trying to present the worst case scenario to generate action. Unfortunately, the information he uses contradicts that of leading climate scientists and is not indeed “fact” based. Likewise, his assertion that the link between climate change and migration is “very weak” is preposterous. This man is really comfortable spouting off a string of poorly formulated arguments. What he doesn’t discuss in much detail is that statistical analyses can be cherry picked to support arguments. Your argument can still be poor if you cite data. This is exactly what he has done, but with a grating hubris that his perspective is unquestionably empirical. He also takes a very long time to make each individual point due to his meandering style. I know this is part of the ""I'm writing like I talk"" style, but there's a reason why people like concision. I am honestly shocked that this book got such great reviews."
111,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,4,"Factfulness is basically an information literacy text that takes a hard look at how humans misjudge numbers. I enjoy statistics and have a pretty good grasp of PhD level stats, so I was more interested in the kinds of misjudgments most people make. On this front, the book did not disappoint. Each chapter focuses on a different type of thinking error and covers the territory pretty well. As humans, we like simple explanations that put the blame on a concrete person or entity, even in the absence of conclusive data.The authors’ main point is, assume nothing. Gather data. Summarize it intelligently, then draw appropriate conclusions. As a retired academic, I hope I have largely managed to do this. But I noticed as I was reading the book that we do tend to jump to conclusions based on personal experience and limited data. The Iowa caucuses had a massive technology failure last night and results are as yet unavailable. The internet is rife with assumptions that the DNC was involved in a shadowy plot to undermine one candidate or another. This is hogwash but otherwise intelligent friends clearly believe it. The media doesn’t help as it reports on the technology problem as if it were a major scandal. This situation demonstrates many of the authors’ principles. Use data to make decisions. Don’t be swayed by provocative media coverage. Don’t scapegoat. And so on. I’d recommend this book for anyone with little statistical training who is interested in thinking about how to frame issues based on data."
112,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85511402-taro,1,"Rosling thinks that the statistical data he is using in the book are facts. Many of the data come from the IMF and from the world bank. I don't really think those capitalistic institutes provide really objective data. As Winston Churchill said: The only statistics you can trust are those you falsified yourself.The author claims that in Fukushima nobody died form radioactivity. People were dying from fear of radioactivity. The same claim about the pesticide DDT. Even worse he claims the Vietnam War was not that severe, the country had some longer wars in the history. These statements make me feel sad.One big mistake in this book is the use of the average income to declare the financial state of a country. If there is one rich billionaire living in this country, the average would increase dramatically. Rosling should better use the median income. That means the income, where 50% of the people earn more, and 50% earn less. The median is typically smaller than the average. The so-called facts of this book would look very different then ...The most annoying thing in the book is the use of an exponential scale in the income graphics. If Rosling used a linear scale, then most of the people would live in Level 1, only a few in Levels 2, 3 and 4. Details on this issue can be found in the Web, search for ""Factfulness: Building Gapminder Income Mountains"" of the Stockholm University."
113,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"This amazing book reminds me of Steven Pinker's wonderful book ""Enlightenment Now"". Hans tries to explain why the world is a much better place to live now than decades in the past. Most of us have a distorted view of the world and it's mainly because of our instinctive biases. According to Hans Rosling, the world is not divided in two. There's no gap between the rich and the poor. So maybe you'd better stop using the words ""developing"" and ""developed"". Human beings have a strong dramatic instinct toward binary thinking. A basic urge to divide things into two distinct groups, with nothing but an empty gap in between. We love to dichotomize: good vs. bad. Heroes vs. villains. My country vs. the rest. We are naturally drawn to extreme examples because they are easier to recall. We tend to notice the bad more than the good. That's why the majority of people think that the world is getting worse. We also have a fear instinct. When we are afraid, we do not see clearly. Critical thinking is always difficult, but it's almost impossible when we are scared. There's no room for facts when our minds are occupied by fear. This fear can distort our worldview. Fear that once helped keep our ancestors alive, today helps keep journalist's employed. We need to remember that things can be bad and getting better. "

The world cannot be understood without numbers. And it cannot be understood with numbers alone.
Factfulness is a great book that explains how our instincts sometimes distort our understanding of our world and why it's crucial to learn established facts that are now reliably and readily available. Our instincts might help in certain situations, but in others, critical thinking beyond emotions is necessary. 
I'm a very serious ""possibilist."" That's something I made up. It means someone who neither hopes without reason, nor fears without reason, someone who constantly resists the overdramatic worldview.
In a world more connected than ever, it's harmful to view each other through old and murky glasses. We often continue to regard the world wrong either because of the exciting news and messages we receive or the way we perceive the stories. The world is continually changing, and it is both bad and getting better at the same time. So, it is essential to develop a factful view of the world instead of a dramatic one. And Hans Rosling makes an excellent case for it in this book."
115,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5687484-ana,5,"I am actively recommending this book to a large number of people - that's how much I loved reading it! One of the main points which resonates with me is that the world has been improving in a significant way in certain areas which tend to be overlooked. It explores approachable ways in which to deconstruct simplistic ideas like 'rich and poor countries', it encourages critical thinking with simple advice like looking at distributions or making relevant comparisons when trying to make sense of data about the world. And it's got charts with clear labelling and titles and drawings and chapter summaries with bullet points and citations and references and all the things I love - it really is a masterpiece of pedagogy without becoming condescending or repetitive. If you're already familiar with global statistics, policies and initiatives, I still think it's worth the read as an example of presenting to a broad audience. Have I recommended this book to you yet?"
116,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36137204-carl-rannaberg,4,"Definitely an important book which discusses how our worldview is distorted compared to the actual facts.This distortion happens through the combination of many factors: psychological biases, lack of systems thinking, sensationalistic and negative focus of media, inability to comprehend exponential growth, outdated school programs, half-life of facts etc.One of the key takeaways from this book is that the world is never black and white. It’s always some shade of gray and it’s not monotone. Also averages are mostly meaningless, distribution is what matters.If only the world and local leaders would read this book and apply the methods in their work, we would make a lot less dumb decisions as societies and habitants of the Earth."

I grew in South America; thus, I have a serious love-hate relationship with Médecins Sans Frontières, aka Doctors Without Borders, 2. I am a huge data nerd, and 3. I am smarter than a chimpanzee, at least according to Dr. Rosling's criteria. While this book does a very good job of emphasizing the importance of quality relevant data; it most definitely has its own agenda and tone that was hard to overlook. Nonetheless, I do agree that curiosity and humility are key ingredients to reduce the ignorance of the well-educated 4 level folks. "

122,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3898791-udit-nair,5,"This book presents a refreshing approach to tackle things which confront humanity. It becomes a very essential read because most of us think that the world is a pathetic and miserable place to be in. But contrary to the popular notion we are placed much better than what it used to be maybe even few decades ago. Why one should read this one-1. The book is written in very simple and accessible manner. Though the author cautions everybody from seeing things in simplistic way but he does a great job in conveying his message through simplicity.2. The book challenges our misconceptions and hence it can become a source of introspection and hence progress.3. The book is indeed a great testimony of human progress achieved over years. It places great faith in humanity's ability to overcome problems. Now this faith is not based on wishful thinking but are backed by facts and figures. 4. Which leads me to next good thing about the book. That is the use of facts, statistics and all the bubbles. It is hard to deny the claim when stats are staring right into your ignorance. 5. The author has carefully identified the reasons for our misconception or ignorance. So hence he goes out to list the problems and he calls it the Instincts. Now this follows with solutions to tackle it. For eg he talks about the blame instinct. With corona crisis it becomes more evident. How countries and groups are hell bent on finding a scapegoat to pin the cause on it. Now the way to tackle this blame instinct is to look for causes and not villains. Its important to find the multiple causes which gave rise to pandemic rather than one nation, one group, one community, one action or one person. Same applies for if something good happens. Look for systems and not heroes.The things which I dont agree with the author-1. The very portrayal of grief and suffering in terms of numbers. I do agree that the world is a better place. But it doesn't help a person living in war torn places such as Syria or Yemen or Sudan to know that statistically conflict has decreased. For the individual or groups of people the reality of daily life is unimaginable. 2. The author contends that activists should not create an atmosphere of fear when confronting global challenges such as climate change. I completely disagree with this. Its because even after creating the fear there are leaders across the globe who even deny the threat and the numbers are large. Bureaucracy always reacts to a problem according to the intensity or the fear in the masses. And hence it becomes necessary that people are made aware about the existential threats specially when it comes to issues like climate change. 3. I am also of the opinion that certain amount of negativity is necessary to propel the systems and make it work. Because as we see around humans generally dont act until the threat is imminent or it affects them directly.Because otherwise its business as usual and this type of attitude can be disastrous if extended to ruling and political class."
123,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,5,"Factfulness is yet another great book that everyone who lives in this world should read. And this is coming from a person who has been generally pessimistic about the world. It may appear dichotomous for me to 5-star this book which was supposed to be telling us that the world is better than we think it is, after doing the same to one which told about how humanity made a mess of everything in this world. In fact, it took me a while to pick up this well-lauded title because I was worried that it may paint an overly rosy picture about the world. However, my concern was unfounded. Factfulness did tell me that the world is not bad as I thought it to be, but it also emphasized that while some things are getting better, there remained big issues and risks out there that need to be addressed. And it is by getting facts right and in context that resources and efforts can be directed to fixing the root causes and real problems. Supplementing both Factfulness by Hans Rosling and Humans by Tom Phillips made one of the best and most insightful non-fiction reads I've had of late. Hans Rosling called himself a 'possibilist' - not a pessimist, nor an optimist. Throughout the book, he provided lots of personal experiences and anecdotes. Some of these I could tell were painful for him to recall and share, but it lent a whole lot of credibility to his writing.  There's a lot more to say as I reflect upon what I've gotten out of this book, but I believe that it's best for one to just read it. It is so well-written, well-presented and engaging that it makes for an easy and fairly quick read. This quote from the book pretty much summarised how Factfulness could make us and the world better. 
""I don't tell you not to worry. I tell you to worry about the right things. I don't tell you look away from the news or to ignore the activists' calls to action. I tell you to ignore the noise, but keep an eye on the big global risks. I don't tell you not to be afraid. I tell you to stay coolheaded and support the global collaborations we need to reduce these risks. Control your urgency instinct. Control all your dramatic instincts. Be less stressed by the imaginary problems of an overdramatic world, and more alert to the real problems and how to solve them.

1. In all low-income countries across the world today, how many girls finish primary school?2. Where does the majority of the world population live?3. In the last 20 years, the proportion of the world population living in extreme poverty has…4. What is the life expectancy of the world today?5. There are 2 billion children in the world today, aged 0 to 15 years old. How many children will there be in the year 2100, according to the United Nations?6. The UN predicts that by 2100 the world population will have increased by another 4 billion people. What is the main reason?7. How did the number of deaths per year from natural disasters change over the last hundred years?...
Only 10% of people scored better than random guessing on these questions, the most important trends of the last hundred years. How can it be that we are both 1) a rabidly overconfident species and 2) an extremely pessimistic species that generally gets these simple, objective questions very wrong (doing far worse than random)? Sure, we could just be dogmatic nihilists or idiots, but that doesn't fit that well. 
A stunning 15% of humans managed to pick the wrong answer on all twelve questions. That’s almost impossible for a monkey to achieve. It requires systematic misconceptions. The problem here is not the lack of correct knowledge. The problem is the presence of wrong “knowledge”. To score this bad requires a false perception of the world, that make you pick the wrong answer systematically.
Rosling explains it in terms of cognitive biases: we suffer from a 
dramatic
 worldview, binarised, conflict-obsessed, and blamey. People seem to find Development - the completely unprecedented explosion of survival, freedom, and dignity for the larger part of the entire world! - boring. (You could blame the media, but Rosling persuasively argues that they too are an epiphenomenon of our evolved fear and narrowness.)
Your most important challenge in developing a fact-based worldview is to realize that most of your firsthand experiences are from Level 4 [the top 10% of global income]; and that your secondhand experiences are filtered through the mass media, which loves nonrepresentative extraordinary events and shuns normality. When you live on Level 4, everyone on Levels 3, 2, and 1 can look equally poor, and the word poor can lose any specific meaning... Anyone who has looked down from the top of a tall building knows that it is difficult to assess from there the differences in height of the buildings nearer the ground. They all look kind of small... It is natural to miss the distinctions between the people with cars, the people with motorbikes and bicycles, the people with sandals, and the people with no shoes at all. 
On the shocking lack of empiricism even in the most important places like medicine and policy:
In the 1960s, the success of the recovery position inspired new public health advice, against most traditional practices, to put babies to sleep on their tummies... Even though the data showed that sudden infant deaths went up, not down, it wasn’t until 1985 that a group of pediatricians in Hong Kong actually suggested that the prone position might be the cause. Even then, doctors in Europe didn’t pay much attention. It took Swedish authorities another seven years to accept their mistake and reverse the policy...With my own hands, over a decade or so, I turned many babies from back to tummy to prevent suffocation and save lives. So did many other doctors and parents throughout Europe and the United States, until the advice was finally reversed, 18 months after the Hong Kong study was published. Thousands of babies died because of a sweeping generalization, including some during the months when the evidence was already available. 

Two hundred ninety-two brave young feminists had traveled to Stockholm from across the world to coordinate their struggle to improve women's access to education. But only 8 percent knew that 30-year-old women have spent on average only one year less in school than 30-year-old men.
Bad incentives and noble lies are another reason for the stubborn gloom of intellectuals:
There has been progress in human rights, animal protection, women's education, climate awareness, catastrophe relief, and many other areas where activists raise awareness by saying that things are getting worse.
Relentlessly sensible:
resist blaming any one individual or group of individuals for anything. Because the problem is that when we identify the bad guy, we are done thinking. And it’s almost always more complicated than that. It’s almost always about multiple interacting causes—a system. If you really want to change the world, you have to understand how it actually works and forget about punching anyone in the face. 
I've been studying Development for years and this still taught me plenty. It should shock you into awareness and hopefully more.
Paying too much attention to the individual visible victim rather than to the numbers can lead us to spend all our resources on a fraction of the problem, and therefore save many fewer lives. This principle applies anywhere we are prioritizing scarce resources. It is hard for people to talk about resources when it comes to saving lives, or prolonging or improving them Doing so is often taken for heartlessness. Yet so long as resources are not infinite—and they never are infinite—it is the most compassionate thing to do to use your brain and work out how to do the most good with what you have. 
One of the ""five books that represent my worldview"": moral passion, strict empiricism, psychological depth, existential hope. I picked this rather than Enlightenment Now or Rational Optimist or Doing Good Better or Our World In Data or Whole Earth Discipline (out of the contemporary literature of progress) because it also covers heuristics and biases - and so substitutes / complements Kahneman, Taleb, Hanson, and Yudkowsky, without (what people insist on seeing as) their self-superior wonkishness.

In a sense he stays on the surface - this isn't the full radical evolutionary account of 
Elephant in the Brain
, instead just noting some bad epistemic practices and gesturing at evolutionary theory. But that said, there's a ""charity is not about helping"" bit:
If I check the World Wildlife Fund I can see how, despite declines in some local populations, the total wild populations of tigers, giant pandas, and black rhinos have all increased over the past years. It was worth paying for all those pandas stickers on the doors all around Stockholm. Yet only 6% of the Swedish public knows that their support has had any effect.
But despite all the suffering and error and backfiring efforts he describes, he is trying to make you realise how good things could be:
Could everyone have a fact-based worldview one day? Big change is always difficult to imagine. But it is definitely possible, and I think it will happen, for two simple reasons. First: a fact-based worldview is more useful for navigating life, just like an accurate GPS is more useful for finding your way in the city. Second, and probably more important: a fact-based worldview is more comfortable. It creates less stress and hopelessness than the dramatic worldview, simply because the dramatic one is so negative and terrifying. When we have a fact-based worldview, we can see that the world is not as bad as it seems— and we can see what we have to do to keep making it better. 
This, then, is the same message as Sagan, 25 years ago: the emotional gain of reason. ---Misc notes- Binary categories are often unhelpful because they obscure continuum. Rosling ranted against ""developed"" / ""developing"" for 20 years. The World Bank has caught on but the UN haven't.- He is a better messenger for the cognitive bias alarm, for activists anyway, because of his deep credibility: he mucked in to anti-poverty measures for decades. Some of his anecdotes are chilling.
I could tell you countless stories of the nonsense I saw in Cuba: the local moonshine, a toxic fluorescent concoction brewed inside TV tubes using water, sugar, and babies’ poopy diapers to provide the yeast required for fermentation; the hotels that hadn’t planned for any guests and so had no food, a problem we solved by driving to an old people’s home and eating their leftovers from the standard adult food rations; my Cuban colleague who knew his children would be expelled from university if he sent a Christmas card to his cousin in Miami; the fact that I had to explain my research methods to Fidel Castro personally to get approval. I will restrain myself and just tell you why I was there and what I discovered.

You get a letter from the manufacturer saying, “We would like to recall your vehicle and replace the brakes.” When the facts about the world that you were taught in schools and universities become out of date, you should get a letter too: “Sorry, what we taught you is no longer true. Please return your brain for a free upgrade.” """

Hans starts off with a quiz about the general state of the world with a focus on health and wealth. I won’t give too much away but suffice to say you’ll probably get more than a few questions wrong. I did the quiz with my husband and scored much better than him on most questions because I’d seen the TED talk. So if you don’t have time to read the book, watch the TED talk. But read the book. Hans then talks about how everyone gets the questions wrong, even experts. Why? Because we have a skewed, outdated world view. He then seeks to address this, starting with redefining our definition of the world from 2 categories of developed/developing countries to 4 income levels. Next he talks about 10 tendencies, or instincts, that we employ when judging/thinking about the world, and creating and consuming news and media. He talks about how these instincts help us and are necessary in some situations but are detrimental to learning about the world. And then he gives us tips on how to bypass these and make correct judgements. All of this is peppered with the most fascinating and engaging stories of his life as a trainee doctor in Sweden, a doctor in Africa with Médicin Sans Frontières and a Professor of health. Hans is a great story teller and you get the impression his whole life’s work has led to this moment, the creation of this book, a heap of knowledge and wisdom built up over decades and condensed into an extremely digestible, and highly readable, vital lesson on how to view the world and make good decisions. If you’re not familiar with Hans’ work I fully recommend checking out some of his videos on TED, YouTube or his own site gapminder.org. The book is so much more enjoyable if you can hear his voice in your head. Sadly Hans died last year. This book is an honourable legacy. "

This is a wonderful manifesto for curiosity and letting facts drive our assessment of the world, rather than our limited and parochial world views.I kept thinking of Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow while I read. Kahneman tackles cognitive biases, Rosling tackles bad mental habits. Two books that should be read by everyone. (IMHO)I'll be honest -- I was a little turned off by ""him"" and his voice throughout. It felt a bit too cocky. However, I outright bawled at the postscript, so apparently his stories and anecdotes really generated a tenderness in me towards him. I felt this worth noting, because I don't tend to cry with these kinds of books over an affinity for the author himself/herself."

137,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47154315-ian,4,"I would have liked to have spent a bit more time on this fairly new book, but alas the library had a huge waiting list of eager readers, so I could not renew it.There is good reason for the popularity and interest in Hans Rosling's book, which he worked on with his son and daughter in-law as a project that arouse from his lifetime of work as a public health official in Sweden.Rosling's thesis is that a huge majority of us cannot answer factual questions about the state of the modern world, which is apparently doing quite well in several important metrics. When it comes to questions such as, what percentage of women have 10 years or more of schooling, what is the average income in India, or what is the child-mortality of Bangladesh, most of us are sadly inaccurate and believe that the world still is what it was when we were taught in elementary school circa 1952. In fact, when he spends the early part of the book posing multiple-choice questions to the reader to show that the world is better off than ever in many measures, Rosling is rather fond of pointing out that even UN officials are typically less accurate in their responses to these questions than the random choices of a group of chimpanzees! Why?! How come our gut instincts are so outdated and false when it comes to the very world we live in?A big part of it is to do with just that, relying on our gut instincts. These tend to be set as the cognitive foundation by our elementary school projects from 30-50 years ago on the ""Third-World"", the news media's love of uniquely bad news (""if it doesn't bleed, it doesn't lead""), and our human tendencies of over-generalizing and being trapped in our own perspective.I think it important to point out that Rosling and his positive fact-finders are not simply some pollyannas saying that the world is just great and everything is getting better. He makes an effort to show that some things are indeed not getting better, such as the threat of climate change and the rise of political violence and terrorism in the last few decades. His purpose, however, is to rouse those of us living in the wealthier parts of the world to snap out of our old worldview and when presented with facts that seem ""unreal"" to actually look at the real data, to think critically about that data, and to ultimately realize that the world is changing in many ways for the better.Interestingly, I find that his advice also works well in this era of ""fake news"", where politicians can spout anything that seems to hold with an unsophisticated, uncritical worldview. Instead, if we again apply Rosling's tenets of looking up the true data, comparing numbers, thinking critically, and being aware of our own internal biases, we can tell which news is ""fake"" and which is not. A handy set of tools that truly can make the world better. Much better."
138,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/565673-nicholas-whyte,5,"https://nwhyte.livejournal.com/3142977.htmlI was a huge fan of the videos of Hans Rosling, who died in March 2017; and I write as one who generally hates vlogging (even though I have indulged in it myself occasionally). In Factfulness, the book he rushed to complete with his son and daughter-in-law when he learned he was dying, he calls on us all to engage critically with news stories and perceptions about the world - particularly about the state of humanity as a whole, most of all the developing economies. The concept of 'Factfulness', clearly intended as a close relative of mindfulness, is defined as :the stress-reducing habvit of only carrying opinions for which you have strong supporting facts.He repeatedly makes the effective point that most people - including the rich, privileged and well-informed - perform less well on a basic test about the state of the world than would a chimpanzee selecting answers at random.If I can boil it down, his first key message is that things are better than they were, but that should not deter us from making them better still. In particular, humanity is healthier, more prosperous, safer and more peaceful than it has ever been, and the greatest improvements have been made in countries which were desperately poor decades ago and have caught up since. BUT, his second key message is that news reports naturally concentrate on the drama of failure and crisis, so it's easy to get the impression that the world is going to hell; improvements are generally gradual (not always - there is the striking case of the recent decrease in birthrate in Iran, for instance, which of course received no international media coverage) while disasters, epidemics and wars fit the news cycle. HOWEVER, thirdly there is a real climate crisis, but we must be careful not to exaggerate it; the facts themselves are worrying enough, without resorting to worst-case scenarios or irrelevant issues (and he has plenty of cites for those).I find this all very attractive. If we are looking for a framework to push back against fake news, Rosling's fact-based approach is a very good place to start. but also, if we are trying to get to grips with crises (of which climate change is clearly the most drastic), it's very helpful to be able to point to the progress that has already been made as well as the further steps that are demanded. Certainly I find it easier to be motivated by the thought of building on previous good work than the notion of crusading against an inevitable fate. Strongly recommended."

If you are a manufacturer of menstrual pads, this is bad for business. So you ought to know about, and be so happy about, the drop in babies per woman across the world. You ought to know and be happy too about the growth in the number of educated women working away from home. Because these developments have created an exploding market for your products over the last few decades among billions of menstruating women now living on Levels 2 [income of $2-8/day] and 3 [income of $8-32/day].But, as I realized when I attended an internal meeting at one of the world's biggest manufacturers of sanitary wear, most Western manufacturers have completely missed this. Instead, when hunting for new customers they are often stuck dreaming up new needs among the 300 million menstruating women on Level 4 [income above $32/day]. ""What if we market an even thinner pad for bikinis? What about pads that are invisible, to wear Lycra? How about one pad for each kind of outfit, each situation, each sport? Special pads for mountain climbers!"" Ideally, all the pads are so small they need to be replaced several times a day. But like most rich consumer markets, the basic needs are already met, and producers fight in vain to create demand in ever-smaller segments.Meanwhile, on Levels 2 and 3, roughly 2 billion menstruating women have few alternatives to choose from. These women don't wear Lycra and won't spend money on ultrathin pads. They demand a low-cost pad that will be reliable throughout the day so they don't have to change it when they are out at work. And when they find a product they like, they will probably stick to that brand for their whole lives and recommend it to their daughters."""
140,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63307890-amy,1,"My favorite thing about this book is that this guy is a quirky sword swallower. Unfortunately, it truly ends there. Anyone that's taken a basic statistics course or a population dynamics course can approach this narrative with an appropriately critical eye. I think that these instincts/trends in human emotion and cognition are real, but his oversimplification of global issues is reductive and un-academic. I think that his arguments would have been much stronger if he had justified them with neurology literature which he is fully qualified to do as a clinician. I especially find fault with his depiction of emphasizing the urgency of climate change as “crying wolf.” I get what he’s saying. He’s trying to say that activists are trying to present the worst case scenario to generate action. Unfortunately, the information he uses contradicts that of leading climate scientists and is not indeed “fact” based. Likewise, his assertion that the link between climate change and migration is “very weak” is preposterous. This man is really comfortable spouting off a string of poorly formulated arguments. What he doesn’t discuss in much detail is that statistical analyses can be cherry picked to support arguments. Your argument can still be poor if you cite data. This is exactly what he has done, but with a grating hubris that his perspective is unquestionably empirical. He also takes a very long time to make each individual point due to his meandering style. I know this is part of the ""I'm writing like I talk"" style, but there's a reason why people like concision. I am honestly shocked that this book got such great reviews."
141,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,4,"Factfulness is basically an information literacy text that takes a hard look at how humans misjudge numbers. I enjoy statistics and have a pretty good grasp of PhD level stats, so I was more interested in the kinds of misjudgments most people make. On this front, the book did not disappoint. Each chapter focuses on a different type of thinking error and covers the territory pretty well. As humans, we like simple explanations that put the blame on a concrete person or entity, even in the absence of conclusive data.The authors’ main point is, assume nothing. Gather data. Summarize it intelligently, then draw appropriate conclusions. As a retired academic, I hope I have largely managed to do this. But I noticed as I was reading the book that we do tend to jump to conclusions based on personal experience and limited data. The Iowa caucuses had a massive technology failure last night and results are as yet unavailable. The internet is rife with assumptions that the DNC was involved in a shadowy plot to undermine one candidate or another. This is hogwash but otherwise intelligent friends clearly believe it. The media doesn’t help as it reports on the technology problem as if it were a major scandal. This situation demonstrates many of the authors’ principles. Use data to make decisions. Don’t be swayed by provocative media coverage. Don’t scapegoat. And so on. I’d recommend this book for anyone with little statistical training who is interested in thinking about how to frame issues based on data."
142,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85511402-taro,1,"Rosling thinks that the statistical data he is using in the book are facts. Many of the data come from the IMF and from the world bank. I don't really think those capitalistic institutes provide really objective data. As Winston Churchill said: The only statistics you can trust are those you falsified yourself.The author claims that in Fukushima nobody died form radioactivity. People were dying from fear of radioactivity. The same claim about the pesticide DDT. Even worse he claims the Vietnam War was not that severe, the country had some longer wars in the history. These statements make me feel sad.One big mistake in this book is the use of the average income to declare the financial state of a country. If there is one rich billionaire living in this country, the average would increase dramatically. Rosling should better use the median income. That means the income, where 50% of the people earn more, and 50% earn less. The median is typically smaller than the average. The so-called facts of this book would look very different then ...The most annoying thing in the book is the use of an exponential scale in the income graphics. If Rosling used a linear scale, then most of the people would live in Level 1, only a few in Levels 2, 3 and 4. Details on this issue can be found in the Web, search for ""Factfulness: Building Gapminder Income Mountains"" of the Stockholm University."
143,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"This amazing book reminds me of Steven Pinker's wonderful book ""Enlightenment Now"". Hans tries to explain why the world is a much better place to live now than decades in the past. Most of us have a distorted view of the world and it's mainly because of our instinctive biases. According to Hans Rosling, the world is not divided in two. There's no gap between the rich and the poor. So maybe you'd better stop using the words ""developing"" and ""developed"". Human beings have a strong dramatic instinct toward binary thinking. A basic urge to divide things into two distinct groups, with nothing but an empty gap in between. We love to dichotomize: good vs. bad. Heroes vs. villains. My country vs. the rest. We are naturally drawn to extreme examples because they are easier to recall. We tend to notice the bad more than the good. That's why the majority of people think that the world is getting worse. We also have a fear instinct. When we are afraid, we do not see clearly. Critical thinking is always difficult, but it's almost impossible when we are scared. There's no room for facts when our minds are occupied by fear. This fear can distort our worldview. Fear that once helped keep our ancestors alive, today helps keep journalist's employed. We need to remember that things can be bad and getting better. "

The world cannot be understood without numbers. And it cannot be understood with numbers alone.
Factfulness is a great book that explains how our instincts sometimes distort our understanding of our world and why it's crucial to learn established facts that are now reliably and readily available. Our instincts might help in certain situations, but in others, critical thinking beyond emotions is necessary. 
I'm a very serious ""possibilist."" That's something I made up. It means someone who neither hopes without reason, nor fears without reason, someone who constantly resists the overdramatic worldview.
In a world more connected than ever, it's harmful to view each other through old and murky glasses. We often continue to regard the world wrong either because of the exciting news and messages we receive or the way we perceive the stories. The world is continually changing, and it is both bad and getting better at the same time. So, it is essential to develop a factful view of the world instead of a dramatic one. And Hans Rosling makes an excellent case for it in this book."

One of the main points which resonates with me is that the world has been improving in a significant way in certain areas which tend to be overlooked. It explores approachable ways in which to deconstruct simplistic ideas like 'rich and poor countries', it encourages critical thinking with simple advice like looking at distributions or making relevant comparisons when trying to make sense of data about the world. And it's got charts with clear labelling and titles and drawings and chapter summaries with bullet points and citations and references and all the things I love - it really is a masterpiece of pedagogy without becoming condescending or repetitive. If you're already familiar with global statistics, policies and initiatives, I still think it's worth the read as an example of presenting to a broad audience. Have I recommended this book to you yet?"

It’s always some shade of gray and it’s not monotone. Also averages are mostly meaningless, distribution is what matters.If only the world and local leaders would read this book and apply the methods in their work, we would make a lot less dumb decisions as societies and habitants of the Earth."

152,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3898791-udit-nair,5,"This book presents a refreshing approach to tackle things which confront humanity. It becomes a very essential read because most of us think that the world is a pathetic and miserable place to be in. But contrary to the popular notion we are placed much better than what it used to be maybe even few decades ago. Why one should read this one-1. The book is written in very simple and accessible manner. Though the author cautions everybody from seeing things in simplistic way but he does a great job in conveying his message through simplicity.2. The book challenges our misconceptions and hence it can become a source of introspection and hence progress.3. The book is indeed a great testimony of human progress achieved over years. It places great faith in humanity's ability to overcome problems. Now this faith is not based on wishful thinking but are backed by facts and figures. 4. Which leads me to next good thing about the book. That is the use of facts, statistics and all the bubbles. It is hard to deny the claim when stats are staring right into your ignorance. 5. The author has carefully identified the reasons for our misconception or ignorance. So hence he goes out to list the problems and he calls it the Instincts. Now this follows with solutions to tackle it. For eg he talks about the blame instinct. With corona crisis it becomes more evident. How countries and groups are hell bent on finding a scapegoat to pin the cause on it. Now the way to tackle this blame instinct is to look for causes and not villains. Its important to find the multiple causes which gave rise to pandemic rather than one nation, one group, one community, one action or one person. Same applies for if something good happens. Look for systems and not heroes.The things which I dont agree with the author-1. The very portrayal of grief and suffering in terms of numbers. I do agree that the world is a better place. But it doesn't help a person living in war torn places such as Syria or Yemen or Sudan to know that statistically conflict has decreased. For the individual or groups of people the reality of daily life is unimaginable. 2. The author contends that activists should not create an atmosphere of fear when confronting global challenges such as climate change. I completely disagree with this. Its because even after creating the fear there are leaders across the globe who even deny the threat and the numbers are large. Bureaucracy always reacts to a problem according to the intensity or the fear in the masses. And hence it becomes necessary that people are made aware about the existential threats specially when it comes to issues like climate change. 3. I am also of the opinion that certain amount of negativity is necessary to propel the systems and make it work. Because as we see around humans generally dont act until the threat is imminent or it affects them directly.Because otherwise its business as usual and this type of attitude can be disastrous if extended to ruling and political class."
153,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,5,"Factfulness is yet another great book that everyone who lives in this world should read. And this is coming from a person who has been generally pessimistic about the world. It may appear dichotomous for me to 5-star this book which was supposed to be telling us that the world is better than we think it is, after doing the same to one which told about how humanity made a mess of everything in this world. In fact, it took me a while to pick up this well-lauded title because I was worried that it may paint an overly rosy picture about the world. However, my concern was unfounded. Factfulness did tell me that the world is not bad as I thought it to be, but it also emphasized that while some things are getting better, there remained big issues and risks out there that need to be addressed. And it is by getting facts right and in context that resources and efforts can be directed to fixing the root causes and real problems. Supplementing both Factfulness by Hans Rosling and Humans by Tom Phillips made one of the best and most insightful non-fiction reads I've had of late. Hans Rosling called himself a 'possibilist' - not a pessimist, nor an optimist. Throughout the book, he provided lots of personal experiences and anecdotes. Some of these I could tell were painful for him to recall and share, but it lent a whole lot of credibility to his writing.  There's a lot more to say as I reflect upon what I've gotten out of this book, but I believe that it's best for one to just read it. It is so well-written, well-presented and engaging that it makes for an easy and fairly quick read. This quote from the book pretty much summarised how Factfulness could make us and the world better. 
""I don't tell you not to worry. I tell you to worry about the right things. I don't tell you look away from the news or to ignore the activists' calls to action. I tell you to ignore the noise, but keep an eye on the big global risks. I don't tell you not to be afraid. I tell you to stay coolheaded and support the global collaborations we need to reduce these risks. Control your urgency instinct. Control all your dramatic instincts. Be less stressed by the imaginary problems of an overdramatic world, and more alert to the real problems and how to solve them.

How did the number of deaths per year from natural disasters change over the last hundred years?...
Only 10% of people scored better than random guessing on these questions, the most important trends of the last hundred years. How can it be that we are both 1) a rabidly overconfident species and 2) an extremely pessimistic species that generally gets these simple, objective questions very wrong (doing far worse than random)? Sure, we could just be dogmatic nihilists or idiots, but that doesn't fit that well. 
A stunning 15% of humans managed to pick the wrong answer on all twelve questions. That’s almost impossible for a monkey to achieve. It requires systematic misconceptions. The problem here is not the lack of correct knowledge. The problem is the presence of wrong “knowledge”. To score this bad requires a false perception of the world, that make you pick the wrong answer systematically.
Rosling explains it in terms of cognitive biases: we suffer from a 
dramatic
 worldview, binarised, conflict-obsessed, and blamey. People seem to find Development - the completely unprecedented explosion of survival, freedom, and dignity for the larger part of the entire world! - boring. (You could blame the media, but Rosling persuasively argues that they too are an epiphenomenon of our evolved fear and narrowness.)
Your most important challenge in developing a fact-based worldview is to realize that most of your firsthand experiences are from Level 4 [the top 10% of global income]; and that your secondhand experiences are filtered through the mass media, which loves nonrepresentative extraordinary events and shuns normality. When you live on Level 4, everyone on Levels 3, 2, and 1 can look equally poor, and the word poor can lose any specific meaning... Anyone who has looked down from the top of a tall building knows that it is difficult to assess from there the differences in height of the buildings nearer the ground. They all look kind of small... It is natural to miss the distinctions between the people with cars, the people with motorbikes and bicycles, the people with sandals, and the people with no shoes at all. 
On the shocking lack of empiricism even in the most important places like medicine and policy:
In the 1960s, the success of the recovery position inspired new public health advice, against most traditional practices, to put babies to sleep on their tummies... Even though the data showed that sudden infant deaths went up, not down, it wasn’t until 1985 that a group of pediatricians in Hong Kong actually suggested that the prone position might be the cause. Even then, doctors in Europe didn’t pay much attention. It took Swedish authorities another seven years to accept their mistake and reverse the policy...With my own hands, over a decade or so, I turned many babies from back to tummy to prevent suffocation and save lives. So did many other doctors and parents throughout Europe and the United States, until the advice was finally reversed, 18 months after the Hong Kong study was published. Thousands of babies died because of a sweeping generalization, including some during the months when the evidence was already available. 

Two hundred ninety-two brave young feminists had traveled to Stockholm from across the world to coordinate their struggle to improve women's access to education. But only 8 percent knew that 30-year-old women have spent on average only one year less in school than 30-year-old men.
Bad incentives and noble lies are another reason for the stubborn gloom of intellectuals:
There has been progress in human rights, animal protection, women's education, climate awareness, catastrophe relief, and many other areas where activists raise awareness by saying that things are getting worse.
Relentlessly sensible:
resist blaming any one individual or group of individuals for anything. Because the problem is that when we identify the bad guy, we are done thinking. And it’s almost always more complicated than that. It’s almost always about multiple interacting causes—a system. If you really want to change the world, you have to understand how it actually works and forget about punching anyone in the face. 
I've been studying Development for years and this still taught me plenty. It should shock you into awareness and hopefully more.
Paying too much attention to the individual visible victim rather than to the numbers can lead us to spend all our resources on a fraction of the problem, and therefore save many fewer lives. This principle applies anywhere we are prioritizing scarce resources. It is hard for people to talk about resources when it comes to saving lives, or prolonging or improving them Doing so is often taken for heartlessness. Yet so long as resources are not infinite—and they never are infinite—it is the most compassionate thing to do to use your brain and work out how to do the most good with what you have.

I picked this rather than Enlightenment Now or Rational Optimist or Doing Good Better or Our World In Data or Whole Earth Discipline (out of the contemporary literature of progress) because it also covers heuristics and biases - and so substitutes / complements Kahneman, Taleb, Hanson, and Yudkowsky, without (what people insist on seeing as) their self-superior wonkishness.

If I check the World Wildlife Fund I can see how, despite declines in some local populations, the total wild populations of tigers, giant pandas, and black rhinos have all increased over the past years. It was worth paying for all those pandas stickers on the doors all around Stockholm. Yet only 6% of the Swedish public knows that their support has had any effect.
But despite all the suffering and error and backfiring efforts he describes, he is trying to make you realise how good things could be:
Could everyone have a fact-based worldview one day? Big change is always difficult to imagine. But it is definitely possible, and I think it will happen, for two simple reasons. First: a fact-based worldview is more useful for navigating life, just like an accurate GPS is more useful for finding your way in the city. Second, and probably more important: a fact-based worldview is more comfortable. It creates less stress and hopelessness than the dramatic worldview, simply because the dramatic one is so negative and terrifying. When we have a fact-based worldview, we can see that the world is not as bad as it seems— and we can see what we have to do to keep making it better. 
This, then, is the same message as Sagan, 25 years ago: the emotional gain of reason. ---Misc notes- Binary categories are often unhelpful because they obscure continuum. Rosling ranted against ""developed"" / ""developing"" for 20 years. The World Bank has caught on but the UN haven't.- He is a better messenger for the cognitive bias alarm, for activists anyway, because of his deep credibility: he mucked in to anti-poverty measures for decades. Some of his anecdotes are chilling.
I could tell you countless stories of the nonsense I saw in Cuba: the local moonshine, a toxic fluorescent concoction brewed inside TV tubes using water, sugar, and babies’ poopy diapers to provide the yeast required for fermentation; the hotels that hadn’t planned for any guests and so had no food, a problem we solved by driving to an old people’s home and eating their leftovers from the standard adult food rations; my Cuban colleague who knew his children would be expelled from university if he sent a Christmas card to his cousin in Miami; the fact that I had to explain my research methods to Fidel Castro personally to get approval. I will restrain myself and just tell you why I was there and what I discovered. 
- ""I do not believe that fake news is the major culprit for our distorted worldview: we haven’t only just started to get the world wrong, I think we have always gotten it wrong.""- ""In the car industry, cars are recalled when a mistake is discovered. You get a letter from the manufacturer saying, “We would like to recall your vehicle and replace the brakes.” When the facts about the world that you were taught in schools and universities become out of date, you should get a letter too: “Sorry, what we taught you is no longer true. Please return your brain for a free upgrade.” """

Hans starts off with a quiz about the general state of the world with a focus on health and wealth. I won’t give too much away but suffice to say you’ll probably get more than a few questions wrong. I did the quiz with my husband and scored much better than him on most questions because I’d seen the TED talk. So if you don’t have time to read the book, watch the TED talk. But read the book. Hans then talks about how everyone gets the questions wrong, even experts. Why? Because we have a skewed, outdated world view. He then seeks to address this, starting with redefining our definition of the world from 2 categories of developed/developing countries to 4 income levels. Next he talks about 10 tendencies, or instincts, that we employ when judging/thinking about the world, and creating and consuming news and media. He talks about how these instincts help us and are necessary in some situations but are detrimental to learning about the world. And then he gives us tips on how to bypass these and make correct judgements. All of this is peppered with the most fascinating and engaging stories of his life as a trainee doctor in Sweden, a doctor in Africa with Médicin Sans Frontières and a Professor of health. Hans is a great story teller and you get the impression his whole life’s work has led to this moment, the creation of this book, a heap of knowledge and wisdom built up over decades and condensed into an extremely digestible, and highly readable, vital lesson on how to view the world and make good decisions. If you’re not familiar with Hans’ work I fully recommend checking out some of his videos on TED, YouTube or his own site gapminder.org. The book is so much more enjoyable if you can hear his voice in your head. Sadly Hans died last year. This book is an honourable legacy. "
162,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13369978-jana-light,4,"I really enjoyed this book. It reads quickly because of all the graphs, but it is packed with good data demonstrating that the world is better than we think it is. ""Bad, but better."" (My new favorite way to describe the world.) This is a wonderful manifesto for curiosity and letting facts drive our assessment of the world, rather than our limited and parochial world views.I kept thinking of Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow while I read. Kahneman tackles cognitive biases, Rosling tackles bad mental habits. Two books that should be read by everyone. (IMHO)I'll be honest -- I was a little turned off by ""him"" and his voice throughout. It felt a bit too cocky. However, I outright bawled at the postscript, so apparently his stories and anecdotes really generated a tenderness in me towards him. I felt this worth noting, because I don't tend to cry with these kinds of books over an affinity for the author himself/herself."

Should be given out as a general handbook for understanding the world. It does not just break the myths we have from decades ago, but also brings a framework how to be in touch with the reality going forward.My main takeway: Stop the developing/developed countries nonsense, there are regions on the whole spectrum of income, use dollarstreet.org when trying to get an idea how a family on part of the spectrum lives.Also: gapminder.org/tools is a great explorative UI for various world metrics. For example, life expectancy versus total health expenses shows really well the fuckupedness of US health system."

And not because I don't obviously know that we are a better world- a better society- now than say in the Middle Ages. Duh.It is because I'm against the notion that the fact that we've progressed could mean that we should stop seeking an even betterment of the world.I think the premise of this book is used as proof that we are good (not better) in the world and so no changes are necessary.Hans Rosling does present a hopeful panorama (and the book is pretty great) but I think he also presents a case for contentment. And I disagree with that."
167,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47154315-ian,4,"I would have liked to have spent a bit more time on this fairly new book, but alas the library had a huge waiting list of eager readers, so I could not renew it.There is good reason for the popularity and interest in Hans Rosling's book, which he worked on with his son and daughter in-law as a project that arouse from his lifetime of work as a public health official in Sweden.Rosling's thesis is that a huge majority of us cannot answer factual questions about the state of the modern world, which is apparently doing quite well in several important metrics. When it comes to questions such as, what percentage of women have 10 years or more of schooling, what is the average income in India, or what is the child-mortality of Bangladesh, most of us are sadly inaccurate and believe that the world still is what it was when we were taught in elementary school circa 1952. In fact, when he spends the early part of the book posing multiple-choice questions to the reader to show that the world is better off than ever in many measures, Rosling is rather fond of pointing out that even UN officials are typically less accurate in their responses to these questions than the random choices of a group of chimpanzees! Why?! How come our gut instincts are so outdated and false when it comes to the very world we live in?A big part of it is to do with just that, relying on our gut instincts. These tend to be set as the cognitive foundation by our elementary school projects from 30-50 years ago on the ""Third-World"", the news media's love of uniquely bad news (""if it doesn't bleed, it doesn't lead""), and our human tendencies of over-generalizing and being trapped in our own perspective.I think it important to point out that Rosling and his positive fact-finders are not simply some pollyannas saying that the world is just great and everything is getting better. He makes an effort to show that some things are indeed not getting better, such as the threat of climate change and the rise of political violence and terrorism in the last few decades. His purpose, however, is to rouse those of us living in the wealthier parts of the world to snap out of our old worldview and when presented with facts that seem ""unreal"" to actually look at the real data, to think critically about that data, and to ultimately realize that the world is changing in many ways for the better.Interestingly, I find that his advice also works well in this era of ""fake news"", where politicians can spout anything that seems to hold with an unsophisticated, uncritical worldview. Instead, if we again apply Rosling's tenets of looking up the true data, comparing numbers, thinking critically, and being aware of our own internal biases, we can tell which news is ""fake"" and which is not. A handy set of tools that truly can make the world better. Much better."
168,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/565673-nicholas-whyte,5,"https://nwhyte.livejournal.com/3142977.htmlI was a huge fan of the videos of Hans Rosling, who died in March 2017; and I write as one who generally hates vlogging (even though I have indulged in it myself occasionally). In Factfulness, the book he rushed to complete with his son and daughter-in-law when he learned he was dying, he calls on us all to engage critically with news stories and perceptions about the world - particularly about the state of humanity as a whole, most of all the developing economies. The concept of 'Factfulness', clearly intended as a close relative of mindfulness, is defined as :the stress-reducing habvit of only carrying opinions for which you have strong supporting facts.He repeatedly makes the effective point that most people - including the rich, privileged and well-informed - perform less well on a basic test about the state of the world than would a chimpanzee selecting answers at random.If I can boil it down, his first key message is that things are better than they were, but that should not deter us from making them better still. In particular, humanity is healthier, more prosperous, safer and more peaceful than it has ever been, and the greatest improvements have been made in countries which were desperately poor decades ago and have caught up since. BUT, his second key message is that news reports naturally concentrate on the drama of failure and crisis, so it's easy to get the impression that the world is going to hell; improvements are generally gradual (not always - there is the striking case of the recent decrease in birthrate in Iran, for instance, which of course received no international media coverage) while disasters, epidemics and wars fit the news cycle. HOWEVER, thirdly there is a real climate crisis, but we must be careful not to exaggerate it; the facts themselves are worrying enough, without resorting to worst-case scenarios or irrelevant issues (and he has plenty of cites for those).I find this all very attractive. If we are looking for a framework to push back against fake news, Rosling's fact-based approach is a very good place to start. but also, if we are trying to get to grips with crises (of which climate change is clearly the most drastic), it's very helpful to be able to point to the progress that has already been made as well as the further steps that are demanded. Certainly I find it easier to be motivated by the thought of building on previous good work than the notion of crusading against an inevitable fate. Strongly recommended."
169,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1910836-lobstergirl,3,"p. 149: ""Every pregnancy results in roughly two years of lost menstruation. If you are a manufacturer of menstrual pads, this is bad for business. So you ought to know about, and be so happy about, the drop in babies per woman across the world. You ought to know and be happy too about the growth in the number of educated women working away from home. Because these developments have created an exploding market for your products over the last few decades among billions of menstruating women now living on Levels 2 [income of $2-8/day] and 3 [income of $8-32/day].But, as I realized when I attended an internal meeting at one of the world's biggest manufacturers of sanitary wear, most Western manufacturers have completely missed this. Instead, when hunting for new customers they are often stuck dreaming up new needs among the 300 million menstruating women on Level 4 [income above $32/day]. ""What if we market an even thinner pad for bikinis? What about pads that are invisible, to wear Lycra? How about one pad for each kind of outfit, each situation, each sport? Special pads for mountain climbers!"" Ideally, all the pads are so small they need to be replaced several times a day. But like most rich consumer markets, the basic needs are already met, and producers fight in vain to create demand in ever-smaller segments.Meanwhile, on Levels 2 and 3, roughly 2 billion menstruating women have few alternatives to choose from. These women don't wear Lycra and won't spend money on ultrathin pads. They demand a low-cost pad that will be reliable throughout the day so they don't have to change it when they are out at work. And when they find a product they like, they will probably stick to that brand for their whole lives and recommend it to their daughters."""
170,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63307890-amy,1,"My favorite thing about this book is that this guy is a quirky sword swallower. Unfortunately, it truly ends there. Anyone that's taken a basic statistics course or a population dynamics course can approach this narrative with an appropriately critical eye. I think that these instincts/trends in human emotion and cognition are real, but his oversimplification of global issues is reductive and un-academic. I think that his arguments would have been much stronger if he had justified them with neurology literature which he is fully qualified to do as a clinician. I especially find fault with his depiction of emphasizing the urgency of climate change as “crying wolf.” I get what he’s saying. He’s trying to say that activists are trying to present the worst case scenario to generate action. Unfortunately, the information he uses contradicts that of leading climate scientists and is not indeed “fact” based. Likewise, his assertion that the link between climate change and migration is “very weak” is preposterous. This man is really comfortable spouting off a string of poorly formulated arguments. What he doesn’t discuss in much detail is that statistical analyses can be cherry picked to support arguments. Your argument can still be poor if you cite data. This is exactly what he has done, but with a grating hubris that his perspective is unquestionably empirical. He also takes a very long time to make each individual point due to his meandering style. I know this is part of the ""I'm writing like I talk"" style, but there's a reason why people like concision. I am honestly shocked that this book got such great reviews."
171,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,4,"Factfulness is basically an information literacy text that takes a hard look at how humans misjudge numbers. I enjoy statistics and have a pretty good grasp of PhD level stats, so I was more interested in the kinds of misjudgments most people make. On this front, the book did not disappoint. Each chapter focuses on a different type of thinking error and covers the territory pretty well. As humans, we like simple explanations that put the blame on a concrete person or entity, even in the absence of conclusive data.The authors’ main point is, assume nothing. Gather data. Summarize it intelligently, then draw appropriate conclusions. As a retired academic, I hope I have largely managed to do this. But I noticed as I was reading the book that we do tend to jump to conclusions based on personal experience and limited data. The Iowa caucuses had a massive technology failure last night and results are as yet unavailable. The internet is rife with assumptions that the DNC was involved in a shadowy plot to undermine one candidate or another. This is hogwash but otherwise intelligent friends clearly believe it. The media doesn’t help as it reports on the technology problem as if it were a major scandal. This situation demonstrates many of the authors’ principles. Use data to make decisions. Don’t be swayed by provocative media coverage. Don’t scapegoat. And so on. I’d recommend this book for anyone with little statistical training who is interested in thinking about how to frame issues based on data."
172,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85511402-taro,1,"Rosling thinks that the statistical data he is using in the book are facts. Many of the data come from the IMF and from the world bank. I don't really think those capitalistic institutes provide really objective data. As Winston Churchill said: The only statistics you can trust are those you falsified yourself.The author claims that in Fukushima nobody died form radioactivity. People were dying from fear of radioactivity. The same claim about the pesticide DDT. Even worse he claims the Vietnam War was not that severe, the country had some longer wars in the history. These statements make me feel sad.One big mistake in this book is the use of the average income to declare the financial state of a country. If there is one rich billionaire living in this country, the average would increase dramatically. Rosling should better use the median income. That means the income, where 50% of the people earn more, and 50% earn less. The median is typically smaller than the average. The so-called facts of this book would look very different then ...The most annoying thing in the book is the use of an exponential scale in the income graphics. If Rosling used a linear scale, then most of the people would live in Level 1, only a few in Levels 2, 3 and 4. Details on this issue can be found in the Web, search for ""Factfulness: Building Gapminder Income Mountains"" of the Stockholm University."
173,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"This amazing book reminds me of Steven Pinker's wonderful book ""Enlightenment Now"". Hans tries to explain why the world is a much better place to live now than decades in the past. Most of us have a distorted view of the world and it's mainly because of our instinctive biases. According to Hans Rosling, the world is not divided in two. There's no gap between the rich and the poor. So maybe you'd better stop using the words ""developing"" and ""developed"". Human beings have a strong dramatic instinct toward binary thinking. A basic urge to divide things into two distinct groups, with nothing but an empty gap in between. We love to dichotomize: good vs. bad. Heroes vs. villains. My country vs. the rest. We are naturally drawn to extreme examples because they are easier to recall. We tend to notice the bad more than the good. That's why the majority of people think that the world is getting worse. We also have a fear instinct. When we are afraid, we do not see clearly. Critical thinking is always difficult, but it's almost impossible when we are scared. There's no room for facts when our minds are occupied by fear. This fear can distort our worldview. Fear that once helped keep our ancestors alive, today helps keep journalist's employed. We need to remember that things can be bad and getting better. "

The world cannot be understood without numbers. And it cannot be understood with numbers alone.
Factfulness is a great book that explains how our instincts sometimes distort our understanding of our world and why it's crucial to learn established facts that are now reliably and readily available. Our instincts might help in certain situations, but in others, critical thinking beyond emotions is necessary. 
I'm a very serious ""possibilist."" That's something I made up. It means someone who neither hopes without reason, nor fears without reason, someone who constantly resists the overdramatic worldview.
In a world more connected than ever, it's harmful to view each other through old and murky glasses. We often continue to regard the world wrong either because of the exciting news and messages we receive or the way we perceive the stories. The world is continually changing, and it is both bad and getting better at the same time. So, it is essential to develop a factful view of the world instead of a dramatic one. And Hans Rosling makes an excellent case for it in this book."
175,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5687484-ana,5,"I am actively recommending this book to a large number of people - that's how much I loved reading it! One of the main points which resonates with me is that the world has been improving in a significant way in certain areas which tend to be overlooked. It explores approachable ways in which to deconstruct simplistic ideas like 'rich and poor countries', it encourages critical thinking with simple advice like looking at distributions or making relevant comparisons when trying to make sense of data about the world. And it's got charts with clear labelling and titles and drawings and chapter summaries with bullet points and citations and references and all the things I love - it really is a masterpiece of pedagogy without becoming condescending or repetitive. If you're already familiar with global statistics, policies and initiatives, I still think it's worth the read as an example of presenting to a broad audience. Have I recommended this book to you yet?"

It’s always some shade of gray and it’s not monotone. Also averages are mostly meaningless, distribution is what matters.If only the world and local leaders would read this book and apply the methods in their work, we would make a lot less dumb decisions as societies and habitants of the Earth."

182,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3898791-udit-nair,5,"This book presents a refreshing approach to tackle things which confront humanity. It becomes a very essential read because most of us think that the world is a pathetic and miserable place to be in. But contrary to the popular notion we are placed much better than what it used to be maybe even few decades ago. Why one should read this one-1. The book is written in very simple and accessible manner. Though the author cautions everybody from seeing things in simplistic way but he does a great job in conveying his message through simplicity.2. The book challenges our misconceptions and hence it can become a source of introspection and hence progress.3. The book is indeed a great testimony of human progress achieved over years. It places great faith in humanity's ability to overcome problems. Now this faith is not based on wishful thinking but are backed by facts and figures. 4. Which leads me to next good thing about the book. That is the use of facts, statistics and all the bubbles. It is hard to deny the claim when stats are staring right into your ignorance. 5. The author has carefully identified the reasons for our misconception or ignorance. So hence he goes out to list the problems and he calls it the Instincts. Now this follows with solutions to tackle it. For eg he talks about the blame instinct. With corona crisis it becomes more evident. How countries and groups are hell bent on finding a scapegoat to pin the cause on it. Now the way to tackle this blame instinct is to look for causes and not villains. Its important to find the multiple causes which gave rise to pandemic rather than one nation, one group, one community, one action or one person. Same applies for if something good happens. Look for systems and not heroes.The things which I dont agree with the author-1. The very portrayal of grief and suffering in terms of numbers. I do agree that the world is a better place. But it doesn't help a person living in war torn places such as Syria or Yemen or Sudan to know that statistically conflict has decreased. For the individual or groups of people the reality of daily life is unimaginable. 2. The author contends that activists should not create an atmosphere of fear when confronting global challenges such as climate change. I completely disagree with this. Its because even after creating the fear there are leaders across the globe who even deny the threat and the numbers are large. Bureaucracy always reacts to a problem according to the intensity or the fear in the masses. And hence it becomes necessary that people are made aware about the existential threats specially when it comes to issues like climate change. 3. I am also of the opinion that certain amount of negativity is necessary to propel the systems and make it work. Because as we see around humans generally dont act until the threat is imminent or it affects them directly.Because otherwise its business as usual and this type of attitude can be disastrous if extended to ruling and political class."
183,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,5,"Factfulness is yet another great book that everyone who lives in this world should read. And this is coming from a person who has been generally pessimistic about the world. It may appear dichotomous for me to 5-star this book which was supposed to be telling us that the world is better than we think it is, after doing the same to one which told about how humanity made a mess of everything in this world. In fact, it took me a while to pick up this well-lauded title because I was worried that it may paint an overly rosy picture about the world. However, my concern was unfounded. Factfulness did tell me that the world is not bad as I thought it to be, but it also emphasized that while some things are getting better, there remained big issues and risks out there that need to be addressed. And it is by getting facts right and in context that resources and efforts can be directed to fixing the root causes and real problems. Supplementing both Factfulness by Hans Rosling and Humans by Tom Phillips made one of the best and most insightful non-fiction reads I've had of late. Hans Rosling called himself a 'possibilist' - not a pessimist, nor an optimist. Throughout the book, he provided lots of personal experiences and anecdotes. Some of these I could tell were painful for him to recall and share, but it lent a whole lot of credibility to his writing.  There's a lot more to say as I reflect upon what I've gotten out of this book, but I believe that it's best for one to just read it. It is so well-written, well-presented and engaging that it makes for an easy and fairly quick read. This quote from the book pretty much summarised how Factfulness could make us and the world better. 
""I don't tell you not to worry. I tell you to worry about the right things. I don't tell you look away from the news or to ignore the activists' calls to action. I tell you to ignore the noise, but keep an eye on the big global risks. I don't tell you not to be afraid. I tell you to stay coolheaded and support the global collaborations we need to reduce these risks. Control your urgency instinct. Control all your dramatic instincts. Be less stressed by the imaginary problems of an overdramatic world, and more alert to the real problems and how to solve them.

1. In all low-income countries across the world today, how many girls finish primary school?2. Where does the majority of the world population live?3. In the last 20 years, the proportion of the world population living in extreme poverty has…4. What is the life expectancy of the world today?5. There are 2 billion children in the world today, aged 0 to 15 years old. How many children will there be in the year 2100, according to the United Nations?6. The UN predicts that by 2100 the world population will have increased by another 4 billion people. What is the main reason?7. How did the number of deaths per year from natural disasters change over the last hundred years?...
Only 10% of people scored better than random guessing on these questions, the most important trends of the last hundred years. How can it be that we are both 1) a rabidly overconfident species and 2) an extremely pessimistic species that generally gets these simple, objective questions very wrong (doing far worse than random)? Sure, we could just be dogmatic nihilists or idiots, but that doesn't fit that well. 
A stunning 15% of humans managed to pick the wrong answer on all twelve questions. That’s almost impossible for a monkey to achieve. It requires systematic misconceptions. The problem here is not the lack of correct knowledge. The problem is the presence of wrong “knowledge”. To score this bad requires a false perception of the world, that make you pick the wrong answer systematically.
Rosling explains it in terms of cognitive biases: we suffer from a 
dramatic
 worldview, binarised, conflict-obsessed, and blamey. People seem to find Development - the completely unprecedented explosion of survival, freedom, and dignity for the larger part of the entire world! - boring. (You could blame the media, but Rosling persuasively argues that they too are an epiphenomenon of our evolved fear and narrowness.)
Your most important challenge in developing a fact-based worldview is to realize that most of your firsthand experiences are from Level 4 [the top 10% of global income]; and that your secondhand experiences are filtered through the mass media, which loves nonrepresentative extraordinary events and shuns normality. When you live on Level 4, everyone on Levels 3, 2, and 1 can look equally poor, and the word poor can lose any specific meaning... Anyone who has looked down from the top of a tall building knows that it is difficult to assess from there the differences in height of the buildings nearer the ground. They all look kind of small... It is natural to miss the distinctions between the people with cars, the people with motorbikes and bicycles, the people with sandals, and the people with no shoes at all. 
On the shocking lack of empiricism even in the most important places like medicine and policy:
In the 1960s, the success of the recovery position inspired new public health advice, against most traditional practices, to put babies to sleep on their tummies... Even though the data showed that sudden infant deaths went up, not down, it wasn’t until 1985 that a group of pediatricians in Hong Kong actually suggested that the prone position might be the cause. Even then, doctors in Europe didn’t pay much attention. It took Swedish authorities another seven years to accept their mistake and reverse the policy...With my own hands, over a decade or so, I turned many babies from back to tummy to prevent suffocation and save lives. So did many other doctors and parents throughout Europe and the United States, until the advice was finally reversed, 18 months after the Hong Kong study was published. Thousands of babies died because of a sweeping generalization, including some during the months when the evidence was already available. 

Two hundred ninety-two brave young feminists had traveled to Stockholm from across the world to coordinate their struggle to improve women's access to education. But only 8 percent knew that 30-year-old women have spent on average only one year less in school than 30-year-old men.
Bad incentives and noble lies are another reason for the stubborn gloom of intellectuals:
There has been progress in human rights, animal protection, women's education, climate awareness, catastrophe relief, and many other areas where activists raise awareness by saying that things are getting worse.
Relentlessly sensible:
resist blaming any one individual or group of individuals for anything. Because the problem is that when we identify the bad guy, we are done thinking. And it’s almost always more complicated than that. It’s almost always about multiple interacting causes—a system. If you really want to change the world, you have to understand how it actually works and forget about punching anyone in the face. 
I've been studying Development for years and this still taught me plenty. It should shock you into awareness and hopefully more.
Paying too much attention to the individual visible victim rather than to the numbers can lead us to spend all our resources on a fraction of the problem, and therefore save many fewer lives. This principle applies anywhere we are prioritizing scarce resources. It is hard for people to talk about resources when it comes to saving lives, or prolonging or improving them Doing so is often taken for heartlessness. Yet so long as resources are not infinite—and they never are infinite—it is the most compassionate thing to do to use your brain and work out how to do the most good with what you have. 
One of the ""five books that represent my worldview"": moral passion, strict empiricism, psychological depth, existential hope. I picked this rather than Enlightenment Now or Rational Optimist or Doing Good Better or Our World In Data or Whole Earth Discipline (out of the contemporary literature of progress) because it also covers heuristics and biases - and so substitutes / complements Kahneman, Taleb, Hanson, and Yudkowsky, without (what people insist on seeing as) their self-superior wonkishness.
Thank you industrialization, thank you steel mill, thank you power station, thank you chemical-processing industry, for giving us the time to read books. 
In a sense he stays on the surface - this isn't the full radical evolutionary account of 
Elephant in the Brain
, instead just noting some bad epistemic practices and gesturing at evolutionary theory. But that said, there's a ""charity is not about helping"" bit:
If I check the World Wildlife Fund I can see how, despite declines in some local populations, the total wild populations of tigers, giant pandas, and black rhinos have all increased over the past years. It was worth paying for all those pandas stickers on the doors all around Stockholm. Yet only 6% of the Swedish public knows that their support has had any effect.
But despite all the suffering and error and backfiring efforts he describes, he is trying to make you realise how good things could be:
Could everyone have a fact-based worldview one day? Big change is always difficult to imagine. But it is definitely possible, and I think it will happen, for two simple reasons. First: a fact-based worldview is more useful for navigating life, just like an accurate GPS is more useful for finding your way in the city. Second, and probably more important: a fact-based worldview is more comfortable. It creates less stress and hopelessness than the dramatic worldview, simply because the dramatic one is so negative and terrifying. When we have a fact-based worldview, we can see that the world is not as bad as it seems— and we can see what we have to do to keep making it better. 
This, then, is the same message as Sagan, 25 years ago: the emotional gain of reason. ---Misc notes- Binary categories are often unhelpful because they obscure continuum. Rosling ranted against ""developed"" / ""developing"" for 20 years. The World Bank has caught on but the UN haven't.- He is a better messenger for the cognitive bias alarm, for activists anyway, because of his deep credibility: he mucked in to anti-poverty measures for decades. Some of his anecdotes are chilling.
I could tell you countless stories of the nonsense I saw in Cuba: the local moonshine, a toxic fluorescent concoction brewed inside TV tubes using water, sugar, and babies’ poopy diapers to provide the yeast required for fermentation; the hotels that hadn’t planned for any guests and so had no food, a problem we solved by driving to an old people’s home and eating their leftovers from the standard adult food rations; my Cuban colleague who knew his children would be expelled from university if he sent a Christmas card to his cousin in Miami; the fact that I had to explain my research methods to Fidel Castro personally to get approval. I will restrain myself and just tell you why I was there and what I discovered. 
- ""I do not believe that fake news is the major culprit for our distorted worldview: we haven’t only just started to get the world wrong, I think we have always gotten it wrong.""- ""In the car industry, cars are recalled when a mistake is discovered. You get a letter from the manufacturer saying, “We would like to recall your vehicle and replace the brakes.” When the facts about the world that you were taught in schools and universities become out of date, you should get a letter too: “Sorry, what we taught you is no longer true. Please return your brain for a free upgrade.” """

Hans starts off with a quiz about the general state of the world with a focus on health and wealth. I won’t give too much away but suffice to say you’ll probably get more than a few questions wrong. I did the quiz with my husband and scored much better than him on most questions because I’d seen the TED talk. So if you don’t have time to read the book, watch the TED talk. But read the book. Hans then talks about how everyone gets the questions wrong, even experts. Why? Because we have a skewed, outdated world view. He then seeks to address this, starting with redefining our definition of the world from 2 categories of developed/developing countries to 4 income levels. Next he talks about 10 tendencies, or instincts, that we employ when judging/thinking about the world, and creating and consuming news and media. He talks about how these instincts help us and are necessary in some situations but are detrimental to learning about the world. And then he gives us tips on how to bypass these and make correct judgements. All of this is peppered with the most fascinating and engaging stories of his life as a trainee doctor in Sweden, a doctor in Africa with Médicin Sans Frontières and a Professor of health. Hans is a great story teller and you get the impression his whole life’s work has led to this moment, the creation of this book, a heap of knowledge and wisdom built up over decades and condensed into an extremely digestible, and highly readable, vital lesson on how to view the world and make good decisions. If you’re not familiar with Hans’ work I fully recommend checking out some of his videos on TED, YouTube or his own site gapminder.org. The book is so much more enjoyable if you can hear his voice in your head. Sadly Hans died last year. This book is an honourable legacy. "
192,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13369978-jana-light,4,"I really enjoyed this book. It reads quickly because of all the graphs, but it is packed with good data demonstrating that the world is better than we think it is. ""Bad, but better."" (My new favorite way to describe the world.) This is a wonderful manifesto for curiosity and letting facts drive our assessment of the world, rather than our limited and parochial world views.I kept thinking of Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow while I read. Kahneman tackles cognitive biases, Rosling tackles bad mental habits. Two books that should be read by everyone. (IMHO)I'll be honest -- I was a little turned off by ""him"" and his voice throughout. It felt a bit too cocky. However, I outright bawled at the postscript, so apparently his stories and anecdotes really generated a tenderness in me towards him. I felt this worth noting, because I don't tend to cry with these kinds of books over an affinity for the author himself/herself."

Should be given out as a general handbook for understanding the world. It does not just break the myths we have from decades ago, but also brings a framework how to be in touch with the reality going forward.My main takeway: Stop the developing/developed countries nonsense, there are regions on the whole spectrum of income, use dollarstreet.org when trying to get an idea how a family on part of the spectrum lives.Also: gapminder.org/tools is a great explorative UI for various world metrics. For example, life expectancy versus total health expenses shows really well the fuckupedness of US health system."

As Rosling mentioned in the introdution part, this book is his last battle to fight devastating global ignorance, and his last attempt to change people ways of thinking, calm their irrational fears, and redirect their energies into constructive activities."

And not because I don't obviously know that we are a better world- a better society- now than say in the Middle Ages. Duh.It is because I'm against the notion that the fact that we've progressed could mean that we should stop seeking an even betterment of the world.I think the premise of this book is used as proof that we are good (not better) in the world and so no changes are necessary.Hans Rosling does present a hopeful panorama (and the book is pretty great) but I think he also presents a case for contentment. And I disagree with that."
197,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47154315-ian,4,"I would have liked to have spent a bit more time on this fairly new book, but alas the library had a huge waiting list of eager readers, so I could not renew it.There is good reason for the popularity and interest in Hans Rosling's book, which he worked on with his son and daughter in-law as a project that arouse from his lifetime of work as a public health official in Sweden.Rosling's thesis is that a huge majority of us cannot answer factual questions about the state of the modern world, which is apparently doing quite well in several important metrics. When it comes to questions such as, what percentage of women have 10 years or more of schooling, what is the average income in India, or what is the child-mortality of Bangladesh, most of us are sadly inaccurate and believe that the world still is what it was when we were taught in elementary school circa 1952. In fact, when he spends the early part of the book posing multiple-choice questions to the reader to show that the world is better off than ever in many measures, Rosling is rather fond of pointing out that even UN officials are typically less accurate in their responses to these questions than the random choices of a group of chimpanzees! Why?! How come our gut instincts are so outdated and false when it comes to the very world we live in?A big part of it is to do with just that, relying on our gut instincts. These tend to be set as the cognitive foundation by our elementary school projects from 30-50 years ago on the ""Third-World"", the news media's love of uniquely bad news (""if it doesn't bleed, it doesn't lead""), and our human tendencies of over-generalizing and being trapped in our own perspective.I think it important to point out that Rosling and his positive fact-finders are not simply some pollyannas saying that the world is just great and everything is getting better. He makes an effort to show that some things are indeed not getting better, such as the threat of climate change and the rise of political violence and terrorism in the last few decades. His purpose, however, is to rouse those of us living in the wealthier parts of the world to snap out of our old worldview and when presented with facts that seem ""unreal"" to actually look at the real data, to think critically about that data, and to ultimately realize that the world is changing in many ways for the better.Interestingly, I find that his advice also works well in this era of ""fake news"", where politicians can spout anything that seems to hold with an unsophisticated, uncritical worldview. Instead, if we again apply Rosling's tenets of looking up the true data, comparing numbers, thinking critically, and being aware of our own internal biases, we can tell which news is ""fake"" and which is not. A handy set of tools that truly can make the world better. Much better."
198,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/565673-nicholas-whyte,5,"https://nwhyte.livejournal.com/3142977.htmlI was a huge fan of the videos of Hans Rosling, who died in March 2017; and I write as one who generally hates vlogging (even though I have indulged in it myself occasionally). In Factfulness, the book he rushed to complete with his son and daughter-in-law when he learned he was dying, he calls on us all to engage critically with news stories and perceptions about the world - particularly about the state of humanity as a whole, most of all the developing economies. The concept of 'Factfulness', clearly intended as a close relative of mindfulness, is defined as :the stress-reducing habvit of only carrying opinions for which you have strong supporting facts.He repeatedly makes the effective point that most people - including the rich, privileged and well-informed - perform less well on a basic test about the state of the world than would a chimpanzee selecting answers at random.If I can boil it down, his first key message is that things are better than they were, but that should not deter us from making them better still. In particular, humanity is healthier, more prosperous, safer and more peaceful than it has ever been, and the greatest improvements have been made in countries which were desperately poor decades ago and have caught up since. BUT, his second key message is that news reports naturally concentrate on the drama of failure and crisis, so it's easy to get the impression that the world is going to hell; improvements are generally gradual (not always - there is the striking case of the recent decrease in birthrate in Iran, for instance, which of course received no international media coverage) while disasters, epidemics and wars fit the news cycle. HOWEVER, thirdly there is a real climate crisis, but we must be careful not to exaggerate it; the facts themselves are worrying enough, without resorting to worst-case scenarios or irrelevant issues (and he has plenty of cites for those).I find this all very attractive. If we are looking for a framework to push back against fake news, Rosling's fact-based approach is a very good place to start. but also, if we are trying to get to grips with crises (of which climate change is clearly the most drastic), it's very helpful to be able to point to the progress that has already been made as well as the further steps that are demanded. Certainly I find it easier to be motivated by the thought of building on previous good work than the notion of crusading against an inevitable fate. Strongly recommended."

If you are a manufacturer of menstrual pads, this is bad for business. So you ought to know about, and be so happy about, the drop in babies per woman across the world. You ought to know and be happy too about the growth in the number of educated women working away from home. Because these developments have created an exploding market for your products over the last few decades among billions of menstruating women now living on Levels 2 [income of $2-8/day] and 3 [income of $8-32/day].But, as I realized when I attended an internal meeting at one of the world's biggest manufacturers of sanitary wear, most Western manufacturers have completely missed this. Instead, when hunting for new customers they are often stuck dreaming up new needs among the 300 million menstruating women on Level 4 [income above $32/day]. ""What if we market an even thinner pad for bikinis? What about pads that are invisible, to wear Lycra? How about one pad for each kind of outfit, each situation, each sport? Special pads for mountain climbers!"" Ideally, all the pads are so small they need to be replaced several times a day. But like most rich consumer markets, the basic needs are already met, and producers fight in vain to create demand in ever-smaller segments.Meanwhile, on Levels 2 and 3, roughly 2 billion menstruating women have few alternatives to choose from. These women don't wear Lycra and won't spend money on ultrathin pads. They demand a low-cost pad that will be reliable throughout the day so they don't have to change it when they are out at work. And when they find a product they like, they will probably stick to that brand for their whole lives and recommend it to their daughters."""
200,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63307890-amy,1,"My favorite thing about this book is that this guy is a quirky sword swallower. Unfortunately, it truly ends there. Anyone that's taken a basic statistics course or a population dynamics course can approach this narrative with an appropriately critical eye. I think that these instincts/trends in human emotion and cognition are real, but his oversimplification of global issues is reductive and un-academic. I think that his arguments would have been much stronger if he had justified them with neurology literature which he is fully qualified to do as a clinician. I especially find fault with his depiction of emphasizing the urgency of climate change as “crying wolf.” I get what he’s saying. He’s trying to say that activists are trying to present the worst case scenario to generate action. Unfortunately, the information he uses contradicts that of leading climate scientists and is not indeed “fact” based. Likewise, his assertion that the link between climate change and migration is “very weak” is preposterous. This man is really comfortable spouting off a string of poorly formulated arguments. What he doesn’t discuss in much detail is that statistical analyses can be cherry picked to support arguments. Your argument can still be poor if you cite data. This is exactly what he has done, but with a grating hubris that his perspective is unquestionably empirical. He also takes a very long time to make each individual point due to his meandering style. I know this is part of the ""I'm writing like I talk"" style, but there's a reason why people like concision. I am honestly shocked that this book got such great reviews."
201,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,4,"Factfulness is basically an information literacy text that takes a hard look at how humans misjudge numbers. I enjoy statistics and have a pretty good grasp of PhD level stats, so I was more interested in the kinds of misjudgments most people make. On this front, the book did not disappoint. Each chapter focuses on a different type of thinking error and covers the territory pretty well. As humans, we like simple explanations that put the blame on a concrete person or entity, even in the absence of conclusive data.The authors’ main point is, assume nothing. Gather data. Summarize it intelligently, then draw appropriate conclusions. As a retired academic, I hope I have largely managed to do this. But I noticed as I was reading the book that we do tend to jump to conclusions based on personal experience and limited data. The Iowa caucuses had a massive technology failure last night and results are as yet unavailable. The internet is rife with assumptions that the DNC was involved in a shadowy plot to undermine one candidate or another. This is hogwash but otherwise intelligent friends clearly believe it. The media doesn’t help as it reports on the technology problem as if it were a major scandal. This situation demonstrates many of the authors’ principles. Use data to make decisions. Don’t be swayed by provocative media coverage. Don’t scapegoat. And so on. I’d recommend this book for anyone with little statistical training who is interested in thinking about how to frame issues based on data."
202,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85511402-taro,1,"Rosling thinks that the statistical data he is using in the book are facts. Many of the data come from the IMF and from the world bank. I don't really think those capitalistic institutes provide really objective data. As Winston Churchill said: The only statistics you can trust are those you falsified yourself.The author claims that in Fukushima nobody died form radioactivity. People were dying from fear of radioactivity. The same claim about the pesticide DDT. Even worse he claims the Vietnam War was not that severe, the country had some longer wars in the history. These statements make me feel sad.One big mistake in this book is the use of the average income to declare the financial state of a country. If there is one rich billionaire living in this country, the average would increase dramatically. Rosling should better use the median income. That means the income, where 50% of the people earn more, and 50% earn less. The median is typically smaller than the average. The so-called facts of this book would look very different then ...The most annoying thing in the book is the use of an exponential scale in the income graphics. If Rosling used a linear scale, then most of the people would live in Level 1, only a few in Levels 2, 3 and 4. Details on this issue can be found in the Web, search for ""Factfulness: Building Gapminder Income Mountains"" of the Stockholm University."
203,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"This amazing book reminds me of Steven Pinker's wonderful book ""Enlightenment Now"". Hans tries to explain why the world is a much better place to live now than decades in the past. Most of us have a distorted view of the world and it's mainly because of our instinctive biases. According to Hans Rosling, the world is not divided in two. There's no gap between the rich and the poor. So maybe you'd better stop using the words ""developing"" and ""developed"". Human beings have a strong dramatic instinct toward binary thinking. A basic urge to divide things into two distinct groups, with nothing but an empty gap in between. We love to dichotomize: good vs. bad. Heroes vs. villains. My country vs. the rest. We are naturally drawn to extreme examples because they are easier to recall. We tend to notice the bad more than the good. That's why the majority of people think that the world is getting worse. We also have a fear instinct. When we are afraid, we do not see clearly. Critical thinking is always difficult, but it's almost impossible when we are scared. There's no room for facts when our minds are occupied by fear. This fear can distort our worldview. Fear that once helped keep our ancestors alive, today helps keep journalist's employed. We need to remember that things can be bad and getting better. "

The world cannot be understood without numbers. And it cannot be understood with numbers alone.
Factfulness is a great book that explains how our instincts sometimes distort our understanding of our world and why it's crucial to learn established facts that are now reliably and readily available. Our instincts might help in certain situations, but in others, critical thinking beyond emotions is necessary. 
I'm a very serious ""possibilist."" That's something I made up. It means someone who neither hopes without reason, nor fears without reason, someone who constantly resists the overdramatic worldview.
In a world more connected than ever, it's harmful to view each other through old and murky glasses. We often continue to regard the world wrong either because of the exciting news and messages we receive or the way we perceive the stories. The world is continually changing, and it is both bad and getting better at the same time. So, it is essential to develop a factful view of the world instead of a dramatic one. And Hans Rosling makes an excellent case for it in this book."

One of the main points which resonates with me is that the world has been improving in a significant way in certain areas which tend to be overlooked. It explores approachable ways in which to deconstruct simplistic ideas like 'rich and poor countries', it encourages critical thinking with simple advice like looking at distributions or making relevant comparisons when trying to make sense of data about the world. And it's got charts with clear labelling and titles and drawings and chapter summaries with bullet points and citations and references and all the things I love - it really is a masterpiece of pedagogy without becoming condescending or repetitive. If you're already familiar with global statistics, policies and initiatives, I still think it's worth the read as an example of presenting to a broad audience.

It’s always some shade of gray and it’s not monotone. Also averages are mostly meaningless, distribution is what matters.If only the world and local leaders would read this book and apply the methods in their work, we would make a lot less dumb decisions as societies and habitants of the Earth."

I got 12/13 correctly and I wasn't sure if I should continue reading the book. But I did anyway. It's good writing but I don't think I learned a lot from it.

212,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3898791-udit-nair,5,"This book presents a refreshing approach to tackle things which confront humanity. It becomes a very essential read because most of us think that the world is a pathetic and miserable place to be in. But contrary to the popular notion we are placed much better than what it used to be maybe even few decades ago. Why one should read this one-1. The book is written in very simple and accessible manner. Though the author cautions everybody from seeing things in simplistic way but he does a great job in conveying his message through simplicity.2. The book challenges our misconceptions and hence it can become a source of introspection and hence progress.3. The book is indeed a great testimony of human progress achieved over years. It places great faith in humanity's ability to overcome problems. Now this faith is not based on wishful thinking but are backed by facts and figures. 4. Which leads me to next good thing about the book. That is the use of facts, statistics and all the bubbles. It is hard to deny the claim when stats are staring right into your ignorance. 5. The author has carefully identified the reasons for our misconception or ignorance. So hence he goes out to list the problems and he calls it the Instincts. Now this follows with solutions to tackle it. For eg he talks about the blame instinct. With corona crisis it becomes more evident. How countries and groups are hell bent on finding a scapegoat to pin the cause on it. Now the way to tackle this blame instinct is to look for causes and not villains. Its important to find the multiple causes which gave rise to pandemic rather than one nation, one group, one community, one action or one person. Same applies for if something good happens. Look for systems and not heroes.The things which I dont agree with the author-1. The very portrayal of grief and suffering in terms of numbers. I do agree that the world is a better place. But it doesn't help a person living in war torn places such as Syria or Yemen or Sudan to know that statistically conflict has decreased. For the individual or groups of people the reality of daily life is unimaginable. 2. The author contends that activists should not create an atmosphere of fear when confronting global challenges such as climate change. I completely disagree with this. Its because even after creating the fear there are leaders across the globe who even deny the threat and the numbers are large. Bureaucracy always reacts to a problem according to the intensity or the fear in the masses. And hence it becomes necessary that people are made aware about the existential threats specially when it comes to issues like climate change. 3. I am also of the opinion that certain amount of negativity is necessary to propel the systems and make it work. Because as we see around humans generally dont act until the threat is imminent or it affects them directly.Because otherwise its business as usual and this type of attitude can be disastrous if extended to ruling and political class."
213,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,5,"Factfulness is yet another great book that everyone who lives in this world should read. And this is coming from a person who has been generally pessimistic about the world. It may appear dichotomous for me to 5-star this book which was supposed to be telling us that the world is better than we think it is, after doing the same to one which told about how humanity made a mess of everything in this world. In fact, it took me a while to pick up this well-lauded title because I was worried that it may paint an overly rosy picture about the world. However, my concern was unfounded. Factfulness did tell me that the world is not bad as I thought it to be, but it also emphasized that while some things are getting better, there remained big issues and risks out there that need to be addressed. And it is by getting facts right and in context that resources and efforts can be directed to fixing the root causes and real problems. Supplementing both Factfulness by Hans Rosling and Humans by Tom Phillips made one of the best and most insightful non-fiction reads I've had of late. Hans Rosling called himself a 'possibilist' - not a pessimist, nor an optimist. Throughout the book, he provided lots of personal experiences and anecdotes. Some of these I could tell were painful for him to recall and share, but it lent a whole lot of credibility to his writing.  There's a lot more to say as I reflect upon what I've gotten out of this book, but I believe that it's best for one to just read it. It is so well-written, well-presented and engaging that it makes for an easy and fairly quick read. This quote from the book pretty much summarised how Factfulness could make us and the world better. 
""I don't tell you not to worry. I tell you to worry about the right things. I don't tell you look away from the news or to ignore the activists' calls to action. I tell you to ignore the noise, but keep an eye on the big global risks. I don't tell you not to be afraid. I tell you to stay coolheaded and support the global collaborations we need to reduce these risks. Control your urgency instinct. Control all your dramatic instincts. Be less stressed by the imaginary problems of an overdramatic world, and more alert to the real problems and how to solve them.

And it is an interesting book, a valuable publication, definitely a book I wouldn't like to miss.At the beginning I wasn't sure that I really like and believe in dividing people in various levels (based on their income, place / country of living...) but ended up having understanding and agreeing with most of the facts in this book. Definitely I learned a lot, changed mu opinion in many things... Liked Hans Rosling's stories based on personal experience, the one about blame is a shocking story but full of truth...A good book, rich on information, well written, valuable graphs and pictures, reads like fiction, unforgettable."

1. In all low-income countries across the world today, how many girls finish primary school?2. Where does the majority of the world population live?3. In the last 20 years, the proportion of the world population living in extreme poverty has…4. What is the life expectancy of the world today?5. There are 2 billion children in the world today, aged 0 to 15 years old. How many children will there be in the year 2100, according to the United Nations?6. The UN predicts that by 2100 the world population will have increased by another 4 billion people. What is the main reason?7. How did the number of deaths per year from natural disasters change over the last hundred years?...
Only 10% of people scored better than random guessing on these questions, the most important trends of the last hundred years. How can it be that we are both 1) a rabidly overconfident species and 2) an extremely pessimistic species that generally gets these simple, objective questions very wrong (doing far worse than random)? Sure, we could just be dogmatic nihilists or idiots, but that doesn't fit that well. 
A stunning 15% of humans managed to pick the wrong answer on all twelve questions. That’s almost impossible for a monkey to achieve. It requires systematic misconceptions. The problem here is not the lack of correct knowledge. The problem is the presence of wrong “knowledge”. To score this bad requires a false perception of the world, that make you pick the wrong answer systematically.
Rosling explains it in terms of cognitive biases: we suffer from a 
dramatic
 worldview, binarised, conflict-obsessed, and blamey. People seem to find Development - the completely unprecedented explosion of survival, freedom, and dignity for the larger part of the entire world! - boring. (You could blame the media, but Rosling persuasively argues that they too are an epiphenomenon of our evolved fear and narrowness.)
Your most important challenge in developing a fact-based worldview is to realize that most of your firsthand experiences are from Level 4 [the top 10% of global income]; and that your secondhand experiences are filtered through the mass media, which loves nonrepresentative extraordinary events and shuns normality. When you live on Level 4, everyone on Levels 3, 2, and 1 can look equally poor, and the word poor can lose any specific meaning... Anyone who has looked down from the top of a tall building knows that it is difficult to assess from there the differences in height of the buildings nearer the ground. They all look kind of small... It is natural to miss the distinctions between the people with cars, the people with motorbikes and bicycles, the people with sandals, and the people with no shoes at all. 
On the shocking lack of empiricism even in the most important places like medicine and policy:
In the 1960s, the success of the recovery position inspired new public health advice, against most traditional practices, to put babies to sleep on their tummies... Even though the data showed that sudden infant deaths went up, not down, it wasn’t until 1985 that a group of pediatricians in Hong Kong actually suggested that the prone position might be the cause. Even then, doctors in Europe didn’t pay much attention. It took Swedish authorities another seven years to accept their mistake and reverse the policy...With my own hands, over a decade or so, I turned many babies from back to tummy to prevent suffocation and save lives. So did many other doctors and parents throughout Europe and the United States, until the advice was finally reversed, 18 months after the Hong Kong study was published. Thousands of babies died because of a sweeping generalization, including some during the months when the evidence was already available. 

Two hundred ninety-two brave young feminists had traveled to Stockholm from across the world to coordinate their struggle to improve women's access to education. But only 8 percent knew that 30-year-old women have spent on average only one year less in school than 30-year-old men.
Bad incentives and noble lies are another reason for the stubborn gloom of intellectuals:
There has been progress in human rights, animal protection, women's education, climate awareness, catastrophe relief, and many other areas where activists raise awareness by saying that things are getting worse.
Relentlessly sensible:
resist blaming any one individual or group of individuals for anything. Because the problem is that when we identify the bad guy, we are done thinking. And it’s almost always more complicated than that. It’s almost always about multiple interacting causes—a system. If you really want to change the world, you have to understand how it actually works and forget about punching anyone in the face. 
I've been studying Development for years and this still taught me plenty. It should shock you into awareness and hopefully more.
Paying too much attention to the individual visible victim rather than to the numbers can lead us to spend all our resources on a fraction of the problem, and therefore save many fewer lives. This principle applies anywhere we are prioritizing scarce resources. It is hard for people to talk about resources when it comes to saving lives, or prolonging or improving them Doing so is often taken for heartlessness. Yet so long as resources are not infinite—and they never are infinite—it is the most compassionate thing to do to use your brain and work out how to do the most good with what you have. 
One of the ""five books that represent my worldview"": moral passion, strict empiricism, psychological depth, existential hope. I picked this rather than Enlightenment Now or Rational Optimist or Doing Good Better or Our World In Data or Whole Earth Discipline (out of the contemporary literature of progress) because it also covers heuristics and biases - and so substitutes / complements Kahneman, Taleb, Hanson, and Yudkowsky, without (what people insist on seeing as) their self-superior wonkishness.
Thank you industrialization, thank you steel mill, thank you power station, thank you chemical-processing industry, for giving us the time to read books. 
In a sense he stays on the surface - this isn't the full radical evolutionary account of 
Elephant in the Brain
, instead just noting some bad epistemic practices and gesturing at evolutionary theory. But that said, there's a ""charity is not about helping"" bit:
If I check the World Wildlife Fund I can see how, despite declines in some local populations, the total wild populations of tigers, giant pandas, and black rhinos have all increased over the past years. It was worth paying for all those pandas stickers on the doors all around Stockholm. Yet only 6% of the Swedish public knows that their support has had any effect.
But despite all the suffering and error and backfiring efforts he describes, he is trying to make you realise how good things could be:
Could everyone have a fact-based worldview one day? Big change is always difficult to imagine. But it is definitely possible, and I think it will happen, for two simple reasons. First: a fact-based worldview is more useful for navigating life, just like an accurate GPS is more useful for finding your way in the city. Second, and probably more important: a fact-based worldview is more comfortable. It creates less stress and hopelessness than the dramatic worldview, simply because the dramatic one is so negative and terrifying. When we have a fact-based worldview, we can see that the world is not as bad as it seems— and we can see what we have to do to keep making it better. 
This, then, is the same message as Sagan, 25 years ago: the emotional gain of reason. ---Misc notes- Binary categories are often unhelpful because they obscure continuum. Rosling ranted against ""developed"" / ""developing"" for 20 years. The World Bank has caught on but the UN haven't.- He is a better messenger for the cognitive bias alarm, for activists anyway, because of his deep credibility: he mucked in to anti-poverty measures for decades. Some of his anecdotes are chilling.
I could tell you countless stories of the nonsense I saw in Cuba: the local moonshine, a toxic fluorescent concoction brewed inside TV tubes using water, sugar, and babies’ poopy diapers to provide the yeast required for fermentation; the hotels that hadn’t planned for any guests and so had no food, a problem we solved by driving to an old people’s home and eating their leftovers from the standard adult food rations; my Cuban colleague who knew his children would be expelled from university if he sent a Christmas card to his cousin in Miami; the fact that I had to explain my research methods to Fidel Castro personally to get approval. I will restrain myself and just tell you why I was there and what I discovered. 
- ""I do not believe that fake news is the major culprit for our distorted worldview: we haven’t only just started to get the world wrong, I think we have always gotten it wrong.""- ""In the car industry, cars are recalled when a mistake is discovered. You get a letter from the manufacturer saying, “We would like to recall your vehicle and replace the brakes.” When the facts about the world that you were taught in schools and universities become out of date, you should get a letter too: “Sorry, what we taught you is no longer true. Please return your brain for a free upgrade.” """
221,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63280509-lindsey-clewett,5,"I love this book. It isn’t often I give 5* but this book is thoroughly deserving. Everyone should read this. Hans starts off with a quiz about the general state of the world with a focus on health and wealth. I won’t give too much away but suffice to say you’ll probably get more than a few questions wrong. I did the quiz with my husband and scored much better than him on most questions because I’d seen the TED talk. So if you don’t have time to read the book, watch the TED talk. But read the book. Hans then talks about how everyone gets the questions wrong, even experts. Why? Because we have a skewed, outdated world view. He then seeks to address this, starting with redefining our definition of the world from 2 categories of developed/developing countries to 4 income levels. Next he talks about 10 tendencies, or instincts, that we employ when judging/thinking about the world, and creating and consuming news and media. He talks about how these instincts help us and are necessary in some situations but are detrimental to learning about the world. And then he gives us tips on how to bypass these and make correct judgements. All of this is peppered with the most fascinating and engaging stories of his life as a trainee doctor in Sweden, a doctor in Africa with Médicin Sans Frontières and a Professor of health. Hans is a great story teller and you get the impression his whole life’s work has led to this moment, the creation of this book, a heap of knowledge and wisdom built up over decades and condensed into an extremely digestible, and highly readable, vital lesson on how to view the world and make good decisions. If you’re not familiar with Hans’ work I fully recommend checking out some of his videos on TED, YouTube or his own site gapminder.org. The book is so much more enjoyable if you can hear his voice in your head. Sadly Hans died last year. This book is an honourable legacy. "
222,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13369978-jana-light,4,"I really enjoyed this book. It reads quickly because of all the graphs, but it is packed with good data demonstrating that the world is better than we think it is. ""Bad, but better."" (My new favorite way to describe the world.) This is a wonderful manifesto for curiosity and letting facts drive our assessment of the world, rather than our limited and parochial world views.I kept thinking of Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow while I read. Kahneman tackles cognitive biases, Rosling tackles bad mental habits. Two books that should be read by everyone. (IMHO)I'll be honest -- I was a little turned off by ""him"" and his voice throughout. It felt a bit too cocky. However, I outright bawled at the postscript, so apparently his stories and anecdotes really generated a tenderness in me towards him. I felt this worth noting, because I don't tend to cry with these kinds of books over an affinity for the author himself/herself."
223,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10686638-jan,5,"Finally set aside time to read this in full and wow, it is really is a gem. Should be given out as a general handbook for understanding the world. It does not just break the myths we have from decades ago, but also brings a framework how to be in touch with the reality going forward.My main takeway: Stop the developing/developed countries nonsense, there are regions on the whole spectrum of income, use dollarstreet.org when trying to get an idea how a family on part of the spectrum lives.Also: gapminder.org/tools is a great explorative UI for various world metrics. For example, life expectancy versus total health expenses shows really well the fuckupedness of US health system."

And not because I don't obviously know that we are a better world- a better society- now than say in the Middle Ages. Duh.It is because I'm against the notion that the fact that we've progressed could mean that we should stop seeking an even betterment of the world.I think the premise of this book is used as proof that we are good (not better) in the world and so no changes are necessary.Hans Rosling does present a hopeful panorama (and the book is pretty great) but I think he also presents a case for contentment. And I disagree with that."
227,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47154315-ian,4,"I would have liked to have spent a bit more time on this fairly new book, but alas the library had a huge waiting list of eager readers, so I could not renew it.There is good reason for the popularity and interest in Hans Rosling's book, which he worked on with his son and daughter in-law as a project that arouse from his lifetime of work as a public health official in Sweden.Rosling's thesis is that a huge majority of us cannot answer factual questions about the state of the modern world, which is apparently doing quite well in several important metrics. When it comes to questions such as, what percentage of women have 10 years or more of schooling, what is the average income in India, or what is the child-mortality of Bangladesh, most of us are sadly inaccurate and believe that the world still is what it was when we were taught in elementary school circa 1952. In fact, when he spends the early part of the book posing multiple-choice questions to the reader to show that the world is better off than ever in many measures, Rosling is rather fond of pointing out that even UN officials are typically less accurate in their responses to these questions than the random choices of a group of chimpanzees! Why?! How come our gut instincts are so outdated and false when it comes to the very world we live in?A big part of it is to do with just that, relying on our gut instincts. These tend to be set as the cognitive foundation by our elementary school projects from 30-50 years ago on the ""Third-World"", the news media's love of uniquely bad news (""if it doesn't bleed, it doesn't lead""), and our human tendencies of over-generalizing and being trapped in our own perspective.I think it important to point out that Rosling and his positive fact-finders are not simply some pollyannas saying that the world is just great and everything is getting better. He makes an effort to show that some things are indeed not getting better, such as the threat of climate change and the rise of political violence and terrorism in the last few decades. His purpose, however, is to rouse those of us living in the wealthier parts of the world to snap out of our old worldview and when presented with facts that seem ""unreal"" to actually look at the real data, to think critically about that data, and to ultimately realize that the world is changing in many ways for the better.Interestingly, I find that his advice also works well in this era of ""fake news"", where politicians can spout anything that seems to hold with an unsophisticated, uncritical worldview. Instead, if we again apply Rosling's tenets of looking up the true data, comparing numbers, thinking critically, and being aware of our own internal biases, we can tell which news is ""fake"" and which is not. A handy set of tools that truly can make the world better. Much better."
228,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/565673-nicholas-whyte,5,"https://nwhyte.livejournal.com/3142977.htmlI was a huge fan of the videos of Hans Rosling, who died in March 2017; and I write as one who generally hates vlogging (even though I have indulged in it myself occasionally). In Factfulness, the book he rushed to complete with his son and daughter-in-law when he learned he was dying, he calls on us all to engage critically with news stories and perceptions about the world - particularly about the state of humanity as a whole, most of all the developing economies. The concept of 'Factfulness', clearly intended as a close relative of mindfulness, is defined as :the stress-reducing habvit of only carrying opinions for which you have strong supporting facts.He repeatedly makes the effective point that most people - including the rich, privileged and well-informed - perform less well on a basic test about the state of the world than would a chimpanzee selecting answers at random.If I can boil it down, his first key message is that things are better than they were, but that should not deter us from making them better still. In particular, humanity is healthier, more prosperous, safer and more peaceful than it has ever been, and the greatest improvements have been made in countries which were desperately poor decades ago and have caught up since. BUT, his second key message is that news reports naturally concentrate on the drama of failure and crisis, so it's easy to get the impression that the world is going to hell; improvements are generally gradual (not always - there is the striking case of the recent decrease in birthrate in Iran, for instance, which of course received no international media coverage) while disasters, epidemics and wars fit the news cycle. HOWEVER, thirdly there is a real climate crisis, but we must be careful not to exaggerate it; the facts themselves are worrying enough, without resorting to worst-case scenarios or irrelevant issues (and he has plenty of cites for those).I find this all very attractive. If we are looking for a framework to push back against fake news, Rosling's fact-based approach is a very good place to start. but also, if we are trying to get to grips with crises (of which climate change is clearly the most drastic), it's very helpful to be able to point to the progress that has already been made as well as the further steps that are demanded. Certainly I find it easier to be motivated by the thought of building on previous good work than the notion of crusading against an inevitable fate. Strongly recommended."

If you are a manufacturer of menstrual pads, this is bad for business. So you ought to know about, and be so happy about, the drop in babies per woman across the world. You ought to know and be happy too about the growth in the number of educated women working away from home. Because these developments have created an exploding market for your products over the last few decades among billions of menstruating women now living on Levels 2 [income of $2-8/day] and 3 [income of $8-32/day].But, as I realized when I attended an internal meeting at one of the world's biggest manufacturers of sanitary wear, most Western manufacturers have completely missed this. Instead, when hunting for new customers they are often stuck dreaming up new needs among the 300 million menstruating women on Level 4 [income above $32/day]. ""What if we market an even thinner pad for bikinis? What about pads that are invisible, to wear Lycra? How about one pad for each kind of outfit, each situation, each sport? Special pads for mountain climbers!"" Ideally, all the pads are so small they need to be replaced several times a day. But like most rich consumer markets, the basic needs are already met, and producers fight in vain to create demand in ever-smaller segments.Meanwhile, on Levels 2 and 3, roughly 2 billion menstruating women have few alternatives to choose from. These women don't wear Lycra and won't spend money on ultrathin pads. They demand a low-cost pad that will be reliable throughout the day so they don't have to change it when they are out at work. And when they find a product they like, they will probably stick to that brand for their whole lives and recommend it to their daughters."""
230,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63307890-amy,1,"My favorite thing about this book is that this guy is a quirky sword swallower. Unfortunately, it truly ends there. Anyone that's taken a basic statistics course or a population dynamics course can approach this narrative with an appropriately critical eye. I think that these instincts/trends in human emotion and cognition are real, but his oversimplification of global issues is reductive and un-academic. I think that his arguments would have been much stronger if he had justified them with neurology literature which he is fully qualified to do as a clinician. I especially find fault with his depiction of emphasizing the urgency of climate change as “crying wolf.” I get what he’s saying. He’s trying to say that activists are trying to present the worst case scenario to generate action. Unfortunately, the information he uses contradicts that of leading climate scientists and is not indeed “fact” based. Likewise, his assertion that the link between climate change and migration is “very weak” is preposterous. This man is really comfortable spouting off a string of poorly formulated arguments. What he doesn’t discuss in much detail is that statistical analyses can be cherry picked to support arguments. Your argument can still be poor if you cite data. This is exactly what he has done, but with a grating hubris that his perspective is unquestionably empirical. He also takes a very long time to make each individual point due to his meandering style. I know this is part of the ""I'm writing like I talk"" style, but there's a reason why people like concision. I am honestly shocked that this book got such great reviews."
231,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,4,"Factfulness is basically an information literacy text that takes a hard look at how humans misjudge numbers. I enjoy statistics and have a pretty good grasp of PhD level stats, so I was more interested in the kinds of misjudgments most people make. On this front, the book did not disappoint. Each chapter focuses on a different type of thinking error and covers the territory pretty well. As humans, we like simple explanations that put the blame on a concrete person or entity, even in the absence of conclusive data.The authors’ main point is, assume nothing. Gather data. Summarize it intelligently, then draw appropriate conclusions. As a retired academic, I hope I have largely managed to do this. But I noticed as I was reading the book that we do tend to jump to conclusions based on personal experience and limited data. The Iowa caucuses had a massive technology failure last night and results are as yet unavailable. The internet is rife with assumptions that the DNC was involved in a shadowy plot to undermine one candidate or another. This is hogwash but otherwise intelligent friends clearly believe it. The media doesn’t help as it reports on the technology problem as if it were a major scandal. This situation demonstrates many of the authors’ principles. Use data to make decisions. Don’t be swayed by provocative media coverage. Don’t scapegoat. And so on. I’d recommend this book for anyone with little statistical training who is interested in thinking about how to frame issues based on data."
232,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85511402-taro,1,"Rosling thinks that the statistical data he is using in the book are facts. Many of the data come from the IMF and from the world bank. I don't really think those capitalistic institutes provide really objective data. As Winston Churchill said: The only statistics you can trust are those you falsified yourself.The author claims that in Fukushima nobody died form radioactivity. People were dying from fear of radioactivity. The same claim about the pesticide DDT. Even worse he claims the Vietnam War was not that severe, the country had some longer wars in the history. These statements make me feel sad.One big mistake in this book is the use of the average income to declare the financial state of a country. If there is one rich billionaire living in this country, the average would increase dramatically. Rosling should better use the median income. That means the income, where 50% of the people earn more, and 50% earn less. The median is typically smaller than the average. The so-called facts of this book would look very different then ...The most annoying thing in the book is the use of an exponential scale in the income graphics. If Rosling used a linear scale, then most of the people would live in Level 1, only a few in Levels 2, 3 and 4. Details on this issue can be found in the Web, search for ""Factfulness: Building Gapminder Income Mountains"" of the Stockholm University."
233,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"This amazing book reminds me of Steven Pinker's wonderful book ""Enlightenment Now"". Hans tries to explain why the world is a much better place to live now than decades in the past. Most of us have a distorted view of the world and it's mainly because of our instinctive biases. According to Hans Rosling, the world is not divided in two. There's no gap between the rich and the poor. So maybe you'd better stop using the words ""developing"" and ""developed"". Human beings have a strong dramatic instinct toward binary thinking. A basic urge to divide things into two distinct groups, with nothing but an empty gap in between. We love to dichotomize: good vs. bad. Heroes vs. villains. My country vs. the rest. We are naturally drawn to extreme examples because they are easier to recall. We tend to notice the bad more than the good. That's why the majority of people think that the world is getting worse. We also have a fear instinct. When we are afraid, we do not see clearly. Critical thinking is always difficult, but it's almost impossible when we are scared. There's no room for facts when our minds are occupied by fear. This fear can distort our worldview. Fear that once helped keep our ancestors alive, today helps keep journalist's employed. We need to remember that things can be bad and getting better. "

The world cannot be understood without numbers. And it cannot be understood with numbers alone.
Factfulness is a great book that explains how our instincts sometimes distort our understanding of our world and why it's crucial to learn established facts that are now reliably and readily available. Our instincts might help in certain situations, but in others, critical thinking beyond emotions is necessary. 
I'm a very serious ""possibilist."" That's something I made up. It means someone who neither hopes without reason, nor fears without reason, someone who constantly resists the overdramatic worldview.
In a world more connected than ever, it's harmful to view each other through old and murky glasses. We often continue to regard the world wrong either because of the exciting news and messages we receive or the way we perceive the stories. The world is continually changing, and it is both bad and getting better at the same time. So, it is essential to develop a factful view of the world instead of a dramatic one. And Hans Rosling makes an excellent case for it in this book."
235,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5687484-ana,5,"I am actively recommending this book to a large number of people - that's how much I loved reading it! One of the main points which resonates with me is that the world has been improving in a significant way in certain areas which tend to be overlooked. It explores approachable ways in which to deconstruct simplistic ideas like 'rich and poor countries', it encourages critical thinking with simple advice like looking at distributions or making relevant comparisons when trying to make sense of data about the world. And it's got charts with clear labelling and titles and drawings and chapter summaries with bullet points and citations and references and all the things I love - it really is a masterpiece of pedagogy without becoming condescending or repetitive. If you're already familiar with global statistics, policies and initiatives, I still think it's worth the read as an example of presenting to a broad audience. Have I recommended this book to you yet?"
236,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36137204-carl-rannaberg,4,"Definitely an important book which discusses how our worldview is distorted compared to the actual facts.This distortion happens through the combination of many factors: psychological biases, lack of systems thinking, sensationalistic and negative focus of media, inability to comprehend exponential growth, outdated school programs, half-life of facts etc.One of the key takeaways from this book is that the world is never black and white. It’s always some shade of gray and it’s not monotone. Also averages are mostly meaningless, distribution is what matters.If only the world and local leaders would read this book and apply the methods in their work, we would make a lot less dumb decisions as societies and habitants of the Earth."

I grew in South America; thus, I have a serious love-hate relationship with Médecins Sans Frontières, aka Doctors Without Borders, 2. I am a huge data nerd, and 3. I am smarter than a chimpanzee, at least according to Dr. Rosling's criteria. While this book does a very good job of emphasizing the importance of quality relevant data; it most definitely has its own agenda and tone that was hard to overlook. Nonetheless, I do agree that curiosity and humility are key ingredients to reduce the ignorance of the well-educated 4 level folks. "

242,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3898791-udit-nair,5,"This book presents a refreshing approach to tackle things which confront humanity. It becomes a very essential read because most of us think that the world is a pathetic and miserable place to be in. But contrary to the popular notion we are placed much better than what it used to be maybe even few decades ago. Why one should read this one-1. The book is written in very simple and accessible manner. Though the author cautions everybody from seeing things in simplistic way but he does a great job in conveying his message through simplicity.2. The book challenges our misconceptions and hence it can become a source of introspection and hence progress.3. The book is indeed a great testimony of human progress achieved over years. It places great faith in humanity's ability to overcome problems. Now this faith is not based on wishful thinking but are backed by facts and figures. 4. Which leads me to next good thing about the book. That is the use of facts, statistics and all the bubbles. It is hard to deny the claim when stats are staring right into your ignorance. 5. The author has carefully identified the reasons for our misconception or ignorance. So hence he goes out to list the problems and he calls it the Instincts. Now this follows with solutions to tackle it. For eg he talks about the blame instinct. With corona crisis it becomes more evident. How countries and groups are hell bent on finding a scapegoat to pin the cause on it. Now the way to tackle this blame instinct is to look for causes and not villains. Its important to find the multiple causes which gave rise to pandemic rather than one nation, one group, one community, one action or one person. Same applies for if something good happens. Look for systems and not heroes.The things which I dont agree with the author-1. The very portrayal of grief and suffering in terms of numbers. I do agree that the world is a better place. But it doesn't help a person living in war torn places such as Syria or Yemen or Sudan to know that statistically conflict has decreased. For the individual or groups of people the reality of daily life is unimaginable. 2. The author contends that activists should not create an atmosphere of fear when confronting global challenges such as climate change. I completely disagree with this. Its because even after creating the fear there are leaders across the globe who even deny the threat and the numbers are large. Bureaucracy always reacts to a problem according to the intensity or the fear in the masses. And hence it becomes necessary that people are made aware about the existential threats specially when it comes to issues like climate change. 3. I am also of the opinion that certain amount of negativity is necessary to propel the systems and make it work. Because as we see around humans generally dont act until the threat is imminent or it affects them directly.Because otherwise its business as usual and this type of attitude can be disastrous if extended to ruling and political class."
243,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,5,"Factfulness is yet another great book that everyone who lives in this world should read. And this is coming from a person who has been generally pessimistic about the world. It may appear dichotomous for me to 5-star this book which was supposed to be telling us that the world is better than we think it is, after doing the same to one which told about how humanity made a mess of everything in this world. In fact, it took me a while to pick up this well-lauded title because I was worried that it may paint an overly rosy picture about the world. However, my concern was unfounded. Factfulness did tell me that the world is not bad as I thought it to be, but it also emphasized that while some things are getting better, there remained big issues and risks out there that need to be addressed. And it is by getting facts right and in context that resources and efforts can be directed to fixing the root causes and real problems. Supplementing both Factfulness by Hans Rosling and Humans by Tom Phillips made one of the best and most insightful non-fiction reads I've had of late. Hans Rosling called himself a 'possibilist' - not a pessimist, nor an optimist. Throughout the book, he provided lots of personal experiences and anecdotes. Some of these I could tell were painful for him to recall and share, but it lent a whole lot of credibility to his writing.  There's a lot more to say as I reflect upon what I've gotten out of this book, but I believe that it's best for one to just read it. It is so well-written, well-presented and engaging that it makes for an easy and fairly quick read. This quote from the book pretty much summarised how Factfulness could make us and the world better. 
""I don't tell you not to worry. I tell you to worry about the right things. I don't tell you look away from the news or to ignore the activists' calls to action. I tell you to ignore the noise, but keep an eye on the big global risks. I don't tell you not to be afraid. I tell you to stay coolheaded and support the global collaborations we need to reduce these risks. Control your urgency instinct. Control all your dramatic instincts. Be less stressed by the imaginary problems of an overdramatic world, and more alert to the real problems and how to solve them.

1. In all low-income countries across the world today, how many girls finish primary school?2. Where does the majority of the world population live?3. In the last 20 years, the proportion of the world population living in extreme poverty has…4. What is the life expectancy of the world today?5. There are 2 billion children in the world today, aged 0 to 15 years old. How many children will there be in the year 2100, according to the United Nations?6. The UN predicts that by 2100 the world population will have increased by another 4 billion people. What is the main reason?7. How did the number of deaths per year from natural disasters change over the last hundred years?...
Only 10% of people scored better than random guessing on these questions, the most important trends of the last hundred years. How can it be that we are both 1) a rabidly overconfident species and 2) an extremely pessimistic species that generally gets these simple, objective questions very wrong (doing far worse than random)? Sure, we could just be dogmatic nihilists or idiots, but that doesn't fit that well. 
A stunning 15% of humans managed to pick the wrong answer on all twelve questions. That’s almost impossible for a monkey to achieve. It requires systematic misconceptions. The problem here is not the lack of correct knowledge. The problem is the presence of wrong “knowledge”. To score this bad requires a false perception of the world, that make you pick the wrong answer systematically.
Rosling explains it in terms of cognitive biases: we suffer from a 
dramatic
 worldview, binarised, conflict-obsessed, and blamey. People seem to find Development - the completely unprecedented explosion of survival, freedom, and dignity for the larger part of the entire world! - boring. (You could blame the media, but Rosling persuasively argues that they too are an epiphenomenon of our evolved fear and narrowness.)
Your most important challenge in developing a fact-based worldview is to realize that most of your firsthand experiences are from Level 4 [the top 10% of global income]; and that your secondhand experiences are filtered through the mass media, which loves nonrepresentative extraordinary events and shuns normality. When you live on Level 4, everyone on Levels 3, 2, and 1 can look equally poor, and the word poor can lose any specific meaning... Anyone who has looked down from the top of a tall building knows that it is difficult to assess from there the differences in height of the buildings nearer the ground. They all look kind of small... It is natural to miss the distinctions between the people with cars, the people with motorbikes and bicycles, the people with sandals, and the people with no shoes at all. 
On the shocking lack of empiricism even in the most important places like medicine and policy:
In the 1960s, the success of the recovery position inspired new public health advice, against most traditional practices, to put babies to sleep on their tummies... Even though the data showed that sudden infant deaths went up, not down, it wasn’t until 1985 that a group of pediatricians in Hong Kong actually suggested that the prone position might be the cause. Even then, doctors in Europe didn’t pay much attention. It took Swedish authorities another seven years to accept their mistake and reverse the policy...With my own hands, over a decade or so, I turned many babies from back to tummy to prevent suffocation and save lives. So did many other doctors and parents throughout Europe and the United States, until the advice was finally reversed, 18 months after the Hong Kong study was published. Thousands of babies died because of a sweeping generalization, including some during the months when the evidence was already available. 

Two hundred ninety-two brave young feminists had traveled to Stockholm from across the world to coordinate their struggle to improve women's access to education. But only 8 percent knew that 30-year-old women have spent on average only one year less in school than 30-year-old men.
Bad incentives and noble lies are another reason for the stubborn gloom of intellectuals:
There has been progress in human rights, animal protection, women's education, climate awareness, catastrophe relief, and many other areas where activists raise awareness by saying that things are getting worse.
Relentlessly sensible:
resist blaming any one individual or group of individuals for anything. Because the problem is that when we identify the bad guy, we are done thinking. And it’s almost always more complicated than that. It’s almost always about multiple interacting causes—a system. If you really want to change the world, you have to understand how it actually works and forget about punching anyone in the face. 
I've been studying Development for years and this still taught me plenty. It should shock you into awareness and hopefully more.
Paying too much attention to the individual visible victim rather than to the numbers can lead us to spend all our resources on a fraction of the problem, and therefore save many fewer lives. This principle applies anywhere we are prioritizing scarce resources. It is hard for people to talk about resources when it comes to saving lives, or prolonging or improving them Doing so is often taken for heartlessness. Yet so long as resources are not infinite—and they never are infinite—it is the most compassionate thing to do to use your brain and work out how to do the most good with what you have. 
One of the ""five books that represent my worldview"": moral passion, strict empiricism, psychological depth, existential hope. I picked this rather than Enlightenment Now or Rational Optimist or Doing Good Better or Our World In Data or Whole Earth Discipline (out of the contemporary literature of progress) because it also covers heuristics and biases - and so substitutes / complements Kahneman, Taleb, Hanson, and Yudkowsky, without (what people insist on seeing as) their self-superior wonkishness.

In a sense he stays on the surface - this isn't the full radical evolutionary account of 
Elephant in the Brain
, instead just noting some bad epistemic practices and gesturing at evolutionary theory. But that said, there's a ""charity is not about helping"" bit:
If I check the World Wildlife Fund I can see how, despite declines in some local populations, the total wild populations of tigers, giant pandas, and black rhinos have all increased over the past years. It was worth paying for all those pandas stickers on the doors all around Stockholm. Yet only 6% of the Swedish public knows that their support has had any effect.
But despite all the suffering and error and backfiring efforts he describes, he is trying to make you realise how good things could be:
Could everyone have a fact-based worldview one day? Big change is always difficult to imagine. But it is definitely possible, and I think it will happen, for two simple reasons. First: a fact-based worldview is more useful for navigating life, just like an accurate GPS is more useful for finding your way in the city. Second, and probably more important: a fact-based worldview is more comfortable. It creates less stress and hopelessness than the dramatic worldview, simply because the dramatic one is so negative and terrifying. When we have a fact-based worldview, we can see that the world is not as bad as it seems— and we can see what we have to do to keep making it better. 
This, then, is the same message as Sagan, 25 years ago: the emotional gain of reason. ---Misc notes- Binary categories are often unhelpful because they obscure continuum. Rosling ranted against ""developed"" / ""developing"" for 20 years. The World Bank has caught on but the UN haven't.- He is a better messenger for the cognitive bias alarm, for activists anyway, because of his deep credibility: he mucked in to anti-poverty measures for decades. Some of his anecdotes are chilling.
I could tell you countless stories of the nonsense I saw in Cuba: the local moonshine, a toxic fluorescent concoction brewed inside TV tubes using water, sugar, and babies’ poopy diapers to provide the yeast required for fermentation; the hotels that hadn’t planned for any guests and so had no food, a problem we solved by driving to an old people’s home and eating their leftovers from the standard adult food rations; my Cuban colleague who knew his children would be expelled from university if he sent a Christmas card to his cousin in Miami; the fact that I had to explain my research methods to Fidel Castro personally to get approval. I will restrain myself and just tell you why I was there and what I discovered.

You get a letter from the manufacturer saying, “We would like to recall your vehicle and replace the brakes.” When the facts about the world that you were taught in schools and universities become out of date, you should get a letter too: “Sorry, what we taught you is no longer true. Please return your brain for a free upgrade.” """

Hans starts off with a quiz about the general state of the world with a focus on health and wealth. I won’t give too much away but suffice to say you’ll probably get more than a few questions wrong. I did the quiz with my husband and scored much better than him on most questions because I’d seen the TED talk. So if you don’t have time to read the book, watch the TED talk. But read the book. Hans then talks about how everyone gets the questions wrong, even experts. Why? Because we have a skewed, outdated world view. He then seeks to address this, starting with redefining our definition of the world from 2 categories of developed/developing countries to 4 income levels. Next he talks about 10 tendencies, or instincts, that we employ when judging/thinking about the world, and creating and consuming news and media. He talks about how these instincts help us and are necessary in some situations but are detrimental to learning about the world. And then he gives us tips on how to bypass these and make correct judgements. All of this is peppered with the most fascinating and engaging stories of his life as a trainee doctor in Sweden, a doctor in Africa with Médicin Sans Frontières and a Professor of health. Hans is a great story teller and you get the impression his whole life’s work has led to this moment, the creation of this book, a heap of knowledge and wisdom built up over decades and condensed into an extremely digestible, and highly readable, vital lesson on how to view the world and make good decisions. If you’re not familiar with Hans’ work I fully recommend checking out some of his videos on TED, YouTube or his own site gapminder.org. The book is so much more enjoyable if you can hear his voice in your head. Sadly Hans died last year. This book is an honourable legacy. "

It reads quickly because of all the graphs, but it is packed with good data demonstrating that the world is better than we think it is. ""Bad, but better."" (My new favorite way to describe the world.) This is a wonderful manifesto for curiosity and letting facts drive our assessment of the world, rather than our limited and parochial world views.I kept thinking of Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow while I read. Kahneman tackles cognitive biases, Rosling tackles bad mental habits. Two books that should be read by everyone. (IMHO)I'll be honest -- I was a little turned off by ""him"" and his voice throughout. It felt a bit too cocky. However, I outright bawled at the postscript, so apparently his stories and anecdotes really generated a tenderness in me towards him. I felt this worth noting, because I don't tend to cry with these kinds of books over an affinity for the author himself/herself."

257,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47154315-ian,4,"I would have liked to have spent a bit more time on this fairly new book, but alas the library had a huge waiting list of eager readers, so I could not renew it.There is good reason for the popularity and interest in Hans Rosling's book, which he worked on with his son and daughter in-law as a project that arouse from his lifetime of work as a public health official in Sweden.Rosling's thesis is that a huge majority of us cannot answer factual questions about the state of the modern world, which is apparently doing quite well in several important metrics. When it comes to questions such as, what percentage of women have 10 years or more of schooling, what is the average income in India, or what is the child-mortality of Bangladesh, most of us are sadly inaccurate and believe that the world still is what it was when we were taught in elementary school circa 1952. In fact, when he spends the early part of the book posing multiple-choice questions to the reader to show that the world is better off than ever in many measures, Rosling is rather fond of pointing out that even UN officials are typically less accurate in their responses to these questions than the random choices of a group of chimpanzees! Why?! How come our gut instincts are so outdated and false when it comes to the very world we live in?A big part of it is to do with just that, relying on our gut instincts. These tend to be set as the cognitive foundation by our elementary school projects from 30-50 years ago on the ""Third-World"", the news media's love of uniquely bad news (""if it doesn't bleed, it doesn't lead""), and our human tendencies of over-generalizing and being trapped in our own perspective.I think it important to point out that Rosling and his positive fact-finders are not simply some pollyannas saying that the world is just great and everything is getting better. He makes an effort to show that some things are indeed not getting better, such as the threat of climate change and the rise of political violence and terrorism in the last few decades. His purpose, however, is to rouse those of us living in the wealthier parts of the world to snap out of our old worldview and when presented with facts that seem ""unreal"" to actually look at the real data, to think critically about that data, and to ultimately realize that the world is changing in many ways for the better.Interestingly, I find that his advice also works well in this era of ""fake news"", where politicians can spout anything that seems to hold with an unsophisticated, uncritical worldview. Instead, if we again apply Rosling's tenets of looking up the true data, comparing numbers, thinking critically, and being aware of our own internal biases, we can tell which news is ""fake"" and which is not. A handy set of tools that truly can make the world better. Much better."
258,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/565673-nicholas-whyte,5,"https://nwhyte.livejournal.com/3142977.htmlI was a huge fan of the videos of Hans Rosling, who died in March 2017; and I write as one who generally hates vlogging (even though I have indulged in it myself occasionally). In Factfulness, the book he rushed to complete with his son and daughter-in-law when he learned he was dying, he calls on us all to engage critically with news stories and perceptions about the world - particularly about the state of humanity as a whole, most of all the developing economies. The concept of 'Factfulness', clearly intended as a close relative of mindfulness, is defined as :the stress-reducing habvit of only carrying opinions for which you have strong supporting facts.He repeatedly makes the effective point that most people - including the rich, privileged and well-informed - perform less well on a basic test about the state of the world than would a chimpanzee selecting answers at random.If I can boil it down, his first key message is that things are better than they were, but that should not deter us from making them better still. In particular, humanity is healthier, more prosperous, safer and more peaceful than it has ever been, and the greatest improvements have been made in countries which were desperately poor decades ago and have caught up since. BUT, his second key message is that news reports naturally concentrate on the drama of failure and crisis, so it's easy to get the impression that the world is going to hell; improvements are generally gradual (not always - there is the striking case of the recent decrease in birthrate in Iran, for instance, which of course received no international media coverage) while disasters, epidemics and wars fit the news cycle. HOWEVER, thirdly there is a real climate crisis, but we must be careful not to exaggerate it; the facts themselves are worrying enough, without resorting to worst-case scenarios or irrelevant issues (and he has plenty of cites for those).I find this all very attractive. If we are looking for a framework to push back against fake news, Rosling's fact-based approach is a very good place to start. but also, if we are trying to get to grips with crises (of which climate change is clearly the most drastic), it's very helpful to be able to point to the progress that has already been made as well as the further steps that are demanded. Certainly I find it easier to be motivated by the thought of building on previous good work than the notion of crusading against an inevitable fate. Strongly recommended."

If you are a manufacturer of menstrual pads, this is bad for business. So you ought to know about, and be so happy about, the drop in babies per woman across the world. You ought to know and be happy too about the growth in the number of educated women working away from home. Because these developments have created an exploding market for your products over the last few decades among billions of menstruating women now living on Levels 2 [income of $2-8/day] and 3 [income of $8-32/day].But, as I realized when I attended an internal meeting at one of the world's biggest manufacturers of sanitary wear, most Western manufacturers have completely missed this. Instead, when hunting for new customers they are often stuck dreaming up new needs among the 300 million menstruating women on Level 4 [income above $32/day]. ""What if we market an even thinner pad for bikinis? What about pads that are invisible, to wear Lycra? How about one pad for each kind of outfit, each situation, each sport? Special pads for mountain climbers!"" Ideally, all the pads are so small they need to be replaced several times a day. But like most rich consumer markets, the basic needs are already met, and producers fight in vain to create demand in ever-smaller segments.Meanwhile, on Levels 2 and 3, roughly 2 billion menstruating women have few alternatives to choose from. These women don't wear Lycra and won't spend money on ultrathin pads. They demand a low-cost pad that will be reliable throughout the day so they don't have to change it when they are out at work. And when they find a product they like, they will probably stick to that brand for their whole lives and recommend it to their daughters."""

Anyone that's taken a basic statistics course or a population dynamics course can approach this narrative with an appropriately critical eye. I think that these instincts/trends in human emotion and cognition are real, but his oversimplification of global issues is reductive and un-academic. I think that his arguments would have been much stronger if he had justified them with neurology literature which he is fully qualified to do as a clinician. I especially find fault with his depiction of emphasizing the urgency of climate change as “crying wolf.” I get what he’s saying. He’s trying to say that activists are trying to present the worst case scenario to generate action. Unfortunately, the information he uses contradicts that of leading climate scientists and is not indeed “fact” based. Likewise, his assertion that the link between climate change and migration is “very weak” is preposterous. This man is really comfortable spouting off a string of poorly formulated arguments. What he doesn’t discuss in much detail is that statistical analyses can be cherry picked to support arguments. Your argument can still be poor if you cite data. This is exactly what he has done, but with a grating hubris that his perspective is unquestionably empirical. He also takes a very long time to make each individual point due to his meandering style. I know this is part of the ""I'm writing like I talk"" style, but there's a reason why people like concision. I am honestly shocked that this book got such great reviews."
261,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,4,"Factfulness is basically an information literacy text that takes a hard look at how humans misjudge numbers. I enjoy statistics and have a pretty good grasp of PhD level stats, so I was more interested in the kinds of misjudgments most people make. On this front, the book did not disappoint. Each chapter focuses on a different type of thinking error and covers the territory pretty well. As humans, we like simple explanations that put the blame on a concrete person or entity, even in the absence of conclusive data.The authors’ main point is, assume nothing. Gather data. Summarize it intelligently, then draw appropriate conclusions. As a retired academic, I hope I have largely managed to do this. But I noticed as I was reading the book that we do tend to jump to conclusions based on personal experience and limited data. The Iowa caucuses had a massive technology failure last night and results are as yet unavailable. The internet is rife with assumptions that the DNC was involved in a shadowy plot to undermine one candidate or another. This is hogwash but otherwise intelligent friends clearly believe it. The media doesn’t help as it reports on the technology problem as if it were a major scandal. This situation demonstrates many of the authors’ principles. Use data to make decisions. Don’t be swayed by provocative media coverage. Don’t scapegoat. And so on. I’d recommend this book for anyone with little statistical training who is interested in thinking about how to frame issues based on data."
262,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85511402-taro,1,"Rosling thinks that the statistical data he is using in the book are facts. Many of the data come from the IMF and from the world bank. I don't really think those capitalistic institutes provide really objective data. As Winston Churchill said: The only statistics you can trust are those you falsified yourself.The author claims that in Fukushima nobody died form radioactivity. People were dying from fear of radioactivity. The same claim about the pesticide DDT. Even worse he claims the Vietnam War was not that severe, the country had some longer wars in the history. These statements make me feel sad.One big mistake in this book is the use of the average income to declare the financial state of a country. If there is one rich billionaire living in this country, the average would increase dramatically. Rosling should better use the median income. That means the income, where 50% of the people earn more, and 50% earn less. The median is typically smaller than the average. The so-called facts of this book would look very different then ...The most annoying thing in the book is the use of an exponential scale in the income graphics. If Rosling used a linear scale, then most of the people would live in Level 1, only a few in Levels 2, 3 and 4. Details on this issue can be found in the Web, search for ""Factfulness: Building Gapminder Income Mountains"" of the Stockholm University."
263,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"This amazing book reminds me of Steven Pinker's wonderful book ""Enlightenment Now"". Hans tries to explain why the world is a much better place to live now than decades in the past. Most of us have a distorted view of the world and it's mainly because of our instinctive biases. According to Hans Rosling, the world is not divided in two. There's no gap between the rich and the poor. So maybe you'd better stop using the words ""developing"" and ""developed"". Human beings have a strong dramatic instinct toward binary thinking. A basic urge to divide things into two distinct groups, with nothing but an empty gap in between. We love to dichotomize: good vs. bad. Heroes vs. villains. My country vs. the rest. We are naturally drawn to extreme examples because they are easier to recall. We tend to notice the bad more than the good. That's why the majority of people think that the world is getting worse. We also have a fear instinct. When we are afraid, we do not see clearly. Critical thinking is always difficult, but it's almost impossible when we are scared. There's no room for facts when our minds are occupied by fear. This fear can distort our worldview. Fear that once helped keep our ancestors alive, today helps keep journalist's employed. We need to remember that things can be bad and getting better. "

The world cannot be understood without numbers. And it cannot be understood with numbers alone.
Factfulness is a great book that explains how our instincts sometimes distort our understanding of our world and why it's crucial to learn established facts that are now reliably and readily available. Our instincts might help in certain situations, but in others, critical thinking beyond emotions is necessary. 
I'm a very serious ""possibilist."" That's something I made up. It means someone who neither hopes without reason, nor fears without reason, someone who constantly resists the overdramatic worldview.
In a world more connected than ever, it's harmful to view each other through old and murky glasses. We often continue to regard the world wrong either because of the exciting news and messages we receive or the way we perceive the stories. The world is continually changing, and it is both bad and getting better at the same time. So, it is essential to develop a factful view of the world instead of a dramatic one. And Hans Rosling makes an excellent case for it in this book."

One of the main points which resonates with me is that the world has been improving in a significant way in certain areas which tend to be overlooked. It explores approachable ways in which to deconstruct simplistic ideas like 'rich and poor countries', it encourages critical thinking with simple advice like looking at distributions or making relevant comparisons when trying to make sense of data about the world. And it's got charts with clear labelling and titles and drawings and chapter summaries with bullet points and citations and references and all the things I love - it really is a masterpiece of pedagogy without becoming condescending or repetitive. If you're already familiar with global statistics, policies and initiatives, I still think it's worth the read as an example of presenting to a broad audience.

It’s always some shade of gray and it’s not monotone. Also averages are mostly meaningless, distribution is what matters.If only the world and local leaders would read this book and apply the methods in their work, we would make a lot less dumb decisions as societies and habitants of the Earth."

272,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3898791-udit-nair,5,"This book presents a refreshing approach to tackle things which confront humanity. It becomes a very essential read because most of us think that the world is a pathetic and miserable place to be in. But contrary to the popular notion we are placed much better than what it used to be maybe even few decades ago. Why one should read this one-1. The book is written in very simple and accessible manner. Though the author cautions everybody from seeing things in simplistic way but he does a great job in conveying his message through simplicity.2. The book challenges our misconceptions and hence it can become a source of introspection and hence progress.3. The book is indeed a great testimony of human progress achieved over years. It places great faith in humanity's ability to overcome problems. Now this faith is not based on wishful thinking but are backed by facts and figures. 4. Which leads me to next good thing about the book. That is the use of facts, statistics and all the bubbles. It is hard to deny the claim when stats are staring right into your ignorance. 5. The author has carefully identified the reasons for our misconception or ignorance. So hence he goes out to list the problems and he calls it the Instincts. Now this follows with solutions to tackle it. For eg he talks about the blame instinct. With corona crisis it becomes more evident. How countries and groups are hell bent on finding a scapegoat to pin the cause on it. Now the way to tackle this blame instinct is to look for causes and not villains. Its important to find the multiple causes which gave rise to pandemic rather than one nation, one group, one community, one action or one person. Same applies for if something good happens. Look for systems and not heroes.The things which I dont agree with the author-1. The very portrayal of grief and suffering in terms of numbers. I do agree that the world is a better place. But it doesn't help a person living in war torn places such as Syria or Yemen or Sudan to know that statistically conflict has decreased. For the individual or groups of people the reality of daily life is unimaginable. 2. The author contends that activists should not create an atmosphere of fear when confronting global challenges such as climate change. I completely disagree with this. Its because even after creating the fear there are leaders across the globe who even deny the threat and the numbers are large. Bureaucracy always reacts to a problem according to the intensity or the fear in the masses. And hence it becomes necessary that people are made aware about the existential threats specially when it comes to issues like climate change. 3. I am also of the opinion that certain amount of negativity is necessary to propel the systems and make it work. Because as we see around humans generally dont act until the threat is imminent or it affects them directly.Because otherwise its business as usual and this type of attitude can be disastrous if extended to ruling and political class."
273,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan,5,"Factfulness is yet another great book that everyone who lives in this world should read. And this is coming from a person who has been generally pessimistic about the world. It may appear dichotomous for me to 5-star this book which was supposed to be telling us that the world is better than we think it is, after doing the same to one which told about how humanity made a mess of everything in this world. In fact, it took me a while to pick up this well-lauded title because I was worried that it may paint an overly rosy picture about the world. However, my concern was unfounded. Factfulness did tell me that the world is not bad as I thought it to be, but it also emphasized that while some things are getting better, there remained big issues and risks out there that need to be addressed. And it is by getting facts right and in context that resources and efforts can be directed to fixing the root causes and real problems. Supplementing both Factfulness by Hans Rosling and Humans by Tom Phillips made one of the best and most insightful non-fiction reads I've had of late. Hans Rosling called himself a 'possibilist' - not a pessimist, nor an optimist. Throughout the book, he provided lots of personal experiences and anecdotes. Some of these I could tell were painful for him to recall and share, but it lent a whole lot of credibility to his writing.  There's a lot more to say as I reflect upon what I've gotten out of this book, but I believe that it's best for one to just read it. It is so well-written, well-presented and engaging that it makes for an easy and fairly quick read. This quote from the book pretty much summarised how Factfulness could make us and the world better. 
""I don't tell you not to worry. I tell you to worry about the right things. I don't tell you look away from the news or to ignore the activists' calls to action. I tell you to ignore the noise, but keep an eye on the big global risks. I don't tell you not to be afraid. I tell you to stay coolheaded and support the global collaborations we need to reduce these risks. Control your urgency instinct. Control all your dramatic instincts. Be less stressed by the imaginary problems of an overdramatic world, and more alert to the real problems and how to solve them.

How did the number of deaths per year from natural disasters change over the last hundred years?...
Only 10% of people scored better than random guessing on these questions, the most important trends of the last hundred years. How can it be that we are both 1) a rabidly overconfident species and 2) an extremely pessimistic species that generally gets these simple, objective questions very wrong (doing far worse than random)? Sure, we could just be dogmatic nihilists or idiots, but that doesn't fit that well. 
A stunning 15% of humans managed to pick the wrong answer on all twelve questions. That’s almost impossible for a monkey to achieve. It requires systematic misconceptions. The problem here is not the lack of correct knowledge. The problem is the presence of wrong “knowledge”. To score this bad requires a false perception of the world, that make you pick the wrong answer systematically.
Rosling explains it in terms of cognitive biases: we suffer from a 
dramatic
 worldview, binarised, conflict-obsessed, and blamey. People seem to find Development - the completely unprecedented explosion of survival, freedom, and dignity for the larger part of the entire world! - boring. (You could blame the media, but Rosling persuasively argues that they too are an epiphenomenon of our evolved fear and narrowness.)
Your most important challenge in developing a fact-based worldview is to realize that most of your firsthand experiences are from Level 4 [the top 10% of global income]; and that your secondhand experiences are filtered through the mass media, which loves nonrepresentative extraordinary events and shuns normality. When you live on Level 4, everyone on Levels 3, 2, and 1 can look equally poor, and the word poor can lose any specific meaning... Anyone who has looked down from the top of a tall building knows that it is difficult to assess from there the differences in height of the buildings nearer the ground. They all look kind of small... It is natural to miss the distinctions between the people with cars, the people with motorbikes and bicycles, the people with sandals, and the people with no shoes at all. 
On the shocking lack of empiricism even in the most important places like medicine and policy:
In the 1960s, the success of the recovery position inspired new public health advice, against most traditional practices, to put babies to sleep on their tummies... Even though the data showed that sudden infant deaths went up, not down, it wasn’t until 1985 that a group of pediatricians in Hong Kong actually suggested that the prone position might be the cause. Even then, doctors in Europe didn’t pay much attention. It took Swedish authorities another seven years to accept their mistake and reverse the policy...With my own hands, over a decade or so, I turned many babies from back to tummy to prevent suffocation and save lives. So did many other doctors and parents throughout Europe and the United States, until the advice was finally reversed, 18 months after the Hong Kong study was published. Thousands of babies died because of a sweeping generalization, including some during the months when the evidence was already available. 

Two hundred ninety-two brave young feminists had traveled to Stockholm from across the world to coordinate their struggle to improve women's access to education. But only 8 percent knew that 30-year-old women have spent on average only one year less in school than 30-year-old men.
Bad incentives and noble lies are another reason for the stubborn gloom of intellectuals:
There has been progress in human rights, animal protection, women's education, climate awareness, catastrophe relief, and many other areas where activists raise awareness by saying that things are getting worse.
Relentlessly sensible:
resist blaming any one individual or group of individuals for anything. Because the problem is that when we identify the bad guy, we are done thinking. And it’s almost always more complicated than that. It’s almost always about multiple interacting causes—a system. If you really want to change the world, you have to understand how it actually works and forget about punching anyone in the face. 
I've been studying Development for years and this still taught me plenty. It should shock you into awareness and hopefully more.
Paying too much attention to the individual visible victim rather than to the numbers can lead us to spend all our resources on a fraction of the problem, and therefore save many fewer lives. This principle applies anywhere we are prioritizing scarce resources. It is hard for people to talk about resources when it comes to saving lives, or prolonging or improving them Doing so is often taken for heartlessness. Yet so long as resources are not infinite—and they never are infinite—it is the most compassionate thing to do to use your brain and work out how to do the most good with what you have. 
One of the ""five books that represent my worldview"": moral passion, strict empiricism, psychological depth, existential hope. I picked this rather than Enlightenment Now or Rational Optimist or Doing Good Better or Our World In Data or Whole Earth Discipline (out of the contemporary literature of progress) because it also covers heuristics and biases - and so substitutes / complements Kahneman, Taleb, Hanson, and Yudkowsky, without (what people insist on seeing as) their self-superior wonkishness.

In a sense he stays on the surface - this isn't the full radical evolutionary account of 
Elephant in the Brain
, instead just noting some bad epistemic practices and gesturing at evolutionary theory. But that said, there's a ""charity is not about helping"" bit:
If I check the World Wildlife Fund I can see how, despite declines in some local populations, the total wild populations of tigers, giant pandas, and black rhinos have all increased over the past years. It was worth paying for all those pandas stickers on the doors all around Stockholm. Yet only 6% of the Swedish public knows that their support has had any effect.
But despite all the suffering and error and backfiring efforts he describes, he is trying to make you realise how good things could be:
Could everyone have a fact-based worldview one day? Big change is always difficult to imagine. But it is definitely possible, and I think it will happen, for two simple reasons. First: a fact-based worldview is more useful for navigating life, just like an accurate GPS is more useful for finding your way in the city. Second, and probably more important: a fact-based worldview is more comfortable. It creates less stress and hopelessness than the dramatic worldview, simply because the dramatic one is so negative and terrifying. When we have a fact-based worldview, we can see that the world is not as bad as it seems— and we can see what we have to do to keep making it better. 
This, then, is the same message as Sagan, 25 years ago: the emotional gain of reason. ---Misc notes- Binary categories are often unhelpful because they obscure continuum. Rosling ranted against ""developed"" / ""developing"" for 20 years. The World Bank has caught on but the UN haven't.- He is a better messenger for the cognitive bias alarm, for activists anyway, because of his deep credibility: he mucked in to anti-poverty measures for decades. Some of his anecdotes are chilling.
I could tell you countless stories of the nonsense I saw in Cuba: the local moonshine, a toxic fluorescent concoction brewed inside TV tubes using water, sugar, and babies’ poopy diapers to provide the yeast required for fermentation; the hotels that hadn’t planned for any guests and so had no food, a problem we solved by driving to an old people’s home and eating their leftovers from the standard adult food rations; my Cuban colleague who knew his children would be expelled from university if he sent a Christmas card to his cousin in Miami; the fact that I had to explain my research methods to Fidel Castro personally to get approval. I will restrain myself and just tell you why I was there and what I discovered.

I did the quiz with my husband and scored much better than him on most questions because I’d seen the TED talk. So if you don’t have time to read the book, watch the TED talk. But read the book. Hans then talks about how everyone gets the questions wrong, even experts. Why? Because we have a skewed, outdated world view. He then seeks to address this, starting with redefining our definition of the world from 2 categories of developed/developing countries to 4 income levels. Next he talks about 10 tendencies, or instincts, that we employ when judging/thinking about the world, and creating and consuming news and media. He talks about how these instincts help us and are necessary in some situations but are detrimental to learning about the world. And then he gives us tips on how to bypass these and make correct judgements. All of this is peppered with the most fascinating and engaging stories of his life as a trainee doctor in Sweden, a doctor in Africa with Médicin Sans Frontières and a Professor of health. Hans is a great story teller and you get the impression his whole life’s work has led to this moment, the creation of this book, a heap of knowledge and wisdom built up over decades and condensed into an extremely digestible, and highly readable, vital lesson on how to view the world and make good decisions. If you’re not familiar with Hans’ work I fully recommend checking out some of his videos on TED, YouTube or his own site gapminder.org. The book is so much more enjoyable if you can hear his voice in your head. Sadly Hans died last year. This book is an honourable legacy. "
282,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13369978-jana-light,4,"I really enjoyed this book. It reads quickly because of all the graphs, but it is packed with good data demonstrating that the world is better than we think it is. ""Bad, but better."" (My new favorite way to describe the world.) This is a wonderful manifesto for curiosity and letting facts drive our assessment of the world, rather than our limited and parochial world views.I kept thinking of Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow while I read. Kahneman tackles cognitive biases, Rosling tackles bad mental habits. Two books that should be read by everyone. (IMHO)I'll be honest -- I was a little turned off by ""him"" and his voice throughout. It felt a bit too cocky. However, I outright bawled at the postscript, so apparently his stories and anecdotes really generated a tenderness in me towards him. I felt this worth noting, because I don't tend to cry with these kinds of books over an affinity for the author himself/herself."
283,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10686638-jan,5,"Finally set aside time to read this in full and wow, it is really is a gem. Should be given out as a general handbook for understanding the world. It does not just break the myths we have from decades ago, but also brings a framework how to be in touch with the reality going forward.My main takeway: Stop the developing/developed countries nonsense, there are regions on the whole spectrum of income, use dollarstreet.org when trying to get an idea how a family on part of the spectrum lives.Also: gapminder.org/tools is a great explorative UI for various world metrics. For example, life expectancy versus total health expenses shows really well the fuckupedness of US health system."
284,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32012375-soophia-yaghoobi,0,"”Things can be both bad and better”; I think this is a key sentence of this book. “factfulness” is a book that tries to engage our attention to some of our dramatic instincts that cause misconceptions and an overdramatic worldview. As Rosling mentioned in the introdution part, this book is his last battle to fight devastating global ignorance, and his last attempt to change people ways of thinking, calm their irrational fears, and redirect their energies into constructive activities."
285,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4823153-bridget,5,I've realised that I didn't add this book. Which I loved. I read it at the beginning of the year and have been thinking about it ever since. Especially the very end where Hans talks about his greatest fear being a pandemic. Hmmmm. 
286,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27512341-m-nica-bq,3,"It is an indictment on my pettiness that I read this book and Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty for the sole purpose of debunking a point made by an acquaintance on Facebook.I wanted solid arguments for my answer and I got them xDI disagree on a fundamental level with this book. And not because I don't obviously know that we are a better world- a better society- now than say in the Middle Ages. Duh.It is because I'm against the notion that the fact that we've progressed could mean that we should stop seeking an even betterment of the world.I think the premise of this book is used as proof that we are good (not better) in the world and so no changes are necessary.Hans Rosling does present a hopeful panorama (and the book is pretty great) but I think he also presents a case for contentment. And I disagree with that."
287,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47154315-ian,4,"I would have liked to have spent a bit more time on this fairly new book, but alas the library had a huge waiting list of eager readers, so I could not renew it.There is good reason for the popularity and interest in Hans Rosling's book, which he worked on with his son and daughter in-law as a project that arouse from his lifetime of work as a public health official in Sweden.Rosling's thesis is that a huge majority of us cannot answer factual questions about the state of the modern world, which is apparently doing quite well in several important metrics. When it comes to questions such as, what percentage of women have 10 years or more of schooling, what is the average income in India, or what is the child-mortality of Bangladesh, most of us are sadly inaccurate and believe that the world still is what it was when we were taught in elementary school circa 1952. In fact, when he spends the early part of the book posing multiple-choice questions to the reader to show that the world is better off than ever in many measures, Rosling is rather fond of pointing out that even UN officials are typically less accurate in their responses to these questions than the random choices of a group of chimpanzees! Why?! How come our gut instincts are so outdated and false when it comes to the very world we live in?A big part of it is to do with just that, relying on our gut instincts. These tend to be set as the cognitive foundation by our elementary school projects from 30-50 years ago on the ""Third-World"", the news media's love of uniquely bad news (""if it doesn't bleed, it doesn't lead""), and our human tendencies of over-generalizing and being trapped in our own perspective.I think it important to point out that Rosling and his positive fact-finders are not simply some pollyannas saying that the world is just great and everything is getting better. He makes an effort to show that some things are indeed not getting better, such as the threat of climate change and the rise of political violence and terrorism in the last few decades. His purpose, however, is to rouse those of us living in the wealthier parts of the world to snap out of our old worldview and when presented with facts that seem ""unreal"" to actually look at the real data, to think critically about that data, and to ultimately realize that the world is changing in many ways for the better.Interestingly, I find that his advice also works well in this era of ""fake news"", where politicians can spout anything that seems to hold with an unsophisticated, uncritical worldview. Instead, if we again apply Rosling's tenets of looking up the true data, comparing numbers, thinking critically, and being aware of our own internal biases, we can tell which news is ""fake"" and which is not. A handy set of tools that truly can make the world better. Much better."
288,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/565673-nicholas-whyte,5,"https://nwhyte.livejournal.com/3142977.htmlI was a huge fan of the videos of Hans Rosling, who died in March 2017; and I write as one who generally hates vlogging (even though I have indulged in it myself occasionally). In Factfulness, the book he rushed to complete with his son and daughter-in-law when he learned he was dying, he calls on us all to engage critically with news stories and perceptions about the world - particularly about the state of humanity as a whole, most of all the developing economies. The concept of 'Factfulness', clearly intended as a close relative of mindfulness, is defined as :the stress-reducing habvit of only carrying opinions for which you have strong supporting facts.He repeatedly makes the effective point that most people - including the rich, privileged and well-informed - perform less well on a basic test about the state of the world than would a chimpanzee selecting answers at random.If I can boil it down, his first key message is that things are better than they were, but that should not deter us from making them better still. In particular, humanity is healthier, more prosperous, safer and more peaceful than it has ever been, and the greatest improvements have been made in countries which were desperately poor decades ago and have caught up since. BUT, his second key message is that news reports naturally concentrate on the drama of failure and crisis, so it's easy to get the impression that the world is going to hell; improvements are generally gradual (not always - there is the striking case of the recent decrease in birthrate in Iran, for instance, which of course received no international media coverage) while disasters, epidemics and wars fit the news cycle. HOWEVER, thirdly there is a real climate crisis, but we must be careful not to exaggerate it; the facts themselves are worrying enough, without resorting to worst-case scenarios or irrelevant issues (and he has plenty of cites for those).I find this all very attractive. If we are looking for a framework to push back against fake news, Rosling's fact-based approach is a very good place to start. but also, if we are trying to get to grips with crises (of which climate change is clearly the most drastic), it's very helpful to be able to point to the progress that has already been made as well as the further steps that are demanded. Certainly I find it easier to be motivated by the thought of building on previous good work than the notion of crusading against an inevitable fate. Strongly recommended."
289,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1910836-lobstergirl,3,"p. 149: ""Every pregnancy results in roughly two years of lost menstruation. If you are a manufacturer of menstrual pads, this is bad for business. So you ought to know about, and be so happy about, the drop in babies per woman across the world. You ought to know and be happy too about the growth in the number of educated women working away from home. Because these developments have created an exploding market for your products over the last few decades among billions of menstruating women now living on Levels 2 [income of $2-8/day] and 3 [income of $8-32/day].But, as I realized when I attended an internal meeting at one of the world's biggest manufacturers of sanitary wear, most Western manufacturers have completely missed this. Instead, when hunting for new customers they are often stuck dreaming up new needs among the 300 million menstruating women on Level 4 [income above $32/day]. ""What if we market an even thinner pad for bikinis? What about pads that are invisible, to wear Lycra? How about one pad for each kind of outfit, each situation, each sport? Special pads for mountain climbers!"" Ideally, all the pads are so small they need to be replaced several times a day. But like most rich consumer markets, the basic needs are already met, and producers fight in vain to create demand in ever-smaller segments.Meanwhile, on Levels 2 and 3, roughly 2 billion menstruating women have few alternatives to choose from. These women don't wear Lycra and won't spend money on ultrathin pads. They demand a low-cost pad that will be reliable throughout the day so they don't have to change it when they are out at work. And when they find a product they like, they will probably stick to that brand for their whole lives and recommend it to their daughters."""
290,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63307890-amy,1,"My favorite thing about this book is that this guy is a quirky sword swallower. Unfortunately, it truly ends there. Anyone that's taken a basic statistics course or a population dynamics course can approach this narrative with an appropriately critical eye. I think that these instincts/trends in human emotion and cognition are real, but his oversimplification of global issues is reductive and un-academic. I think that his arguments would have been much stronger if he had justified them with neurology literature which he is fully qualified to do as a clinician. I especially find fault with his depiction of emphasizing the urgency of climate change as “crying wolf.” I get what he’s saying. He’s trying to say that activists are trying to present the worst case scenario to generate action. Unfortunately, the information he uses contradicts that of leading climate scientists and is not indeed “fact” based. Likewise, his assertion that the link between climate change and migration is “very weak” is preposterous. This man is really comfortable spouting off a string of poorly formulated arguments. What he doesn’t discuss in much detail is that statistical analyses can be cherry picked to support arguments. Your argument can still be poor if you cite data. This is exactly what he has done, but with a grating hubris that his perspective is unquestionably empirical. He also takes a very long time to make each individual point due to his meandering style. I know this is part of the ""I'm writing like I talk"" style, but there's a reason why people like concision. I am honestly shocked that this book got such great reviews."
291,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7958239-elizabeth-theiss,4,"Factfulness is basically an information literacy text that takes a hard look at how humans misjudge numbers. I enjoy statistics and have a pretty good grasp of PhD level stats, so I was more interested in the kinds of misjudgments most people make. On this front, the book did not disappoint. Each chapter focuses on a different type of thinking error and covers the territory pretty well. As humans, we like simple explanations that put the blame on a concrete person or entity, even in the absence of conclusive data.The authors’ main point is, assume nothing. Gather data. Summarize it intelligently, then draw appropriate conclusions. As a retired academic, I hope I have largely managed to do this. But I noticed as I was reading the book that we do tend to jump to conclusions based on personal experience and limited data. The Iowa caucuses had a massive technology failure last night and results are as yet unavailable. The internet is rife with assumptions that the DNC was involved in a shadowy plot to undermine one candidate or another. This is hogwash but otherwise intelligent friends clearly believe it. The media doesn’t help as it reports on the technology problem as if it were a major scandal. This situation demonstrates many of the authors’ principles. Use data to make decisions. Don’t be swayed by provocative media coverage. Don’t scapegoat. And so on. I’d recommend this book for anyone with little statistical training who is interested in thinking about how to frame issues based on data."
292,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85511402-taro,1,"Rosling thinks that the statistical data he is using in the book are facts. Many of the data come from the IMF and from the world bank. I don't really think those capitalistic institutes provide really objective data. As Winston Churchill said: The only statistics you can trust are those you falsified yourself.The author claims that in Fukushima nobody died form radioactivity. People were dying from fear of radioactivity. The same claim about the pesticide DDT. Even worse he claims the Vietnam War was not that severe, the country had some longer wars in the history. These statements make me feel sad.One big mistake in this book is the use of the average income to declare the financial state of a country. If there is one rich billionaire living in this country, the average would increase dramatically. Rosling should better use the median income. That means the income, where 50% of the people earn more, and 50% earn less. The median is typically smaller than the average. The so-called facts of this book would look very different then ...The most annoying thing in the book is the use of an exponential scale in the income graphics. If Rosling used a linear scale, then most of the people would live in Level 1, only a few in Levels 2, 3 and 4. Details on this issue can be found in the Web, search for ""Factfulness: Building Gapminder Income Mountains"" of the Stockholm University."
293,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"This amazing book reminds me of Steven Pinker's wonderful book ""Enlightenment Now"". Hans tries to explain why the world is a much better place to live now than decades in the past. Most of us have a distorted view of the world and it's mainly because of our instinctive biases. According to Hans Rosling, the world is not divided in two. There's no gap between the rich and the poor. So maybe you'd better stop using the words ""developing"" and ""developed"". Human beings have a strong dramatic instinct toward binary thinking. A basic urge to divide things into two distinct groups, with nothing but an empty gap in between. We love to dichotomize: good vs. bad. Heroes vs. villains. My country vs. the rest. We are naturally drawn to extreme examples because they are easier to recall. We tend to notice the bad more than the good. That's why the majority of people think that the world is getting worse. We also have a fear instinct. When we are afraid, we do not see clearly. Critical thinking is always difficult, but it's almost impossible when we are scared. There's no room for facts when our minds are occupied by fear. This fear can distort our worldview. Fear that once helped keep our ancestors alive, today helps keep journalist's employed. We need to remember that things can be bad and getting better. "

The world cannot be understood without numbers. And it cannot be understood with numbers alone.
Factfulness is a great book that explains how our instincts sometimes distort our understanding of our world and why it's crucial to learn established facts that are now reliably and readily available. Our instincts might help in certain situations, but in others, critical thinking beyond emotions is necessary. 
I'm a very serious ""possibilist."" That's something I made up. It means someone who neither hopes without reason, nor fears without reason, someone who constantly resists the overdramatic worldview.
In a world more connected than ever, it's harmful to view each other through old and murky glasses. We often continue to regard the world wrong either because of the exciting news and messages we receive or the way we perceive the stories. The world is continually changing, and it is both bad and getting better at the same time. So, it is essential to develop a factful view of the world instead of a dramatic one. And Hans Rosling makes an excellent case for it in this book."
295,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5687484-ana,5,"I am actively recommending this book to a large number of people - that's how much I loved reading it! One of the main points which resonates with me is that the world has been improving in a significant way in certain areas which tend to be overlooked. It explores approachable ways in which to deconstruct simplistic ideas like 'rich and poor countries', it encourages critical thinking with simple advice like looking at distributions or making relevant comparisons when trying to make sense of data about the world. And it's got charts with clear labelling and titles and drawings and chapter summaries with bullet points and citations and references and all the things I love - it really is a masterpiece of pedagogy without becoming condescending or repetitive. If you're already familiar with global statistics, policies and initiatives, I still think it's worth the read as an example of presenting to a broad audience. Have I recommended this book to you yet?"
296,1473637465,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36137204-carl-rannaberg,4,"Definitely an important book which discusses how our worldview is distorted compared to the actual facts.This distortion happens through the combination of many factors: psychological biases, lack of systems thinking, sensationalistic and negative focus of media, inability to comprehend exponential growth, outdated school programs, half-life of facts etc.One of the key takeaways from this book is that the world is never black and white. It’s always some shade of gray and it’s not monotone. Also averages are mostly meaningless, distribution is what matters.If only the world and local leaders would read this book and apply the methods in their work, we would make a lot less dumb decisions as societies and habitants of the Earth."

I grew in South America; thus, I have a serious love-hate relationship with Médecins Sans Frontières, aka Doctors Without Borders, 2. I am a huge data nerd, and 3. I am smarter than a chimpanzee, at least according to Dr. Rosling's criteria. While this book does a very good job of emphasizing the importance of quality relevant data; it most definitely has its own agenda and tone that was hard to overlook. Nonetheless, I do agree that curiosity and humility are key ingredients to reduce the ignorance of the well-educated 4 level folks. "
