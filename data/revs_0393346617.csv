0,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,5,"2020 Update: Well, here we go, 2020 Covid pandemic. Don't say David Quammen didn't tell you so. And check out the comments below from 2016. Highlights:I thought the topic might give me heebie-jeebies, but it mostly didn't, except when it comes to traveling to China, Bangladesh or West Africa. Or working in a disease research lab.andI do think SARS was scary as a healthcare provider because it seemed to circumvent standard isolation and had a high fatality rate.David Quammen is prescient. He appears to have predicted the 2014 Ebola outbreak and ability to country jump years before it happened. Alright, maybe he isn’t a diviner; maybe he merely pays attention to the scientists around him. After all, there’s a reason he is has been given an Academy Award in Literature and is a three-time winner of the National Magazine Award. Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic explores the science behind human pandemics, and is a culmination of decades-long interest in animals, biology and travel. It is also an intelligent, thoughtful, and occasionally humorous book about the intersection between humans, disease, public health and the animal kingdom. ""Made no mistake; they are connected, these disease outbreaks coming one after another. And they are not simply happening to us; they represent the unintended results of things we are doing. The first crisis is ecological, the second is medical.""The writing is excellent and well-researched, with a list of citations for each chapter. While clearly well versed in biological concepts and the professional scientific field, Quammen writes with an eye to description, creating a liveliness in his stories. When I looked up his biography, it was with no real surprise that I learned he studied William Faulkner on a Rhodes scholarship–like Faulkner, he clearly has a deep love and respect for the natural world. The writing conveys complicated biological concepts in a way that captures the essence without oversimplifying, leaving both the novice and the more knowledgeable reader satisfied. If I have one complaint, it is that the humor present in his short stories isn’t as present; a fitting approach for the somberness of the subject, but I miss it nonetheless. Most of the humor here acknowledges journalistic license but a fair amount relates to the research process:""If you read the recent scientific literature of disease ecology, which is highly mathematical, and which I do not recommend unless you are deeply interested or troubled with insomnia, you find the basic reproduction rate everywhere.""What takes this book a step beyond the ordinary is that Quammen goes to where the science happens. Interviewing scientists in person, their anecdotes give the research the human touch, and are both instructive and amazing. I found myself deeply wishing my career had taken a different track–but I’m not courageous enough to be a field scientist. The scientists who are looking for the Ebola reservoir are particularly adventuresome: when they collect samples, they do their exploring in full haz-mat gear, including a personal respirator, which leads to interesting challenges. As Quammen summarizes: ""Wait a minute, lemme get this straight: You're in a cave in Uganda, surrounded by Marburg [virus] and rabies and black forest cobras, wading through a slurry of dead bats, getting hit in the face by live ones...the walls are alive with thirsty ticks, and you can hardly breathe, and you can hardly see, and... you've got time to be claustrophobic?''Uganda is not famous for its mine rescue teams,' [Amman] said.""Dude. Skydiving and cliff-jumping are for wimps. Trying being a field scientist studying disease.Just fantastic stuff. If you were ever in doubt about why to get an influenza shot, the information is right here. And why you should be very, very careful about what you eat, particularly game and bushmeat.**********************************************************Specific chapter summaries and key points continued at the blog--- just follow under the asteriskshttps://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2015/..."
1,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3427339-jeffrey-keeten,5,"”’Spillover’ is the term used by disease ecologists to denote the moment when a pathogen passes from members of one species, as host, into members of another.”
How does that happen?
”All it required was a mango or water apple tree, laden with ripe fruit, overhanging a pigsty. An infected bat feeds on a water apple, discarding the pulp, which is besmeared with virus; the pulp drops down among the pigs; one pig snarfs it up and gets a good dose of virus; the virus replicates in that pig and passes to others; soon the whole herd is infected and human handlers begin to fall sick.”Besmeared, doesn’t that give a visual?So what are we dealing with? ”A zoonosis is an animal infection transmissible to humans. There are more such diseases than you might expect. AIDS is one. Influenza is a whole category of others. Pondering them as a group tends to reaffirm the old Darwinian truth (the darkest of his truths, well known and persistently forgotten) that humanity is a kind of animal, inextricably connected with other animals: in origin and in descent, in sickness and in health. Pondering them individually provides a salubrious reminder that everything, including pestilence, comes from somewhere.”The thing that I keep thinking about is that coronavirus or Covid-19, because we need to give it a name to distinguish it from all the future coronavirus outbreaks, is just a dress rehearsal for a much bigger theatrical event. From what I’m hearing from health care officials, we are not well prepared. We don’t even have enough masks for health care workers. Did we think it was not going to come here? Did we think it was just a China thing and that air travel wasn’t going to drop it like a rotting fruit basket in every human inhabited region of the world? The symptoms are like getting a cold or the flu; by the time someone knows they have it, they may have infected hundreds of people. ”’Viruses have no locomotion,’ according to the eminent virologist Stephen S. Morse, ‘yet many of them have traveled around the world.’ They can’t run, they can’t walk, they can’t swim, they can’t crawl. They ride.”The problem with finding a cure is that Covid-19 is an animal infection that has spilled over to humans. Diseases, like polio, that originate in humans are easier to cure. If we eradicate it in humans through inoculations, it disappears. With viruses that spillover from other species, there is what is called a reserve host, such as bats, rats, pigs, or birds, that will incubate the virus, keep it alive, and mutate it. Eradication is impossible.David Quammen takes us around the world to all the hot spots or, as Richard Preston calls them, the hot zones. You want some vivid, scary writing about Ebola deaths? Pick up Preston’s book. Quammen was interested in traveling to these places to discover how hosting worked with diseases and the exhaustive, frustrating, investigative work that scientists have to do to find these reservoir host creatures. It is dangerous work where a pinprick can kill. So why are we such a juicy host for invasion by a virus? ”It’s not that they target us especially. It’s that we are so obtrusively, abundantly available. ‘If you look at the world from the point of view of a hungry virus,’ the historian William H. McNeill has noted, ‘or even a bacterium--we offer a magnificent feeding ground with all our billions of human bodies, where, in the recent past, there were only half as many people. In some 25 or 27 years, we have doubled in number. A marvelous target for any organism that can adapt itself to invading us.’”I might add, at the rate that we are killing off other species of wildlife, aren’t we forcing viruses to spillover to survive?Quammen provides another stark view of the growth of the human population. ”We are prodigious, we are unprecedented. We are phenomenal. No other primate has ever weighed upon the planet to anything like this degree. In ecological terms, we are almost paradoxical: large-bodied and long-lived but grotesquely abundant. We are the outbreak.”As I’ve said numerous times in other reviews, the greatest threat to human existence is overpopulation. We don’t need more people. In fact, we need fewer people. Job growth will not keep pace with population increases. We have more value when there are fewer of us. Not to mention, food production will struggle to keep up with rampant population growth, and fresh water will not be able to keep pace either. It makes me think about deer populations when I was growing up on a farm. Whenever they had an explosion in numbers that threatened the ecosystem, an infection would spring up and reduce their numbers. Is the cosmos, at some point, going to decide we need to be reduced? Quammen’s goal with this book is not to scare people, though he understands that will be a natural reaction to his knee-knocking, inspiring descriptions of the various virus outbreaks that have already happened. He wants us to feel informed, so that we will be more careful and respect the danger of these viruses. We have been lucky so far, and there is no other way to describe it. Combinations of scientists and doctors have reacted quickly to outbreaks around the world, but even they will say they aren’t sure how and why they were able to get ahead of the contagion. Quammen is among the number of scientists who are not wondering if a major pandemic will happen, but when. 
My takeaways from this read.
I will no longer be an exotic eater. Whenever I have traveled anywhere in the world, I’ve always been an adventurous eater. Quammen’s descriptions of the live, wild animal markets in China was more than enough to keep me from being curious about what a masked faced civet tastes like or porcupine or an exotic snake. The animals in these markets are treated horribly, and the unsanitary conditions create a perfect environment for producing a spillover. I am greatly reducing my plane travel. Not out of fear of contagion, but out of respect for the planet. I will say, though, that plane travel will be the modern conveyance that will be the carrier of our destruction. Planes can move people all over the world before they even know they are sick. Quammen mentions that scientists have received pressure to edit from their essays assertions about the dangers of a pandemic traveling by plane. We’ve seen it happen!!!  I will no longer shake people’s hands. I love the historical significance of what a handshake means. By presenting a naked hand, men were showing they were unarmed and meant no harm. Even without a pandemic, how many colds and flus are passed through a handshake? Maybe it is time to dispense with handshakes and replace it with a nod of the head. I certainly don’t want to be responsible for unintentionally making other people sick...potentially terminally sick. I like the energy of crowds, but as I’ve gotten older, I feel more uncomfortable in large groups of people, and so it will be no great loss for me to avoid crowded events. I will drive as little as possible. One of the reports in recent days that has made me smile was hearing about the clearing of pollution over cities where people have been asked to stay home. Think if we made a conscious effort, all the time, to reduce our driving time every week. Personally, I’m going to make an effort to condense my errands into one day and as brief an amount of time every week as I can. Let’s give the oil companies a cut in profits. Times like these are a good time for self-reflection. Quammen is a vivid and compelling writer who doesn’t indulge himself in hyperbole. He sticks with the facts and gives the reader context without glazing their eyes over. I learned about several viruses that I’ve never heard about and shivered whenever demon viruses I am very familiar with, like Ebola, SARS, or MERS, are mentioned. Oh, and he also mentions another virus. ”The team had electron microscope images of round viral particles, each particle encircled by a corona of knobs.” There’s the current devil we are dealing with. I want to close the review with an example of Quammen’s ability to make a reader feel like she has been there with his evocative writing. ”Before I knew it, I was helping Lisa Jones-Engel and Gregory Engel trap Macaque monkeys at a shrine in northeastern Bangladesh. We had come to a city called Sylhet, along the banks of the Surma River, an area where the Bangladesh lowlands begin to wrinkle up into hills. The hills rise northward into mountains, beyond which lie Assam, Bhutan, and Tibet. Sylhet is a district capital, home to a half million people and an indeterminate number of other primates. Its streets are flooded with traffic that somehow manages to move despite a near-total absence of stoplights. Hundreds of green motorbike taxis, powered by natural gas, and thousands of brightly decorated bicycle rickshaws, powered by long-suffering men with skinny brown legs, jockey for position alongside the bashed-up busses and creeping cars. In early morning, two-wheeled push carts also roll through the streets, moving vegetables to market. At the bigger intersections loom shopping complexes and upscale hotels behind gleaming glass. It’s a thriving city, one of the richest in this poor country, thanks much to investment and spending by emigrant families, with roots here, who have thrived in Great Britain. They often return home, or at least send money back. Many of the curry shops in London, a man told me, are run by expat Bangladeshis from Sylhet.”Be smart. Be respectful. Be safe.

2,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"Update At first I thought this book was so relevant to the present coronavirus pandemic crisis in the world, but it's not really as the one thing the book doesn't discuss is what if an animal illness - a bat one, as so many are - is modified or experimented on in a laboratory and it infects a person, who then is patient zero and infects the world? The laboratory connection is not mentioned at all, and therefore the book is not so prescient as many people think, unless you subscribe to the wet market theory.________________________This book is a very detailed look at zoonoses, diseases that cross from animals to people. If it hadn't been quite so detailed, it would have been a 10 star. What I have learned:1. There are three sorts of host. There is the reservoir host that the disease resides in and may or may not cause disease. Then there is the amplification host where if the original host infects it, or if a vector (like fleas that carry it) does, the disease-causing pathogen will multiply to very large numbers. Then there is us! We are often the final host. 2. The biggest natural reservoirs of zoonotic diseases are bats. Especially fruit bats and flying foxes. If you touched a rock that an infected bat did, ate some fruit one shit on, or got bit by the dog that the bat got first, you are at risk. Avoid bats at all cost. Very large numbers of vectors are fleas, mosquitos, flies, lice and ticks. Now it may seem like bats are more dangerous than other creatures because so many carry diseases but it's not necessarily so. 25% of all mammal species are bats, and it's not known if the y carry the same percentage of zoonoses as other mammal groups or if they really are uniquely dangerous. Bats breed and live in huge numbers and no one minds if they are caught and their blood sampled or even killed for necropsies. Doing that to, say, large numbers of lions, monkeys, elephants or other much-loved mammals is another issue entirely. But they might be as zoonotic pathogen-ridden as bats, we just don't know. So if you like bats (I do) they should be our friends from a distance.2. Lyme Disease. If you like rambling in the woods where this is present, choose a year when there haven't been many acorns and go to a big wood rather than a little copse. In little copses there may not be many mammals but there will probably be the white-footed mouse which is a reservoir of the disease. In a good acorn year it will breed like crazy, unchecked. In a bad acorn year, there will be less of them and in a big wood there are many predators for whom they are a major food source. Fleas breed on these mice who are not very good at grooming them away. They bite the deer as they need the blood to breed (much as mosquitos do on us), but are not really relevant in Lyme Disease as just one deer could supply enough blood for millions of ticks to suck on. It is keeping down the sweet little mice that keeps down Lyme Disease in an area.3. Zoonoses are in general pretty rare, there are only 150 known ones and they don't cause major epidemics these days although they do cause small, limited but extremely newsworthy outbreaks like Ebola, rabies and dengue. Bubonic plague, the Black Death, is a zoonotic disease that was perhaps the worst disease the world has ever faced. But these days, antibiotics cure it quickly.I've had dengue. There is no treatment for it and it isn't nicknamed bone break disease for nothing. I moved house with it. Easiest move in my life. I just lay there while all around me packed and moved, then they lifted the mattress into the van and transported me to my new house. By the time i was well enough to walk to the bathroom by myself, everything was spick and span. It was about ten days start to finish. Very nasty. Very interesting book, I had to skim bits at times because it was as detailed and repetitive as a text book although, mostly, considerably less dry. I learned a lot and for that it's definitely a 5 star read.____________Notes on reading the book. (view spoiler)[This is as good as The Boilerplate Rhino: Nature in the Eye of the Beholder, a book I read years ago. I'm learning a lot ab0ut zoonotic diseases, which are very common, and why, because the only host is the human, polio and smallpox could be wiped out. I love science books about subjects I know very little. I love writers that can make writing about science a page-turning experience.  (hide spoiler)]"
3,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,5,"I guess I won´t ever take a duck, bat, or cute little monkey as a pet after reading this book. Ok, the ape would be pretty illegal too. A similar question I kept continually asking myself while reading this: Could it once spread to pets like dogs and cats and back to humans again who infect a bird that infects a bat that is eaten by a wild dog who bites a human etc. Isn´t that an endless circle with possible catastrophes around each corner, even without human intervention such as antibiotic resistance, genetic engineering, and biological warfare? And what if the mutation rate of the viruses reaches a level that it gets impossible to develop vaccines, because their genetic code changes so quickly over a few months that there is no cure anymore or the get immune within weeks.It can´t be overemphasized enough that we know close to nothing, that no serious predictions are possible because:There are not just the already mutating RNA viruses around, but many we don´t know enough about and still have to do basic research.There are species we still haven´t discovered.Microorganisms interact, swap, infiltrate another and the ones successful are the winners of a hundreds of millions year long arms race and were able to adapt to ever more complex lifeforms, possibly enabling higher life. There are more and more interactions between primates, rodents, and other species and humans due to natural destruction and population growth.We don´t know how quickly viruses can evolve, jump from species to species, become less harmful or a killer for everyone, as each one infected could become the patient zero for a much deadlier version of the original virus. What if the person has HIV, tuberculosis, or hepatitis C and the virus combines its abilities with the ones of the chronic illness, let´s say the flu with AIDS?It´s Russian roulette to eat, and live next to, primates who share up to 97 to 98 percent of the same genome.We will (or already have been) be breeding hybrids and human ape chimeras.Many of the worst diseases such as Ebola, BSE, Bubonic plague, anthrax, AIDS, influenza, Hantavirus, leprosy, rabies, zika, and many others are zoonosis, such as SARS Cov-2, and as soon as they have spread widely enough in populations or even around the world, they will last forever. As each human is unique and RNA Viruses are really bad, there will always be reservoirs of hosts until the next winter is coming. It´s already enough to touch anything invisibly contaminated with any body fluid of a bat, monkey, or whatever. Human, of course, too.There are different stages with different hosts, be it animals or humans, getting sick or not getting sick, transmitting the disease.We are isolating ourselves more and more from nature, have more allergies, get sicker with all the civilization diseases and make ourselves much more vulnerable to new viruses, as our immune systems aren´t used to get in contact with dirt and germs anymore and the bacterias and viruses that survive are more hardcore.What happens if flying syringes, escaped lab animals, and all the genetically engineered crops and animals we have already left out into the world interact with the microflora, and the invisible monsters take interesting power ups we integrated to grow more meat and resistant plants for themselves?The incompetence of politicians and governments, especially in this really very important field, is shocking and would be as ridiculous as all they do to simulate doing anything, if it wouldn´t be so dangerous. They even aren´t able to follow plans that have been finetuned over decades for the case of a pandemic. It´s as if they were even too stupid to read simple instructions or hand them to one of their hundreds of assistants. The basic reproduction rate, virulence, case fatality rate, pathogenicity, and other factors are black swans, coincidences, nobody knows what will and can happen, it´s a question of good or bad luck if it gets deadlier or harmless, any person infected could be the starting point for a mutation to kill hundreds of millions. I didn´t realize how many terrible diseases came out of the animal kingdom, but now it makes perfect sense that a new land without police knowing the enemy is a dreamland for each new virus and a human has pretty many functions to mess with. That tropical countries are so overstuffed with potentially deadly dangers is one more of the reasons why I am a stay at home guy, I mean, if it doesn´t directly kill one, one could bring undetectable, new death home from the jungle without even recognizing it. Quammen didn´t directly predict the 2013 Ebolahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western...and 2020 Coronavirushttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2...epidemic, but he explained in detail that more and more people in an interconnected, globalized world in much contact with wild animals may lead to unforeseeable chain reactions. These scientists researching and studying outside in the field, taking the probes, working in biosafety level 4 labs, are so badass and courageous to provide the knowledge needed to find cures for these plagues that it´s hard to imagine how one normal person should do that. I would get so paranoid and nervous that it wouldn´t end well. The too specific biological aspects of the book can be skimmed and scanned if one isn´t into this kind of stuff, but the great and vivid style of telling the stories surrounding the facts will be terrifying for every reader. We are ourselves permanently breeding the next angel of death by adding genetic engineering, poisoning nature, developing more and more drugs and chemicals that are used in vast amounts without knowing the short, not even to speak of the long, time effects, antibiotic resistance, and biological warfare. They really tried to make ebolapox, as if diseases like AIDS or SARS weren´t horrible enough and it´s a question of a coincidence if the next big plague will be all natural, made by ignorance and involuntary bad luck coincidences, or by an oopsie in a secret military biohazard level 4 umbrella corporation lab with this song in the background.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L7mZ...Could be used for a black comedy scene too…Would also be quite an irony if the majority of the human population is wiped out in an attempt to find a cure for cancer or the path to immortality.Since the outbreak of SARS Cov-2, I am repeatedly thinking of the game Plague Inc.

4,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33771-tony,4,"You have to understand. I have my phobias. So it makes for awkward social encounters. Like: “Mommy,” said the little girl in the elevator, “Why is that man holding his breath the whole way down from the 16th floor?” I have been known to say things like, “Will you please stop sneezing in the direction of my beer?” I went to a doctor’s office a few years ago. Nothing ultimately serious, but possibly so, so that I went for the quickly scheduled appointment even though I was already nursing a bad cold. He wouldn’t have to touch my face, I safely predicted. It was a doctor I had never seen before, and after the usual 15-minute wait in solitary, he came in to the examination room with a game show-host smile and extended his hand, like, you know, we were soon to become new best friends. So I put up my hands defensively and said, “Sorry, but I have a cold and it’s better not to shake hands.” I figured, as a doctor, he would appreciate my candor and consideration for him and the many patients to follow. Well, he kept his hand out for a minute, as if I had slapped him, clearly thinking about what I had said. Then, with a busy officiousness, he strode to the sink and vigorously washed his hands with some anti-bacterial goo. This gave me pause. Why was he washing his hands after I declined shaking his hand and not before he offered it?I share this because the last thing I really need is to read a book about Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic. Like going to see an obvious Horror movie, I know I will be scared. Yet, we plunk down our money, watch the predictable script and wait for the creepy Pavlovian organ music to raise the hair on the back of our necks. So, scare me shitless, David Quammen. I gots to know.It is not until page 511 of this 520-page book that Quammen raises the question that he is often asked by those learning he is writing such a book: “Are we all gonna die?” And the answer is: Yes, we’re all gonna die. Yes. We are all gonna pay taxes and we are all gonna die. Most of us, though, will probably die of something more mundane than a new virus lately emerged from a duck or a chimpanzee or a bat.Most, but not all of us.This is a book about zoonosis, animal infections transmissible to humans. AIDS is one. Rabies. Ebola. Marburg. Influenza. Beware the animal reservoir. That would be the animal that ‘hosts’ the virus, safely unto itself, but potentially lethal when it jumps, when there’s a Spillover to humans. So don’t nosh on raw monkey or ape bushmeat, no matter how prized that delicacy is in the culture you’re visiting. Don’t place your pigsty under the mango tree. And don’t under any circumstances drink the palm sap. If you happen to crawl into an African cave, you know, for the experience of being underground with stale air, no natural light, thousands of bats peeing on you from above and a few cobras slinking through your feet, all without a biohazard suit, do not under any circumstances reach down for balance and touch the bat guano with your bare hand. Trust me, bad shit happens.I learned more reading this book than I did in two semesters of indifferently-attended college biology classes. Not that I can articulate the difference between microbiology and molecular biology, or other things unnecessary to get through the day. But how about this? Of all the mammals in the world – every dog, every deer, every kittycat – every freaking mammal, one in four is a bat. That’s: 1) a lot of bats ; and 2) a bad thing. Also, if you go to the Dominican Republic or some other exotic island and one of the locals comes along the beach to put a macaque on your head for a cute picture to send home to the family, resist the tourist urge. You may be bringing home something more than a Kodak moment.Quammen has found the right level of transmission to get these notions of science and math across to an idiot like me. And, even if I failed him, I was nevertheless entertained. Here is the way to start a chapter:In late February, 2003, SARS got on a plane in Hong Kong and went to Toronto. But soon we are learning more about bats, three species in particular carrying SARS-like virus: the big-eared horseshoe bat, the least horseshoe bat, and Pearson’s Horseshoe bat. Waxing smart-alecky, Quammen quips, “If you ever notice these animals on the menu of a restaurant in Southern China, you might want to choose the noodles instead. But I like smart-alecky. So I was scared, entertained and enlightened. Sometimes a single sentence would send me happily to both a dictionary and Google, such as this description of his first meeting with a researcher in Guangzhou: I suppose the durian should have been my first signal that he was a temerarious eater.One last, lingering piece of advice I will share:If your husband catches an ebolavirus, give him food and water and love and prayers but keep your distance, wait patiently, hope for the best—and, if he dies, don’t clean out his bowels by hand. Better to step back, blow a kiss, and burn the hut.Wise words. Which I pass along, like a reservoir host, as a public service."

Pondering them as a group tends to reaffirm the old Darwinian truth (the darkest of his truths, well known and persistently forgotten) that humanity IS a kind of animal, inextricably connected with other animals; in origin and in descent, in sickness and in health."" This is what David Quammen preaches in Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic. Some have already given him credit for predicting the recent Ebola outbreak. If this sounds unappealing, it's my fault. Quammen is a researcher who writes with style and substance. He isn't the type who stays in his cubicle reviewing journals and online information. He is out in the field with his buddies and compatriots giving us a front line perspective on this serious issue.To say this was an eye-opener for me probably understates its impact. I now think I know that every disease must have a reservoir. Smallpox basically resides in humans and is transmitted only among humans. Other diseases have either living or non-living reservoirs. Tetanus comes from a bacterium that resides in the soil. Cholera comes from a bacterium that resides in contaminated water. ""A disease must have a portal of exit from the reservoir and a portal of entry into the host. This is how diseases are spread and new cases of infection occur. Examples of portals of exit are respiratory, the digestive tract, urinary, skin,"" etc. ""Diseases can spread by three different, modes of transmission: contact transmission, vehicle transmission, and vector transmission."" Let's remember the title of this book. Quammen is focused on ""animal infections and the next human pandemic."" A pandemic is an epidemic of infectious disease that has spread through human populations across a large region; for instance multiple continents, or even worldwide.Quammen points out (and I am surprised as usual) that zoonosis isn't rare. In fact, ""about 60 percent of all human infectious diseases currently known either cross routinely or have recently crossed between other animals and us...Ebola...bubonic plague...Spanish influenza...bovine tuberculosis, Lyme disease, West Nile fever...rabies, hanta virus pulmonary syndrome, antharx""...etc.A lot of this book reads like a mystery. Some one or some thing has died unexpectedly and there is no immediate explanation for it. Quammen takes us along on these investigations. I came to like and respect this writer. He admires good science and points out with disdain efforts that fall short. His writing is intimate, filled with humor (often dark), and engaging. ""Most people aren't familiar with the word 'zoonotic,' but they have heard of SARS, they have heard of West Nile virus, they have heard of bird flu. They know someone who has suffered through Lyme disease and someone else who has died of AIDS. They have heard of Ebola, and they know that it's a very terrifying thing (though they may confuse it with E. coli, the bacterium that can kill you if you eat the wrong spinach). They are concerned. They are vaguely aware. But they don't have the time or the interest to consider a lot of scientific detail. I can say from experience that some people, if they hear you're writing a book about such things---about scary emerging diseases, about killer viruses, about pandemics---want you to cut to the chase. So they ask: 'Are we all gonna die?"" I have made it my little policy to say yes.""Quammen is on the lookout for the ""Next Big One."" Some say his discussion of Ebola gives him a lot of ""street cred."" He states that few disagree that that Next Big One will be zoonotic. So it behooves us to understand what he is talking about. It's a longish book, but you can get a lot out of a little at a time. I will leave you with a sample of how he passes on advice: "" If your husband catches an ebola virus, give him food and water and love and maybe prayers but keep your distance, wait patiently, hope for the best — and, if he dies, don’t clean out his bowels by hand. Better to step back, blow a kiss and burn the hut.”Given the reviews by my GR friends (including Greta, Max, carol, Jeanette, Hannah) and our current COVID-19 crisis, I thought a re-read would be beneficial. Was it ever! It was definitely worth reviewing zoonosis, pandemics, human behavior, and measures that can be taken. Quammen definitely deserves 5* ---and--- Do NOT Touch Your Face!"
7,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max,4,"Quamman explores zoonotic diseases, infectious diseases caused by pathogens that “spillover” from animals to man. The pathogen may be a virus, bacteria or parasite. Zoonotic diseases include well known ones like Ebola, Lyme disease, SARS, and AIDS, lesser known ones like Hendra virus, Marburg virus and Q fever, and ones just being recognized as zoonotic such as some forms of malaria. Zoonotic diseases require a reservoir animal, an animal that sustains the virus without serious complications. Reservoir animals feed a cycle of epidemics. The virus can be eliminated from all humans and still come back. Non-zoonotic infectious diseases like polio, smallpox and measles can be eradicated once the pathogen is eliminated from every human. Some non-zoonotic diseases may have originally jumped from an animal, for example measles from goats or sheep.Zoonotic diseases may require a vector like a mosquito. A pathogen may jump from a bat or monkey to a human and then from human to human. Or it may jump to an intermediate animal that reproduces it in large quantities sufficient to infect humans. The reservoir animals for the Hendra virus are fruit bats, which pass it to horses, which are “amplifier” animals that pass it to humans. Fruit bats are suspected as the reservoir animal for Ebola. Gorillas and chimpanzees are susceptible to Ebola just like humans and many thousands have died from it. Outbreaks in humans have been caused by eating infected gorilla and chimpanzee meat. It is important to consider the ecosystem of the animals and organisms involved in spreading infection. Lyme disease is a good example. Deer ticks infect humans and deer are often blamed as the reservoir but they are not. Adult ticks that feed off deer and humans fall off never to bite again. Both humans and deer are dead ends. They don’t spread the disease. Larval ticks feed off of small mammals such as shrews, chipmunks and particularly mice which are the reservoir animals for the Lyme disease bacterium. Larval ticks become infected from animals that have been bitten by infected nymphal ticks. To control the spread of the disease culling deer won’t work, the mice must be controlled, a near impossible task. The best way would be to encourage natural predators such as owls, foxes, weasels and the like. Unfortunately, woodlands today have been divided into ever smaller patches that don’t support these carnivores.Zoonotic pathogens can be parasites, bacteria, DNA viruses or RNA viruses. RNA viruses like the flu, West Nile, Hendra, HIV and Ebola can quickly mutate turning into new infectious agents. Flu viruses are especially prone to reassortment, a process in which viruses of different subtypes exchange components creating new subtypes. Thus we regularly see new versions of the flu. Retroviruses like HIV are particularly sinister. HIV uses the invaded cell to turn its RNA into DNA which it inserts into the host cell’s DNA, producing more viruses and replicating every time the cell divides. There are a dozen variants of HIV in humans and each is believed to be the result of a separate spillover. Thus the Simian virus, SIV, spills over regularly to the human virus, HIV. While only the main variant of HIV is responsible for most deaths, a new dangerous one could cross over anytime. In contrast DNA viruses such as herpes viruses (only some zoonotic) self-correct errors in replication and have larger genomes. They cannot mutate so quickly and must be persistent in order to sustain themselves. A great example is the chickenpox virus (not zoonotic) that infects children causing an itchy rash. The virus remains after the rash is gone and ramps up late in life causing shingles. Transmission methods for viruses and other pathogens include airborne, oral-fecal (water and food contamination), blood-borne, sexual, vertical (mother to child), or the bite of an animal. Modern animal husbandry densely packs large numbers of animals in close confinement. For example in the Netherlands dairy goats are housed in huge barns holding thousands of animals creating perfect conditions for the bacteria causing Q fever to grow. Q fever bacteria were spread everywhere when the infected manure was used to fertilize crops. When the fields dried out the wind picked up the loose soil. People downwind breathed in dust full of the highly contagious and lethal bacteria. SARS was spread in China from the markets that sold wild animals (some raised on farms) for food. The animals were crammed together and not cared for by the marketers. These conditions undermine their immune systems making it easier for the virus that had been held in check to spread. Another example is parrot fever carried particularly by parakeets and cockatoos that many breeders keep in close dirty confines allowing latent infections to erupt.Statistical analysis can reveal the requirements for an epidemic. There must be a critical mass, a sufficient number of susceptible individuals in sufficient density. Then a virulent pathogen will quickly spread. But those who die and those who recover (now immune) are no longer susceptible. When the number and density of those susceptible falls too low the epidemic is over until the susceptible population is replenished, an endless cycle. Concentration and number of pathogens and their infection rate also have required parameters, different for each disease. A good analysis of these factors can predict which measures to control the outbreak will work and which won’t.Quammen’s book consists largely of descriptions of outbreaks, each crafted as a detective story. People get sick, die and nobody understands it. Tenacious doctors, veterinarians and scientists come to investigate. Some work in labs identifying the pathogen. Others track the associations of the victims. Still others figure where to look for animal hosts, collect samples and get them to the labs. Quammen embellishes these stories with frightening descriptions of the disease spread and the victim’s plight. He details the many hurdles the investigators must overcome. Their aim is prevention. Too often there is little that can be done for the victims. After typically years of work and false leads they identify the reservoir animal and the means of transmission. It is a repetitive story and one doomed to repeat time and again.As human population expands and encroaches on natural environments and as wild species adapt to human presence and expand into human habitat, we will see evermore spillover. The increasing number and density of both people and the animals they eat favor the spread of zoonotic diseases. Poor countries with limited resources are particularly prone to epidemics. Wherever disease breaks out, modern day frequent travel and extensive global supply chains can quickly spread it to distant locations. Quammen expresses particular concern about the flu virus given its ability to reassort potentially mixing highly infectious and lethal subtypes. But whether flu, HIV or something new we can be sure we will be facing many more epidemics. The good news is that modern science gives us many tools to contain these outbreaks. However, the current wave of science bashing, nationalism, politicizing and underfunding government agencies is troubling. We need the institutions defending us against communicable diseases such as the CDC and its counterparts to have the resources, science based direction and international cooperation that are essential to be vigilant and responsive."

He is also guilty of not meeting required minimum standards of veterinary care, and negligence. He doesn’t carry out surgery in a sterile environment, wear surgical gloves, a gown, a mask, and a cap during surgery. I watched a few episodes and was appalled by what I saw, for instance during an assisted calving. He was probing with his bare arms in a cow’s birth canal, without gloves and without disinfecting either the cow or his arms. No disinfecting afterwards either; the farmer’s water well will do. How in the world is this man getting away with this stuff, and become a TV star at that. The next time there’s a virus outbreak in Michigan, scientists at least know where to look for patient zero and the superspreader alike.(Review in progress)"
9,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,5,"One does not need to be a science wiz to understand or enjoy this book. Author David Quamman spills the beans on how disease spreads. The original emergence of the virus ‘Hendra’, didn’t seem very dire or newsworthy unless you happened to live in eastern Australia. In September 1994, a violent distress erupted among horses in a suburb at the north fringe of Brisbane. The place itself is called Hendra.... a quiet neighborhood filled with racecourses, racing people, weatherboard houses whose backyard had been converted to stables, newstands that sold tip sheets, corner café’s with names like ‘The Feed Bin’.  “The first victim was a bay mare named Drama Series, retired from racing and now heavily in foal—that is, pregnant and well along”. “A zoonosis is an animal infection transmissible to humans”. There was nothing dramatically wrong with Drama Series— but she had gotten sick. Her trainer was named Vic Rail...a shrewd and forcefully charming man. Vic had a reputation for being ‘tough as nails’ in the local racing world. Some people resented Vic Rail, but no one denied he knew horses. Just before Drama Series died, ( temperature had been high, heart rate was high, there was facial swelling, and a frothy discharge from her nostrils), a veterinarian named Peter Reid didn’t perform a necropsy because Vic Rail couldn’t afford it and because nobody forced saw a disease emergency which every bit of data would’ve been crucial. The cause of her death remained uncertain. Then, 12 more animals died within the next several days, ( thrashing and gasping), “either expiring horrifically or euthanized”. Reid later said....”the speed with which it went through those forces with unbelievable, but in these early moments no one had identified ‘it’”. What was causing the mayhem? How was it spreading from one horse to another? It was a very traumati time treating and trying to help the suffering animals with antibiotics, fluids, and anti-shock medicines. Meanwhile, Vic Rail became sick. So had one of the other stable helpers. It seemed like they each had a touch of a bad flu. Vic Rail died. An autopsy showed that his lungs were full of blood, other fluids, andsome sort of virus. The other stable hand, named Ray Unwin, after a fever and flu symptoms, he recovered and survived. As the horse deaths came to crescendo, the government ofQueensland had intervened, in the form of veterinarians and other personnel from the Department of Primary Industries (responsible for livestock, wildlife, and agriculture throughout the state). The DPI veterinarians began doing necropsies. They found the virus. It was something new -something never seen before but whichfrom its size and its shape, resembled members of a particular virus group: the paramyxoviruses. Around the same time, researchers tested is sample tissue from Vic Rail’s kidney during his autopsy. That sample also yielded and identical virus from the horses — confirming that this equine morbillivirus didn’t afflict only equines. The details and descriptions of how zoonotic pathogens afflict humans was written for mainstream every day people ( non scientists), to easily understand. 🦇🐴 🦜😊 “Nearly all zoonotic diseases result from infection by one of six kinds of pathogen: viruses, bacteria, fungi, protists, (a group of small complex creatures such as amoebae, formally misleadingly known as protozoans), prions, and worms”. In time it was learned that molecular tracks of Hendra virus had been exposed long before it struck Vic Rail’s horses. Two years later after the Rail outbreak, a flying fox tested positive for antibodies, making it possible for the first isolation of Hendra virus from a bat. The identification of flying foxes as reservoir hosts, plus the high levels of seroprevalence, caused public-image trouble for A group of animals that had a legacy of such trouble already. Approval ratings for bats were never high- and with the new information in Australia they weren’t even lower. There seem to be a lot of mystifying concerns around the bat-human relationship-There was much they didn’t know about the nature of the virus....other than they knew it was very contagious, making livestock ill.  “An amplifier host is a creature in which a virus or other pathogen replicates— and from which it spews—with extraordinary abundance”.  “Spillover is the term used by disease ecologists (it has a different use for economists)to denote the moment when pathogen passes from members of one species, as host, into members of another. It’s a focused event. Hendra virus spilled over into Drama series ( from bats) and then into Vic Rail (from horses) in September 1994”. Reading this book greatly helped me understand COV19, coronaviruses.... and how the viruses transfer from animals to humans. This physical science and biology, where is easy to understand. Thank you, David Quamman!!David has a funny bone too. This book is as entertaining as it is informative. Vegans: I applaud you!! Thank you for your contributions to our planet. This book didn’t scare me: it made me more aware!!!I leave you with a song —-(it kept ‘speaking/singing’ to me while reading this book).

In this case, the Chinese peasant farmers literally live with their animals which are carriers of these exotic viruses that they are immune to, but pass on to humans who are not immune. The viruses incubate and mutate in the humans and are transmittable to other humans. Apparently this new one, Covid-19, is easily transmittable, but it's different enough from others we have seen that it takes awhile to figure it out. Old remedies and vaccines don't work. Our increased trade and business with China in recent decades has meant that numerous potential carriers from the U.S. are constantly flying back and forth and bringing the virus to our shores. It's no surprise that the West Coast has the most cases.===========I'm a doctor's kid. My father told me more than once that when he was 10 years old (1927) he read a book titled ""Microbe Hunters"" by Paul de Kruif that inspired him to become a medical doctor. In spite of the Great Depression and WW II, he achieved his goal. Another book he passed on to me was ""Rats, Lice, and History"" by Hans Zinsser. I did not become an MD myself, but have retained my father's interest in epidemiology (which also extends to an interest in genetics and cancer).The author quotes Zinsser....“Here, as in bacterial disease, there is a lively interchange of parasites between man and the animal world.” Zinsser was a panoramic thinker as well as an acutely trained microbiologist. Eight decades ago he sensed that viruses, only lately discovered, might be among the most nefarious of zoonoses.""Among zoonotic diseases are monkeypox, bovine tuberculosis, Lyme disease, West Nile fever, Marburg virus disease, rabies, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, anthrax, Lassa fever, Rift Valley fever, ocular larva migrans, scrub typhus, Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, Kyasanur forest disease, and a strange new affliction called Nipah encephalitis, which has killed pigs and pig farmers in Malaysia.This form of interspecies leap is common, not rare; about 60 percent of all human infectious diseases currently known either cross routinely or have recently crossed between other animals and us. Ecological disturbance causes such diseases to emerge. Such was the case with gold miners in Gabon (and their families— these camps were essentially villages) by their very presence, their needs for food, shelter, and fuel, had caused disturbance to the forest canopy and the creatures that lived in it. The miners ate Ebola-infected chimpanzees and gorillas and spread the disease to other humans. =========When and where did it start, this modern era of emerging zoonotic diseases? A good candidate would be the emergence of Machupo virus among Bolivian villagers between 1959 and 1963. Symptoms included fever and chills, nausea and vomiting, body aches, nosebleeds, and bleeding gums. It became known as El Tifu Negro (the Black Typhus, for the color of vomit and stool).If you assembled a short list of the highlights and high anxieties of that saga within recent decades, it could include not just Machupo but also Marburg (1967), Lassa (1969), Ebola (1976), HIV-1 (inferred in 1981, first isolated in 1983), HIV-2 (1986), Sin Nombre (1993), Hendra (1994), avian flu (1997), Nipah (1998), West Nile (1999), and SARS (2003). Swine flu-H1N1 (2009) did not prove as deadly as feared.A person might construe this list as a sequence of dire but unrelated events— independent misfortunes that have happened to us, to humans, for one unfathomable reason and another. Seen that way, Machupo and the HIVs and SARS and the others are “acts of God” in in the figurative (or literal) sense, grievous mishaps of a kind with earthquakes and volcanic eruptions and meteor impacts, which can be lamented and ameliorated but not avoided. That’s a passive, almost stoical way of viewing them. It’s also the wrong way.Make no mistake, they are connected, these disease outbreaks coming one after another. And they are not simply happening to us; they represent the unintended results of things we are doing. Human-caused ecological pressures and disruptions are bringing animal pathogens ever more into contact with human populations, while human technology and behavior are spreading those pathogens ever more widely and quickly.Students of virology now speak of the “virosphere,” a vast realm of organisms that probably dwarfs every other group. Now the disruption of natural ecosystems seems more and more to be unloosing such microbes into a wider world. Many viruses, for instance, inhabit the forests of Central Africa, each parasitic upon a kind of bacterium or animal or fungus or protist or plant. Viruses can only replicate inside the living cells of some other organism. Commonly they inhabit one kind of animal or plant, with whom their relations are intimate, ancient, and often (but not always) commensal. That is to say, dependent but benign. But now the disruption of natural ecosystems seems more and more to be unloosing such microbes into a wider world.Viruses, especially those of a certain sort— those whose genomes consist of RNA rather than DNA, leaving them more prone to mutation— are highly and rapidly adaptive. All these factors have yielded not just novel infections and dramatic little outbreaks, but also new epidemics and pandemics.================Here's how the coronavirus can spread exponentially---namely how one person infecting another can multiply out of control----at a much faster rate than what the expert here calls the ""normal flu"".....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg7Rn...==================""If you’re a thriving population, living at high density but exposed to new bugs, it’s just a matter of time until the Next Big One (NBO) arrives.""Examples of NBO from the book....AIDS: about 30 million deaths, 34 million living people now infected, with no end in sight.Polio in America The 1918–1919 influenza--the first H1N1 pandemic--""which had its ultimate source in a wild aquatic bird and, after passing through some combination of domesticated animals (a duck in southern China, a sow in Iowa?) emerged to kill as many as 50 million people before receding into obscurity.""Smallpox in the Americas arriving from Spain in 1520The Black Death: 1347-1352, killing 30% of the people who lived in Europe (attributable to bubonic plague)==========="

Laurie Garret - The Coming Plague, Richard Preston - The Hot Zone, Randy Shilts - And the Band Played On... the list goes on and on. I love this stuff. But having said that, this is truly the best thing I've ever read on the subject of infectious agents spilling over from their host species into humans. Brilliant, readable and absolutely spell-binding, Quammen's description of mutation, illness and the effect of human encroachment into different environments turns science into art. Without a doubt this guy knows his stuff and how to write about it. Highly recommended!"
12,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8421076-linda,5,"Disclamer: I received this book from the Goodreads First Reads Giveaway program.I'm very grateful that I did. I happen to be a physician, specializing in Public Health and Preventive Medicine. I work in an environment where epidemiology underlies everything I do. Therefore, I feel that I can give an especially educated evaluation of this book.The first thing I would like to comment on is the cover. It's an eye-catching blurred photograph of a screaming mandrill. Everywhere I carried the book (which is everywhere at work; I could not put it down) people looked at it and asked me what I was reading. Beautiful and suitable, the artwork sets the stage for the gripping narratives contained within.This is a book written for the intellectually curious. Quammen, as a journalist, understands that some of the material covered in this book can be esoteric for those not trained in the subject. He explains complex subjects clearly, and this is the important part, does not condescend or dumb it down. This makes the content accessible to everyone who may be interested, and the material is fascinating.As a public health physician, I thought I was fairly well-informed on the subject of zoonoses. I was delighted to find that this book is chock full of new, up-to-date information, and I had never even heard of some of the diseases he discussed. For example, I had though the reservoir for SARS was the civet cat. I had no idea that it was...well, you have to read the book. This book is as gripping and suspenseful as any thriller or mystery, and more terrifying, to boot, since this is non-fiction. As I am typing this, Hanta virus is affecting visitors to Yosemite National Park, Ebola is breaking out in Uganda and The Congo, and who knows what other mystery illnesses have yet to be identified and are lurking for the opportunity to breakout into the greater population. David Quammen has a delightfully sardonic sense of humor, and as he spins his tales, backed with a tremendous amount of field work on his part, one feels as if they are right there in the field with him and the researchers collecting bat piss (yes, really) or strolling the Hong Kong markets, or munching on Bamboo Rat hot-pot (apparently mild and sweet, quite tasty).I found myself reading the book like a good, no, excellent, novel. Normally with non-fiction, I pick it up and put it down in spurts. This book is so engrossing, though, that I found myself even walking down the street from the train station to work while reading this (a substantial hardcover, mind you). Quite a few of my co-workers want to read it, particularly the epidemiologists and physicians, but please don't hold back if you haven't got the background. This book is written so as to be accessible to anyone who has the interest. Everyone should be interested. The next big outbreak is inevitable because of human manipulation of climate, habitat and overcrowded conditions and intrusions into the wild, bringing us more and more in contact with potential pathogens. This book is a sobering look at the changing conditions in the world and how they leave us very, very vulnerable. This is easily the most frightening book I have read in a long, long time. Thank you, David for the work of love that produced this.Note for Goodreads: the page count is wrong; please correct it. The correct page number is 520 pages of text, plus a long reference section."
13,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,5,"A ""spillover"" occurs when a microbe crosses over from an animal to humans, as an infectious disease. David Quammen describes many examples of this: SARS, ebola, HIV, influenza, marburg and hendra.Each chapter is a detective story--scientists, veterinarians and medical researchers are detectives searching for the source of a disease. The source is usually a reservoir--an animal that carries the microbe, but is not usually harmed by the microbe. And--now here's the best part--Quammen is not a stay-at-home researcher. He visits the scientists and interviews them over extended periods of time. And better yet--he accompanies scientists on research expeditions all over the world, in search of the reservoirs for terrible diseases. Quammen describes, in detail, what it is like to hunt for elusive viruses in bats, chimpanzees, monkeys, and horses. Often, the researchers must take special precautions to avoid being infected themselves. Sometimes these precautions fail, with awful consequences.Quammen investigates why spillovers occur when and where they do. It's a combination of ecology and evolution. A microbe is carried by an animal reservoir, and usually in equilibrium where the animal is unharmed. Then, some dramatic change to the environment occurs, usually it is caused by humans impinging on the local ecology. The microbe mutates and jumps either to a vector (like a mosquito or a rat) or directly to a human. Further mutations then allow the microbe to jump from one human to another, causing an epidemic.Researchers agree that in the future, there will be lethal epidemics like AIDS and the influenza pandemic of 1918. Such epidemics are totally unpredictable, because of the diversity of human behavior.David Quammen is an excellent writer--he has a wonderful style. It is obvious from his enthusiasm and from his extensive travels, that this book represents his life-long efforts. Spillover is a sequence of detective mysteries and adventure stories, all rolled up into one. I highly recommend it!"
14,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3125810-james,5,"Might be beating a dead horse—or preferably not, considering the horse-borne Hendra virus that kickstarts this book—to sing my praises now for Quammen’s masterwork. An investigation into zoonoses (i.e., animals’ diseases that jump into humans), hitting all the big names from bloody Ebola to body-ravaging HIV and AIDS, Spillover also prioritises the narrative impulse over the encyclopedic, laying down each disease’s fascinating story but moreover tying them all together into a larger and frankly terrifying picture of what might await us as we encroach on more of the natural world and then encounter the wrong bat; and makes it all so damn readable as a result. Little surprise there as Quammen, who makes no secret his love for Faulkner, is conscious of and clearly here practices good writing. Particularly choice bit: when Quammen, though respectful (""I don’t like criticizing a colleague""), nevertheless low-key savages The Hot Zone for exaggerating Ebola’s symptoms to great if altogether disingenuous effect. Spillover is necessarily infused towards the end with a heavy note of uncertainty, so long as the Next Big (Final?) One remains still at large. But Quammen everywhere writes driven by a strong sense of certainty and, with his impressive fieldwork, awesome authority."
15,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,5,"I find solace in knowledge. In research. In science.In realizing (again) that history is a teacher.Reading a book about pandemics during a pandemic might not work for everyone, but I find comfort in realizing that shit has happened many many times before and it will happen again and again.I like to remember that we, as humans, are animals, and no matter what we do, we are not infallible.Our own hubris is and always will be our biggest downfall.I like to remember that science and research can save lives and change history.I read David Quammen's SPILLOVER: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic, a 500+ page book in a few short days because:1) It is great writing and hard to put down2) I've got the time as work is a slow trickle now3) I craved those reminders, stated above.Quammen is a first-rate researcher and writer, the book details the emergence and spillover of zoonotic diseases that cross from non-human animals to human animals, many I've heard of, and some I hadn't.The book opens with a detailed history or the Hendra virus, which attacks both horses and humans that was first studied in Australia in the 90s. Through forensics, and many many samples, this virus, and many other recent viruses have been traced to various species of bats (SARS, Marburg, Ebola, and now COVID-19). Quammen and some bat biologists speculate why these mammals, an ancient and highly diversified group, are the reservoir host for so many viruses. These chapters were amongst my favorite in the book - highly informative and highly readable.Written in 2012, but pertinent in this very moment, as we're all quarantined in our homes."
16,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6601778-parker-f,3,"This book was an exciting and informative tour of zoonotic diseases, but the fragmented style diminished my enjoyment. Quammen practices an annoying form of gonzo journalism in which he needlessly inserts himself into the narrative because he is too lazy to do otherwise. There are numerous throwaway chapters that are included for no other reason than because Quammen made a trip or did the interview. For instance, many pages are devoted to the unenlightening tale of a scientist who accidentally pricks herself with an Ebola-carrying needle. We learn of this woman's childhood, educational background, family life, the cleanliness of her home, etc. We learn of the boredom of her long quarantine and how she and her friends shared unfunny jokes via email about how her quarantine diet is high calorie. One may think that Quammen is building up to some sort of cliffhanger in which this poor woman ends up showing Ebola symptoms, but it is clear from the start (as he describes his visit to her house and the interview) that this didn't happen. This whole ordeal could have been omitted or replaced with one sentence, but Quammen must feel that every interview he conducts deserves many pages of text. (After a few minutes of reflection, I now realize the author's intent with this Ebola-quarantine section. He is de-sensationalizing Ebola by telling a tale of potential laboratory-borne infection completely lacking any excitement or exploding bodies, in stark contrast to THE HOT ZONE.)While these aren't direct quotes, the book is strewn with needless editorializing along the lines of ""I think the guy who first discovered the cause of malaria is one cool dude,"" and there are way too many one word sentences like ""Boring"" or ""Neato."" Seriously. Worst of all, near the end of the book Quammen takes a novelistic turn and tells an entirely fictional account of a patient zero carrying AIDS from the jungle of central Africa into the city. While this perhaps is demonstrating a plausible scenario for the first cases of human to human transmission of the virus, the level of trivial detail is infuriating. Should we applaud Quammen for so humanizing his fictional character and eagerly await the publication of his first novel? Or should we be upset that so many pages of a 700 page book are wasted on an Introduction-to-Creative-Writing-quality novella? Nonetheless, most of the book is enthralling. But I dread the approaching day in which all journalistic nonfiction will be told in this short-attention-span, MTV-News-inspired format. "

18,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,5,"This exposé of zoonoses (diseases passed from animals to humans) is top-notch scientific journalism: pacey, well-structured and entirely gripping. Although it’s a rather sobering topic, this is not scare-mongering for the sake of it; indeed, Quammen frankly concludes that we are much more likely to die of heart disease or fatal car crashes: “Yes, we are all gonna die. Yes. We are all gonna pay taxes and we are all gonna die. Most of us, though, will probably die of something much more mundane than a new virus lately emerged from a duck or a chimpanzee or a bat.” Still, you can’t help but wonder: what will be the next major pandemic? When, where and how will it happen; how severe could it be?"

Parts of it read as a detective story, as the author describes the quest to identify pathogens, and the routes that can lead those pathogens to cause human disease. The approach encompasses the ecological as well as the evolutionary factors that lead to zoonotic diseases.As I read, I took copious quotes from every chapter. As David Quammen says it much better than I can, I am going to copy some of them here. I will use spoiler tags for my summary notes about what the reservoir host etc. are for viruses, so if you want to read it for yourself, it will come as a surprise. The passages in italics are tidbits that show the author’s sometimes sarcastic humour which made the book even more enjoyable.I Pale Horse (Hendra virus) (view spoiler)[Australia, fruit bat as reservoir, horse as amplifier (hide spoiler)]A zoonosis is an animal infection transmissible to humans. There are more such diseases than you might expect. AIDS is one. Influenza is a whole category of others...This form of interspecies leap is common, not rare; about 60 percent of all human infectious diseases currently known either cross routinely or have recently crossed between other animals and us.Human-caused ecological pressures and disruptions are bringing animal pathogens ever more into contact with human populations, while human technology and behavior are spreading those pathogens ever more widely and quickly.II Thirteen Gorillas (Ebola) (view spoiler)[unknown reservoir, gorillas and chimpanzees affected (hide spoiler)]Like other zoonotic viruses, ebolaviruses have probably adapted to living tranquilly within their reservoir (or reservoirs), replicating steadily but not abundantly and causing little or no trouble. Spilling over into humans, they encounter a new environment, a new set of circumstances, often causing fatal devastation. And one human can infect another, through direct contact with bodily fluids or other sources of virus. But the chain of ebolavirus infection, at least so far, has never continued through many successive cases, great distances, or long stretches of time. Some scientists use the term “dead-end host,” as distinct from “reservoir host,” to describe humanity’s role in the lives and adventures of ebolaviruses.Advisory: If your husband catches an ebolavirus, give him food and water and love and maybe prayers but keep your distance, wait patiently, hope for the best—and, if he dies, don’t clean out his bowels by hand. Better to step back, blow a kiss, and burn the hut.III Everything Comes from Somewhere (Malaria)Hamer was especially interested in why diseases such as influenza, diphtheria, and measles seem to mount into major outbreaks in a cyclical pattern—rising to a high case count, fading away, rising again after a certain interval of time. What seemed curious was that the interval between outbreaks remained, for a given disease, so constant. The logic of such cycles, Hamer suspected, was that an outbreak declined whenever there weren’t enough susceptible (nonimmune) people left in the population to fuel it, and that another outbreak began as soon as new births had supplied a sufficient number of new victims. Furthermore, it wasn’t the sheer number of susceptible individuals that was crucial, but the density of susceptibles multiplied by the density of infectious people. In other words, contact between those two groups is what mattered.The four (kinds of malaria) known for targeting humans are transmitted from person to person by Anopheles mosquitoes. These four parasites possess wondrously complicated life histories, encompassing multiple metamorphoses and different forms in series: an asexual stage known as the sporozoite, which enters the human skin during a mosquito bite and migrates to the human liver; another asexual stage known as the merozoite, which emerges from the liver and reproduces in red blood cells; a stage known as the trophozoite, feeding and growing inside the blood cells, each of which fattens as a schizont and then bursts, releasing more merozoites to further multiply in the blood, and causing a spike of fever; a sexual stage known as the gametocyte, differentiated into male and female versions, which emerge from a later round of infected red blood cells, enter the bloodstream en masse, and are taken up within a blood meal by the next mosquito; a fertilized sexual stage known as the ookinete, which lodges in the gut lining of the mosquito, each ookinete ripening into a sort of egg sac filled with sporozoites; and then come the sporozoites again, bursting out of the egg sac and migrating to the mosquito’s salivary glands, where they lurk, ready to surge down the mosquito’s proboscis into another host. If you’ve followed all that, at a quick reading, you have a future in biology.This elaborate concatenation of life-forms and sequential strategies is highly adaptive and, so far as mosquitoes and hosts are concerned, difficult to resist. It shows evolution’s power, over great lengths of time, to produce structures, tactics, and transformations of majestic intricacy. Alternatively, anyone who favors Intelligent Design in lieu of evolution might pause to wonder why God devoted so much of His intelligence to designing malarial parasites.IV Dinner at the Rat Farm (SARS) (view spoiler)[reservoir bats, coronavirus (hide spoiler)]The very name coined during that early period, SARS, reflects the fact that this thing was known only by its effects, its impacts, like the footprints of a large, invisible beast. Ebola is a virus. Hendra is a virus. Nipah is a virus. SARS is a syndrome.A superspreader is a patient who, for one reason or another, directly infects far more people than does the typical infected patient.One further factor, possibly the most crucial, was inherent to the way SARS-CoV affects the human body: Symptoms tend to appear in a person before, rather than after, that person becomes highly infectious. The headache, the fever, and the chills—maybe even the cough—precede the major discharge of virus toward other people..This was an enormously consequential factor in the SARS episode—not just lucky but salvational.""V The Deer, the Parrot, and the Kid Next Door (Q fever, Psittacosis, Lyme disease)Q fever, or “abattoir’s fever”. It wasn’t a virus, though in some measure it behaved like one. It was a bacterium, but unlike most other bacteria.First of all, it’s an intracellular bacterium, meaning that it reproduces within cells of its host—as does a virus, though by dissimilar mechanisms—not out in the bloodstream or the gut, where it could be more easily targeted by immune response. Furthermore, it exists in two forms of bacterial particle, one large and one small, each with different characteristics suited to different phases of its life history. The large form replicates prolifically inside host cells and then transmogrifies to the small form, which is tougher and more stable. The small form, almost like a spore, is packaged for survival in the external environment.Psittacosis. “Parrot fever” a culprit had been identified. It was a small bacterium with some unusual properties, seemingly similar to the agent that causes typhus (Rickettsia prowazekii) and therefore given the name Rickettsia psittaci. (Renamed later Chlamydophila psittaci.)“If the young cockatoo, after capture, is kept under good conditions,” he and his coauthor wrote, “it remains healthy and presents no danger to human beings.” Likewise, the wild bird populations might carry a high prevalence of infection but suffer little impact in terms of damaged health or mortality. “When, on the other hand, birds are crowded into small spaces, with inadequate food and sunlight, their latent infection is lit up.” The bacterium multiplies and “is excreted in large amounts.” It floats out of the cages along with downy feathers, powdered dung, and dust. It rides the air like a Mosaic plague. People inhale it and become ill.Lyme disease Part of what makes it problematic is that the life history of Borrelia burgdorferi is very complex, involving much more than ticks and people.Related to the unchanging fact of noninheritability is a variable that Ostfeld and others call “reservoir competence.” This is the measure of likelihood that a given host animal, if it’s already infected, will transmit the infection to a feeding tick. Reservoir competence varies from species to species, most likely depending on differences in the strength of immune response against the pathogen. If the immune response is weak and the blood teems with spirochetes, that species will serve as a highly “competent” reservoir of B. burgdorferi, transmitting infection to most ticks that bite it. If the immune response is strong and effective, damping down the level of blood-borne spirochetes, that species will be a relatively less competent reservoir. Studies by Ostfeld’s group, involving captive animals and the ticks feeding on them, showed white-footed mice to be the most competent of reservoirs for the Lyme disease spirochete. Chipmunks were a distant second in reservoir competence, with shrews close behind them.VI Going viralExpert opinion even divides on the conundrum of whether viruses are alive. If they aren’t, then at the very least they’re mechanistic shortcuts on the principle of life itself. They parasitize. They compete. They attack, they evade. They struggle. They obey the same basic imperatives as all living creatures—to survive, to multiply, to perpetuate their lineage—and they do it using intricate strategies shaped by Darwinian natural selection. They evolve. The viruses on Earth today are well fit for what they do because only the fittest have survived.R0 = βN/(α + b + v)In English: The evolutionary success of a bug is directly related to its rate of transmission through the host population and inversely but intricately related to its lethality, the rate of recovery from it, and the normal death rate from all other causes. (The clunky imprecision of that sentence is why ecologists prefer math.) So the first rule of a successful parasite is slightly more complicated than Don’t kill your host. It’s more complicated even than Don’t burn your bridges until after you’ve crossed them. The first rule of a successful parasite is βN/(α + b + v).And why are RNA genomes so small? Because their self-replication is so fraught with inaccuracies that, given more information to replicate, they would accumulate more errors and cease to function at all. It’s sort of a chicken-and-egg problem, he said. RNA viruses are limited to small genomes because their mutation rates are so high, and their mutation rates are so high because they’re limited to small genomes. In fact, there’s a fancy name for that bind: Eigen’s paradox.VII Celestial HostsFrom where do these viruses jump? They jump from animals in which they have long abided, found safety, and occasionally gotten stuck. They jump, that is, from their reservoir hosts.And which animals are those? Some kinds are more deeply implicated than others as reservoirs of the zoonotic viruses that jump into humans. Hantaviruses jump from rodents. Lassa too jumps from rodents. Yellow fever virus jumps from monkeys. Monkeypox, despite its name, seems to jump mainly from squirrels. Herpes B jumps from macaques. The influenzas jump from wild birds into domestic poultry and then into people, sometimes after a transformative stopover in pigs. Measles may originally have jumped into us from domesticated sheep and goats. HIV-1 has jumped our way from chimpanzees. So there’s a certain diversity of origins. But a large fraction of all the scary new viruses I’ve mentioned so far, as well as others I haven’t mentioned, come jumping at us from bats.Epstein was talking, in an understated way, about the two distinct but interconnected dimensions of zoonotic transfer: ecology and evolution. Habitat disturbance, bushmeat hunting, the exposure of humans to unfamiliar viruses that lurk in animal hosts—that’s ecology. Those things happen between humans and other kinds of organism, and are viewed in the moment. Rates of replication and mutation of an RNA virus, differential success for different strains of the virus, adaptation of the virus to a new host—that’s evolution. It happens within a population of some organism, as the population responds to its environment over time. Among the most important things to remember about evolution—and about its primary mechanism, natural selection, as limned by Darwin and his successors—is that it doesn’t have purposes. It only has results. To believe otherwise is to embrace a teleological fallacy that carries emotive appeal (“the revenge of the rain forest”) but misleads. This is what Jon Epstein was getting at. Don’t imagine that these viruses have a deliberate strategy, he said. Don’t think that they bear some malign onus against humans. “It’s all about opportunity.” They don’t come after us. In one way or another, we go to them. VIII The chimp and the river (AIDS, HIV-1, HIV-2, SIV)As the new century began, AIDS researchers pondered this roster of different viral lineages: seven groups of HIV-2 and three groups of HIV-1. The seven groups of HIV-2, distinct as they were from one another, all resembled SIVsm, the virus endemic in sooty mangabeys. (So did the later addition, group H.) The three kinds of HIV-1 all resembled SIVcpz, from chimps. (The eventual fourth kind, group P, is most closely related to SIV from gorillas.) Now here’s the part that, as it percolates into your brain, should cause a shudder: Scientists think that each of those twelve groups (eight of HIV-2, four of HIV-1) reflects an independent instance of cross-species transmission. Twelve spillovers.In other words, HIV hasn’t happened to humanity just once. It has happened at least a dozen times—a dozen that we know of, and probably many more times in earlier history. Therefore it wasn’t a highly improbable event. It wasn’t a singular piece of vastly unlikely bad luck, striking humankind with devastating results—like a comet come knuckleballing across the infinitude of space to smack planet Earth and extinguish the dinosaurs. No. The arrival of HIV in human bloodstreams was, on the contrary, part of a small trend. Due to the nature of our interactions with African primates, it seems to occur pretty often.Throughout the rest of the world you see AIDS-education materials crying out: Practice safe sex! Wear a condom! Don’t reuse needles! Here the message was: Don’t eat apes!IX It depends (Influenza) (view spoiler)[reservoir wild aquatic birds (hide spoiler)]Influenza is caused by three types of viruses, of which the most worrisome and widespread is influenza A. Viruses of that type all share certain genetic traits: a single-stranded RNA genome, which is partitioned into eight segments, which serve as templates for eleven different proteins.Two of those molecules become spiky protuberances from the outer surface of the viral envelope: hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Those two, recognizable by an immune system, and crucial for penetrating and exiting cells of a host, give the various subtypes of influenza A their definitive labels: H5N1, H1N1, and so on. The term “H5N1” indicates a virus featuring subtype 5 of the hemagglutinin protein combined with subtype 1 of the neuraminidase protein. Sixteen different kinds of hemagglutinin, plus nine kinds of neuraminidase, have been detected in the natural world. Hemagglutinin is the key that unlocks a cell membrane so that the virus can get in, and neuraminidase is the key for getting back out. Okay so far? Having absorbed this simple paragraph, you understand more about influenza than 99.9 percent of the people on Earth. Pat yourself on the back and get a flu shot in November.One of the things that makes influenza so problematic, Webster said, is its propensity to change. He explained. First of all there’s the high rate of mutation, as in any RNA virus. No quality control as it replicates, he said, echoing what I’d heard from Eddie Holmes. Continual copying errors at the level of individual letters of code. But that’s not the half of it. Even more important is the reassortment. (“Reassortment” means the accidental swapping of entire genomic segments between virions of two different subtypes. It’s similar to recombination, as occurs sometimes between crossed chromosomes in dividing cells, except that reassortment is somewhat more facile and orderly. It happens often among influenza viruses because the segmentation allows their RNA to snap apart neatly at the points of demarcation between genes: those eight railroad cars in a switching yard.) Sixteen available kinds of hemagglutinin, Webster reminded me. Nine kinds of neuraminidase. “You can do the arithmetic,” he said. (I did: 144 possible pairings.) The changes are random and most yield bad combinations, making the virus less viable. But random changes do constitute variation, and variation is the exploration of possibilities. It’s the raw material of natural selection, adaptation, evolution. That’s why influenza is such a protean sort of bug, always full of surprises, full of newness, full of menace: so much mutation and reassortment.The steady incidence of mutations yields incremental change in how the virus looks and behaves. Ergo you need another flu shot every autumn: This year’s version of flu is different enough from last year’s. Reassortment yields big changes. Such major innovations by reassortment, introducing new subtypes, which may be infectious but unfamiliar to the human population, are what generally lead to pandemics.
If you have read through my admittedly long review, or just scrolled through, I have a few words of advice: Don’t go into a bat cave without a hazmat suit. Don’t feed the monkeys in shrines, generally keep your distance from them. Don’t eat apes. Practice safe sex, and take your yearly flu shot.

20,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56146790-whitney,5,"Overall: This book is an absolute masterpiece. Epic in scope, brilliant in how it is all connected, very relevant to today, and extremely eye opening and illuminating. Not an easy read but absolutely worth it! 10/10Summary:“When a pathogen leaps from some nonhuman animal into a person, and succeeds there in establishing itself as an infectious presence, sometimes causing illness or death, the result is a zoonosis.” Much of this story is detailing Quammen's adventures and research following various zoonosis around the world. Fun fact: Historically, some 60 percent of the infections that plague humankind, from influenza to H.I.V. and bubonic plague, all originated in the bodies of other animals. This book is neatly divided into sections based around a certain zoonosis or a group of similar ones. Each section is a meticulous telling of the origin, history, pertinent findings and research, development, and current state of these various zoonotic diseases. Take home message: eat more plants and chocolate!Note: though this book is all about zoonosis it should not cause the reader to panic or be scared about them. “Spillover” hardly touches on such pandemic-­worthy animal pathogens as avian flu or multi-drug-resistant bacteria, rather, it fully describes the unfolding convergence between veterinary science and human medicine, and how veterinary-­minded medical experts discover and track diseases that spread across species. “Spillover” is less public health warning than ecological affirmation: these crossovers force us to uphold “the old Darwinian truth (the darkest of his truths, well known and persistently forgotten) that humanity is a kind of animal” — with a shared fate on the planet. “People and gorillas, horses and duikers and pigs, monkeys and chimps and bats and viruses,” Quammen writes. “We’re all in this together.”The Good: I loved this book! Granted it is a subject I am very interested in but I listened to it with my husband who has no medical or animal background, and he immensely enjoyed it as well. The storytelling is amazing, it really does read like a narrative and I felt swept away at many points that I had to remind myself this was nonfiction. Another major positive is the scope. This book has SO MUCH information and yes, you absolutely have to pay attention, but the author does a great job at bringing everything together and explaining difficult to understand topics. It is a blend of science, history, ecology, anthropology, immunology, research, and all presented cohesively in a narrative that grips you with every chapter. My favorite section of all was Ebola. Overall, this book is phenomenal, very relevant to current events, and I learned so much while listening to it. Highly recommend.The Bad: There were a few chapters in the section on AIDS that the author was speculating and theorizing that I was not a fan of. I preferred the remainder of the book which was all based on facts and science that I found these few chapters distracting and out of place. Some sections are dense in material that you really do need to be paying attention in order to keep up. I found this to be a positive though as I really learned a lot while reading this book.Favorite Quotes:“Make no mistake, they are connected, these disease outbreaks coming one after another. And they are not simply happening to us; they represent the unintended results of things we are doing. They reflect the convergence of two forms of crisis on our planet. The first crisis is ecological, the second is medical.”“Our findings highlight the critical need for health monitoring and identification of new, potentially zoonotic pathogens in wildlife populations, as a forecast measure for EIDs.” That sounds reasonable: Let’s keep an eye on wild creatures. As we besiege them, as we corner them, as we exterminate them and eat them, we’re getting their diseases.” “People and gorillas, horses and duikers and pigs, monkeys and chimps and bats and viruses: We’re all in this together.” “Disappointment, in science, is sometimes a gateway to insight.”"

If you're a thriving population, living at high density but exposed to new bugs, it's just a matter of time until the NBO arrives.

Published in 2012, Quammen's Spillover updated and built upon Garrett's work in The Coming Plague,  which was released 18 years earlier. His primary concern is the same as Garrett's, and that is the inevitable arrival of the Next Big One (or NBO). 

Zoonotic pathogens can hide. That's what make them ... so complicated, so problematic.Ecological disturbances cause diseases to emerge. Shake a tree, and things fall out.

Despite the two authors' common warning, I didn't find reading  Spillover  to be redundant. The book's title refers to the moment when a pathogen in host species #1 leaps into species #2. This broad definition covers that transmission event whether between animals (""cross-species transmission"") or from animal to humans (""zoonosis""). And for the sake of completeness, ""anthroponosis"" refers to pathogen transmission from human to animals or to another human. Quammen asserted that the NBO is likely to be viral in origin. Three of the past four epic disease killers were attributable to viruses: smallpox in the 1500s wiped out indigenous peoples throughout the Americas (number of deaths unknown), the 1918-19 influenza pandemic (50 million fatalities), and AIDS which has killed 30 million persons and still counting. The Black Death during the 1300s killed one-third of Europe (25 million estimated) and was likely due to the bubonic plague bacterium. Scientists expect the NBO to have a similar impact in magnitude. By that metric, this 2020 Covid-19 pandemic is likely not the NBO, which is rather daunting considering the toll to date in terms of fatalities and economic costs. Quammen wrote about bacterial disease zoonosis, such as Lyme disease, but he seemed more fascinated by viruses. Nobel laureate Sir Peter Medewar, a biologist, defined a virus as ""a piece of bad news wrapped up in a protein."" To a reader who visualizes her favorite ribeye steak upon hearing ""protein,"" this was not an informative description. Since my local news show regularly displays an image of Covid-19, crowned in all of its spiky glory, this served as a handy visual reference. First of all, viruses are incredibly tiny and they weren't seen until electron microscopes were invented in the 1930s. Viruses are not quite alive, as a virion (an individual virus particle outside of a host cell) isn't even a cell. No, a virus is technically an obligate intracellular parasite, meaning that it can live it up and replicate only once it hijacks a host cell for its purposes. The virion's innards consist of various proteins and a tiny genome, whose nucleotides contain instructions for replication. The virion's outer surface is called a capsid, which is a protein. The capsid protects the virion's genome as it helps it to breech a host cell's wall, usually injuring it in the process, and it gives the virion its overall shape. Covid-19 is a coronavirus because its spherical capsid with its multiple little spikes resembles its namesake. Those protuberances enable the virion to lock onto its targeted host cells. By the same token, a person's immune system has to create antibodies, white blood cells, that specifically fit those spikes to circumvent the virion's ability to lock onto its target. (An antibody test for Covid-19 only confirms whether a person had been infected by the virus. At this moment in time, lifelong immunity to Covid-19 can not be concluded from a positive antibody test result.)A virus' genome is either going to be DNA or RNA based. The double-stranded helix shape of DNA makes the virus relatively more stable than a RNA-based version. The latter, as only a single strand, has more flexible genetic instructions and is thus faster to mutate and evolve, discarding iterations which don't achieve its goal of replication. To mitigate the limitations of its tiny genetic programming, RNA viruses are especially inclined to jump between hosts. And since humans are too numerous to ignore, all this explains why RNA viruses are likelier to be zoonotic pathogens than DNA viruses. Some examples of RNA viruses are hantavirus, herpes B, and ebolavirus.One additional and genetically sly design, however, belongs to retroviruses. A retrovirus is a RNA virus that can reverse transcribe its code into DNA after it breeches a host cell's wall but before it hijacks that cell's nucleus for its replications. This trick results in the retrovirus becoming permanently part of the host cell's DNA. The most notorious retrovirus is HIV-1, which can lead to AIDS. Indeed, if the darn things weren't so injurious to humans, I would likely admire viruses' evolutionary adaptability - no, not truly! Quammen, of course, included a pathogen parade in Spillover. In Australia, the Hendra (measles) virus killed horses first and then two people. Nipah virus encephalitis erupted among Malaysian pig farmers and then hopscotched to Bangladesh, which has few, if any, pigs. Now I know not to drink date-palm sap, however fresh and ""restorative"" it may purported to be. He updated Garrett's coverage of Ebola and AIDS research. Of great interest to me was the account of the first coronavirus outbreak, which was SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), in 2003.Since Spillover is about zoonosis, Quammen discussed disease ecology, especially the significance of host or natural reservoirs. We can't eradicate zoonotic pathogens because they take refuge (i.e. hide) in some other hospitable animal species without causing it any long-lasting harm. One great scientific mystery is where the Ebolavirus is biding its time in between its sporadic outbreaks; its natural reservoir has yet to be found. Bats remain the favorite suspect based on scientific hunts in Africa. As there are about 4,000 mammal species, broad diversity in reservoirs, ranging from rodents to primates, exist. But bats are the most common natural reservoirs for viruses and were confirmed as such for 3 of the 5 diseases that I mentioned in the preceding paragraph. Quammen does not have formal training in the sciences, although many of his previous writings have been scientific in nature. His literature background manifested itself with metaphors like this one -""the busses grind against one another like chummy elephants"" - and with a prolonged imaginative account of how HIV-1 spread throughout Africa. I could have done without his personal musings here. Much of Spillover  read like a travelogue with his adventures abroad as he followed disease researchers. He was cognizant of the need to educate his readers about the underlying science, so I do feel as though I've attended a seminar on virology and epidemiology. There were, however, two major drawbacks with Quammen's lack of scientific training. It appeared as though he believed that his readership not only lacked a scientific background but was actively afraid of science. This tone of voice posed an occasional distraction. The second negative aspect of that tone, which also appeared flippant on many occasions, diminished his credibility with me. For instance, after reading Garrett's description of many bacterial pathogens which have developed resistance to multiple antibiotics, Quammen appeared too casually confident in this misleading, double-pronged assessment: ""now that modern antibiotics are widely available, vastly reducing the lethal menace of bacteria, we can guess confidently that the NBO will be a virus too."" I'm including a link to  my review for Garrett's The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance in case you're trying to choose which book to read. I don't regret reading both, but together (totaling about 1,350 pages) they will likely require a substantial commitment of time. Garrett's book is older and written in a clinical / technical style. Garrett, however, has far more scientific credibility than Quammen does with me. In Spillover's  favor, it's both more recent and accessible to readers intimidated by science. I agreed with Quammen's conclusion: 

 We should appreciate that these recent outbreaks of zoonotic diseases, as well as the spread and recurrences of old ones, are part of a larger pattern, and that humanity is responsible for generating that pattern. We should understand that, although some of the human caused factors may seem virtually inexorable, others are within our control. 

GR doesn't allow fractions in which case I would rate this as just missing the 4 star threshold at around 3.75. I've truncated my rating to 3 stars."

23,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9374686-clouds,5,"Pure class from beginning to end - the best science journalism I've read.It was completely coincidental that I read this just before the 2014 Ebola outbreak... but that did sort of reinforce why this is essential reading!Plenty of other goodreads reviews have given superb summaries of the content of the novel, so I'll only touch on that briefly - but here's why I personally loved it:I originally put this on my long-list as research reading. There's a novel I want to write (one day!) that is set in a an alt-history where humanity was ravaged 18th/19th century by an incredibly contagious but slow killing parasite that crosses from a fictional type of domesticated chimps to mankind. So... I aced high-school Biology, I've seen Outbreak, I've read the Andromedus Strain and I've played the Plauge Inc app and the Pandemic boardgame - I have a higher than average interest in the mechanics of contagious diseases - but I'm certainly no pro. There were plenty of question marks in my plot regarding how my fictional plague functioned. This book sounded like the perfect, broad spectrum primer for what kinds of diseases had spread from animals, how that worked, and how it could (plausibly enough for spec fic) work.So that's why it got on my long-list.Every time I saw a review flash past from a goodreads friend, it was invariably positive.For the last few years I've been diligently focused on my reading lists - working through all the major sci-fi/fantasy award winners since 1980. It hasn't left a huge amount of space for books which sounded interesting, but weren't award winners. So I created a new reading list called the 'Cup of Tea List' for books that hadn't won awards but sounded like my cup of tea! I picked 10 top books for the list - and this was one of them.So I eventually got my chance to read it!And I loved every page.I love learning new stuff and I thought this was all fascinating and presented in an incredibly accessible way. It's not dumbed-down, but Quammen never talks in the stilted, precise vernacular of the true scientist. He's a damn-fine writer, who happens to really know his science. At the end of every chapter I wanted to report it all back to my wife. She's kind of squeamish about sickness, so she didn't totally appreciate that, but even she found it interesting.I've spoken about it so glowingly every since I finished it, that I've loaned it out twice already. If a friend's looking to borrow a book and they have any science leanings at all, I'm there, ""dear friend, have you by chance read Spillover yet? No? Let me find where I've put it...""In football (soccer) rhetoric, there's a running joke that club managers don't have the broadest vocabularies, and a good player is often described as ""a top lad"". If he's an exceptional player he might be a ""a top, top lad"" - with each subsequent, more emphatic ""top"" being reserved for the elite, the world-beaters, etc. With this in mind, I say that Spillover is a top, top,

It is unsettling to read how easy it is for an infection to *spillover* (sorry) from animal to human.

In fact, there is no “natural world,” it’s a bad and artificial phrase. There is only the world. Humankind is part of that world, as are the ebolaviruses, as are the influenzas and the HIVs, as are Nipah and Hendra and SARS, as are chimpanzees and bats and palm civits and bar-headed geese, as is the next murderous virus-the one we haven’t yet detected. Informative and enlightening. And you don't need to be an epidemiologist to follow along.Just fantastic.10/10(Thanks Carol.!)"
27,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nicky,5,"I found this book fascinating. When I originally got it out of the library, some of my friends were a biiiit concerned that given my GAD was health-focused, this would just make me have a panic attack. I'm happy to report that I was simply happily curious, digging around with great enthusiasm, stopping to google things, etc.In terms of the level this is at, it's perfectly comprehensible to anyone, I would say. Granted, I do have a background in reading plenty of popular science, an A Level in biology, and various science/medical courses online, but I don't think that puts me much above the layman, really. Where something needs explaining, Quammen does so quite clearly. (Although if you do find this fascinating but a bit dense for you, this course on Coursera might be worth a look the next time it runs. I enjoyed it, anyway.)So, granted I already find this topic fascinating, but I think this was a good read. It avoided sensationalism, aside from the couple of chapters where Quammen imagined the life of the Cut Hunter from the cut-hunter theory of the origin of HIV, which were a little much for me. That goes beyond adding a bit of human interest into a flight of fancy, which jars with the rest of the book. If you want to think delightedly of Ebola victims as being a sack of liquefied matter, I gather you want to read The Hot Zone (Richard Preston).It's well-structured, taking us through various different zoonotic pathogens and their implications. The search for the ""Next Big One"" (the next pandemic) isn't the primary focus, despite the title, and instead Quammen focuses on how the diseases are tracked, particularly how they are tracked to the reservoir species that safely harbour the pathogens until they spill over into other species. It's not hysterical about the fact that there will be another pandemic, but treats it in a matter of fact way. Of course there'll be another pandemic: we're overcrowded, highly connected, highly social, and fairly careless.I know there are people out there who will be complaining about Quammen's bias when he notes that we are, to a great extent, making the problem worse. We destroy habitats, bring animals into closer contact with us, and thus bring ourselves into closer contact with their pathogens, which may spill over into humans. Not biased, and not hard to understand, just a fact."
28,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,5,"""When a pathogen leaps from some nonhuman animal into a person, and succeeds there in establishing itself as an infectious presence, sometimes causing illness or death, the result is a zoonosis."" The event of such leap is a spillover. Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic is a well-researched book. David Quammen is not an armchair researcher. He visits scientists and doctors allover the world, from Africa, Australia to Southeast Asia, and takes part in the actual field work. The writing is rich and dotted with humor. The diseases covered in the book include Hendra (horse measles), Ebola, SARS, Malaria, Nipah Virus, HIV (mostly HIV-1), Influenza, and many more. It explains scientific concepts such as ""reservoir"" and ""amplifier"" well, as well how RNA virus and retrovirus work and why they behave the way they do. A lot of investigation journalism too. The 100 pages long chapter about HIV reads like a detective story, very engaging indeed.A few fun facts (yes I think science is fun, even it is about infectious diseases):1. ""Deer tick"" is misleading, as deer is a reservoir but not the most popular reservoir of Lyme Disease. The white-footed mouse is, followed by chipmunks and shrews. 2. A Malaria bug was used to treat a type of late stage of syphilis but also gave the usually mild bug a chance to become deadly.3. Bats are the most popular reservoir, wow. 4. It is almost impossible to eradicate a zoonotic disease because they have a natural animal reservoir. Smallpox is not zoonosis (meaning only in humans) therefore it has been eradicated. What strikes me most is that the NBO (the Next Big One, i.e. the next deadly pandemic disease) is inevitable. It is not a matter of if, but a matter of when. Ecology plays a crucial part in the happening of spillover events. Human population explosion, the destroy of animal habitat and the proximity between wild animals and human all make such events inevitable.  ""Human-caused ecological pressures and disruptions are bringing animal pathogens ever more into contact with human populations, while human technology and behavior are spreading those pathogens ever more widely and quickly."" However, the inevitability does not mean we are helpless. It all depends how we react.Is the current Covid-19 pandemic the Next Big One? Probably not, because its mortality rate is not as high as the last big one, 1918-1919 influenza, but history will tell."
29,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25371127-rossdavidh,5,"Another book from the guy who's become one of my favorite authors. Most non-fiction books (including Quammen's) can be divided into one of two types: books with many small ideas (e.g. his book of essays, ""Biolerplate Rhino""), and books with one big idea. Both have their place, and I have enjoyed both. There is pleasure (and edification) in reading 10 pages (or so) on an idea at a time, then moving on to the next topic. Big things can come from small ideas; not everything has to be a magnum opus.This book, though, is not a book of many small ideas. This is a book of One Big Idea. Or perhaps, One Big Analogy.Without trying to pretend that I can do in a few hundred words what takes a writer as accomplished as Quammen over 500 pages, the basic question here is, are we doomed? Not doomed in the general sense (the answer to that is always 'yes'), but from a particular kind of self-inflicted wound.Quammen has talked elsewhere about the ""Planet of Weeds"", which is a particularly dispiriting vision of the future in which, besides humans, there are only such organisms as crabgrass, poison ivy, rats, cockroaches, and other such species too adaptable or ornery to be extinguished. Most species, we accidentally extirminate, sometimes despite heroic efforts by a few to save them. These species, we repeatedly fail to extirminate, despite heroic efforts by many to do so. Over time, more and more of Earth is likely to be either humanity; species like wheat, soy, pig, and cow; and the weed species that can prosper despite (or sometimes even because of) our dominance.There is one kind of life, though, which this vision of the future (not so much apocalyptic as ""banal-yptic"", which is a word because I say so) says nothing about: the microscopic. In ""Spillover"", Quammen turns his attention to this.Many diseases which cause humanity a great deal of trouble in the past (and the present) are found only in humans. These may be extirminated, like smallpox, or not, like malaria, but they are at least in principle solvable problems. If you cure or immunize everyone on Earth, even for a little while, then the problem is gone (unless somebody in a bioweapons lab re-introduces it later).There are other diseases, though (whether bacterial or viral in origin), that do NOT primarily live in humans. They live in other species, sometimes not even causing illness there, and occasionally spill over into humans. The technical term is ""zoonosis"".Imagine that every species is a room. Imagine that inside every one of these rooms is a certain amount of tinder. As long as the walls between rooms are firewalls, and the doors are closed, the potential for a firestorm is limited. I once lived in a dormitory where one room went up in flames, but the fire never spread to anyone else's rooms because the walls were cinderblock and the doors were stout, not especially flammable, and nearly always closed.Imagine that instead, we punch holes in those cinderblock walls, and people move their belongings from one place to another, leaving piles of paper in the hallway or doorways. Now, once a spark hits tinder in any room, it has a chance of spreading without limit.As humanity has moved from one ecosystem to another, eating or displacing species after species, spreading them (and their insides, and their bodily fluids, and thus their pathogens) far and wide, it is as if we are punching holes in the cinderblock walls. Will a firestorm result?One answer would be: HIV was a zoonosis, and it was a very slow-acting one.Quammen knows better than to leap straight into the HIV story, though. First, we learn about much smaller zoonoses, like Hendra, Ebola, SARS, and bird flu. We learn about what is known by doctors, biologists, and veterinarians, and also how it came to be known, and what is still unknown. We travel with Quammen to labs and offices in Europe and North America, and we also travel with him to the Congo and Australia and Hong Kong. We are treated to a particularly vivid imagining (based on what is known, and guessing at what is unknown) of how HIV made the leap from chimpanzee to human to humanity. We dip lightly into the mathematics of disease infectivity. Then, we are treated to The Analogy, which Quammen is able to phrase far more gracefully than I (which is why I made up the dorm room fire analogy above, instead, so I wouldn't ruin his by botching the re-telling).In case you haven't figured it out by now, I liked this book. A lot. I put all others aside until it was finished, and afterwards lamented that it was done. It will not make you sleep better, but it will make you think, and like a good horror story or thriller, will entertain despite (or because of) the dark subject matter. You should read it."
30,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,4,"Good book. It was interesting to learn about how viruses and disease can pass over to humans. Certainly, relevant to the current situation particularly the sections about bats. The organization and pace of the book is good. It’s a mix of information, interviews and the author’s experiences while observing the scientists at work. I usually don’t like author’s personal experiences in works like this, but since he focuses on the research itself it’s not too irritating. The writing is readable if a bit too snarky at times. The content is great. I learned a lot about viruses and the research behind figuring out pandemics. It’s all very interesting. This book exceeded my expectations.  So, I give this a 4. It’s mostly readable and always interesting with clear implications for the current situation.  "
31,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,3,"This holds a ton of information that is helpful to hold some specifics re virus infections that proceed to humans. But it's not completely upon the title material.In fact, the writing is well accomplished. It's often clear and better than some of the highly scientific particulars and nomenclatures of pure science reads (very dry) elsewhere. But as much as I can decide it DID make the reading easier than most material in this genre, it also holds another quality I thought was a considerable distraction from that positive prose form. Quammen has a kind of tone that's strange to read (it was for me) and quite difficult to describe. It's not Chicken Little on meth (or a hate rant like Gerta Thunberg either) but it's not a logical nor scientific bottom line ""norm"" either. If I'm overstating that, I'm sorry. But some of this assumption and oversight is just plain wrong when he tends to expand from ""one"" to ""some"" to ""all"". And it some cases it seems to me, that this emotive occludes to some of the very actual world reality of how MOST virus pass into pandemic outcomes. And how they did in the past, as well. Like the 1918 and the other human influenza forms that went lethal since. There are huge portions of this book that read like a memoir and travelogue. It's just not direct to the title at all, immense pages of asides/ tangents.The history of some of the worst spillovers (like Hendra or other bat vector virus) were the best and most accurate parts- and I am glad I read it for the understanding of how an intermediate ""amplify"" animal is also usually a HUGE part of the ""it depends"" serendipity that results in these horrific outcomes. First a small ""usual"" mammal, then a mid vector animal and then other species- such as monkeys/apes or humans.It's not a book I would necessarily recommend. His personality and slant, I just feel, is containing quite a bit of ""group think"" and not enough science. But now I do comprehend more easily the trail through 3 or 4 species this virus morph road can take."
32,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3230750-molly,5,"Thrilled to see that David Quammen had a new science book, I snatched this up. It’s been 15 years since his book ""Song of the Dodo” about island biogeography, which remains at the top of my favorite non-fiction. Can one *enjoy* a book about infectious disease? Anyone who's read Richard Preston's “The Hot Zone” will guiltily admit, yes (interestingly, he takes Preston to task for overplaying descriptions of Ebola infection. “Bleeding out"" is not accurate.)There is inherent narrative drama in the question of when the Next Big One (NBO) will hit and in the epidemiological sleuthing to identify viruses and their host animals when an epidemic breaks. What will turn a local outbreak into a pandemic? Do scientists think there IS a NBO lurking? Quite possibly. And if so, it will assuredly originate in animals, as has almost all human infectious disease. Influenza, SARS, Marburg, Lyme disease - Quammen covers them all and more, and turns up startling facts. For one, the subtitle of his book could just as well be, ""From Bats to Humans."" But what put the book over the top in excellence and dramatic page-turning was the penultimate chapter on the origin of AIDS. In some ways the whole book was moving toward this chapter. The origins of HIV can now be pinned to a year (much earlier than you’d think) and a single spillover event; chimp to human. And Quammen makes the poignant and chilling case that lest you wonder why we should care about exotic diseases such as Marbug, consider the exponential trajectory and devastation of AIDS. It too is a zoonotic disease, but one that has moved more slowly than an airborne NBO will surely do. Despite the theme – lively and buoyant writing. In other words, it’s readable. Quammen remains a master of science journalism. "
33,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/259402-sebastien,5,"Superb! David Quammen brings to life the stories of a wide variety of infectious diseases and their spillover from animals to humans. David is a great writer, his narrative drive and prose are magnificent. He does this while presenting the science in a very accessible yet amazingly informative way.What is astounding is the amount of work and research that must have gone into this book. David conducted a seemingly endless amount of interviews with scientists, researchers, doctors. To say he took it to the next level, well that is a vast understatement. This is science journalism/writing at its pinnacle.My particular favorite was the section on the ecology of borrelia (lyme). This is a subject that hits close to home for me.The section on malaria was very intriguing, learned a lot. The coolest thing was learning that a form of malaria had been used as therapy to treat syphilis (a form of therapy known as pyrotherapy). That blew my mind. If you're curious, here's an article on the subject: http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/bod...I was also fascinated by the HIV chapter. Could have done without his hypothesizing and reimagining of the original patient 0 story, I saw what he was trying to do, but that seemed a bit clunky and unnecessary. But that's a minor quibble with an otherwise outstanding book. Dang, the ebola chapter was incredible as well... so much good stuff in here."
34,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6612660-roberta,4,"Informative, essential, easy to understand even if you don't have a previous knowledge of the subject. Zoonoses fascinates me. Well, viruses and bacteria fascinate me and I'm piling up titles about the subject: Spillover is so far one of the best. It doesn't try to add drama and it sticks to the chronicles; the exception is the AIDS chapter, in which the author allows himself to turn the hypothesis of how the AIDS left the African jungles into a sort of fable.

35,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin,4,"Interesting read (especially now as most of us are still on ""lock-down""). I'll not try to lay out what's in the book (as if I could do that I'd need several degrees) I'd not be able to lay it out as I should. After all this is a book on epidemics/pandemics and more specifically how some of the ""new"" diseases enter the human species.We get a look here at some of the ways these ""viruses"" may be jumping species and why it may be happening."

It is longer than most science/ medicine books, but do not let that deter you. I was extremely sad when this book ended. I wanted more!In the middle of reading this book, I made the mistake of putting this book on pause to read the more recent Pandemic by Sonia Shah. Science is obviously not the authors strong suit. It was extremely disappointing. It might fly with people who are less scientifically literate. She had more up to date info on Ebola, which might draw in a huge readership, but her book doesn't hold a candle to this book. Quammen's book is a big WOW, on every level. When I finally returned from Pandemic, I was in such a foul mood, it was detracting from my enjoyment of this book. That only lasted for a little bit. I could not help but get sucked right back into all of Quammen's case studies and histories of various outbreaks. This book was well researched, extremely thorough, scientifically sound, well written, and entertaining as hell. His passion for his subject spilled over into every page and into me. I do not even want to give a summary of all the wonder inside this book because he tells the story of each virus so well, anything I would relate here feels like an actual spoiler. It is a must read! "
37,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"Where Do ""Emerging Diseases"" Emerge From?AIDS, Ebola, Marburg, SARS, H5N1 — every one of the world’s scariest diseases is a “zoonosis,” that is, a virus harbored by animals and transmitted to humans, often by other animals, in a complex minuet that often stretches out into decades.AIDS, for example. According to the latest research, reported by David Quammen in Spillover, Patient Zero was not that French-Canadian flight attendant you may have read about who went amok in the 1970s but a hunter in Southeast Cameroon around 1908 who killed a chimpanzee and somehow unwittingly allowed the animal’s blood to seep into his own circulatory system, either through a cut or by eating his prey’s raw flesh. This is the phenomenon that epidemiologists call “spillover.” At that point, a particularly virulent form of a recently emergent simian virus found a friendly and familiar environment in the hunter’s blood and flourished, becoming what we know today as HIV-1 (the more lethal form of the virus that causes AIDS). Later, the hunter passed along the virus to one or more women through sexual contact, and the disease slowly spread, both by sex and by transmission through reused needles, undetected as anything out of the ordinary, from Cameroon into what is now called the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and other sub-Saharan countries, and thence by happenstance to Haiti. It was a Haitian harboring HIV-1 who probably passed it along to that notorious Canadian flight attendant, setting off the epidemic among gay men in North America.In Spillover, Quammen tells tales like these in fascinating detail, relating the stories of the often-heroic scientists, physicians, and veterinarians who worked directly with deadly diseases, occasionally at the cost of their own lives. Quammen spent years writing this book. He appears to have read all the relevant scientific literature, attended specialized scientific conferences, and spent long hours tracking down and speaking face-to-face with the people who discovered these diseases, isolated the viruses, first treated the symptoms, and labored for thankless years on end in laboratories around the world to help humanity avert the next pandemic.You may have read Richard Preston’s best-selling 2001 treatment of the emergence of Ebola in The Hot Zone. If not, I can tell you that I vividly recall the book because it was so dramatic, and so terrifying. No doubt I had nightmares about contracting Ebola. But it turns out, according to Quammen and to the eminent scientists he interviewed, that Preston’s account was sensationalized and highly inaccurate in essential details. For example, he described tears of blood, massive hemorrhages, and melted internal organs, none of which has any basis in fact.However, Spillover, in its own way, is no less frightening. Quammen advances the popular theory that what appears to be the accelerating emergence of dangerous new pathogens became inevitable as a result of the enormous population growth of homo sapiens — because humanity has increasingly encroached on animal habitat and come into intimate contact with animals as never before. In discussions with noted biologists, he explores the concept of “breakout,” the explosive growth frequently seen in some animal species that shortly leads to sudden, catastrophic — through disease. He intimates that, with AIDS — or, all too possibly, with the next pandemic — humankind may experience something similar. Despite all the horrific details about AIDS, Ebola, Marburg, and the like, these are the book’s scariest passages.David Quammen writes about science, nature, and travel — a total of 10 nonfiction books and five novels to date. A former Rhodes Scholar, he was educated at Yale and Oxford.(From www.malwarwickonbooks.com)"
38,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58119141-elena-sala,5,"SPILLOVER: ANIMAL INFECTIONS AND THE NEXT HUMAN PANDEMIC (2012) was the result of David Quammen's five years of research interviewing scientists who were looking into the possibility of another horrific Ebola-type disease emerging. At that time, believe it or not, there was a widespread consensus: there would indeed be a new disease, likely from the coronavirus family, coming out of a bat, and it would likely emerge in or around a wet market in China. So, how could the world be SO unprepared for this nightmarish pandemic?? This book was written 8 years before this pandemic so it does not attempt to answer this question. Though we can probably guess some possible answers.This book is about zoonoses, infectious diseases that originate in animals and spread to humans. Rabies, for example, is a zoonotic disease. HIV is also a zoonotic disease. Dengue, yellow fever, malaria, influenza, Lyme disease, MERS, SARS, Zika and COVID are all zoonoses. The technical term scientists use to describe the leap of a pathogen from one animal to another is “spillover”. Most infections start as spillovers. Some, like Ebola and lesser-known viral diseases (Nipah, Hendra, Marburg), are highly transmissible and virulent, but so far have been limited to sporadic outbreaks. They persist because they are endemic in a reservoir population through a process of mutual adaptation.Quammen explores the correlation between these diseases that come up one after the other. It should not come as a surprise that they are not mere accidents but unwanted consequences of our actions. How do these pathogens make the leap from animals to humans? Quammen's answer: ""we invade tropical forests and other wild landscapes, which harbor so many species of animals and plants. And within those creatures, so many viruses. We cut the trees, we kill the animals or cage them and send them to markets. We disrupt ecosystems and we shake viruses loose from their natural hosts. When that happens, they need a new host. Often, we are it.” And why does this seem to be happening more frequently in recent times? The answer, again in Quammen's own words is: ""there’s 7.8 billion of us on this planet—four times the number of humans at the time of the 1918 influenza. And we have quadrupled the speed we travel around the planet; we have quadrupled the size of some of our cities. So there are a lot more of us large-bodied vertebrate animals, living in dense aggregations, moving fluidly from one place to another... We’re the world’s greatest target for a virus—a great ecosystem for them to colonize. So when a virus does get into a human and finds it can replicate and transmit to the next human, that virus has opened the door to vast opportunity.""Quammen's journeys have taken him all around the world: inside the air-locked sterility of high-security biological research labs, through the crowded alleyways of Chinese live animal markets, into remote African and Asian villages that have experienced outbreaks of some of the most lethal diseases yet known to mankind. He has interviewed survivors of these diseases and the scientists doing all the research. He has been a science writer for over 35 years, interested in ecology and evolutionary biology. He uses a conversational tone and, occasionally, some dark humor to give a frightening and eye opening summary of all that is known about these zoonotic diseases. This is a book I highly recommend, not only because it is written in an engaging and accessible way, sober, rational yet suspenseful, but because it is clear that COVID will not be the last pandemic we will see. There will be more zoonoses because we are disrupting the environment more and more. So we need to think about our own responsibility and how we relate to our environment. Each one of us has a responsibility, because we are all consumers of food, resources, and energy. Each of the choices that we make about what we’re going to eat, wear, or buy draws on these wild ecosystems. This book invites the reader to think about these choices while explaining how we got into this mess in the first place."
39,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4," Fairly good coverage of a topic that is all over the headlines at the current moment epidemics from diseases that jump from animal to human mostly viruses. It would be really hard at this point to not know about Coronavirus and the pandemic it caused and its likely source from animals (probably bats). This has been a problem we have been aware of for quite some time with flu strains and aids, and Lyme disease, and zika virus, and ebola, and Marburg virus the list goes on. Only now the point is hammered home in a pandemic and a world-historical economic crisis. Some of us knew better but as usual, people didn't heed the warnings. They almost never do."
40,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,4,"The hubris of homo sapiens lies in believing that it holds sway over this planet but then hidden away from anything but the most powerful electron microscopes are organisms that can wreak havoc on all of us. These microorganisms are hardy, smart and incredibly adaptable when it comes to the question of how to survive and thrive among the biodiversity of the earth. If you were to romanticize the whole concept then it becomes very easy to paint the pathogen as the most dreaded enemy of mankind/ nature’s revenge on us etc. However, a rational perspective tells a story which is entirely different and utterly fascinating in a deadly way. The microorganism’s capability to jump across species to man and thereby begin devastating outbreaks is the premise of the book and the scientific term for such a happening is Zoonosis. In the words of the author about the need of such a book :  Why obsess about Zoonoses ? In the larger balance of miseries, what makes anyone think they should be taken so seriously ? It’s a fair question but there are good answers. Some of those answers are intricate and speculative. Some are subjective. Others are objective and blunt. The bluntest is this : AIDS. Let’s look at some zoonotic diseases other than AIDS : Ebola, Marburg, Avian and Swine Flu, SARS, Malaria, Hendra are but a few of them. All of these are without doubt some of the deadliest killer that we have encountered. David Quammen does a book length investigation into the history, nature and where we stand in the understanding of the microorganisms which cause these diseases. Quammen’s writing style is approachable and far less sensational than what I encountered with Richard Preston’s Hot Zone. While Preston horrified and thrilled me, Quammen offers a more informative and grounded view at the pathogens and their effects. He also travels far and wide for his research and converses with recovered patients, eyewitnesses, doctors and scientists and ergo a much more well-rounded view of what actually transpires during a disease outbreak comes to light. Of special mention is the chapter named The Chimp and River which is an in depth detective story that traces the journey of HIV from the jungles of Africa into the world at large. There are two things about the book that really caught my attention : • The number of mice and monkeys that die in the name of betterment and advancement of science in this book is huge. There were times when I paused and wondered if more of these hapless animals perish than humans.• Quammen is a first rate travel writer. His descriptions of Asia and Africa are measured views of anthropology, wildlife and the inevitable clash between the two.Parts of the book especially on the mathematical connects between the nature of mass outbreaks and about the lifecycles of viruses were difficult to comprehend. But that aside this is a fantastic book to understand how much nature has in store which man has no idea of. It also corrected for me the notion that nature uses viruses to eventually get back at humans ( courtesy Richard Preston). A virus is a non-thinking organism and one for which in a majority of the cases, a human host is next to an evolutionary dead end. It just so happens that with our invasive lifestyle, we breach the habitats of the virus and get caught in their snares.Recommended."
41,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,5,"I see why Quammen is so well thought of. Spillover was amazingly informative, had a near perfect execution, explained very difficult, scientific subjects in a manner that a reader with little science background could understand without making it so dumbed down that the same reader found themselves lost in a nexus of weakening metaphors and feeling insulted (I'm looking at you, Winchester). This is how you speak to your audience! You do not dumbdown, but rather heighten the discourse and inform. I learned so much, and was so in awe of what I was learning, and the research that was done by Quammen, and even more by the researching actively trying to save us from the ""Next Big One"" that nightly over dinner I'd tell my husband excitedly that he just HAD to read Spillover, because did you know this or that about ebola? Its the only audiobook that I have honestly considered restarting immediately. There is just so much to process here, so much that I realize I just didn't know, and so much more that I could learn from a second reading.This is a book that I think every person should read. There is as much (if not more) human interest as science, it can honestly keep you on the edge of your seat. I love nature, but it can be such a scary place without considering that maybe you just inhaled infected bat shit or dust from an aborted goat. But its also a beautiful place, where ecology matters, where there is balance, and as the eruption of human population continues (presumably unchecked for now) that balance is disturbed. I cannot stress enough, especially during this election cycle, how important an informed populace is. How can we make decisions in domestic protection, how we raise our livestock, how we tour, how we travel across the globe, how we transport EVERYTHING, how we mine, and how we manufacture if we are not informed of the consequences and the possible dangers of what we are doing. I'm not crazy, I'm not saying lets halt the world, but we need to understand that its not just about global warming, when ecologists are warning us of what we are doing to the planet. We have rapidly interconnected this world in a way that has never before happened. There are risks and benefits to that. Scientists are trying to study and prepare for the next big one, but should the unthinkable happen (its not unthinkable, its more that we refuse to think of it) how are we, as a populace, prepared to respond? We need to consider this.And, man, wash your hands if you butcher something, okay?"
42,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60209410-jordan-buckley,4,"Good information on zoonotic diseases (diseases that live in animal hosts and can spread to humans), which are pretty relevant at the moment because COVID-19 is believed to be one. Many major diseases are zoonoses or started that way, including HIV, Ebola, rabies, Lyme disease, SARS, swine flu, etc.There were a few major takeaways for me. You can't eradicate a zoonotic disease if it's still silently thriving in some animal population (""reservoir host""). The pathogen may just live happily in one or more animal species without causing any obvious symptoms, but could be deadly if it infects humans. The other big takeaway is that human civilization and activity is often what unearths these diseases or gives them the opportunity to thrive. As we expand we move into forests and come into contact with animals that may carry all kinds of unknown pathogens. Our new methods of factory farming and cramming animals together in their own excrement creates new opportunities for these things to thrive and spread. Tragedies like the current pandemic aren't just ""acts of God"" that we have no control over; they are brought on by our own activity.Like most nonfiction books I read, I wish it was much shorter. The author does a good job of making it interesting, but I could have done without so much of the breathless recounting of the journalist's search for truth, tracking down different hypotheses, biographical descriptions of the various interviewees, the fanciful hypothetical story of the imagined ""voyager"" who brought HIV out of the jungle and into human civilization. The story of the SARS outbreak was interesting for comparison to COVID-19, and it was notable to see coronaviruses mentioned repeatedly among other candidates as a risk for the next pandemic."

Super, super relevant right now, and from my memory this book references EEE, though don't quote me. *Review*First things first. I hate when I look at a nonfiction book table of contents and can’t tell by the name of the chapters what they cover. For those who feel the same, here is the annotated table of contents:I. Pale Horse (Hendra virus)II. Thirteen Gorillas (Ebola virus)III. Everything Comes From Somewhere (Malaria)IV. Dinner at the Rat Farm (SARS)V. The Deer, the Parrot, & the Kid Next Door (Q Fever, Psittacosis, and Lyme disease)VI. Going Viral (General Virus Stuff, but Especially HIV)VII. Celestial Hosts (About Animals That Transmit Disease, Especially Bats, and Also Focuses on the Nipah virus)VIII. The Chimp and The River (HIV)IX. It Depends (Viruses of the Future)Onto the review.I wasn’t thinking about it when I snagged it at the library, but this was the perfect book to follow up The Hot Zone (and, in fact, this book references that one). That was a concentrated, focused look at one distinct family of viruses, the filoviruses. It was also more dramatized. This one takes that zoomed-in look and contextualizes it. Reminds us that 60% of all infections diseases that affect humans come from animals via zoonosis. Ebola, Marburg (the stars of The Hot Zone), rabies, hantavirus, anthrax, Lassa, Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, dengue, west nile, sars, typhus, mad cow disease, all forms of influenza, bubonic plague, Lyme disease, AIDS, and countless more. The author also points out something interesting- the diseases we’ve mostly eradicated, like smallpox and polio, are the rare ones that aren’t passed to humans by animals. That’s why we were able to eradicate them. People are easier to keep track of and vaccinate than animals. Nowhere for them to hide. Whereas Marburg or Ebola can lurk forever in hidden corners of caves, immortal. And why are these diseases popping up now? Practically all of these zoonotic (species-hopping) diseases are new. Like, zoonotic diseases barely existed at all before the 1960s, after which they started popping up everywhere in myriad forms. Why? Because we’re tearing apart ecosystems, breaking down the natural fabric of things, spreading ourselves where we ought not be a-spreadin’. These diseases had their natural hosts. They didn’t kill the hosts, they mostly lived in harmony with the host in some remote corner of the world. But when we wreck that natural host’s home and kill lots of them off, what’s a virus to do but to jump ship and latch onto humans if it wants to survive? Finally, I’d like to thank David Quammen for summarizing my feelings on life nicely: “Mathematics to me is like a language I don’t speak, though I admire its literature in translation.”"
46,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,5,"I try not to read books that make me paranoid or hypochondriac — and that's not the intention of this book — but I'll think twice next time that I'm in some exotic place and close to wild animals. The Monkey Forest in Bali was mentioned in this book in relation to herpes B (a deadly disease caused by a spillover from macaques monkeys to humans). Thanks goodness I feel a visceral revulsion towards monkeys. I didn't hand-feed any or let them climb up my head and shoulders so that I can take a picture with them. A little bite or scratch from the wrong monkey could seal your death sentence. This is a very well-researched, well-written, and highly-informative book on zoonosis — a pathogen leaping from an animal to humans. There have been recent scares with diseases like SARS and bird flu and swine flu that caused relatively limited damage and were contained. But you can never underestimate the danger of the Next Big One. We shouldn't forget that the Spanish flu at the end of the World War I killed by far more people than the war. As Quammen says, if you think we shouldn't concern ourselves too much with a local outbreak of an exotic disease like ebola that is caused by starving villagers in a remote corner of Congo eating a rotten dead chimp, the answer is: AIDS.The most interesting chapter of the book is the chapter on AIDS, which reads like a detective story. Here's the spoiler: the HIV virus first jumped from chimps to humans (quite likely when a hunter was butchering an infected chimp) somewhere in southeast Cameroon some time around 1908. What it was doing between then and the early 1980's when it became a global pandemic that has so far killed an estimated 35 million people is a fascinating story. "
47,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"Spillover is a well-written bio-thriller in the tradition of The Hot Zone, etc. It rehashes the same misleading theme of scary monster viruses waiting out there in the bushes to kill us all. It is good if you want a horror story, not if you want useful, accurate science about public health. As the subtitle indicates, it is focused on the hypothetical ""Next Big One"" but misses the point about what caused the actual Great Pandemic of 1918, repeating boilerplate nonsense about gene shifts etc. The demonstrably false idea that reassortment of the Hs and Ns in influenza virus is why you get a deadly pandemic is what caused the panics in 1976 and 2009 over the shift to H1N1. Both times there was no deadly pandemic. In 1976, the needless panic actually killed a bunch of people with a bad vaccine. In 2009, it cost billions and billions of dollars and created tremendous emotional stress for no apparent benefit. This is pretty obvious stuff. So why act as if nobody knows this and repeat old nonsense about what causes pandemics? The difference between a mild flu and a deadly one that kills 50 million people is not a reassortment of the genes. This is known. So what is the difference and how do we make germs be mild instead of lethal? That is a very important question, but you won't find the answer in this book. If you are interested in exploring this question, you may want to look at the TED talk by Paul Ewald: http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_ewald_a...."

It is scary, sure, because there are always new microbes out there ready to go rampaging through our vast society. It is also rather comforting, both the methodical search for vectors and reservoirs, the details of transmission and treatment, the stream of breakthroughs that enable researchers to locate and sequence. And through it all, Quammen maintains a casual, light conversational tone, reassuring the reader that sure, horrible new diseases can (and will) spring up seemingly out of nowhere to spread around the world, but that also we have been pretty good at controlling those sorts of outbreaks.There's quite a lot about Ebola here, written before this summer's outbreak. It should prove very comforting to everyone whose loved ones are not currently infected. I heap praise upon him for pointing out that it isn't nearly as grotesque as Preston painted it in The Hot Zone.The only part I really disliked was the pure fiction of The Voyager, which was too long and added nothing. This was particularly annoying as I was nearing the end and racing to finish quickly before the future biologist usurped in entirely.Library copyI don't usually comment on covers, but I will say that Chip Kidd managed to make a very disturbing one."

David Quammen convincingly argues that the greatest bugaboo for the human race should be a zoonosis, an infectious disease that spills over from an animal population into humans. He travels around the world and talks to scientists who have worked in the virus-riddled trenches of HIV, malaria, Ebola, SARS, and an ever-growing list of other nasties with shocking fatality rates. Particularly interesting is Quammen's notion that the historical rate of human population growth is itself an outbreak. We've proliferated like mad - at a speed unprecedented for a large mammal species. And what scientists know about outbreaks is that they always come to an end... While layman accessible, this detailed and hefty book takes perseverance, but it's well worth it for the amount of information you'll get in return. I'm going to go wash my hands now.

Back to my original review:Zoonotic pathogens, those that travel from other animals to human animals, have been with us, will be with us, have killed millions of people, will kill millions more. I read half of this book on the topic and got really really bored. Each chapter was ""And here's another example"" ""and here's yet another example."" He tried to spice that up with turning searching for the animal source of the pathogen into a mystery and by getting personal about the researchers (that is, applying fictional techniques to non fiction), but it couldn't disguise for me that it was all ""and here's another example."" I got the point by page 100. So I got past page 300 and then skimmed the rest. It's not badly written...it just got a bit boring for me.Here's the take-away advice I gleaned:1) Try to calm down. That zoonosis exists is largely beyond your control.2) To the extent you can control things: first, quit overbreeding. Overbreeding leads to human encroachment upon ecosystems where disease has happily been at equilibrium for tens of thousands of years. Overbreeding is awful for many reasons, but if you needed another, well, here's another. Overbreeders are bad world citizens.3) Don't, for heaven's sake, eat unusual game meat, particularly not game you find mysteriously dead on the ground with blood around its mouth. Also, glove/mask when treating sick domestic animals, yes, even beloved Fluffy, and when Fluffy does succumb, avoid kissing her bloody muzzle goodbye.4) Be rich and insured and ideally connected to the government in a first world country--not only can you buy farmed/ranched meat that's inspected and safe, if you do get sick, you'll get the best treatment available.5) That 33% of Americans aren't insured means the coming pandemic is going to be worse and spread faster and kill more here than in civilized countries where all citizens have access to health care. Not his point in the first 300 pages, but any thinking person can see it.6) Commercial airliners are really that dangerous for spreading disease--avoid if you can and rethink what ""vacation"" means to you. Sure, any given flight probably won't next Patient X on it...but it might. Is it really that important to board that plane?7) Religion helps spread pandemics because people pray and wallow in superstition instead of of getting treatment. When the next epidemic comes, pray/chant/positive-think/sacrifice a goat all you want, but not in a crowd, and get treatment, too."
52,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85488700-derrick-stormblessed,5,"What a frightful but entertaining read!! David Quammen is a brilliant scientist and storyteller all at once. He weaves narrative storytelling and science seamlessly like its the easiest thing ever. That's the source of the overall brilliance of the book. Quammen manages to use his own personal experiences with disease scientists at the centre of the research and others in the thick of things to make the book more entertaining. Billy Karesh studying chimps in Moba Bai, Beatrice Hahn at the heart of AIDS research, Engel and Jones-Engel a husband and wife team from New York investigating prevalence of a monkey virus in Bangladesh temples, a Chinese scientist searching for the reservoir of SARS, an Australian vet who survived the Hendra virus, etcThe book is basically about how animal diseases jump or spillover into humans. He narrates how these diseases, commonly classified as zoonoses first appeared on the scene and how people react to these diseases in the beginning, how scientific research unfolded and how they escalated into global epidemics in some cases. He also discusses the tiny pathogens responsible and their evolution into killer monsters. He deals with a long list of deadly diseases like Hendra, Ebola, malaria, AIDS, Lyme disease, Q fever, SARS, etc. All dangerous and potentially lethal bugs if not dealt with properly. A few themes appear throughout the book. One of them is how humans interfere with nature, eat what they are not supposed to or encroach on wild habitats. It's clear we are having more contact with animals, both domestic and wild, and this is one of the reasons why certain diseases have spilled over into humans. And also why in the future probably more lethal pathogens will spill over. As humans, we need to understand the nature of ecosystems better and try not to interfere with wildlife habitats. These diseases have killed millions and millions of people and it's clear that these bugs especially viruses have the upper hand over us and we should be weary of the potential devastation involved. Zoonotic diseases will continue to spill over in future. But how ling before we come across a pathogen capable of annihilating all of humankind?"

Quammen manages to make it understandable and compelling all at the same time. He helps the reader to understand the seriousness of the topic - and it is really serious -- without feeling alarmist. The book was published in 2012, so well before our current pandemic. After reading this, I feel much better equipped to decipher and understand the current reporting on COVID - 19, to make more educated decisions about what I am seeing on my news feed, to know when to be skeptical, and what my role can be in minimizing risk and spread (significant in all viruses with human to human transmission). I highly recommend this book if you want to understand more about viruses - their impact, their trajectory, and our options. With something as serious as what we are currently facing, I wanted more information that newspaper headlines and I wanted it to be, as much as possible, free from the political positioning -- just give me the science and the history so I can improve my context. Quammen did that exceptionally well. "

55,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3397530-lea,3,"This is a very interesting analysis of emerging zoonotic diseases, focusing on SARS, HIV, and Ebola, among others. There are so many facts here, it's a little overwhelming -- I learned so much that I'd never even thought of before, including the fact that HIV can actually be traced back to, wait for it . . . 1908?! Yeah, I didn't believe it at first, either, but the author clearly presents this in a way that is easy even for a non-scientist like myself to understand.After reading this, I can tell you for sure that I will NEVER go anywhere near a bat again -- these beautiful animals are apparently THE virus clearinghouse, for reasons that are explored in depth in this book.Ever wonder why we were able to effectively eradicate smallpox, but can't seem to put an end to malaria? Yep, it's in here.Here are a couple of quotes from the end of the book that I found interesting:""So before we respond either calmly or hysterically, either intelligently or doltishly, we should understand in some measure the basic outlines and dynamics of the situation. We should appreciate that these recent outbreaks of new zoonotic diseases, as well as the recurrence and spread of old ones, are part of a larger pattern, and that humanity is responsible for generating that pattern. We should recognize that they reflect things that we're DOING, not just things that are HAPPENING to us. WE should understand that, although some of the human-caused factors may seem virtually inexorable, others are within our control.""""That's the salubrious thing about zoonotic diseases: They remind us, as St. Francis did, that we humans are inseparable from the natural world. In fact, there IS no ""natural world,"" it's a bad and artificial phrase. There is only the world."""" . . . Dwyer's models have shown that heterogeneity of behavior, even among forest insects, let alone among humans, can be very important in damping the spread of infectious disease. . . . individual effort, individual discernment, individual choice can have huge effects in averting the catastrophes that might otherwise sweep through a herd. An individual gypsy moth may inherit a slightly superior ability to avoid smears of NPV as it grazes on a leaf. An individual human may choose not to drink the palm sap, not to eat the chimpanzee, not to pen the pig beneath mango trees, not to clear the horse's windpipe with his bare hand, not to have unprotected sex with the prostitute, not to share the needle in a shooting gallery, not to cough without covering her mouth, not to board a plane while feeling ill, or not to coop his chickens along with his ducks. ""Any tiny little thing that people do,"" Dwyer said, if it makes them different from one another, from the idealized standard of herd behavior, ""is going to reduce infection rates."" ""So why only three stars? David Quammen -- I wanted to add his author link right there, but GR won't let me, but go look him up because he's written a ton of interesting books -- is more than capable of writing a non-fiction book that would hold anyone's interest, yet he insists on inserting some extremely long passages of pure fiction as he speculates on the exact circumstances leading to the emergence of HIV-1. My husband will tell you, I'm more of a ""just the facts"" kind of person -- I neither need nor want speculation, especially when the facts are compelling on their own. If that kind of thing doesn't bother you, you may rate this one higher.Even with that, I would still recommend this."
56,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,4,"This book is about zoonoses--illnesses that spread from animals to people. It describes the typical process: the virus or bacteria lives, long-term and harmlessly, in a reservoir species. When it infects an amplifier species, it can spread more quickly to humans. For example, the Hendra virus has its reservoir in flying foxes (large Australian bats), but when it infects horses, it can spread to people, who are in much closer contact with their sick horses than with bats. Not only are zoonoses threatening because new ones can appear unexpectedly (like SARS or HIV), they are also essentially impossible to eradicate, unlike (say) polio, which is only found in humans, whom you can vaccinate. Bats come off rather badly in this book. In the past, I've learned that you should like them because they eat harmful insects. It turns out that they are the source of all sorts of nasty bugs, in the virus sense of the word.Quammen writes quite a bit about his travels to research the book, or how one scientist introduces him to another. Not only does this give the book a bit of a travelogue feeling, it also acknowledges the essential contributions of the people who tranquilize angry macaques or go out in the middle of the night to rig up bat nets--without which none of the science would have happened. His style is vivid and entertaining, though there's one passage in the chapter about HIV/AIDS that is strangely novelistic. Not bad, just incongruous and unnecessary.Nothing in this book will make you change your behavior, unless you are remiss about handwashing or routinely eat things bats have shat on. At the end the author emphasizes: ""The purpose of this book is not to make you more worried. The purpose of this book is to make you more smart. That's what most distinguishes humans from, say, tent caterpillars and gypsy moths. Unlike them, we can be pretty smart."" I didn't find this book particularly scary--just informative--so don't avoid it just on those grounds.To the extent it contains a call to action, the book reminds us that human pressure on ecological systems creates havoc. A relatively short section deals with Lyme disease and reveals the startling conclusion that Lyme flourishes in isolated areas. Think the islands in a parking lot rather than a forest. It's where we come in contact with ecologies that we've disrupted that we find zoonoses.P.S. Bonus points for sending me to the dictionary: ""cadastral.""P.P.S. Further bonus points for this sentence, even if the sentiment isn't new: ""[A]nyone who favors Intelligent Design in lieu of evolution might pause to wonder why God devoted so much of His intelligence to designing malarial parasites."""
57,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1182891-sue,5,"This book is a gripping tale of disease “spillover” that will thrill those interested in science – and probably many who aren’t. After all, we all get sick occasionally. Quammen looks at the ways pathogens (usually viruses) have spilled from animals to humans. He traces the origins of, among others, Ebola, SARS, bird flu, Lyme disease, and AIDS. These zoonotic diseases can escalate rapidly into global pandemics when human-to-human transmission occurs. For five years Quammen trailed scientists in their labs and in the field. Worldwide exchange of information turns out to be essential in epidemiology, and the solution to mysterious epidemics often means gathering data in far-flung places. Quammen himself traveled to China, to Bangladesh, to the Congo, to Connecticut. Data moves among such places, and so did the author. Everywhere there is mystery, drama, and good science.A long chapter (more than 20% of the book) traces the origins of HIV to a chimpanzee in Cameroon in the early 20th century. It’s a fascinating story. The author first tracked the evidence, working with scientists as they examined tissue samples that showed the spillover to be not in the 1980s, when the Western world first encountered it, but in the first decade of the 20th century. Quammen then allowed himself to think through a possible scenario which would have brought the virus down river to the Congo, initially moving slowly because its carriers might have died early of other causes, because the virus moved through areas of low population density, because it did not yet have the opportunity afforded by global travel and multiple sex partners.Ten years ago I had to abort a trip to Vietnam and China because of SARS, so the episode was very personal to me. That dread virus ran a deadly but short course. It turned out that the disease was transmissible after the person became ill, so it was eventually within the power of the health system to halt the spread. But it could reemerge. Civets, a diet delicacy blamed initially for the disease, turned out to be “amplifier” hosts but not “reservoir” hosts. This latter term applies to animals who host and live amicably with a virus which may cause great mischief in humans. For SARS, the reservoir was a bat, the amplifier was a civet, and the human who ate the civet was an unlucky, violently ill person. In fact, the eating of exotic (and often illegal) meats was a persistent theme in the entire book.As a non-scientist, I’ve possibly gotten a couple of things wrong in this review. Apologies. But I am pretty sure I’m going to be paying attention to the news about epidemics – as well as to, for example, ticks or exotic meats."
58,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17766893-matty-swytla,5,"A very good bok with scientific, yet approachable explanations to why zoonoses (animal diseases that infect humans) are so scary and deadly, especially when it comes to certain new viruses. The fact is zoonotic viruses and other diseases infect humans on a regular basis. I know; I was infected with ringworm (Dermatophytosis) by my kittens a few years ago - it's a fungal infection that spreads like fire. No fun but no biggie either. But any pet owner knows the drill on vaccinations for rabies and other diseases for dogs and cats. Some of these make the jump to humans with devastating results.The differences between carriers, natural reservoirs, and amplifiers is fascinating and illuminating. Some animals only spread viruses, bacteria or other illness-inducing organisms (mosquitoes for malaria); others live with them, a certain population of infected yet not very ill reservoirs from whence other animals and humans can get infected (bats, monkeys); while some animals get very ill and spread the infections further (amplifiers - often some domestic animals like pigs or poultry). It's important to make the distinction bewteen these or we won't know where to fight the disease in the first place. The book highlights why we should care about natural habitats, treat our animals with care, and not board a plane when feeling sick (!), but it doesn't fear-monger in any way. Yes, it does point out what people should or shouldn't do, what are the risk factors for contracting some exotic diseases, but it also highlights that ordinary diseases kill far more people than ebola, for example. Coronary disease, cancers, diabetes, traffic accidents... familiar killers we've gotten used to don't scare us as they should, while the thought of contracting a virus from a bat makes some people fear them like the plague. What the author makes clear time and time again is that local farmers in some god-forsaken parts of third-world countries (but in the West as well - not everyone is an epidemiologist or veterinarian) can't understand the full impact of an outbreak among their flock before it spreads. So education is key, and fast response from laboratories, research facilites, and medical institutions. I was amazed how much difference fast cooperation among scientists and medical doctors makes in terms of outbreak containment. Why doesn't the media highlight these achievements more and make people interested in science? What will it take? The next big virus or outbreak is just around the corner - it may be our ordinary flu not ebola."

Certainly, relevant to the current situation particularly the sections about bats. The organization and pace of the book is good. It’s a mix of information, interviews and the author’s experiences while observing the scientists at work. I usually don’t like author’s personal experiences in works like this, but since he focuses on the research itself it’s not too irritating. The writing is readable if a bit too snarky at times. The content is great. I learned a lot about viruses and the research behind figuring out pandemics. It’s all very interesting. This book exceeded my expectations.  So, I give this a 4.

But as much as I can decide it DID make the reading easier than most material in this genre, it also holds another quality I thought was a considerable distraction from that positive prose form. Quammen has a kind of tone that's strange to read (it was for me) and quite difficult to describe. It's not Chicken Little on meth (or a hate rant like Gerta Thunberg either) but it's not a logical nor scientific bottom line ""norm"" either. If I'm overstating that, I'm sorry.

And it some cases it seems to me, that this emotive occludes to some of the very actual world reality of how MOST virus pass into pandemic outcomes. And how they did in the past, as well. Like the 1918 and the other human influenza forms that went lethal since. There are huge portions of this book that read like a memoir and travelogue. It's just not direct to the title at all, immense pages of asides/ tangents.The history of some of the worst spillovers (like Hendra or other bat vector virus) were the best and most accurate parts- and I am glad I read it for the understanding of how an intermediate ""amplify"" animal is also usually a HUGE part of the ""it depends"" serendipity that results in these horrific outcomes. First a small ""usual"" mammal, then a mid vector animal and then other species- such as monkeys/apes or humans.It's not a book I would necessarily recommend. His personality and slant, I just feel, is containing quite a bit of ""group think"" and not enough science. But now I do comprehend more easily the trail through 3 or 4 species this virus morph road can take."
62,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3230750-molly,5,"Thrilled to see that David Quammen had a new science book, I snatched this up. It’s been 15 years since his book ""Song of the Dodo” about island biogeography, which remains at the top of my favorite non-fiction. Can one *enjoy* a book about infectious disease? Anyone who's read Richard Preston's “The Hot Zone” will guiltily admit, yes (interestingly, he takes Preston to task for overplaying descriptions of Ebola infection. “Bleeding out"" is not accurate.)There is inherent narrative drama in the question of when the Next Big One (NBO) will hit and in the epidemiological sleuthing to identify viruses and their host animals when an epidemic breaks. What will turn a local outbreak into a pandemic? Do scientists think there IS a NBO lurking? Quite possibly. And if so, it will assuredly originate in animals, as has almost all human infectious disease. Influenza, SARS, Marburg, Lyme disease - Quammen covers them all and more, and turns up startling facts. For one, the subtitle of his book could just as well be, ""From Bats to Humans."" But what put the book over the top in excellence and dramatic page-turning was the penultimate chapter on the origin of AIDS. In some ways the whole book was moving toward this chapter. The origins of HIV can now be pinned to a year (much earlier than you’d think) and a single spillover event; chimp to human. And Quammen makes the poignant and chilling case that lest you wonder why we should care about exotic diseases such as Marbug, consider the exponential trajectory and devastation of AIDS. It too is a zoonotic disease, but one that has moved more slowly than an airborne NBO will surely do. Despite the theme – lively and buoyant writing. In other words, it’s readable. Quammen remains a master of science journalism. "
63,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/259402-sebastien,5,"Superb! David Quammen brings to life the stories of a wide variety of infectious diseases and their spillover from animals to humans. David is a great writer, his narrative drive and prose are magnificent. He does this while presenting the science in a very accessible yet amazingly informative way.What is astounding is the amount of work and research that must have gone into this book. David conducted a seemingly endless amount of interviews with scientists, researchers, doctors. To say he took it to the next level, well that is a vast understatement. This is science journalism/writing at its pinnacle.My particular favorite was the section on the ecology of borrelia (lyme). This is a subject that hits close to home for me.The section on malaria was very intriguing, learned a lot. The coolest thing was learning that a form of malaria had been used as therapy to treat syphilis (a form of therapy known as pyrotherapy). That blew my mind. If you're curious, here's an article on the subject: http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/bod...I was also fascinated by the HIV chapter. Could have done without his hypothesizing and reimagining of the original patient 0 story, I saw what he was trying to do, but that seemed a bit clunky and unnecessary. But that's a minor quibble with an otherwise outstanding book. Dang, the ebola chapter was incredible as well... so much good stuff in here."

Well, viruses and bacteria fascinate me and I'm piling up titles about the subject: Spillover is so far one of the best.

It is longer than most science/ medicine books, but do not let that deter you. I was extremely sad when this book ended. I wanted more!In the middle of reading this book, I made the mistake of putting this book on pause to read the more recent Pandemic by Sonia Shah. Science is obviously not the authors strong suit. It was extremely disappointing. It might fly with people who are less scientifically literate. She had more up to date info on Ebola, which might draw in a huge readership, but her book doesn't hold a candle to this book. Quammen's book is a big WOW, on every level. When I finally returned from Pandemic, I was in such a foul mood, it was detracting from my enjoyment of this book. That only lasted for a little bit. I could not help but get sucked right back into all of Quammen's case studies and histories of various outbreaks. This book was well researched, extremely thorough, scientifically sound, well written, and entertaining as hell. His passion for his subject spilled over into every page and into me. I do not even want to give a summary of all the wonder inside this book because he tells the story of each virus so well, anything I would relate here feels like an actual spoiler. It is a must read!

67,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"Where Do ""Emerging Diseases"" Emerge From?AIDS, Ebola, Marburg, SARS, H5N1 — every one of the world’s scariest diseases is a “zoonosis,” that is, a virus harbored by animals and transmitted to humans, often by other animals, in a complex minuet that often stretches out into decades.AIDS, for example. According to the latest research, reported by David Quammen in Spillover, Patient Zero was not that French-Canadian flight attendant you may have read about who went amok in the 1970s but a hunter in Southeast Cameroon around 1908 who killed a chimpanzee and somehow unwittingly allowed the animal’s blood to seep into his own circulatory system, either through a cut or by eating his prey’s raw flesh. This is the phenomenon that epidemiologists call “spillover.” At that point, a particularly virulent form of a recently emergent simian virus found a friendly and familiar environment in the hunter’s blood and flourished, becoming what we know today as HIV-1 (the more lethal form of the virus that causes AIDS). Later, the hunter passed along the virus to one or more women through sexual contact, and the disease slowly spread, both by sex and by transmission through reused needles, undetected as anything out of the ordinary, from Cameroon into what is now called the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and other sub-Saharan countries, and thence by happenstance to Haiti. It was a Haitian harboring HIV-1 who probably passed it along to that notorious Canadian flight attendant, setting off the epidemic among gay men in North America.In Spillover, Quammen tells tales like these in fascinating detail, relating the stories of the often-heroic scientists, physicians, and veterinarians who worked directly with deadly diseases, occasionally at the cost of their own lives. Quammen spent years writing this book. He appears to have read all the relevant scientific literature, attended specialized scientific conferences, and spent long hours tracking down and speaking face-to-face with the people who discovered these diseases, isolated the viruses, first treated the symptoms, and labored for thankless years on end in laboratories around the world to help humanity avert the next pandemic.You may have read Richard Preston’s best-selling 2001 treatment of the emergence of Ebola in The Hot Zone. If not, I can tell you that I vividly recall the book because it was so dramatic, and so terrifying. No doubt I had nightmares about contracting Ebola. But it turns out, according to Quammen and to the eminent scientists he interviewed, that Preston’s account was sensationalized and highly inaccurate in essential details. For example, he described tears of blood, massive hemorrhages, and melted internal organs, none of which has any basis in fact.However, Spillover, in its own way, is no less frightening. Quammen advances the popular theory that what appears to be the accelerating emergence of dangerous new pathogens became inevitable as a result of the enormous population growth of homo sapiens — because humanity has increasingly encroached on animal habitat and come into intimate contact with animals as never before. In discussions with noted biologists, he explores the concept of “breakout,” the explosive growth frequently seen in some animal species that shortly leads to sudden, catastrophic — through disease. He intimates that, with AIDS — or, all too possibly, with the next pandemic — humankind may experience something similar. Despite all the horrific details about AIDS, Ebola, Marburg, and the like, these are the book’s scariest passages.David Quammen writes about science, nature, and travel — a total of 10 nonfiction books and five novels to date. A former Rhodes Scholar, he was educated at Yale and Oxford.(From www.malwarwickonbooks.com)"
68,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58119141-elena-sala,5,"SPILLOVER: ANIMAL INFECTIONS AND THE NEXT HUMAN PANDEMIC (2012) was the result of David Quammen's five years of research interviewing scientists who were looking into the possibility of another horrific Ebola-type disease emerging. At that time, believe it or not, there was a widespread consensus: there would indeed be a new disease, likely from the coronavirus family, coming out of a bat, and it would likely emerge in or around a wet market in China. So, how could the world be SO unprepared for this nightmarish pandemic?? This book was written 8 years before this pandemic so it does not attempt to answer this question. Though we can probably guess some possible answers.This book is about zoonoses, infectious diseases that originate in animals and spread to humans. Rabies, for example, is a zoonotic disease. HIV is also a zoonotic disease. Dengue, yellow fever, malaria, influenza, Lyme disease, MERS, SARS, Zika and COVID are all zoonoses. The technical term scientists use to describe the leap of a pathogen from one animal to another is “spillover”. Most infections start as spillovers. Some, like Ebola and lesser-known viral diseases (Nipah, Hendra, Marburg), are highly transmissible and virulent, but so far have been limited to sporadic outbreaks. They persist because they are endemic in a reservoir population through a process of mutual adaptation.Quammen explores the correlation between these diseases that come up one after the other. It should not come as a surprise that they are not mere accidents but unwanted consequences of our actions. How do these pathogens make the leap from animals to humans? Quammen's answer: ""we invade tropical forests and other wild landscapes, which harbor so many species of animals and plants. And within those creatures, so many viruses. We cut the trees, we kill the animals or cage them and send them to markets. We disrupt ecosystems and we shake viruses loose from their natural hosts. When that happens, they need a new host. Often, we are it.” And why does this seem to be happening more frequently in recent times? The answer, again in Quammen's own words is: ""there’s 7.8 billion of us on this planet—four times the number of humans at the time of the 1918 influenza. And we have quadrupled the speed we travel around the planet; we have quadrupled the size of some of our cities. So there are a lot more of us large-bodied vertebrate animals, living in dense aggregations, moving fluidly from one place to another... We’re the world’s greatest target for a virus—a great ecosystem for them to colonize. So when a virus does get into a human and finds it can replicate and transmit to the next human, that virus has opened the door to vast opportunity.""Quammen's journeys have taken him all around the world: inside the air-locked sterility of high-security biological research labs, through the crowded alleyways of Chinese live animal markets, into remote African and Asian villages that have experienced outbreaks of some of the most lethal diseases yet known to mankind. He has interviewed survivors of these diseases and the scientists doing all the research. He has been a science writer for over 35 years, interested in ecology and evolutionary biology. He uses a conversational tone and, occasionally, some dark humor to give a frightening and eye opening summary of all that is known about these zoonotic diseases. This is a book I highly recommend, not only because it is written in an engaging and accessible way, sober, rational yet suspenseful, but because it is clear that COVID will not be the last pandemic we will see. There will be more zoonoses because we are disrupting the environment more and more. So we need to think about our own responsibility and how we relate to our environment. Each one of us has a responsibility, because we are all consumers of food, resources, and energy. Each of the choices that we make about what we’re going to eat, wear, or buy draws on these wild ecosystems. This book invites the reader to think about these choices while explaining how we got into this mess in the first place."

It would be really hard at this point to not know about Coronavirus and the pandemic it caused and its likely source from animals (probably bats). This has been a problem we have been aware of for quite some time with flu strains and aids, and Lyme disease, and zika virus, and ebola, and Marburg virus the list goes on. Only now the point is hammered home in a pandemic and a world-historical economic crisis. Some of us knew better but as usual, people didn't heed the warnings. They almost never do."
70,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,4,"The hubris of homo sapiens lies in believing that it holds sway over this planet but then hidden away from anything but the most powerful electron microscopes are organisms that can wreak havoc on all of us. These microorganisms are hardy, smart and incredibly adaptable when it comes to the question of how to survive and thrive among the biodiversity of the earth. If you were to romanticize the whole concept then it becomes very easy to paint the pathogen as the most dreaded enemy of mankind/ nature’s revenge on us etc. However, a rational perspective tells a story which is entirely different and utterly fascinating in a deadly way. The microorganism’s capability to jump across species to man and thereby begin devastating outbreaks is the premise of the book and the scientific term for such a happening is Zoonosis. In the words of the author about the need of such a book :  Why obsess about Zoonoses ? In the larger balance of miseries, what makes anyone think they should be taken so seriously ? It’s a fair question but there are good answers. Some of those answers are intricate and speculative. Some are subjective. Others are objective and blunt. The bluntest is this : AIDS. Let’s look at some zoonotic diseases other than AIDS : Ebola, Marburg, Avian and Swine Flu, SARS, Malaria, Hendra are but a few of them. All of these are without doubt some of the deadliest killer that we have encountered. David Quammen does a book length investigation into the history, nature and where we stand in the understanding of the microorganisms which cause these diseases. Quammen’s writing style is approachable and far less sensational than what I encountered with Richard Preston’s Hot Zone. While Preston horrified and thrilled me, Quammen offers a more informative and grounded view at the pathogens and their effects. He also travels far and wide for his research and converses with recovered patients, eyewitnesses, doctors and scientists and ergo a much more well-rounded view of what actually transpires during a disease outbreak comes to light. Of special mention is the chapter named The Chimp and River which is an in depth detective story that traces the journey of HIV from the jungles of Africa into the world at large. There are two things about the book that really caught my attention : • The number of mice and monkeys that die in the name of betterment and advancement of science in this book is huge. There were times when I paused and wondered if more of these hapless animals perish than humans.• Quammen is a first rate travel writer. His descriptions of Asia and Africa are measured views of anthropology, wildlife and the inevitable clash between the two.Parts of the book especially on the mathematical connects between the nature of mass outbreaks and about the lifecycles of viruses were difficult to comprehend. But that aside this is a fantastic book to understand how much nature has in store which man has no idea of. It also corrected for me the notion that nature uses viruses to eventually get back at humans ( courtesy Richard Preston). A virus is a non-thinking organism and one for which in a majority of the cases, a human host is next to an evolutionary dead end. It just so happens that with our invasive lifestyle, we breach the habitats of the virus and get caught in their snares.Recommended."
71,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,5,"I see why Quammen is so well thought of. Spillover was amazingly informative, had a near perfect execution, explained very difficult, scientific subjects in a manner that a reader with little science background could understand without making it so dumbed down that the same reader found themselves lost in a nexus of weakening metaphors and feeling insulted (I'm looking at you, Winchester). This is how you speak to your audience! You do not dumbdown, but rather heighten the discourse and inform. I learned so much, and was so in awe of what I was learning, and the research that was done by Quammen, and even more by the researching actively trying to save us from the ""Next Big One"" that nightly over dinner I'd tell my husband excitedly that he just HAD to read Spillover, because did you know this or that about ebola? Its the only audiobook that I have honestly considered restarting immediately. There is just so much to process here, so much that I realize I just didn't know, and so much more that I could learn from a second reading.This is a book that I think every person should read. There is as much (if not more) human interest as science, it can honestly keep you on the edge of your seat. I love nature, but it can be such a scary place without considering that maybe you just inhaled infected bat shit or dust from an aborted goat. But its also a beautiful place, where ecology matters, where there is balance, and as the eruption of human population continues (presumably unchecked for now) that balance is disturbed. I cannot stress enough, especially during this election cycle, how important an informed populace is. How can we make decisions in domestic protection, how we raise our livestock, how we tour, how we travel across the globe, how we transport EVERYTHING, how we mine, and how we manufacture if we are not informed of the consequences and the possible dangers of what we are doing. I'm not crazy, I'm not saying lets halt the world, but we need to understand that its not just about global warming, when ecologists are warning us of what we are doing to the planet. We have rapidly interconnected this world in a way that has never before happened. There are risks and benefits to that. Scientists are trying to study and prepare for the next big one, but should the unthinkable happen (its not unthinkable, its more that we refuse to think of it) how are we, as a populace, prepared to respond? We need to consider this.And, man, wash your hands if you butcher something, okay?"
72,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60209410-jordan-buckley,4,"Good information on zoonotic diseases (diseases that live in animal hosts and can spread to humans), which are pretty relevant at the moment because COVID-19 is believed to be one. Many major diseases are zoonoses or started that way, including HIV, Ebola, rabies, Lyme disease, SARS, swine flu, etc.There were a few major takeaways for me. You can't eradicate a zoonotic disease if it's still silently thriving in some animal population (""reservoir host""). The pathogen may just live happily in one or more animal species without causing any obvious symptoms, but could be deadly if it infects humans. The other big takeaway is that human civilization and activity is often what unearths these diseases or gives them the opportunity to thrive. As we expand we move into forests and come into contact with animals that may carry all kinds of unknown pathogens. Our new methods of factory farming and cramming animals together in their own excrement creates new opportunities for these things to thrive and spread. Tragedies like the current pandemic aren't just ""acts of God"" that we have no control over; they are brought on by our own activity.Like most nonfiction books I read, I wish it was much shorter. The author does a good job of making it interesting, but I could have done without so much of the breathless recounting of the journalist's search for truth, tracking down different hypotheses, biographical descriptions of the various interviewees, the fanciful hypothetical story of the imagined ""voyager"" who brought HIV out of the jungle and into human civilization. The story of the SARS outbreak was interesting for comparison to COVID-19, and it was notable to see coronaviruses mentioned repeatedly among other candidates as a risk for the next pandemic."

Super, super relevant right now, and from my memory this book references EEE, though don't quote me. *Review*First things first. I hate when I look at a nonfiction book table of contents and can’t tell by the name of the chapters what they cover. For those who feel the same, here is the annotated table of contents:I. Pale Horse (Hendra virus)II. Thirteen Gorillas (Ebola virus)III. Everything Comes From Somewhere (Malaria)IV. Dinner at the Rat Farm (SARS)V.

Celestial Hosts (About Animals That Transmit Disease, Especially Bats, and Also Focuses on the Nipah virus)VIII. The Chimp and The River (HIV)IX. It Depends (Viruses of the Future)Onto the review.I wasn’t thinking about it when I snagged it at the library, but this was the perfect book to follow up The Hot Zone (and, in fact, this book references that one). That was a concentrated, focused look at one distinct family of viruses, the filoviruses. It was also more dramatized. This one takes that zoomed-in look and contextualizes it. Reminds us that 60% of all infections diseases that affect humans come from animals via zoonosis. Ebola, Marburg (the stars of The Hot Zone), rabies, hantavirus, anthrax, Lassa, Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, dengue, west nile, sars, typhus, mad cow disease, all forms of influenza, bubonic plague, Lyme disease, AIDS, and countless more. The author also points out something interesting- the diseases we’ve mostly eradicated, like smallpox and polio, are the rare ones that aren’t passed to humans by animals. That’s why we were able to eradicate them. People are easier to keep track of and vaccinate than animals. Nowhere for them to hide. Whereas Marburg or Ebola can lurk forever in hidden corners of caves, immortal. And why are these diseases popping up now? Practically all of these zoonotic (species-hopping) diseases are new. Like, zoonotic diseases barely existed at all before the 1960s, after which they started popping up everywhere in myriad forms. Why? Because we’re tearing apart ecosystems, breaking down the natural fabric of things, spreading ourselves where we ought not be a-spreadin’. These diseases had their natural hosts. They didn’t kill the hosts, they mostly lived in harmony with the host in some remote corner of the world. But when we wreck that natural host’s home and kill lots of them off, what’s a virus to do but to jump ship and latch onto humans if it wants to survive? Finally, I’d like to thank David Quammen for summarizing my feelings on life nicely: “Mathematics to me is like a language I don’t speak, though I admire its literature in translation.”"
76,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,5,"I try not to read books that make me paranoid or hypochondriac — and that's not the intention of this book — but I'll think twice next time that I'm in some exotic place and close to wild animals. The Monkey Forest in Bali was mentioned in this book in relation to herpes B (a deadly disease caused by a spillover from macaques monkeys to humans). Thanks goodness I feel a visceral revulsion towards monkeys. I didn't hand-feed any or let them climb up my head and shoulders so that I can take a picture with them. A little bite or scratch from the wrong monkey could seal your death sentence. This is a very well-researched, well-written, and highly-informative book on zoonosis — a pathogen leaping from an animal to humans. There have been recent scares with diseases like SARS and bird flu and swine flu that caused relatively limited damage and were contained. But you can never underestimate the danger of the Next Big One. We shouldn't forget that the Spanish flu at the end of the World War I killed by far more people than the war. As Quammen says, if you think we shouldn't concern ourselves too much with a local outbreak of an exotic disease like ebola that is caused by starving villagers in a remote corner of Congo eating a rotten dead chimp, the answer is: AIDS.The most interesting chapter of the book is the chapter on AIDS, which reads like a detective story. Here's the spoiler: the HIV virus first jumped from chimps to humans (quite likely when a hunter was butchering an infected chimp) somewhere in southeast Cameroon some time around 1908. What it was doing between then and the early 1980's when it became a global pandemic that has so far killed an estimated 35 million people is a fascinating story. "
77,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"Spillover is a well-written bio-thriller in the tradition of The Hot Zone, etc. It rehashes the same misleading theme of scary monster viruses waiting out there in the bushes to kill us all. It is good if you want a horror story, not if you want useful, accurate science about public health. As the subtitle indicates, it is focused on the hypothetical ""Next Big One"" but misses the point about what caused the actual Great Pandemic of 1918, repeating boilerplate nonsense about gene shifts etc. The demonstrably false idea that reassortment of the Hs and Ns in influenza virus is why you get a deadly pandemic is what caused the panics in 1976 and 2009 over the shift to H1N1. Both times there was no deadly pandemic. In 1976, the needless panic actually killed a bunch of people with a bad vaccine. In 2009, it cost billions and billions of dollars and created tremendous emotional stress for no apparent benefit. This is pretty obvious stuff. So why act as if nobody knows this and repeat old nonsense about what causes pandemics? The difference between a mild flu and a deadly one that kills 50 million people is not a reassortment of the genes. This is known. So what is the difference and how do we make germs be mild instead of lethal? That is a very important question, but you won't find the answer in this book. If you are interested in exploring this question, you may want to look at the TED talk by Paul Ewald: http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_ewald_a...."

It is scary, sure, because there are always new microbes out there ready to go rampaging through our vast society. It is also rather comforting, both the methodical search for vectors and reservoirs, the details of transmission and treatment, the stream of breakthroughs that enable researchers to locate and sequence. And through it all, Quammen maintains a casual, light conversational tone, reassuring the reader that sure, horrible new diseases can (and will) spring up seemingly out of nowhere to spread around the world, but that also we have been pretty good at controlling those sorts of outbreaks.There's quite a lot about Ebola here, written before this summer's outbreak. It should prove very comforting to everyone whose loved ones are not currently infected. I heap praise upon him for pointing out that it isn't nearly as grotesque as Preston painted it in The Hot Zone.The only part I really disliked was the pure fiction of The Voyager, which was too long and added nothing.

He travels around the world and talks to scientists who have worked in the virus-riddled trenches of HIV, malaria, Ebola, SARS, and an ever-growing list of other nasties with shocking fatality rates. Particularly interesting is Quammen's notion that the historical rate of human population growth is itself an outbreak. We've proliferated like mad - at a speed unprecedented for a large mammal species. And what scientists know about outbreaks is that they always come to an end... While layman accessible, this detailed and hefty book takes perseverance, but it's well worth it for the amount of information you'll get in return. I'm going to go wash my hands now.

Back to my original review:Zoonotic pathogens, those that travel from other animals to human animals, have been with us, will be with us, have killed millions of people, will kill millions more. I read half of this book on the topic and got really really bored. Each chapter was ""And here's another example"" ""and here's yet another example."" He tried to spice that up with turning searching for the animal source of the pathogen into a mystery and by getting personal about the researchers (that is, applying fictional techniques to non fiction), but it couldn't disguise for me that it was all ""and here's another example."" I got the point by page 100. So I got past page 300 and then skimmed the rest. It's not badly written...it just got a bit boring for me.Here's the take-away advice I gleaned:1) Try to calm down. That zoonosis exists is largely beyond your control.2) To the extent you can control things: first, quit overbreeding. Overbreeding leads to human encroachment upon ecosystems where disease has happily been at equilibrium for tens of thousands of years. Overbreeding is awful for many reasons, but if you needed another, well, here's another. Overbreeders are bad world citizens.3) Don't, for heaven's sake, eat unusual game meat, particularly not game you find mysteriously dead on the ground with blood around its mouth. Also, glove/mask when treating sick domestic animals, yes, even beloved Fluffy, and when Fluffy does succumb, avoid kissing her bloody muzzle goodbye.4) Be rich and insured and ideally connected to the government in a first world country--not only can you buy farmed/ranched meat that's inspected and safe, if you do get sick, you'll get the best treatment available.5) That 33% of Americans aren't insured means the coming pandemic is going to be worse and spread faster and kill more here than in civilized countries where all citizens have access to health care. Not his point in the first 300 pages, but any thinking person can see it.6) Commercial airliners are really that dangerous for spreading disease--avoid if you can and rethink what ""vacation"" means to you. Sure, any given flight probably won't next Patient X on it...but it might. Is it really that important to board that plane?7) Religion helps spread pandemics because people pray and wallow in superstition instead of of getting treatment. When the next epidemic comes, pray/chant/positive-think/sacrifice a goat all you want, but not in a crowd, and get treatment, too."
82,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85488700-derrick-stormblessed,5,"What a frightful but entertaining read!! David Quammen is a brilliant scientist and storyteller all at once. He weaves narrative storytelling and science seamlessly like its the easiest thing ever. That's the source of the overall brilliance of the book. Quammen manages to use his own personal experiences with disease scientists at the centre of the research and others in the thick of things to make the book more entertaining. Billy Karesh studying chimps in Moba Bai, Beatrice Hahn at the heart of AIDS research, Engel and Jones-Engel a husband and wife team from New York investigating prevalence of a monkey virus in Bangladesh temples, a Chinese scientist searching for the reservoir of SARS, an Australian vet who survived the Hendra virus, etcThe book is basically about how animal diseases jump or spillover into humans. He narrates how these diseases, commonly classified as zoonoses first appeared on the scene and how people react to these diseases in the beginning, how scientific research unfolded and how they escalated into global epidemics in some cases. He also discusses the tiny pathogens responsible and their evolution into killer monsters. He deals with a long list of deadly diseases like Hendra, Ebola, malaria, AIDS, Lyme disease, Q fever, SARS, etc. All dangerous and potentially lethal bugs if not dealt with properly. A few themes appear throughout the book. One of them is how humans interfere with nature, eat what they are not supposed to or encroach on wild habitats. It's clear we are having more contact with animals, both domestic and wild, and this is one of the reasons why certain diseases have spilled over into humans. And also why in the future probably more lethal pathogens will spill over. As humans, we need to understand the nature of ecosystems better and try not to interfere with wildlife habitats. These diseases have killed millions and millions of people and it's clear that these bugs especially viruses have the upper hand over us and we should be weary of the potential devastation involved. Zoonotic diseases will continue to spill over in future. But how ling before we come across a pathogen capable of annihilating all of humankind?"

Quammen manages to make it understandable and compelling all at the same time. He helps the reader to understand the seriousness of the topic - and it is really serious -- without feeling alarmist. The book was published in 2012, so well before our current pandemic. After reading this, I feel much better equipped to decipher and understand the current reporting on COVID - 19, to make more educated decisions about what I am seeing on my news feed, to know when to be skeptical, and what my role can be in minimizing risk and spread (significant in all viruses with human to human transmission). I highly recommend this book if you want to understand more about viruses - their impact, their trajectory, and our options. With something as serious as what we are currently facing, I wanted more information that newspaper headlines and I wanted it to be, as much as possible, free from the political positioning -- just give me the science and the history so I can improve my context. Quammen did that exceptionally well. "

85,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3397530-lea,3,"This is a very interesting analysis of emerging zoonotic diseases, focusing on SARS, HIV, and Ebola, among others. There are so many facts here, it's a little overwhelming -- I learned so much that I'd never even thought of before, including the fact that HIV can actually be traced back to, wait for it . . . 1908?! Yeah, I didn't believe it at first, either, but the author clearly presents this in a way that is easy even for a non-scientist like myself to understand.After reading this, I can tell you for sure that I will NEVER go anywhere near a bat again -- these beautiful animals are apparently THE virus clearinghouse, for reasons that are explored in depth in this book.Ever wonder why we were able to effectively eradicate smallpox, but can't seem to put an end to malaria? Yep, it's in here.Here are a couple of quotes from the end of the book that I found interesting:""So before we respond either calmly or hysterically, either intelligently or doltishly, we should understand in some measure the basic outlines and dynamics of the situation. We should appreciate that these recent outbreaks of new zoonotic diseases, as well as the recurrence and spread of old ones, are part of a larger pattern, and that humanity is responsible for generating that pattern. We should recognize that they reflect things that we're DOING, not just things that are HAPPENING to us. WE should understand that, although some of the human-caused factors may seem virtually inexorable, others are within our control.""""That's the salubrious thing about zoonotic diseases: They remind us, as St. Francis did, that we humans are inseparable from the natural world. In fact, there IS no ""natural world,"" it's a bad and artificial phrase. There is only the world."""" . . . Dwyer's models have shown that heterogeneity of behavior, even among forest insects, let alone among humans, can be very important in damping the spread of infectious disease. . . . individual effort, individual discernment, individual choice can have huge effects in averting the catastrophes that might otherwise sweep through a herd. An individual gypsy moth may inherit a slightly superior ability to avoid smears of NPV as it grazes on a leaf. An individual human may choose not to drink the palm sap, not to eat the chimpanzee, not to pen the pig beneath mango trees, not to clear the horse's windpipe with his bare hand, not to have unprotected sex with the prostitute, not to share the needle in a shooting gallery, not to cough without covering her mouth, not to board a plane while feeling ill, or not to coop his chickens along with his ducks. ""Any tiny little thing that people do,"" Dwyer said, if it makes them different from one another, from the idealized standard of herd behavior, ""is going to reduce infection rates."" ""So why only three stars? David Quammen -- I wanted to add his author link right there, but GR won't let me, but go look him up because he's written a ton of interesting books -- is more than capable of writing a non-fiction book that would hold anyone's interest, yet he insists on inserting some extremely long passages of pure fiction as he speculates on the exact circumstances leading to the emergence of HIV-1. My husband will tell you, I'm more of a ""just the facts"" kind of person -- I neither need nor want speculation, especially when the facts are compelling on their own. If that kind of thing doesn't bother you, you may rate this one higher.Even with that, I would still recommend this."
86,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,4,"This book is about zoonoses--illnesses that spread from animals to people. It describes the typical process: the virus or bacteria lives, long-term and harmlessly, in a reservoir species. When it infects an amplifier species, it can spread more quickly to humans. For example, the Hendra virus has its reservoir in flying foxes (large Australian bats), but when it infects horses, it can spread to people, who are in much closer contact with their sick horses than with bats. Not only are zoonoses threatening because new ones can appear unexpectedly (like SARS or HIV), they are also essentially impossible to eradicate, unlike (say) polio, which is only found in humans, whom you can vaccinate. Bats come off rather badly in this book. In the past, I've learned that you should like them because they eat harmful insects. It turns out that they are the source of all sorts of nasty bugs, in the virus sense of the word.Quammen writes quite a bit about his travels to research the book, or how one scientist introduces him to another. Not only does this give the book a bit of a travelogue feeling, it also acknowledges the essential contributions of the people who tranquilize angry macaques or go out in the middle of the night to rig up bat nets--without which none of the science would have happened. His style is vivid and entertaining, though there's one passage in the chapter about HIV/AIDS that is strangely novelistic. Not bad, just incongruous and unnecessary.Nothing in this book will make you change your behavior, unless you are remiss about handwashing or routinely eat things bats have shat on. At the end the author emphasizes: ""The purpose of this book is not to make you more worried. The purpose of this book is to make you more smart. That's what most distinguishes humans from, say, tent caterpillars and gypsy moths. Unlike them, we can be pretty smart."" I didn't find this book particularly scary--just informative--so don't avoid it just on those grounds.To the extent it contains a call to action, the book reminds us that human pressure on ecological systems creates havoc. A relatively short section deals with Lyme disease and reveals the startling conclusion that Lyme flourishes in isolated areas. Think the islands in a parking lot rather than a forest. It's where we come in contact with ecologies that we've disrupted that we find zoonoses.P.S. Bonus points for sending me to the dictionary: ""cadastral.""P.P.S. Further bonus points for this sentence, even if the sentiment isn't new: ""[A]nyone who favors Intelligent Design in lieu of evolution might pause to wonder why God devoted so much of His intelligence to designing malarial parasites."""
87,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1182891-sue,5,"This book is a gripping tale of disease “spillover” that will thrill those interested in science – and probably many who aren’t. After all, we all get sick occasionally. Quammen looks at the ways pathogens (usually viruses) have spilled from animals to humans. He traces the origins of, among others, Ebola, SARS, bird flu, Lyme disease, and AIDS. These zoonotic diseases can escalate rapidly into global pandemics when human-to-human transmission occurs. For five years Quammen trailed scientists in their labs and in the field. Worldwide exchange of information turns out to be essential in epidemiology, and the solution to mysterious epidemics often means gathering data in far-flung places. Quammen himself traveled to China, to Bangladesh, to the Congo, to Connecticut. Data moves among such places, and so did the author. Everywhere there is mystery, drama, and good science.A long chapter (more than 20% of the book) traces the origins of HIV to a chimpanzee in Cameroon in the early 20th century. It’s a fascinating story. The author first tracked the evidence, working with scientists as they examined tissue samples that showed the spillover to be not in the 1980s, when the Western world first encountered it, but in the first decade of the 20th century. Quammen then allowed himself to think through a possible scenario which would have brought the virus down river to the Congo, initially moving slowly because its carriers might have died early of other causes, because the virus moved through areas of low population density, because it did not yet have the opportunity afforded by global travel and multiple sex partners.Ten years ago I had to abort a trip to Vietnam and China because of SARS, so the episode was very personal to me. That dread virus ran a deadly but short course. It turned out that the disease was transmissible after the person became ill, so it was eventually within the power of the health system to halt the spread. But it could reemerge. Civets, a diet delicacy blamed initially for the disease, turned out to be “amplifier” hosts but not “reservoir” hosts. This latter term applies to animals who host and live amicably with a virus which may cause great mischief in humans. For SARS, the reservoir was a bat, the amplifier was a civet, and the human who ate the civet was an unlucky, violently ill person. In fact, the eating of exotic (and often illegal) meats was a persistent theme in the entire book.As a non-scientist, I’ve possibly gotten a couple of things wrong in this review. Apologies. But I am pretty sure I’m going to be paying attention to the news about epidemics – as well as to, for example, ticks or exotic meats."
88,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17766893-matty-swytla,5,"A very good bok with scientific, yet approachable explanations to why zoonoses (animal diseases that infect humans) are so scary and deadly, especially when it comes to certain new viruses. The fact is zoonotic viruses and other diseases infect humans on a regular basis. I know; I was infected with ringworm (Dermatophytosis) by my kittens a few years ago - it's a fungal infection that spreads like fire. No fun but no biggie either. But any pet owner knows the drill on vaccinations for rabies and other diseases for dogs and cats. Some of these make the jump to humans with devastating results.The differences between carriers, natural reservoirs, and amplifiers is fascinating and illuminating. Some animals only spread viruses, bacteria or other illness-inducing organisms (mosquitoes for malaria); others live with them, a certain population of infected yet not very ill reservoirs from whence other animals and humans can get infected (bats, monkeys); while some animals get very ill and spread the infections further (amplifiers - often some domestic animals like pigs or poultry). It's important to make the distinction bewteen these or we won't know where to fight the disease in the first place. The book highlights why we should care about natural habitats, treat our animals with care, and not board a plane when feeling sick (!), but it doesn't fear-monger in any way. Yes, it does point out what people should or shouldn't do, what are the risk factors for contracting some exotic diseases, but it also highlights that ordinary diseases kill far more people than ebola, for example. Coronary disease, cancers, diabetes, traffic accidents... familiar killers we've gotten used to don't scare us as they should, while the thought of contracting a virus from a bat makes some people fear them like the plague. What the author makes clear time and time again is that local farmers in some god-forsaken parts of third-world countries (but in the West as well - not everyone is an epidemiologist or veterinarian) can't understand the full impact of an outbreak among their flock before it spreads. So education is key, and fast response from laboratories, research facilites, and medical institutions. I was amazed how much difference fast cooperation among scientists and medical doctors makes in terms of outbreak containment. Why doesn't the media highlight these achievements more and make people interested in science? What will it take? The next big virus or outbreak is just around the corner - it may be our ordinary flu not ebola."

Certainly, relevant to the current situation particularly the sections about bats. The organization and pace of the book is good. It’s a mix of information, interviews and the author’s experiences while observing the scientists at work. I usually don’t like author’s personal experiences in works like this, but since he focuses on the research itself it’s not too irritating. The writing is readable if a bit too snarky at times. The content is great. I learned a lot about viruses and the research behind figuring out pandemics. It’s all very interesting. This book exceeded my expectations.  So, I give this a 4. It’s mostly readable and always interesting with clear implications for the current situation.  "
91,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,3,"This holds a ton of information that is helpful to hold some specifics re virus infections that proceed to humans. But it's not completely upon the title material.In fact, the writing is well accomplished. It's often clear and better than some of the highly scientific particulars and nomenclatures of pure science reads (very dry) elsewhere. But as much as I can decide it DID make the reading easier than most material in this genre, it also holds another quality I thought was a considerable distraction from that positive prose form. Quammen has a kind of tone that's strange to read (it was for me) and quite difficult to describe. It's not Chicken Little on meth (or a hate rant like Gerta Thunberg either) but it's not a logical nor scientific bottom line ""norm"" either. If I'm overstating that, I'm sorry. But some of this assumption and oversight is just plain wrong when he tends to expand from ""one"" to ""some"" to ""all"". And it some cases it seems to me, that this emotive occludes to some of the very actual world reality of how MOST virus pass into pandemic outcomes. And how they did in the past, as well. Like the 1918 and the other human influenza forms that went lethal since. There are huge portions of this book that read like a memoir and travelogue. It's just not direct to the title at all, immense pages of asides/ tangents.The history of some of the worst spillovers (like Hendra or other bat vector virus) were the best and most accurate parts- and I am glad I read it for the understanding of how an intermediate ""amplify"" animal is also usually a HUGE part of the ""it depends"" serendipity that results in these horrific outcomes. First a small ""usual"" mammal, then a mid vector animal and then other species- such as monkeys/apes or humans.It's not a book I would necessarily recommend. His personality and slant, I just feel, is containing quite a bit of ""group think"" and not enough science. But now I do comprehend more easily the trail through 3 or 4 species this virus morph road can take."
92,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3230750-molly,5,"Thrilled to see that David Quammen had a new science book, I snatched this up. It’s been 15 years since his book ""Song of the Dodo” about island biogeography, which remains at the top of my favorite non-fiction. Can one *enjoy* a book about infectious disease? Anyone who's read Richard Preston's “The Hot Zone” will guiltily admit, yes (interestingly, he takes Preston to task for overplaying descriptions of Ebola infection. “Bleeding out"" is not accurate.)There is inherent narrative drama in the question of when the Next Big One (NBO) will hit and in the epidemiological sleuthing to identify viruses and their host animals when an epidemic breaks. What will turn a local outbreak into a pandemic? Do scientists think there IS a NBO lurking? Quite possibly. And if so, it will assuredly originate in animals, as has almost all human infectious disease. Influenza, SARS, Marburg, Lyme disease - Quammen covers them all and more, and turns up startling facts. For one, the subtitle of his book could just as well be, ""From Bats to Humans."" But what put the book over the top in excellence and dramatic page-turning was the penultimate chapter on the origin of AIDS. In some ways the whole book was moving toward this chapter. The origins of HIV can now be pinned to a year (much earlier than you’d think) and a single spillover event; chimp to human. And Quammen makes the poignant and chilling case that lest you wonder why we should care about exotic diseases such as Marbug, consider the exponential trajectory and devastation of AIDS. It too is a zoonotic disease, but one that has moved more slowly than an airborne NBO will surely do. Despite the theme – lively and buoyant writing. In other words, it’s readable. Quammen remains a master of science journalism. "

He does this while presenting the science in a very accessible yet amazingly informative way.What is astounding is the amount of work and research that must have gone into this book. David conducted a seemingly endless amount of interviews with scientists, researchers, doctors. To say he took it to the next level, well that is a vast understatement. This is science journalism/writing at its pinnacle.My particular favorite was the section on the ecology of borrelia (lyme). This is a subject that hits close to home for me.The section on malaria was very intriguing, learned a lot. The coolest thing was learning that a form of malaria had been used as therapy to treat syphilis (a form of therapy known as pyrotherapy). That blew my mind. If you're curious, here's an article on the subject: http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/bod...I was also fascinated by the HIV chapter. Could have done without his hypothesizing and reimagining of the original patient 0 story, I saw what he was trying to do, but that seemed a bit clunky and unnecessary.

It was extremely disappointing. It might fly with people who are less scientifically literate. She had more up to date info on Ebola, which might draw in a huge readership, but her book doesn't hold a candle to this book. Quammen's book is a big WOW, on every level. When I finally returned from Pandemic, I was in such a foul mood, it was detracting from my enjoyment of this book. That only lasted for a little bit. I could not help but get sucked right back into all of Quammen's case studies and histories of various outbreaks. This book was well researched, extremely thorough, scientifically sound, well written, and entertaining as hell. His passion for his subject spilled over into every page and into me.

97,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"Where Do ""Emerging Diseases"" Emerge From?AIDS, Ebola, Marburg, SARS, H5N1 — every one of the world’s scariest diseases is a “zoonosis,” that is, a virus harbored by animals and transmitted to humans, often by other animals, in a complex minuet that often stretches out into decades.AIDS, for example. According to the latest research, reported by David Quammen in Spillover, Patient Zero was not that French-Canadian flight attendant you may have read about who went amok in the 1970s but a hunter in Southeast Cameroon around 1908 who killed a chimpanzee and somehow unwittingly allowed the animal’s blood to seep into his own circulatory system, either through a cut or by eating his prey’s raw flesh. This is the phenomenon that epidemiologists call “spillover.” At that point, a particularly virulent form of a recently emergent simian virus found a friendly and familiar environment in the hunter’s blood and flourished, becoming what we know today as HIV-1 (the more lethal form of the virus that causes AIDS). Later, the hunter passed along the virus to one or more women through sexual contact, and the disease slowly spread, both by sex and by transmission through reused needles, undetected as anything out of the ordinary, from Cameroon into what is now called the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and other sub-Saharan countries, and thence by happenstance to Haiti. It was a Haitian harboring HIV-1 who probably passed it along to that notorious Canadian flight attendant, setting off the epidemic among gay men in North America.In Spillover, Quammen tells tales like these in fascinating detail, relating the stories of the often-heroic scientists, physicians, and veterinarians who worked directly with deadly diseases, occasionally at the cost of their own lives. Quammen spent years writing this book. He appears to have read all the relevant scientific literature, attended specialized scientific conferences, and spent long hours tracking down and speaking face-to-face with the people who discovered these diseases, isolated the viruses, first treated the symptoms, and labored for thankless years on end in laboratories around the world to help humanity avert the next pandemic.You may have read Richard Preston’s best-selling 2001 treatment of the emergence of Ebola in The Hot Zone. If not, I can tell you that I vividly recall the book because it was so dramatic, and so terrifying. No doubt I had nightmares about contracting Ebola. But it turns out, according to Quammen and to the eminent scientists he interviewed, that Preston’s account was sensationalized and highly inaccurate in essential details. For example, he described tears of blood, massive hemorrhages, and melted internal organs, none of which has any basis in fact.However, Spillover, in its own way, is no less frightening. Quammen advances the popular theory that what appears to be the accelerating emergence of dangerous new pathogens became inevitable as a result of the enormous population growth of homo sapiens — because humanity has increasingly encroached on animal habitat and come into intimate contact with animals as never before. In discussions with noted biologists, he explores the concept of “breakout,” the explosive growth frequently seen in some animal species that shortly leads to sudden, catastrophic — through disease. He intimates that, with AIDS — or, all too possibly, with the next pandemic — humankind may experience something similar. Despite all the horrific details about AIDS, Ebola, Marburg, and the like, these are the book’s scariest passages.David Quammen writes about science, nature, and travel — a total of 10 nonfiction books and five novels to date. A former Rhodes Scholar, he was educated at Yale and Oxford.(From www.malwarwickonbooks.com)"
98,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58119141-elena-sala,5,"SPILLOVER: ANIMAL INFECTIONS AND THE NEXT HUMAN PANDEMIC (2012) was the result of David Quammen's five years of research interviewing scientists who were looking into the possibility of another horrific Ebola-type disease emerging. At that time, believe it or not, there was a widespread consensus: there would indeed be a new disease, likely from the coronavirus family, coming out of a bat, and it would likely emerge in or around a wet market in China. So, how could the world be SO unprepared for this nightmarish pandemic?? This book was written 8 years before this pandemic so it does not attempt to answer this question. Though we can probably guess some possible answers.This book is about zoonoses, infectious diseases that originate in animals and spread to humans. Rabies, for example, is a zoonotic disease. HIV is also a zoonotic disease. Dengue, yellow fever, malaria, influenza, Lyme disease, MERS, SARS, Zika and COVID are all zoonoses. The technical term scientists use to describe the leap of a pathogen from one animal to another is “spillover”. Most infections start as spillovers. Some, like Ebola and lesser-known viral diseases (Nipah, Hendra, Marburg), are highly transmissible and virulent, but so far have been limited to sporadic outbreaks. They persist because they are endemic in a reservoir population through a process of mutual adaptation.Quammen explores the correlation between these diseases that come up one after the other. It should not come as a surprise that they are not mere accidents but unwanted consequences of our actions. How do these pathogens make the leap from animals to humans? Quammen's answer: ""we invade tropical forests and other wild landscapes, which harbor so many species of animals and plants. And within those creatures, so many viruses. We cut the trees, we kill the animals or cage them and send them to markets. We disrupt ecosystems and we shake viruses loose from their natural hosts. When that happens, they need a new host. Often, we are it.” And why does this seem to be happening more frequently in recent times? The answer, again in Quammen's own words is: ""there’s 7.8 billion of us on this planet—four times the number of humans at the time of the 1918 influenza. And we have quadrupled the speed we travel around the planet; we have quadrupled the size of some of our cities. So there are a lot more of us large-bodied vertebrate animals, living in dense aggregations, moving fluidly from one place to another... We’re the world’s greatest target for a virus—a great ecosystem for them to colonize. So when a virus does get into a human and finds it can replicate and transmit to the next human, that virus has opened the door to vast opportunity.""Quammen's journeys have taken him all around the world: inside the air-locked sterility of high-security biological research labs, through the crowded alleyways of Chinese live animal markets, into remote African and Asian villages that have experienced outbreaks of some of the most lethal diseases yet known to mankind. He has interviewed survivors of these diseases and the scientists doing all the research. He has been a science writer for over 35 years, interested in ecology and evolutionary biology. He uses a conversational tone and, occasionally, some dark humor to give a frightening and eye opening summary of all that is known about these zoonotic diseases. This is a book I highly recommend, not only because it is written in an engaging and accessible way, sober, rational yet suspenseful, but because it is clear that COVID will not be the last pandemic we will see. There will be more zoonoses because we are disrupting the environment more and more. So we need to think about our own responsibility and how we relate to our environment. Each one of us has a responsibility, because we are all consumers of food, resources, and energy. Each of the choices that we make about what we’re going to eat, wear, or buy draws on these wild ecosystems. This book invites the reader to think about these choices while explaining how we got into this mess in the first place."

It would be really hard at this point to not know about Coronavirus and the pandemic it caused and its likely source from animals (probably bats). This has been a problem we have been aware of for quite some time with flu strains and aids, and Lyme disease, and zika virus, and ebola, and Marburg virus the list goes on. Only now the point is hammered home in a pandemic and a world-historical economic crisis. Some of us knew better but as usual, people didn't heed the warnings. They almost never do."

These microorganisms are hardy, smart and incredibly adaptable when it comes to the question of how to survive and thrive among the biodiversity of the earth. If you were to romanticize the whole concept then it becomes very easy to paint the pathogen as the most dreaded enemy of mankind/ nature’s revenge on us etc. However, a rational perspective tells a story which is entirely different and utterly fascinating in a deadly way. The microorganism’s capability to jump across species to man and thereby begin devastating outbreaks is the premise of the book and the scientific term for such a happening is Zoonosis. In the words of the author about the need of such a book :  Why obsess about Zoonoses ? In the larger balance of miseries, what makes anyone think they should be taken so seriously ? It’s a fair question but there are good answers. Some of those answers are intricate and speculative. Some are subjective. Others are objective and blunt. The bluntest is this : AIDS. Let’s look at some zoonotic diseases other than AIDS : Ebola, Marburg, Avian and Swine Flu, SARS, Malaria, Hendra are but a few of them. All of these are without doubt some of the deadliest killer that we have encountered. David Quammen does a book length investigation into the history, nature and where we stand in the understanding of the microorganisms which cause these diseases. Quammen’s writing style is approachable and far less sensational than what I encountered with Richard Preston’s Hot Zone. While Preston horrified and thrilled me, Quammen offers a more informative and grounded view at the pathogens and their effects. He also travels far and wide for his research and converses with recovered patients, eyewitnesses, doctors and scientists and ergo a much more well-rounded view of what actually transpires during a disease outbreak comes to light. Of special mention is the chapter named The Chimp and River which is an in depth detective story that traces the journey of HIV from the jungles of Africa into the world at large. There are two things about the book that really caught my attention : • The number of mice and monkeys that die in the name of betterment and advancement of science in this book is huge. There were times when I paused and wondered if more of these hapless animals perish than humans.• Quammen is a first rate travel writer. His descriptions of Asia and Africa are measured views of anthropology, wildlife and the inevitable clash between the two.Parts of the book especially on the mathematical connects between the nature of mass outbreaks and about the lifecycles of viruses were difficult to comprehend. But that aside this is a fantastic book to understand how much nature has in store which man has no idea of. It also corrected for me the notion that nature uses viruses to eventually get back at humans ( courtesy Richard Preston). A virus is a non-thinking organism and one for which in a majority of the cases, a human host is next to an evolutionary dead end. It just so happens that with our invasive lifestyle, we breach the habitats of the virus and get caught in their snares.Recommended."
101,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,5,"I see why Quammen is so well thought of. Spillover was amazingly informative, had a near perfect execution, explained very difficult, scientific subjects in a manner that a reader with little science background could understand without making it so dumbed down that the same reader found themselves lost in a nexus of weakening metaphors and feeling insulted (I'm looking at you, Winchester). This is how you speak to your audience! You do not dumbdown, but rather heighten the discourse and inform. I learned so much, and was so in awe of what I was learning, and the research that was done by Quammen, and even more by the researching actively trying to save us from the ""Next Big One"" that nightly over dinner I'd tell my husband excitedly that he just HAD to read Spillover, because did you know this or that about ebola? Its the only audiobook that I have honestly considered restarting immediately. There is just so much to process here, so much that I realize I just didn't know, and so much more that I could learn from a second reading.This is a book that I think every person should read. There is as much (if not more) human interest as science, it can honestly keep you on the edge of your seat. I love nature, but it can be such a scary place without considering that maybe you just inhaled infected bat shit or dust from an aborted goat. But its also a beautiful place, where ecology matters, where there is balance, and as the eruption of human population continues (presumably unchecked for now) that balance is disturbed. I cannot stress enough, especially during this election cycle, how important an informed populace is. How can we make decisions in domestic protection, how we raise our livestock, how we tour, how we travel across the globe, how we transport EVERYTHING, how we mine, and how we manufacture if we are not informed of the consequences and the possible dangers of what we are doing. I'm not crazy, I'm not saying lets halt the world, but we need to understand that its not just about global warming, when ecologists are warning us of what we are doing to the planet. We have rapidly interconnected this world in a way that has never before happened. There are risks and benefits to that. Scientists are trying to study and prepare for the next big one, but should the unthinkable happen (its not unthinkable, its more that we refuse to think of it) how are we, as a populace, prepared to respond? We need to consider this.And, man, wash your hands if you butcher something, okay?"
102,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60209410-jordan-buckley,4,"Good information on zoonotic diseases (diseases that live in animal hosts and can spread to humans), which are pretty relevant at the moment because COVID-19 is believed to be one. Many major diseases are zoonoses or started that way, including HIV, Ebola, rabies, Lyme disease, SARS, swine flu, etc.There were a few major takeaways for me. You can't eradicate a zoonotic disease if it's still silently thriving in some animal population (""reservoir host""). The pathogen may just live happily in one or more animal species without causing any obvious symptoms, but could be deadly if it infects humans. The other big takeaway is that human civilization and activity is often what unearths these diseases or gives them the opportunity to thrive. As we expand we move into forests and come into contact with animals that may carry all kinds of unknown pathogens. Our new methods of factory farming and cramming animals together in their own excrement creates new opportunities for these things to thrive and spread. Tragedies like the current pandemic aren't just ""acts of God"" that we have no control over; they are brought on by our own activity.Like most nonfiction books I read, I wish it was much shorter. The author does a good job of making it interesting, but I could have done without so much of the breathless recounting of the journalist's search for truth, tracking down different hypotheses, biographical descriptions of the various interviewees, the fanciful hypothetical story of the imagined ""voyager"" who brought HIV out of the jungle and into human civilization. The story of the SARS outbreak was interesting for comparison to COVID-19, and it was notable to see coronaviruses mentioned repeatedly among other candidates as a risk for the next pandemic."

Super, super relevant right now, and from my memory this book references EEE, though don't quote me. *Review*First things first. I hate when I look at a nonfiction book table of contents and can’t tell by the name of the chapters what they cover. For those who feel the same, here is the annotated table of contents:I. Pale Horse (Hendra virus)II. Thirteen Gorillas (Ebola virus)III. Everything Comes From Somewhere (Malaria)IV. Dinner at the Rat Farm (SARS)V. The Deer, the Parrot, & the Kid Next Door (Q Fever, Psittacosis, and Lyme disease)VI. Going Viral (General Virus Stuff, but Especially HIV)VII. Celestial Hosts (About Animals That Transmit Disease, Especially Bats, and Also Focuses on the Nipah virus)VIII. The Chimp and The River (HIV)IX. It Depends (Viruses of the Future)Onto the review.I wasn’t thinking about it when I snagged it at the library, but this was the perfect book to follow up The Hot Zone (and, in fact, this book references that one). That was a concentrated, focused look at one distinct family of viruses, the filoviruses. It was also more dramatized. This one takes that zoomed-in look and contextualizes it. Reminds us that 60% of all infections diseases that affect humans come from animals via zoonosis. Ebola, Marburg (the stars of The Hot Zone), rabies, hantavirus, anthrax, Lassa, Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, dengue, west nile, sars, typhus, mad cow disease, all forms of influenza, bubonic plague, Lyme disease, AIDS, and countless more. The author also points out something interesting- the diseases we’ve mostly eradicated, like smallpox and polio, are the rare ones that aren’t passed to humans by animals. That’s why we were able to eradicate them. People are easier to keep track of and vaccinate than animals. Nowhere for them to hide. Whereas Marburg or Ebola can lurk forever in hidden corners of caves, immortal. And why are these diseases popping up now? Practically all of these zoonotic (species-hopping) diseases are new. Like, zoonotic diseases barely existed at all before the 1960s, after which they started popping up everywhere in myriad forms. Why? Because we’re tearing apart ecosystems, breaking down the natural fabric of things, spreading ourselves where we ought not be a-spreadin’. These diseases had their natural hosts. They didn’t kill the hosts, they mostly lived in harmony with the host in some remote corner of the world. But when we wreck that natural host’s home and kill lots of them off, what’s a virus to do but to jump ship and latch onto humans if it wants to survive? Finally, I’d like to thank David Quammen for summarizing my feelings on life nicely: “Mathematics to me is like a language I don’t speak, though I admire its literature in translation.”"
106,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,5,"I try not to read books that make me paranoid or hypochondriac — and that's not the intention of this book — but I'll think twice next time that I'm in some exotic place and close to wild animals. The Monkey Forest in Bali was mentioned in this book in relation to herpes B (a deadly disease caused by a spillover from macaques monkeys to humans). Thanks goodness I feel a visceral revulsion towards monkeys. I didn't hand-feed any or let them climb up my head and shoulders so that I can take a picture with them. A little bite or scratch from the wrong monkey could seal your death sentence. This is a very well-researched, well-written, and highly-informative book on zoonosis — a pathogen leaping from an animal to humans. There have been recent scares with diseases like SARS and bird flu and swine flu that caused relatively limited damage and were contained. But you can never underestimate the danger of the Next Big One. We shouldn't forget that the Spanish flu at the end of the World War I killed by far more people than the war. As Quammen says, if you think we shouldn't concern ourselves too much with a local outbreak of an exotic disease like ebola that is caused by starving villagers in a remote corner of Congo eating a rotten dead chimp, the answer is: AIDS.The most interesting chapter of the book is the chapter on AIDS, which reads like a detective story. Here's the spoiler: the HIV virus first jumped from chimps to humans (quite likely when a hunter was butchering an infected chimp) somewhere in southeast Cameroon some time around 1908. What it was doing between then and the early 1980's when it became a global pandemic that has so far killed an estimated 35 million people is a fascinating story. "
107,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"Spillover is a well-written bio-thriller in the tradition of The Hot Zone, etc. It rehashes the same misleading theme of scary monster viruses waiting out there in the bushes to kill us all. It is good if you want a horror story, not if you want useful, accurate science about public health. As the subtitle indicates, it is focused on the hypothetical ""Next Big One"" but misses the point about what caused the actual Great Pandemic of 1918, repeating boilerplate nonsense about gene shifts etc. The demonstrably false idea that reassortment of the Hs and Ns in influenza virus is why you get a deadly pandemic is what caused the panics in 1976 and 2009 over the shift to H1N1. Both times there was no deadly pandemic. In 1976, the needless panic actually killed a bunch of people with a bad vaccine. In 2009, it cost billions and billions of dollars and created tremendous emotional stress for no apparent benefit. This is pretty obvious stuff. So why act as if nobody knows this and repeat old nonsense about what causes pandemics? The difference between a mild flu and a deadly one that kills 50 million people is not a reassortment of the genes. This is known. So what is the difference and how do we make germs be mild instead of lethal? That is a very important question, but you won't find the answer in this book. If you are interested in exploring this question, you may want to look at the TED talk by Paul Ewald: http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_ewald_a...."

It is scary, sure, because there are always new microbes out there ready to go rampaging through our vast society. It is also rather comforting, both the methodical search for vectors and reservoirs, the details of transmission and treatment, the stream of breakthroughs that enable researchers to locate and sequence. And through it all, Quammen maintains a casual, light conversational tone, reassuring the reader that sure, horrible new diseases can (and will) spring up seemingly out of nowhere to spread around the world, but that also we have been pretty good at controlling those sorts of outbreaks.There's quite a lot about Ebola here, written before this summer's outbreak. It should prove very comforting to everyone whose loved ones are not currently infected. I heap praise upon him for pointing out that it isn't nearly as grotesque as Preston painted it in The Hot Zone.The only part I really disliked was the pure fiction of The Voyager, which was too long and added nothing. This was particularly annoying as I was nearing the end and racing to finish quickly before the future biologist usurped in entirely.Library copyI don't usually comment on covers, but I will say that Chip Kidd managed to make a very disturbing one."

David Quammen convincingly argues that the greatest bugaboo for the human race should be a zoonosis, an infectious disease that spills over from an animal population into humans. He travels around the world and talks to scientists who have worked in the virus-riddled trenches of HIV, malaria, Ebola, SARS, and an ever-growing list of other nasties with shocking fatality rates. Particularly interesting is Quammen's notion that the historical rate of human population growth is itself an outbreak. We've proliferated like mad - at a speed unprecedented for a large mammal species. And what scientists know about outbreaks is that they always come to an end... While layman accessible, this detailed and hefty book takes perseverance, but it's well worth it for the amount of information you'll get in return. I'm going to go wash my hands now.

Back to my original review:Zoonotic pathogens, those that travel from other animals to human animals, have been with us, will be with us, have killed millions of people, will kill millions more. I read half of this book on the topic and got really really bored. Each chapter was ""And here's another example"" ""and here's yet another example."" He tried to spice that up with turning searching for the animal source of the pathogen into a mystery and by getting personal about the researchers (that is, applying fictional techniques to non fiction), but it couldn't disguise for me that it was all ""and here's another example."" I got the point by page 100. So I got past page 300 and then skimmed the rest. It's not badly written...it just got a bit boring for me.Here's the take-away advice I gleaned:1) Try to calm down. That zoonosis exists is largely beyond your control.2) To the extent you can control things: first, quit overbreeding. Overbreeding leads to human encroachment upon ecosystems where disease has happily been at equilibrium for tens of thousands of years. Overbreeding is awful for many reasons, but if you needed another, well, here's another. Overbreeders are bad world citizens.3) Don't, for heaven's sake, eat unusual game meat, particularly not game you find mysteriously dead on the ground with blood around its mouth. Also, glove/mask when treating sick domestic animals, yes, even beloved Fluffy, and when Fluffy does succumb, avoid kissing her bloody muzzle goodbye.4) Be rich and insured and ideally connected to the government in a first world country--not only can you buy farmed/ranched meat that's inspected and safe, if you do get sick, you'll get the best treatment available.5) That 33% of Americans aren't insured means the coming pandemic is going to be worse and spread faster and kill more here than in civilized countries where all citizens have access to health care. Not his point in the first 300 pages, but any thinking person can see it.6) Commercial airliners are really that dangerous for spreading disease--avoid if you can and rethink what ""vacation"" means to you. Sure, any given flight probably won't next Patient X on it...but it might. Is it really that important to board that plane?7) Religion helps spread pandemics because people pray and wallow in superstition instead of of getting treatment. When the next epidemic comes, pray/chant/positive-think/sacrifice a goat all you want, but not in a crowd, and get treatment, too."

He weaves narrative storytelling and science seamlessly like its the easiest thing ever. That's the source of the overall brilliance of the book. Quammen manages to use his own personal experiences with disease scientists at the centre of the research and others in the thick of things to make the book more entertaining. Billy Karesh studying chimps in Moba Bai, Beatrice Hahn at the heart of AIDS research, Engel and Jones-Engel a husband and wife team from New York investigating prevalence of a monkey virus in Bangladesh temples, a Chinese scientist searching for the reservoir of SARS, an Australian vet who survived the Hendra virus, etcThe book is basically about how animal diseases jump or spillover into humans. He narrates how these diseases, commonly classified as zoonoses first appeared on the scene and how people react to these diseases in the beginning, how scientific research unfolded and how they escalated into global epidemics in some cases. He also discusses the tiny pathogens responsible and their evolution into killer monsters. He deals with a long list of deadly diseases like Hendra, Ebola, malaria, AIDS, Lyme disease, Q fever, SARS, etc. All dangerous and potentially lethal bugs if not dealt with properly. A few themes appear throughout the book. One of them is how humans interfere with nature, eat what they are not supposed to or encroach on wild habitats. It's clear we are having more contact with animals, both domestic and wild, and this is one of the reasons why certain diseases have spilled over into humans. And also why in the future probably more lethal pathogens will spill over. As humans, we need to understand the nature of ecosystems better and try not to interfere with wildlife habitats. These diseases have killed millions and millions of people and it's clear that these bugs especially viruses have the upper hand over us and we should be weary of the potential devastation involved. Zoonotic diseases will continue to spill over in future. But how ling before we come across a pathogen capable of annihilating all of humankind?"

Quammen manages to make it understandable and compelling all at the same time. He helps the reader to understand the seriousness of the topic - and it is really serious -- without feeling alarmist. The book was published in 2012, so well before our current pandemic. After reading this, I feel much better equipped to decipher and understand the current reporting on COVID - 19, to make more educated decisions about what I am seeing on my news feed, to know when to be skeptical, and what my role can be in minimizing risk and spread (significant in all viruses with human to human transmission). I highly recommend this book if you want to understand more about viruses - their impact, their trajectory, and our options. With something as serious as what we are currently facing, I wanted more information that newspaper headlines and I wanted it to be, as much as possible, free from the political positioning -- just give me the science and the history so I can improve my context.

There are so many facts here, it's a little overwhelming -- I learned so much that I'd never even thought of before, including the fact that HIV can actually be traced back to, wait for it . . . 1908?! Yeah, I didn't believe it at first, either, but the author clearly presents this in a way that is easy even for a non-scientist like myself to understand.After reading this, I can tell you for sure that I will NEVER go anywhere near a bat again -- these beautiful animals are apparently THE virus clearinghouse, for reasons that are explored in depth in this book.Ever wonder why we were able to effectively eradicate smallpox, but can't seem to put an end to malaria? Yep, it's in here.Here are a couple of quotes from the end of the book that I found interesting:""So before we respond either calmly or hysterically, either intelligently or doltishly, we should understand in some measure the basic outlines and dynamics of the situation. We should appreciate that these recent outbreaks of new zoonotic diseases, as well as the recurrence and spread of old ones, are part of a larger pattern, and that humanity is responsible for generating that pattern. We should recognize that they reflect things that we're DOING, not just things that are HAPPENING to us. WE should understand that, although some of the human-caused factors may seem virtually inexorable, others are within our control.""""That's the salubrious thing about zoonotic diseases: They remind us, as St. Francis did, that we humans are inseparable from the natural world. In fact, there IS no ""natural world,"" it's a bad and artificial phrase. There is only the world."""" . . . Dwyer's models have shown that heterogeneity of behavior, even among forest insects, let alone among humans, can be very important in damping the spread of infectious disease. . . . individual effort, individual discernment, individual choice can have huge effects in averting the catastrophes that might otherwise sweep through a herd. An individual gypsy moth may inherit a slightly superior ability to avoid smears of NPV as it grazes on a leaf. An individual human may choose not to drink the palm sap, not to eat the chimpanzee, not to pen the pig beneath mango trees, not to clear the horse's windpipe with his bare hand, not to have unprotected sex with the prostitute, not to share the needle in a shooting gallery, not to cough without covering her mouth, not to board a plane while feeling ill, or not to coop his chickens along with his ducks. ""Any tiny little thing that people do,"" Dwyer said, if it makes them different from one another, from the idealized standard of herd behavior, ""is going to reduce infection rates."" ""So why only three stars? David Quammen -- I wanted to add his author link right there, but GR won't let me, but go look him up because he's written a ton of interesting books -- is more than capable of writing a non-fiction book that would hold anyone's interest, yet he insists on inserting some extremely long passages of pure fiction as he speculates on the exact circumstances leading to the emergence of HIV-1. My husband will tell you, I'm more of a ""just the facts"" kind of person -- I neither need nor want speculation, especially when the facts are compelling on their own.

116,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,4,"This book is about zoonoses--illnesses that spread from animals to people. It describes the typical process: the virus or bacteria lives, long-term and harmlessly, in a reservoir species. When it infects an amplifier species, it can spread more quickly to humans. For example, the Hendra virus has its reservoir in flying foxes (large Australian bats), but when it infects horses, it can spread to people, who are in much closer contact with their sick horses than with bats. Not only are zoonoses threatening because new ones can appear unexpectedly (like SARS or HIV), they are also essentially impossible to eradicate, unlike (say) polio, which is only found in humans, whom you can vaccinate. Bats come off rather badly in this book. In the past, I've learned that you should like them because they eat harmful insects. It turns out that they are the source of all sorts of nasty bugs, in the virus sense of the word.Quammen writes quite a bit about his travels to research the book, or how one scientist introduces him to another. Not only does this give the book a bit of a travelogue feeling, it also acknowledges the essential contributions of the people who tranquilize angry macaques or go out in the middle of the night to rig up bat nets--without which none of the science would have happened. His style is vivid and entertaining, though there's one passage in the chapter about HIV/AIDS that is strangely novelistic. Not bad, just incongruous and unnecessary.Nothing in this book will make you change your behavior, unless you are remiss about handwashing or routinely eat things bats have shat on. At the end the author emphasizes: ""The purpose of this book is not to make you more worried. The purpose of this book is to make you more smart. That's what most distinguishes humans from, say, tent caterpillars and gypsy moths. Unlike them, we can be pretty smart."" I didn't find this book particularly scary--just informative--so don't avoid it just on those grounds.To the extent it contains a call to action, the book reminds us that human pressure on ecological systems creates havoc. A relatively short section deals with Lyme disease and reveals the startling conclusion that Lyme flourishes in isolated areas. Think the islands in a parking lot rather than a forest.

117,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1182891-sue,5,"This book is a gripping tale of disease “spillover” that will thrill those interested in science – and probably many who aren’t. After all, we all get sick occasionally. Quammen looks at the ways pathogens (usually viruses) have spilled from animals to humans. He traces the origins of, among others, Ebola, SARS, bird flu, Lyme disease, and AIDS. These zoonotic diseases can escalate rapidly into global pandemics when human-to-human transmission occurs. For five years Quammen trailed scientists in their labs and in the field. Worldwide exchange of information turns out to be essential in epidemiology, and the solution to mysterious epidemics often means gathering data in far-flung places. Quammen himself traveled to China, to Bangladesh, to the Congo, to Connecticut. Data moves among such places, and so did the author. Everywhere there is mystery, drama, and good science.A long chapter (more than 20% of the book) traces the origins of HIV to a chimpanzee in Cameroon in the early 20th century. It’s a fascinating story. The author first tracked the evidence, working with scientists as they examined tissue samples that showed the spillover to be not in the 1980s, when the Western world first encountered it, but in the first decade of the 20th century. Quammen then allowed himself to think through a possible scenario which would have brought the virus down river to the Congo, initially moving slowly because its carriers might have died early of other causes, because the virus moved through areas of low population density, because it did not yet have the opportunity afforded by global travel and multiple sex partners.Ten years ago I had to abort a trip to Vietnam and China because of SARS, so the episode was very personal to me. That dread virus ran a deadly but short course. It turned out that the disease was transmissible after the person became ill, so it was eventually within the power of the health system to halt the spread. But it could reemerge. Civets, a diet delicacy blamed initially for the disease, turned out to be “amplifier” hosts but not “reservoir” hosts. This latter term applies to animals who host and live amicably with a virus which may cause great mischief in humans. For SARS, the reservoir was a bat, the amplifier was a civet, and the human who ate the civet was an unlucky, violently ill person. In fact, the eating of exotic (and often illegal) meats was a persistent theme in the entire book.As a non-scientist, I’ve possibly gotten a couple of things wrong in this review. Apologies. But I am pretty sure I’m going to be paying attention to the news about epidemics – as well as to, for example, ticks or exotic meats."
118,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17766893-matty-swytla,5,"A very good bok with scientific, yet approachable explanations to why zoonoses (animal diseases that infect humans) are so scary and deadly, especially when it comes to certain new viruses. The fact is zoonotic viruses and other diseases infect humans on a regular basis. I know; I was infected with ringworm (Dermatophytosis) by my kittens a few years ago - it's a fungal infection that spreads like fire. No fun but no biggie either. But any pet owner knows the drill on vaccinations for rabies and other diseases for dogs and cats. Some of these make the jump to humans with devastating results.The differences between carriers, natural reservoirs, and amplifiers is fascinating and illuminating. Some animals only spread viruses, bacteria or other illness-inducing organisms (mosquitoes for malaria); others live with them, a certain population of infected yet not very ill reservoirs from whence other animals and humans can get infected (bats, monkeys); while some animals get very ill and spread the infections further (amplifiers - often some domestic animals like pigs or poultry). It's important to make the distinction bewteen these or we won't know where to fight the disease in the first place. The book highlights why we should care about natural habitats, treat our animals with care, and not board a plane when feeling sick (!), but it doesn't fear-monger in any way. Yes, it does point out what people should or shouldn't do, what are the risk factors for contracting some exotic diseases, but it also highlights that ordinary diseases kill far more people than ebola, for example. Coronary disease, cancers, diabetes, traffic accidents... familiar killers we've gotten used to don't scare us as they should, while the thought of contracting a virus from a bat makes some people fear them like the plague. What the author makes clear time and time again is that local farmers in some god-forsaken parts of third-world countries (but in the West as well - not everyone is an epidemiologist or veterinarian) can't understand the full impact of an outbreak among their flock before it spreads. So education is key, and fast response from laboratories, research facilites, and medical institutions. I was amazed how much difference fast cooperation among scientists and medical doctors makes in terms of outbreak containment. Why doesn't the media highlight these achievements more and make people interested in science? What will it take? The next big virus or outbreak is just around the corner - it may be our ordinary flu not ebola."

Nice. I quite enjoyed this book, although it was a bit long. It featured a fictitious scenario about HIV patient zero that went on for more time than it was worth. Author David Qaummen is a science-writer. He actually traveled to Africa many times, accompanying scientists on their quest(s) to identify the wild reservoirs of Ebola and HIV viruses. A large portion of the book is devoted to these efforts. 

He covers many zoonotic infectious diseases here; Hendra virus, Malaria, the SARS coronavirus, among many others.The book has a great flow, and format; He breaks it down into ~100 different chapters, avoiding the common problem of super-long, run on chapters that become difficult to reference. He details many of the adventures he had in Africa, including capturing bats to take their blood.""Spillover"" (it's namesake the term used to describe occurrences when a reservoir population with a high pathogen prevalence comes into contact with a novel host population) also covers quite a lot of epidemiology and virology, as well.

Certainly, relevant to the current situation particularly the sections about bats. The organization and pace of the book is good. It’s a mix of information, interviews and the author’s experiences while observing the scientists at work. I usually don’t like author’s personal experiences in works like this, but since he focuses on the research itself it’s not too irritating. The writing is readable if a bit too snarky at times. The content is great. I learned a lot about viruses and the research behind figuring out pandemics. It’s all very interesting. This book exceeded my expectations.  So, I give this a 4. It’s mostly readable and always interesting with clear implications for the current situation.  "

But it's not completely upon the title material.In fact, the writing is well accomplished. It's often clear and better than some of the highly scientific particulars and nomenclatures of pure science reads (very dry) elsewhere. But as much as I can decide it DID make the reading easier than most material in this genre, it also holds another quality I thought was a considerable distraction from that positive prose form. Quammen has a kind of tone that's strange to read (it was for me) and quite difficult to describe. It's not Chicken Little on meth (or a hate rant like Gerta Thunberg either) but it's not a logical nor scientific bottom line ""norm"" either. If I'm overstating that, I'm sorry. But some of this assumption and oversight is just plain wrong when he tends to expand from ""one"" to ""some"" to ""all"". And it some cases it seems to me, that this emotive occludes to some of the very actual world reality of how MOST virus pass into pandemic outcomes. And how they did in the past, as well. Like the 1918 and the other human influenza forms that went lethal since. There are huge portions of this book that read like a memoir and travelogue. It's just not direct to the title at all, immense pages of asides/ tangents.The history of some of the worst spillovers (like Hendra or other bat vector virus) were the best and most accurate parts- and I am glad I read it for the understanding of how an intermediate ""amplify"" animal is also usually a HUGE part of the ""it depends"" serendipity that results in these horrific outcomes. First a small ""usual"" mammal, then a mid vector animal and then other species- such as monkeys/apes or humans.It's not a book I would necessarily recommend. His personality and slant, I just feel, is containing quite a bit of ""group think"" and not enough science. But now I do comprehend more easily the trail through 3 or 4 species this virus morph road can take."
122,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3230750-molly,5,"Thrilled to see that David Quammen had a new science book, I snatched this up. It’s been 15 years since his book ""Song of the Dodo” about island biogeography, which remains at the top of my favorite non-fiction. Can one *enjoy* a book about infectious disease? Anyone who's read Richard Preston's “The Hot Zone” will guiltily admit, yes (interestingly, he takes Preston to task for overplaying descriptions of Ebola infection. “Bleeding out"" is not accurate.)There is inherent narrative drama in the question of when the Next Big One (NBO) will hit and in the epidemiological sleuthing to identify viruses and their host animals when an epidemic breaks. What will turn a local outbreak into a pandemic? Do scientists think there IS a NBO lurking? Quite possibly. And if so, it will assuredly originate in animals, as has almost all human infectious disease. Influenza, SARS, Marburg, Lyme disease - Quammen covers them all and more, and turns up startling facts. For one, the subtitle of his book could just as well be, ""From Bats to Humans."" But what put the book over the top in excellence and dramatic page-turning was the penultimate chapter on the origin of AIDS. In some ways the whole book was moving toward this chapter. The origins of HIV can now be pinned to a year (much earlier than you’d think) and a single spillover event; chimp to human. And Quammen makes the poignant and chilling case that lest you wonder why we should care about exotic diseases such as Marbug, consider the exponential trajectory and devastation of AIDS. It too is a zoonotic disease, but one that has moved more slowly than an airborne NBO will surely do. Despite the theme – lively and buoyant writing. In other words, it’s readable. Quammen remains a master of science journalism. "
123,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/259402-sebastien,5,"Superb! David Quammen brings to life the stories of a wide variety of infectious diseases and their spillover from animals to humans. David is a great writer, his narrative drive and prose are magnificent. He does this while presenting the science in a very accessible yet amazingly informative way.What is astounding is the amount of work and research that must have gone into this book. David conducted a seemingly endless amount of interviews with scientists, researchers, doctors. To say he took it to the next level, well that is a vast understatement. This is science journalism/writing at its pinnacle.My particular favorite was the section on the ecology of borrelia (lyme). This is a subject that hits close to home for me.The section on malaria was very intriguing, learned a lot. The coolest thing was learning that a form of malaria had been used as therapy to treat syphilis (a form of therapy known as pyrotherapy). That blew my mind. If you're curious, here's an article on the subject: http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/bod...I was also fascinated by the HIV chapter. Could have done without his hypothesizing and reimagining of the original patient 0 story, I saw what he was trying to do, but that seemed a bit clunky and unnecessary. But that's a minor quibble with an otherwise outstanding book. Dang, the ebola chapter was incredible as well... so much good stuff in here."

Well, viruses and bacteria fascinate me and I'm piling up titles about the subject: Spillover is so far one of the best. It doesn't try to add drama and it sticks to the chronicles; the exception is the AIDS chapter, in which the author allows himself to turn the hypothesis of how the AIDS left the African jungles into a sort of fable.

It is longer than most science/ medicine books, but do not let that deter you. I was extremely sad when this book ended. I wanted more!In the middle of reading this book, I made the mistake of putting this book on pause to read the more recent Pandemic by Sonia Shah. Science is obviously not the authors strong suit. It was extremely disappointing. It might fly with people who are less scientifically literate. She had more up to date info on Ebola, which might draw in a huge readership, but her book doesn't hold a candle to this book. Quammen's book is a big WOW, on every level. When I finally returned from Pandemic, I was in such a foul mood, it was detracting from my enjoyment of this book. That only lasted for a little bit. I could not help but get sucked right back into all of Quammen's case studies and histories of various outbreaks. This book was well researched, extremely thorough, scientifically sound, well written, and entertaining as hell. His passion for his subject spilled over into every page and into me. I do not even want to give a summary of all the wonder inside this book because he tells the story of each virus so well, anything I would relate here feels like an actual spoiler. It is a must read!

127,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"Where Do ""Emerging Diseases"" Emerge From?AIDS, Ebola, Marburg, SARS, H5N1 — every one of the world’s scariest diseases is a “zoonosis,” that is, a virus harbored by animals and transmitted to humans, often by other animals, in a complex minuet that often stretches out into decades.AIDS, for example. According to the latest research, reported by David Quammen in Spillover, Patient Zero was not that French-Canadian flight attendant you may have read about who went amok in the 1970s but a hunter in Southeast Cameroon around 1908 who killed a chimpanzee and somehow unwittingly allowed the animal’s blood to seep into his own circulatory system, either through a cut or by eating his prey’s raw flesh. This is the phenomenon that epidemiologists call “spillover.” At that point, a particularly virulent form of a recently emergent simian virus found a friendly and familiar environment in the hunter’s blood and flourished, becoming what we know today as HIV-1 (the more lethal form of the virus that causes AIDS). Later, the hunter passed along the virus to one or more women through sexual contact, and the disease slowly spread, both by sex and by transmission through reused needles, undetected as anything out of the ordinary, from Cameroon into what is now called the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and other sub-Saharan countries, and thence by happenstance to Haiti. It was a Haitian harboring HIV-1 who probably passed it along to that notorious Canadian flight attendant, setting off the epidemic among gay men in North America.In Spillover, Quammen tells tales like these in fascinating detail, relating the stories of the often-heroic scientists, physicians, and veterinarians who worked directly with deadly diseases, occasionally at the cost of their own lives. Quammen spent years writing this book. He appears to have read all the relevant scientific literature, attended specialized scientific conferences, and spent long hours tracking down and speaking face-to-face with the people who discovered these diseases, isolated the viruses, first treated the symptoms, and labored for thankless years on end in laboratories around the world to help humanity avert the next pandemic.You may have read Richard Preston’s best-selling 2001 treatment of the emergence of Ebola in The Hot Zone. If not, I can tell you that I vividly recall the book because it was so dramatic, and so terrifying. No doubt I had nightmares about contracting Ebola. But it turns out, according to Quammen and to the eminent scientists he interviewed, that Preston’s account was sensationalized and highly inaccurate in essential details. For example, he described tears of blood, massive hemorrhages, and melted internal organs, none of which has any basis in fact.However, Spillover, in its own way, is no less frightening. Quammen advances the popular theory that what appears to be the accelerating emergence of dangerous new pathogens became inevitable as a result of the enormous population growth of homo sapiens — because humanity has increasingly encroached on animal habitat and come into intimate contact with animals as never before. In discussions with noted biologists, he explores the concept of “breakout,” the explosive growth frequently seen in some animal species that shortly leads to sudden, catastrophic — through disease. He intimates that, with AIDS — or, all too possibly, with the next pandemic — humankind may experience something similar. Despite all the horrific details about AIDS, Ebola, Marburg, and the like, these are the book’s scariest passages.David Quammen writes about science, nature, and travel — a total of 10 nonfiction books and five novels to date. A former Rhodes Scholar, he was educated at Yale and Oxford.(From www.malwarwickonbooks.com)"
128,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58119141-elena-sala,5,"SPILLOVER: ANIMAL INFECTIONS AND THE NEXT HUMAN PANDEMIC (2012) was the result of David Quammen's five years of research interviewing scientists who were looking into the possibility of another horrific Ebola-type disease emerging. At that time, believe it or not, there was a widespread consensus: there would indeed be a new disease, likely from the coronavirus family, coming out of a bat, and it would likely emerge in or around a wet market in China. So, how could the world be SO unprepared for this nightmarish pandemic?? This book was written 8 years before this pandemic so it does not attempt to answer this question. Though we can probably guess some possible answers.This book is about zoonoses, infectious diseases that originate in animals and spread to humans. Rabies, for example, is a zoonotic disease. HIV is also a zoonotic disease. Dengue, yellow fever, malaria, influenza, Lyme disease, MERS, SARS, Zika and COVID are all zoonoses. The technical term scientists use to describe the leap of a pathogen from one animal to another is “spillover”. Most infections start as spillovers. Some, like Ebola and lesser-known viral diseases (Nipah, Hendra, Marburg), are highly transmissible and virulent, but so far have been limited to sporadic outbreaks. They persist because they are endemic in a reservoir population through a process of mutual adaptation.Quammen explores the correlation between these diseases that come up one after the other. It should not come as a surprise that they are not mere accidents but unwanted consequences of our actions. How do these pathogens make the leap from animals to humans? Quammen's answer: ""we invade tropical forests and other wild landscapes, which harbor so many species of animals and plants. And within those creatures, so many viruses. We cut the trees, we kill the animals or cage them and send them to markets. We disrupt ecosystems and we shake viruses loose from their natural hosts. When that happens, they need a new host. Often, we are it.” And why does this seem to be happening more frequently in recent times? The answer, again in Quammen's own words is: ""there’s 7.8 billion of us on this planet—four times the number of humans at the time of the 1918 influenza. And we have quadrupled the speed we travel around the planet; we have quadrupled the size of some of our cities. So there are a lot more of us large-bodied vertebrate animals, living in dense aggregations, moving fluidly from one place to another... We’re the world’s greatest target for a virus—a great ecosystem for them to colonize. So when a virus does get into a human and finds it can replicate and transmit to the next human, that virus has opened the door to vast opportunity.""Quammen's journeys have taken him all around the world: inside the air-locked sterility of high-security biological research labs, through the crowded alleyways of Chinese live animal markets, into remote African and Asian villages that have experienced outbreaks of some of the most lethal diseases yet known to mankind. He has interviewed survivors of these diseases and the scientists doing all the research. He has been a science writer for over 35 years, interested in ecology and evolutionary biology. He uses a conversational tone and, occasionally, some dark humor to give a frightening and eye opening summary of all that is known about these zoonotic diseases. This is a book I highly recommend, not only because it is written in an engaging and accessible way, sober, rational yet suspenseful, but because it is clear that COVID will not be the last pandemic we will see. There will be more zoonoses because we are disrupting the environment more and more. So we need to think about our own responsibility and how we relate to our environment. Each one of us has a responsibility, because we are all consumers of food, resources, and energy. Each of the choices that we make about what we’re going to eat, wear, or buy draws on these wild ecosystems. This book invites the reader to think about these choices while explaining how we got into this mess in the first place."
129,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4," Fairly good coverage of a topic that is all over the headlines at the current moment epidemics from diseases that jump from animal to human mostly viruses. It would be really hard at this point to not know about Coronavirus and the pandemic it caused and its likely source from animals (probably bats). This has been a problem we have been aware of for quite some time with flu strains and aids, and Lyme disease, and zika virus, and ebola, and Marburg virus the list goes on. Only now the point is hammered home in a pandemic and a world-historical economic crisis. Some of us knew better but as usual, people didn't heed the warnings. They almost never do."
130,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,4,"The hubris of homo sapiens lies in believing that it holds sway over this planet but then hidden away from anything but the most powerful electron microscopes are organisms that can wreak havoc on all of us. These microorganisms are hardy, smart and incredibly adaptable when it comes to the question of how to survive and thrive among the biodiversity of the earth. If you were to romanticize the whole concept then it becomes very easy to paint the pathogen as the most dreaded enemy of mankind/ nature’s revenge on us etc. However, a rational perspective tells a story which is entirely different and utterly fascinating in a deadly way. The microorganism’s capability to jump across species to man and thereby begin devastating outbreaks is the premise of the book and the scientific term for such a happening is Zoonosis. In the words of the author about the need of such a book :  Why obsess about Zoonoses ? In the larger balance of miseries, what makes anyone think they should be taken so seriously ? It’s a fair question but there are good answers. Some of those answers are intricate and speculative. Some are subjective. Others are objective and blunt. The bluntest is this : AIDS. Let’s look at some zoonotic diseases other than AIDS : Ebola, Marburg, Avian and Swine Flu, SARS, Malaria, Hendra are but a few of them. All of these are without doubt some of the deadliest killer that we have encountered. David Quammen does a book length investigation into the history, nature and where we stand in the understanding of the microorganisms which cause these diseases. Quammen’s writing style is approachable and far less sensational than what I encountered with Richard Preston’s Hot Zone. While Preston horrified and thrilled me, Quammen offers a more informative and grounded view at the pathogens and their effects. He also travels far and wide for his research and converses with recovered patients, eyewitnesses, doctors and scientists and ergo a much more well-rounded view of what actually transpires during a disease outbreak comes to light. Of special mention is the chapter named The Chimp and River which is an in depth detective story that traces the journey of HIV from the jungles of Africa into the world at large. There are two things about the book that really caught my attention : • The number of mice and monkeys that die in the name of betterment and advancement of science in this book is huge. There were times when I paused and wondered if more of these hapless animals perish than humans.• Quammen is a first rate travel writer. His descriptions of Asia and Africa are measured views of anthropology, wildlife and the inevitable clash between the two.Parts of the book especially on the mathematical connects between the nature of mass outbreaks and about the lifecycles of viruses were difficult to comprehend. But that aside this is a fantastic book to understand how much nature has in store which man has no idea of. It also corrected for me the notion that nature uses viruses to eventually get back at humans ( courtesy Richard Preston). A virus is a non-thinking organism and one for which in a majority of the cases, a human host is next to an evolutionary dead end. It just so happens that with our invasive lifestyle, we breach the habitats of the virus and get caught in their snares.Recommended."
131,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,5,"I see why Quammen is so well thought of. Spillover was amazingly informative, had a near perfect execution, explained very difficult, scientific subjects in a manner that a reader with little science background could understand without making it so dumbed down that the same reader found themselves lost in a nexus of weakening metaphors and feeling insulted (I'm looking at you, Winchester). This is how you speak to your audience! You do not dumbdown, but rather heighten the discourse and inform. I learned so much, and was so in awe of what I was learning, and the research that was done by Quammen, and even more by the researching actively trying to save us from the ""Next Big One"" that nightly over dinner I'd tell my husband excitedly that he just HAD to read Spillover, because did you know this or that about ebola? Its the only audiobook that I have honestly considered restarting immediately. There is just so much to process here, so much that I realize I just didn't know, and so much more that I could learn from a second reading.This is a book that I think every person should read. There is as much (if not more) human interest as science, it can honestly keep you on the edge of your seat. I love nature, but it can be such a scary place without considering that maybe you just inhaled infected bat shit or dust from an aborted goat. But its also a beautiful place, where ecology matters, where there is balance, and as the eruption of human population continues (presumably unchecked for now) that balance is disturbed. I cannot stress enough, especially during this election cycle, how important an informed populace is. How can we make decisions in domestic protection, how we raise our livestock, how we tour, how we travel across the globe, how we transport EVERYTHING, how we mine, and how we manufacture if we are not informed of the consequences and the possible dangers of what we are doing. I'm not crazy, I'm not saying lets halt the world, but we need to understand that its not just about global warming, when ecologists are warning us of what we are doing to the planet. We have rapidly interconnected this world in a way that has never before happened. There are risks and benefits to that. Scientists are trying to study and prepare for the next big one, but should the unthinkable happen (its not unthinkable, its more that we refuse to think of it) how are we, as a populace, prepared to respond? We need to consider this.And, man, wash your hands if you butcher something, okay?"
132,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60209410-jordan-buckley,4,"Good information on zoonotic diseases (diseases that live in animal hosts and can spread to humans), which are pretty relevant at the moment because COVID-19 is believed to be one. Many major diseases are zoonoses or started that way, including HIV, Ebola, rabies, Lyme disease, SARS, swine flu, etc.There were a few major takeaways for me. You can't eradicate a zoonotic disease if it's still silently thriving in some animal population (""reservoir host""). The pathogen may just live happily in one or more animal species without causing any obvious symptoms, but could be deadly if it infects humans. The other big takeaway is that human civilization and activity is often what unearths these diseases or gives them the opportunity to thrive. As we expand we move into forests and come into contact with animals that may carry all kinds of unknown pathogens. Our new methods of factory farming and cramming animals together in their own excrement creates new opportunities for these things to thrive and spread. Tragedies like the current pandemic aren't just ""acts of God"" that we have no control over; they are brought on by our own activity.Like most nonfiction books I read, I wish it was much shorter. The author does a good job of making it interesting, but I could have done without so much of the breathless recounting of the journalist's search for truth, tracking down different hypotheses, biographical descriptions of the various interviewees, the fanciful hypothetical story of the imagined ""voyager"" who brought HIV out of the jungle and into human civilization. The story of the SARS outbreak was interesting for comparison to COVID-19, and it was notable to see coronaviruses mentioned repeatedly among other candidates as a risk for the next pandemic."

The Deer, the Parrot, & the Kid Next Door (Q Fever, Psittacosis, and Lyme disease)VI. Going Viral (General Virus Stuff, but Especially HIV)VII. Celestial Hosts (About Animals That Transmit Disease, Especially Bats, and Also Focuses on the Nipah virus)VIII. The Chimp and The River (HIV)IX. It Depends (Viruses of the Future)Onto the review.I wasn’t thinking about it when I snagged it at the library, but this was the perfect book to follow up The Hot Zone (and, in fact, this book references that one). That was a concentrated, focused look at one distinct family of viruses, the filoviruses. It was also more dramatized. This one takes that zoomed-in look and contextualizes it. Reminds us that 60% of all infections diseases that affect humans come from animals via zoonosis. Ebola, Marburg (the stars of The Hot Zone), rabies, hantavirus, anthrax, Lassa, Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, dengue, west nile, sars, typhus, mad cow disease, all forms of influenza, bubonic plague, Lyme disease, AIDS, and countless more. The author also points out something interesting- the diseases we’ve mostly eradicated, like smallpox and polio, are the rare ones that aren’t passed to humans by animals. That’s why we were able to eradicate them. People are easier to keep track of and vaccinate than animals. Nowhere for them to hide. Whereas Marburg or Ebola can lurk forever in hidden corners of caves, immortal. And why are these diseases popping up now? Practically all of these zoonotic (species-hopping) diseases are new. Like, zoonotic diseases barely existed at all before the 1960s, after which they started popping up everywhere in myriad forms. Why? Because we’re tearing apart ecosystems, breaking down the natural fabric of things, spreading ourselves where we ought not be a-spreadin’. These diseases had their natural hosts. They didn’t kill the hosts, they mostly lived in harmony with the host in some remote corner of the world. But when we wreck that natural host’s home and kill lots of them off, what’s a virus to do but to jump ship and latch onto humans if it wants to survive? Finally, I’d like to thank David Quammen for summarizing my feelings on life nicely: “Mathematics to me is like a language I don’t speak, though I admire its literature in translation.”"
136,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,5,"I try not to read books that make me paranoid or hypochondriac — and that's not the intention of this book — but I'll think twice next time that I'm in some exotic place and close to wild animals. The Monkey Forest in Bali was mentioned in this book in relation to herpes B (a deadly disease caused by a spillover from macaques monkeys to humans). Thanks goodness I feel a visceral revulsion towards monkeys. I didn't hand-feed any or let them climb up my head and shoulders so that I can take a picture with them. A little bite or scratch from the wrong monkey could seal your death sentence. This is a very well-researched, well-written, and highly-informative book on zoonosis — a pathogen leaping from an animal to humans. There have been recent scares with diseases like SARS and bird flu and swine flu that caused relatively limited damage and were contained. But you can never underestimate the danger of the Next Big One. We shouldn't forget that the Spanish flu at the end of the World War I killed by far more people than the war. As Quammen says, if you think we shouldn't concern ourselves too much with a local outbreak of an exotic disease like ebola that is caused by starving villagers in a remote corner of Congo eating a rotten dead chimp, the answer is: AIDS.The most interesting chapter of the book is the chapter on AIDS, which reads like a detective story. Here's the spoiler: the HIV virus first jumped from chimps to humans (quite likely when a hunter was butchering an infected chimp) somewhere in southeast Cameroon some time around 1908. What it was doing between then and the early 1980's when it became a global pandemic that has so far killed an estimated 35 million people is a fascinating story. "
137,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"Spillover is a well-written bio-thriller in the tradition of The Hot Zone, etc. It rehashes the same misleading theme of scary monster viruses waiting out there in the bushes to kill us all. It is good if you want a horror story, not if you want useful, accurate science about public health. As the subtitle indicates, it is focused on the hypothetical ""Next Big One"" but misses the point about what caused the actual Great Pandemic of 1918, repeating boilerplate nonsense about gene shifts etc. The demonstrably false idea that reassortment of the Hs and Ns in influenza virus is why you get a deadly pandemic is what caused the panics in 1976 and 2009 over the shift to H1N1. Both times there was no deadly pandemic. In 1976, the needless panic actually killed a bunch of people with a bad vaccine. In 2009, it cost billions and billions of dollars and created tremendous emotional stress for no apparent benefit. This is pretty obvious stuff. So why act as if nobody knows this and repeat old nonsense about what causes pandemics? The difference between a mild flu and a deadly one that kills 50 million people is not a reassortment of the genes. This is known. So what is the difference and how do we make germs be mild instead of lethal? That is a very important question, but you won't find the answer in this book. If you are interested in exploring this question, you may want to look at the TED talk by Paul Ewald: http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_ewald_a...."

It is scary, sure, because there are always new microbes out there ready to go rampaging through our vast society. It is also rather comforting, both the methodical search for vectors and reservoirs, the details of transmission and treatment, the stream of breakthroughs that enable researchers to locate and sequence. And through it all, Quammen maintains a casual, light conversational tone, reassuring the reader that sure, horrible new diseases can (and will) spring up seemingly out of nowhere to spread around the world, but that also we have been pretty good at controlling those sorts of outbreaks.There's quite a lot about Ebola here, written before this summer's outbreak. It should prove very comforting to everyone whose loved ones are not currently infected. I heap praise upon him for pointing out that it isn't nearly as grotesque as Preston painted it in The Hot Zone.The only part I really disliked was the pure fiction of The Voyager, which was too long and added nothing. This was particularly annoying as I was nearing the end and racing to finish quickly before the future biologist usurped in entirely.Library copyI don't usually comment on covers, but I will say that Chip Kidd managed to make a very disturbing one."

David Quammen convincingly argues that the greatest bugaboo for the human race should be a zoonosis, an infectious disease that spills over from an animal population into humans. He travels around the world and talks to scientists who have worked in the virus-riddled trenches of HIV, malaria, Ebola, SARS, and an ever-growing list of other nasties with shocking fatality rates. Particularly interesting is Quammen's notion that the historical rate of human population growth is itself an outbreak. We've proliferated like mad - at a speed unprecedented for a large mammal species. And what scientists know about outbreaks is that they always come to an end... While layman accessible, this detailed and hefty book takes perseverance, but it's well worth it for the amount of information you'll get in return. I'm going to go wash my hands now. And stay the heck away from bats. It's always bats! "

Back to my original review:Zoonotic pathogens, those that travel from other animals to human animals, have been with us, will be with us, have killed millions of people, will kill millions more. I read half of this book on the topic and got really really bored. Each chapter was ""And here's another example"" ""and here's yet another example."" He tried to spice that up with turning searching for the animal source of the pathogen into a mystery and by getting personal about the researchers (that is, applying fictional techniques to non fiction), but it couldn't disguise for me that it was all ""and here's another example."" I got the point by page 100. So I got past page 300 and then skimmed the rest. It's not badly written...it just got a bit boring for me.Here's the take-away advice I gleaned:1) Try to calm down. That zoonosis exists is largely beyond your control.2) To the extent you can control things: first, quit overbreeding. Overbreeding leads to human encroachment upon ecosystems where disease has happily been at equilibrium for tens of thousands of years. Overbreeding is awful for many reasons, but if you needed another, well, here's another. Overbreeders are bad world citizens.3) Don't, for heaven's sake, eat unusual game meat, particularly not game you find mysteriously dead on the ground with blood around its mouth. Also, glove/mask when treating sick domestic animals, yes, even beloved Fluffy, and when Fluffy does succumb, avoid kissing her bloody muzzle goodbye.4) Be rich and insured and ideally connected to the government in a first world country--not only can you buy farmed/ranched meat that's inspected and safe, if you do get sick, you'll get the best treatment available.5) That 33% of Americans aren't insured means the coming pandemic is going to be worse and spread faster and kill more here than in civilized countries where all citizens have access to health care. Not his point in the first 300 pages, but any thinking person can see it.6) Commercial airliners are really that dangerous for spreading disease--avoid if you can and rethink what ""vacation"" means to you. Sure, any given flight probably won't next Patient X on it...but it might. Is it really that important to board that plane?7) Religion helps spread pandemics because people pray and wallow in superstition instead of of getting treatment. When the next epidemic comes, pray/chant/positive-think/sacrifice a goat all you want, but not in a crowd, and get treatment, too."
142,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85488700-derrick-stormblessed,5,"What a frightful but entertaining read!! David Quammen is a brilliant scientist and storyteller all at once. He weaves narrative storytelling and science seamlessly like its the easiest thing ever. That's the source of the overall brilliance of the book. Quammen manages to use his own personal experiences with disease scientists at the centre of the research and others in the thick of things to make the book more entertaining. Billy Karesh studying chimps in Moba Bai, Beatrice Hahn at the heart of AIDS research, Engel and Jones-Engel a husband and wife team from New York investigating prevalence of a monkey virus in Bangladesh temples, a Chinese scientist searching for the reservoir of SARS, an Australian vet who survived the Hendra virus, etcThe book is basically about how animal diseases jump or spillover into humans. He narrates how these diseases, commonly classified as zoonoses first appeared on the scene and how people react to these diseases in the beginning, how scientific research unfolded and how they escalated into global epidemics in some cases. He also discusses the tiny pathogens responsible and their evolution into killer monsters. He deals with a long list of deadly diseases like Hendra, Ebola, malaria, AIDS, Lyme disease, Q fever, SARS, etc. All dangerous and potentially lethal bugs if not dealt with properly. A few themes appear throughout the book. One of them is how humans interfere with nature, eat what they are not supposed to or encroach on wild habitats. It's clear we are having more contact with animals, both domestic and wild, and this is one of the reasons why certain diseases have spilled over into humans. And also why in the future probably more lethal pathogens will spill over. As humans, we need to understand the nature of ecosystems better and try not to interfere with wildlife habitats. These diseases have killed millions and millions of people and it's clear that these bugs especially viruses have the upper hand over us and we should be weary of the potential devastation involved. Zoonotic diseases will continue to spill over in future. But how ling before we come across a pathogen capable of annihilating all of humankind?"

Quammen manages to make it understandable and compelling all at the same time. He helps the reader to understand the seriousness of the topic - and it is really serious -- without feeling alarmist. The book was published in 2012, so well before our current pandemic. After reading this, I feel much better equipped to decipher and understand the current reporting on COVID - 19, to make more educated decisions about what I am seeing on my news feed, to know when to be skeptical, and what my role can be in minimizing risk and spread (significant in all viruses with human to human transmission). I highly recommend this book if you want to understand more about viruses - their impact, their trajectory, and our options. With something as serious as what we are currently facing, I wanted more information that newspaper headlines and I wanted it to be, as much as possible, free from the political positioning -- just give me the science and the history so I can improve my context. Quammen did that exceptionally well. "

145,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3397530-lea,3,"This is a very interesting analysis of emerging zoonotic diseases, focusing on SARS, HIV, and Ebola, among others. There are so many facts here, it's a little overwhelming -- I learned so much that I'd never even thought of before, including the fact that HIV can actually be traced back to, wait for it . . . 1908?! Yeah, I didn't believe it at first, either, but the author clearly presents this in a way that is easy even for a non-scientist like myself to understand.After reading this, I can tell you for sure that I will NEVER go anywhere near a bat again -- these beautiful animals are apparently THE virus clearinghouse, for reasons that are explored in depth in this book.Ever wonder why we were able to effectively eradicate smallpox, but can't seem to put an end to malaria? Yep, it's in here.Here are a couple of quotes from the end of the book that I found interesting:""So before we respond either calmly or hysterically, either intelligently or doltishly, we should understand in some measure the basic outlines and dynamics of the situation. We should appreciate that these recent outbreaks of new zoonotic diseases, as well as the recurrence and spread of old ones, are part of a larger pattern, and that humanity is responsible for generating that pattern. We should recognize that they reflect things that we're DOING, not just things that are HAPPENING to us. WE should understand that, although some of the human-caused factors may seem virtually inexorable, others are within our control.""""That's the salubrious thing about zoonotic diseases: They remind us, as St. Francis did, that we humans are inseparable from the natural world. In fact, there IS no ""natural world,"" it's a bad and artificial phrase. There is only the world."""" . . . Dwyer's models have shown that heterogeneity of behavior, even among forest insects, let alone among humans, can be very important in damping the spread of infectious disease. . . . individual effort, individual discernment, individual choice can have huge effects in averting the catastrophes that might otherwise sweep through a herd. An individual gypsy moth may inherit a slightly superior ability to avoid smears of NPV as it grazes on a leaf. An individual human may choose not to drink the palm sap, not to eat the chimpanzee, not to pen the pig beneath mango trees, not to clear the horse's windpipe with his bare hand, not to have unprotected sex with the prostitute, not to share the needle in a shooting gallery, not to cough without covering her mouth, not to board a plane while feeling ill, or not to coop his chickens along with his ducks. ""Any tiny little thing that people do,"" Dwyer said, if it makes them different from one another, from the idealized standard of herd behavior, ""is going to reduce infection rates."" ""So why only three stars? David Quammen -- I wanted to add his author link right there, but GR won't let me, but go look him up because he's written a ton of interesting books -- is more than capable of writing a non-fiction book that would hold anyone's interest, yet he insists on inserting some extremely long passages of pure fiction as he speculates on the exact circumstances leading to the emergence of HIV-1. My husband will tell you, I'm more of a ""just the facts"" kind of person -- I neither need nor want speculation, especially when the facts are compelling on their own. If that kind of thing doesn't bother you, you may rate this one higher.Even with that, I would still recommend this."
146,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,4,"This book is about zoonoses--illnesses that spread from animals to people. It describes the typical process: the virus or bacteria lives, long-term and harmlessly, in a reservoir species. When it infects an amplifier species, it can spread more quickly to humans. For example, the Hendra virus has its reservoir in flying foxes (large Australian bats), but when it infects horses, it can spread to people, who are in much closer contact with their sick horses than with bats. Not only are zoonoses threatening because new ones can appear unexpectedly (like SARS or HIV), they are also essentially impossible to eradicate, unlike (say) polio, which is only found in humans, whom you can vaccinate. Bats come off rather badly in this book. In the past, I've learned that you should like them because they eat harmful insects. It turns out that they are the source of all sorts of nasty bugs, in the virus sense of the word.Quammen writes quite a bit about his travels to research the book, or how one scientist introduces him to another. Not only does this give the book a bit of a travelogue feeling, it also acknowledges the essential contributions of the people who tranquilize angry macaques or go out in the middle of the night to rig up bat nets--without which none of the science would have happened. His style is vivid and entertaining, though there's one passage in the chapter about HIV/AIDS that is strangely novelistic. Not bad, just incongruous and unnecessary.Nothing in this book will make you change your behavior, unless you are remiss about handwashing or routinely eat things bats have shat on. At the end the author emphasizes: ""The purpose of this book is not to make you more worried. The purpose of this book is to make you more smart. That's what most distinguishes humans from, say, tent caterpillars and gypsy moths. Unlike them, we can be pretty smart."" I didn't find this book particularly scary--just informative--so don't avoid it just on those grounds.To the extent it contains a call to action, the book reminds us that human pressure on ecological systems creates havoc. A relatively short section deals with Lyme disease and reveals the startling conclusion that Lyme flourishes in isolated areas. Think the islands in a parking lot rather than a forest. It's where we come in contact with ecologies that we've disrupted that we find zoonoses.P.S. Bonus points for sending me to the dictionary: ""cadastral.""P.P.S. Further bonus points for this sentence, even if the sentiment isn't new: ""[A]nyone who favors Intelligent Design in lieu of evolution might pause to wonder why God devoted so much of His intelligence to designing malarial parasites."""
147,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1182891-sue,5,"This book is a gripping tale of disease “spillover” that will thrill those interested in science – and probably many who aren’t. After all, we all get sick occasionally. Quammen looks at the ways pathogens (usually viruses) have spilled from animals to humans. He traces the origins of, among others, Ebola, SARS, bird flu, Lyme disease, and AIDS. These zoonotic diseases can escalate rapidly into global pandemics when human-to-human transmission occurs. For five years Quammen trailed scientists in their labs and in the field. Worldwide exchange of information turns out to be essential in epidemiology, and the solution to mysterious epidemics often means gathering data in far-flung places. Quammen himself traveled to China, to Bangladesh, to the Congo, to Connecticut. Data moves among such places, and so did the author. Everywhere there is mystery, drama, and good science.A long chapter (more than 20% of the book) traces the origins of HIV to a chimpanzee in Cameroon in the early 20th century. It’s a fascinating story. The author first tracked the evidence, working with scientists as they examined tissue samples that showed the spillover to be not in the 1980s, when the Western world first encountered it, but in the first decade of the 20th century. Quammen then allowed himself to think through a possible scenario which would have brought the virus down river to the Congo, initially moving slowly because its carriers might have died early of other causes, because the virus moved through areas of low population density, because it did not yet have the opportunity afforded by global travel and multiple sex partners.Ten years ago I had to abort a trip to Vietnam and China because of SARS, so the episode was very personal to me. That dread virus ran a deadly but short course. It turned out that the disease was transmissible after the person became ill, so it was eventually within the power of the health system to halt the spread. But it could reemerge. Civets, a diet delicacy blamed initially for the disease, turned out to be “amplifier” hosts but not “reservoir” hosts. This latter term applies to animals who host and live amicably with a virus which may cause great mischief in humans. For SARS, the reservoir was a bat, the amplifier was a civet, and the human who ate the civet was an unlucky, violently ill person. In fact, the eating of exotic (and often illegal) meats was a persistent theme in the entire book.As a non-scientist, I’ve possibly gotten a couple of things wrong in this review. Apologies. But I am pretty sure I’m going to be paying attention to the news about epidemics – as well as to, for example, ticks or exotic meats."
148,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17766893-matty-swytla,5,"A very good bok with scientific, yet approachable explanations to why zoonoses (animal diseases that infect humans) are so scary and deadly, especially when it comes to certain new viruses. The fact is zoonotic viruses and other diseases infect humans on a regular basis. I know; I was infected with ringworm (Dermatophytosis) by my kittens a few years ago - it's a fungal infection that spreads like fire. No fun but no biggie either. But any pet owner knows the drill on vaccinations for rabies and other diseases for dogs and cats. Some of these make the jump to humans with devastating results.The differences between carriers, natural reservoirs, and amplifiers is fascinating and illuminating. Some animals only spread viruses, bacteria or other illness-inducing organisms (mosquitoes for malaria); others live with them, a certain population of infected yet not very ill reservoirs from whence other animals and humans can get infected (bats, monkeys); while some animals get very ill and spread the infections further (amplifiers - often some domestic animals like pigs or poultry). It's important to make the distinction bewteen these or we won't know where to fight the disease in the first place. The book highlights why we should care about natural habitats, treat our animals with care, and not board a plane when feeling sick (!), but it doesn't fear-monger in any way. Yes, it does point out what people should or shouldn't do, what are the risk factors for contracting some exotic diseases, but it also highlights that ordinary diseases kill far more people than ebola, for example. Coronary disease, cancers, diabetes, traffic accidents... familiar killers we've gotten used to don't scare us as they should, while the thought of contracting a virus from a bat makes some people fear them like the plague. What the author makes clear time and time again is that local farmers in some god-forsaken parts of third-world countries (but in the West as well - not everyone is an epidemiologist or veterinarian) can't understand the full impact of an outbreak among their flock before it spreads. So education is key, and fast response from laboratories, research facilites, and medical institutions. I was amazed how much difference fast cooperation among scientists and medical doctors makes in terms of outbreak containment. Why doesn't the media highlight these achievements more and make people interested in science? What will it take? The next big virus or outbreak is just around the corner - it may be our ordinary flu not ebola."

150,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,4,"Good book. It was interesting to learn about how viruses and disease can pass over to humans. Certainly, relevant to the current situation particularly the sections about bats. The organization and pace of the book is good. It’s a mix of information, interviews and the author’s experiences while observing the scientists at work. I usually don’t like author’s personal experiences in works like this, but since he focuses on the research itself it’s not too irritating. The writing is readable if a bit too snarky at times. The content is great. I learned a lot about viruses and the research behind figuring out pandemics. It’s all very interesting. This book exceeded my expectations.  So, I give this a 4. It’s mostly readable and always interesting with clear implications for the current situation.  "
151,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,3,"This holds a ton of information that is helpful to hold some specifics re virus infections that proceed to humans. But it's not completely upon the title material.In fact, the writing is well accomplished. It's often clear and better than some of the highly scientific particulars and nomenclatures of pure science reads (very dry) elsewhere. But as much as I can decide it DID make the reading easier than most material in this genre, it also holds another quality I thought was a considerable distraction from that positive prose form. Quammen has a kind of tone that's strange to read (it was for me) and quite difficult to describe. It's not Chicken Little on meth (or a hate rant like Gerta Thunberg either) but it's not a logical nor scientific bottom line ""norm"" either. If I'm overstating that, I'm sorry. But some of this assumption and oversight is just plain wrong when he tends to expand from ""one"" to ""some"" to ""all"". And it some cases it seems to me, that this emotive occludes to some of the very actual world reality of how MOST virus pass into pandemic outcomes. And how they did in the past, as well. Like the 1918 and the other human influenza forms that went lethal since. There are huge portions of this book that read like a memoir and travelogue. It's just not direct to the title at all, immense pages of asides/ tangents.The history of some of the worst spillovers (like Hendra or other bat vector virus) were the best and most accurate parts- and I am glad I read it for the understanding of how an intermediate ""amplify"" animal is also usually a HUGE part of the ""it depends"" serendipity that results in these horrific outcomes. First a small ""usual"" mammal, then a mid vector animal and then other species- such as monkeys/apes or humans.It's not a book I would necessarily recommend. His personality and slant, I just feel, is containing quite a bit of ""group think"" and not enough science. But now I do comprehend more easily the trail through 3 or 4 species this virus morph road can take."
152,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3230750-molly,5,"Thrilled to see that David Quammen had a new science book, I snatched this up. It’s been 15 years since his book ""Song of the Dodo” about island biogeography, which remains at the top of my favorite non-fiction. Can one *enjoy* a book about infectious disease? Anyone who's read Richard Preston's “The Hot Zone” will guiltily admit, yes (interestingly, he takes Preston to task for overplaying descriptions of Ebola infection. “Bleeding out"" is not accurate.)There is inherent narrative drama in the question of when the Next Big One (NBO) will hit and in the epidemiological sleuthing to identify viruses and their host animals when an epidemic breaks. What will turn a local outbreak into a pandemic? Do scientists think there IS a NBO lurking? Quite possibly. And if so, it will assuredly originate in animals, as has almost all human infectious disease. Influenza, SARS, Marburg, Lyme disease - Quammen covers them all and more, and turns up startling facts. For one, the subtitle of his book could just as well be, ""From Bats to Humans."" But what put the book over the top in excellence and dramatic page-turning was the penultimate chapter on the origin of AIDS. In some ways the whole book was moving toward this chapter. The origins of HIV can now be pinned to a year (much earlier than you’d think) and a single spillover event; chimp to human. And Quammen makes the poignant and chilling case that lest you wonder why we should care about exotic diseases such as Marbug, consider the exponential trajectory and devastation of AIDS. It too is a zoonotic disease, but one that has moved more slowly than an airborne NBO will surely do. Despite the theme – lively and buoyant writing. In other words, it’s readable. Quammen remains a master of science journalism. "

David conducted a seemingly endless amount of interviews with scientists, researchers, doctors. To say he took it to the next level, well that is a vast understatement. This is science journalism/writing at its pinnacle.My particular favorite was the section on the ecology of borrelia (lyme). This is a subject that hits close to home for me.The section on malaria was very intriguing, learned a lot. The coolest thing was learning that a form of malaria had been used as therapy to treat syphilis (a form of therapy known as pyrotherapy). That blew my mind. If you're curious, here's an article on the subject: http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/bod...I was also fascinated by the HIV chapter. Could have done without his hypothesizing and reimagining of the original patient 0 story, I saw what he was trying to do, but that seemed a bit clunky and unnecessary. But that's a minor quibble with an otherwise outstanding book. Dang, the ebola chapter was incredible as well... so much good stuff in here."

Well, viruses and bacteria fascinate me and I'm piling up titles about the subject: Spillover is so far one of the best. It doesn't try to add drama and it sticks to the chronicles; the exception is the AIDS chapter, in which the author allows himself to turn the hypothesis of how the AIDS left the African jungles into a sort of fable.

I'll not try to lay out what's in the book (as if I could do that I'd need several degrees) I'd not be able to lay it out as I should.

It is longer than most science/ medicine books, but do not let that deter you. I was extremely sad when this book ended. I wanted more!In the middle of reading this book, I made the mistake of putting this book on pause to read the more recent Pandemic by Sonia Shah. Science is obviously not the authors strong suit. It was extremely disappointing. It might fly with people who are less scientifically literate. She had more up to date info on Ebola, which might draw in a huge readership, but her book doesn't hold a candle to this book. Quammen's book is a big WOW, on every level. When I finally returned from Pandemic, I was in such a foul mood, it was detracting from my enjoyment of this book. That only lasted for a little bit. I could not help but get sucked right back into all of Quammen's case studies and histories of various outbreaks. This book was well researched, extremely thorough, scientifically sound, well written, and entertaining as hell. His passion for his subject spilled over into every page and into me. I do not even want to give a summary of all the wonder inside this book because he tells the story of each virus so well, anything I would relate here feels like an actual spoiler. It is a must read!

According to the latest research, reported by David Quammen in Spillover, Patient Zero was not that French-Canadian flight attendant you may have read about who went amok in the 1970s but a hunter in Southeast Cameroon around 1908 who killed a chimpanzee and somehow unwittingly allowed the animal’s blood to seep into his own circulatory system, either through a cut or by eating his prey’s raw flesh. This is the phenomenon that epidemiologists call “spillover.” At that point, a particularly virulent form of a recently emergent simian virus found a friendly and familiar environment in the hunter’s blood and flourished, becoming what we know today as HIV-1 (the more lethal form of the virus that causes AIDS). Later, the hunter passed along the virus to one or more women through sexual contact, and the disease slowly spread, both by sex and by transmission through reused needles, undetected as anything out of the ordinary, from Cameroon into what is now called the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and other sub-Saharan countries, and thence by happenstance to Haiti. It was a Haitian harboring HIV-1 who probably passed it along to that notorious Canadian flight attendant, setting off the epidemic among gay men in North America.In Spillover, Quammen tells tales like these in fascinating detail, relating the stories of the often-heroic scientists, physicians, and veterinarians who worked directly with deadly diseases, occasionally at the cost of their own lives. Quammen spent years writing this book. He appears to have read all the relevant scientific literature, attended specialized scientific conferences, and spent long hours tracking down and speaking face-to-face with the people who discovered these diseases, isolated the viruses, first treated the symptoms, and labored for thankless years on end in laboratories around the world to help humanity avert the next pandemic.You may have read Richard Preston’s best-selling 2001 treatment of the emergence of Ebola in The Hot Zone. If not, I can tell you that I vividly recall the book because it was so dramatic, and so terrifying. No doubt I had nightmares about contracting Ebola. But it turns out, according to Quammen and to the eminent scientists he interviewed, that Preston’s account was sensationalized and highly inaccurate in essential details. For example, he described tears of blood, massive hemorrhages, and melted internal organs, none of which has any basis in fact.However, Spillover, in its own way, is no less frightening. Quammen advances the popular theory that what appears to be the accelerating emergence of dangerous new pathogens became inevitable as a result of the enormous population growth of homo sapiens — because humanity has increasingly encroached on animal habitat and come into intimate contact with animals as never before. In discussions with noted biologists, he explores the concept of “breakout,” the explosive growth frequently seen in some animal species that shortly leads to sudden, catastrophic — through disease. He intimates that, with AIDS — or, all too possibly, with the next pandemic — humankind may experience something similar. Despite all the horrific details about AIDS, Ebola, Marburg, and the like, these are the book’s scariest passages.David Quammen writes about science, nature, and travel — a total of 10 nonfiction books and five novels to date. A former Rhodes Scholar, he was educated at Yale and Oxford.(From www.malwarwickonbooks.com)"
158,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58119141-elena-sala,5,"SPILLOVER: ANIMAL INFECTIONS AND THE NEXT HUMAN PANDEMIC (2012) was the result of David Quammen's five years of research interviewing scientists who were looking into the possibility of another horrific Ebola-type disease emerging. At that time, believe it or not, there was a widespread consensus: there would indeed be a new disease, likely from the coronavirus family, coming out of a bat, and it would likely emerge in or around a wet market in China. So, how could the world be SO unprepared for this nightmarish pandemic?? This book was written 8 years before this pandemic so it does not attempt to answer this question. Though we can probably guess some possible answers.This book is about zoonoses, infectious diseases that originate in animals and spread to humans. Rabies, for example, is a zoonotic disease. HIV is also a zoonotic disease. Dengue, yellow fever, malaria, influenza, Lyme disease, MERS, SARS, Zika and COVID are all zoonoses. The technical term scientists use to describe the leap of a pathogen from one animal to another is “spillover”. Most infections start as spillovers. Some, like Ebola and lesser-known viral diseases (Nipah, Hendra, Marburg), are highly transmissible and virulent, but so far have been limited to sporadic outbreaks. They persist because they are endemic in a reservoir population through a process of mutual adaptation.Quammen explores the correlation between these diseases that come up one after the other. It should not come as a surprise that they are not mere accidents but unwanted consequences of our actions. How do these pathogens make the leap from animals to humans? Quammen's answer: ""we invade tropical forests and other wild landscapes, which harbor so many species of animals and plants. And within those creatures, so many viruses. We cut the trees, we kill the animals or cage them and send them to markets. We disrupt ecosystems and we shake viruses loose from their natural hosts. When that happens, they need a new host. Often, we are it.” And why does this seem to be happening more frequently in recent times? The answer, again in Quammen's own words is: ""there’s 7.8 billion of us on this planet—four times the number of humans at the time of the 1918 influenza. And we have quadrupled the speed we travel around the planet; we have quadrupled the size of some of our cities. So there are a lot more of us large-bodied vertebrate animals, living in dense aggregations, moving fluidly from one place to another... We’re the world’s greatest target for a virus—a great ecosystem for them to colonize. So when a virus does get into a human and finds it can replicate and transmit to the next human, that virus has opened the door to vast opportunity.""Quammen's journeys have taken him all around the world: inside the air-locked sterility of high-security biological research labs, through the crowded alleyways of Chinese live animal markets, into remote African and Asian villages that have experienced outbreaks of some of the most lethal diseases yet known to mankind. He has interviewed survivors of these diseases and the scientists doing all the research. He has been a science writer for over 35 years, interested in ecology and evolutionary biology. He uses a conversational tone and, occasionally, some dark humor to give a frightening and eye opening summary of all that is known about these zoonotic diseases. This is a book I highly recommend, not only because it is written in an engaging and accessible way, sober, rational yet suspenseful, but because it is clear that COVID will not be the last pandemic we will see. There will be more zoonoses because we are disrupting the environment more and more. So we need to think about our own responsibility and how we relate to our environment. Each one of us has a responsibility, because we are all consumers of food, resources, and energy. Each of the choices that we make about what we’re going to eat, wear, or buy draws on these wild ecosystems. This book invites the reader to think about these choices while explaining how we got into this mess in the first place."

It would be really hard at this point to not know about Coronavirus and the pandemic it caused and its likely source from animals (probably bats). This has been a problem we have been aware of for quite some time with flu strains and aids, and Lyme disease, and zika virus, and ebola, and Marburg virus the list goes on. Only now the point is hammered home in a pandemic and a world-historical economic crisis. Some of us knew better but as usual, people didn't heed the warnings. They almost never do."
160,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,4,"The hubris of homo sapiens lies in believing that it holds sway over this planet but then hidden away from anything but the most powerful electron microscopes are organisms that can wreak havoc on all of us. These microorganisms are hardy, smart and incredibly adaptable when it comes to the question of how to survive and thrive among the biodiversity of the earth. If you were to romanticize the whole concept then it becomes very easy to paint the pathogen as the most dreaded enemy of mankind/ nature’s revenge on us etc. However, a rational perspective tells a story which is entirely different and utterly fascinating in a deadly way. The microorganism’s capability to jump across species to man and thereby begin devastating outbreaks is the premise of the book and the scientific term for such a happening is Zoonosis. In the words of the author about the need of such a book :  Why obsess about Zoonoses ? In the larger balance of miseries, what makes anyone think they should be taken so seriously ? It’s a fair question but there are good answers. Some of those answers are intricate and speculative. Some are subjective. Others are objective and blunt. The bluntest is this : AIDS. Let’s look at some zoonotic diseases other than AIDS : Ebola, Marburg, Avian and Swine Flu, SARS, Malaria, Hendra are but a few of them. All of these are without doubt some of the deadliest killer that we have encountered. David Quammen does a book length investigation into the history, nature and where we stand in the understanding of the microorganisms which cause these diseases. Quammen’s writing style is approachable and far less sensational than what I encountered with Richard Preston’s Hot Zone. While Preston horrified and thrilled me, Quammen offers a more informative and grounded view at the pathogens and their effects. He also travels far and wide for his research and converses with recovered patients, eyewitnesses, doctors and scientists and ergo a much more well-rounded view of what actually transpires during a disease outbreak comes to light. Of special mention is the chapter named The Chimp and River which is an in depth detective story that traces the journey of HIV from the jungles of Africa into the world at large. There are two things about the book that really caught my attention : • The number of mice and monkeys that die in the name of betterment and advancement of science in this book is huge. There were times when I paused and wondered if more of these hapless animals perish than humans.• Quammen is a first rate travel writer. His descriptions of Asia and Africa are measured views of anthropology, wildlife and the inevitable clash between the two.Parts of the book especially on the mathematical connects between the nature of mass outbreaks and about the lifecycles of viruses were difficult to comprehend. But that aside this is a fantastic book to understand how much nature has in store which man has no idea of. It also corrected for me the notion that nature uses viruses to eventually get back at humans ( courtesy Richard Preston). A virus is a non-thinking organism and one for which in a majority of the cases, a human host is next to an evolutionary dead end. It just so happens that with our invasive lifestyle, we breach the habitats of the virus and get caught in their snares.Recommended."
161,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,5,"I see why Quammen is so well thought of. Spillover was amazingly informative, had a near perfect execution, explained very difficult, scientific subjects in a manner that a reader with little science background could understand without making it so dumbed down that the same reader found themselves lost in a nexus of weakening metaphors and feeling insulted (I'm looking at you, Winchester). This is how you speak to your audience! You do not dumbdown, but rather heighten the discourse and inform. I learned so much, and was so in awe of what I was learning, and the research that was done by Quammen, and even more by the researching actively trying to save us from the ""Next Big One"" that nightly over dinner I'd tell my husband excitedly that he just HAD to read Spillover, because did you know this or that about ebola? Its the only audiobook that I have honestly considered restarting immediately. There is just so much to process here, so much that I realize I just didn't know, and so much more that I could learn from a second reading.This is a book that I think every person should read. There is as much (if not more) human interest as science, it can honestly keep you on the edge of your seat. I love nature, but it can be such a scary place without considering that maybe you just inhaled infected bat shit or dust from an aborted goat. But its also a beautiful place, where ecology matters, where there is balance, and as the eruption of human population continues (presumably unchecked for now) that balance is disturbed. I cannot stress enough, especially during this election cycle, how important an informed populace is. How can we make decisions in domestic protection, how we raise our livestock, how we tour, how we travel across the globe, how we transport EVERYTHING, how we mine, and how we manufacture if we are not informed of the consequences and the possible dangers of what we are doing. I'm not crazy, I'm not saying lets halt the world, but we need to understand that its not just about global warming, when ecologists are warning us of what we are doing to the planet. We have rapidly interconnected this world in a way that has never before happened. There are risks and benefits to that. Scientists are trying to study and prepare for the next big one, but should the unthinkable happen (its not unthinkable, its more that we refuse to think of it) how are we, as a populace, prepared to respond? We need to consider this.And, man, wash your hands if you butcher something, okay?"
162,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60209410-jordan-buckley,4,"Good information on zoonotic diseases (diseases that live in animal hosts and can spread to humans), which are pretty relevant at the moment because COVID-19 is believed to be one. Many major diseases are zoonoses or started that way, including HIV, Ebola, rabies, Lyme disease, SARS, swine flu, etc.There were a few major takeaways for me. You can't eradicate a zoonotic disease if it's still silently thriving in some animal population (""reservoir host""). The pathogen may just live happily in one or more animal species without causing any obvious symptoms, but could be deadly if it infects humans. The other big takeaway is that human civilization and activity is often what unearths these diseases or gives them the opportunity to thrive. As we expand we move into forests and come into contact with animals that may carry all kinds of unknown pathogens. Our new methods of factory farming and cramming animals together in their own excrement creates new opportunities for these things to thrive and spread. Tragedies like the current pandemic aren't just ""acts of God"" that we have no control over; they are brought on by our own activity.Like most nonfiction books I read, I wish it was much shorter. The author does a good job of making it interesting, but I could have done without so much of the breathless recounting of the journalist's search for truth, tracking down different hypotheses, biographical descriptions of the various interviewees, the fanciful hypothetical story of the imagined ""voyager"" who brought HIV out of the jungle and into human civilization. The story of the SARS outbreak was interesting for comparison to COVID-19, and it was notable to see coronaviruses mentioned repeatedly among other candidates as a risk for the next pandemic."

Super, super relevant right now, and from my memory this book references EEE, though don't quote me. *Review*First things first. I hate when I look at a nonfiction book table of contents and can’t tell by the name of the chapters what they cover. For those who feel the same, here is the annotated table of contents:I. Pale Horse (Hendra virus)II. Thirteen Gorillas (Ebola virus)III. Everything Comes From Somewhere (Malaria)IV. Dinner at the Rat Farm (SARS)V. The Deer, the Parrot, & the Kid Next Door (Q Fever, Psittacosis, and Lyme disease)VI. Going Viral (General Virus Stuff, but Especially HIV)VII. Celestial Hosts (About Animals That Transmit Disease, Especially Bats, and Also Focuses on the Nipah virus)VIII. The Chimp and The River (HIV)IX. It Depends (Viruses of the Future)Onto the review.I wasn’t thinking about it when I snagged it at the library, but this was the perfect book to follow up The Hot Zone (and, in fact, this book references that one). That was a concentrated, focused look at one distinct family of viruses, the filoviruses. It was also more dramatized. This one takes that zoomed-in look and contextualizes it. Reminds us that 60% of all infections diseases that affect humans come from animals via zoonosis. Ebola, Marburg (the stars of The Hot Zone), rabies, hantavirus, anthrax, Lassa, Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, dengue, west nile, sars, typhus, mad cow disease, all forms of influenza, bubonic plague, Lyme disease, AIDS, and countless more. The author also points out something interesting- the diseases we’ve mostly eradicated, like smallpox and polio, are the rare ones that aren’t passed to humans by animals. That’s why we were able to eradicate them. People are easier to keep track of and vaccinate than animals. Nowhere for them to hide. Whereas Marburg or Ebola can lurk forever in hidden corners of caves, immortal. And why are these diseases popping up now? Practically all of these zoonotic (species-hopping) diseases are new. Like, zoonotic diseases barely existed at all before the 1960s, after which they started popping up everywhere in myriad forms. Why? Because we’re tearing apart ecosystems, breaking down the natural fabric of things, spreading ourselves where we ought not be a-spreadin’. These diseases had their natural hosts. They didn’t kill the hosts, they mostly lived in harmony with the host in some remote corner of the world. But when we wreck that natural host’s home and kill lots of them off, what’s a virus to do but to jump ship and latch onto humans if it wants to survive? Finally, I’d like to thank David Quammen for summarizing my feelings on life nicely: “Mathematics to me is like a language I don’t speak, though I admire its literature in translation.”"
166,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,5,"I try not to read books that make me paranoid or hypochondriac — and that's not the intention of this book — but I'll think twice next time that I'm in some exotic place and close to wild animals. The Monkey Forest in Bali was mentioned in this book in relation to herpes B (a deadly disease caused by a spillover from macaques monkeys to humans). Thanks goodness I feel a visceral revulsion towards monkeys. I didn't hand-feed any or let them climb up my head and shoulders so that I can take a picture with them. A little bite or scratch from the wrong monkey could seal your death sentence. This is a very well-researched, well-written, and highly-informative book on zoonosis — a pathogen leaping from an animal to humans. There have been recent scares with diseases like SARS and bird flu and swine flu that caused relatively limited damage and were contained. But you can never underestimate the danger of the Next Big One. We shouldn't forget that the Spanish flu at the end of the World War I killed by far more people than the war. As Quammen says, if you think we shouldn't concern ourselves too much with a local outbreak of an exotic disease like ebola that is caused by starving villagers in a remote corner of Congo eating a rotten dead chimp, the answer is: AIDS.The most interesting chapter of the book is the chapter on AIDS, which reads like a detective story. Here's the spoiler: the HIV virus first jumped from chimps to humans (quite likely when a hunter was butchering an infected chimp) somewhere in southeast Cameroon some time around 1908. What it was doing between then and the early 1980's when it became a global pandemic that has so far killed an estimated 35 million people is a fascinating story. "
167,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"Spillover is a well-written bio-thriller in the tradition of The Hot Zone, etc. It rehashes the same misleading theme of scary monster viruses waiting out there in the bushes to kill us all. It is good if you want a horror story, not if you want useful, accurate science about public health. As the subtitle indicates, it is focused on the hypothetical ""Next Big One"" but misses the point about what caused the actual Great Pandemic of 1918, repeating boilerplate nonsense about gene shifts etc. The demonstrably false idea that reassortment of the Hs and Ns in influenza virus is why you get a deadly pandemic is what caused the panics in 1976 and 2009 over the shift to H1N1. Both times there was no deadly pandemic. In 1976, the needless panic actually killed a bunch of people with a bad vaccine. In 2009, it cost billions and billions of dollars and created tremendous emotional stress for no apparent benefit. This is pretty obvious stuff. So why act as if nobody knows this and repeat old nonsense about what causes pandemics? The difference between a mild flu and a deadly one that kills 50 million people is not a reassortment of the genes. This is known. So what is the difference and how do we make germs be mild instead of lethal? That is a very important question, but you won't find the answer in this book. If you are interested in exploring this question, you may want to look at the TED talk by Paul Ewald: http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_ewald_a...."
168,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1072582-kaethe-douglas,4,"This is a book about zoonoses, diseases that come to humans from other animals. It is scary, sure, because there are always new microbes out there ready to go rampaging through our vast society. It is also rather comforting, both the methodical search for vectors and reservoirs, the details of transmission and treatment, the stream of breakthroughs that enable researchers to locate and sequence. And through it all, Quammen maintains a casual, light conversational tone, reassuring the reader that sure, horrible new diseases can (and will) spring up seemingly out of nowhere to spread around the world, but that also we have been pretty good at controlling those sorts of outbreaks.There's quite a lot about Ebola here, written before this summer's outbreak. It should prove very comforting to everyone whose loved ones are not currently infected. I heap praise upon him for pointing out that it isn't nearly as grotesque as Preston painted it in The Hot Zone.The only part I really disliked was the pure fiction of The Voyager, which was too long and added nothing. This was particularly annoying as I was nearing the end and racing to finish quickly before the future biologist usurped in entirely.Library copyI don't usually comment on covers, but I will say that Chip Kidd managed to make a very disturbing one."

David Quammen convincingly argues that the greatest bugaboo for the human race should be a zoonosis, an infectious disease that spills over from an animal population into humans. He travels around the world and talks to scientists who have worked in the virus-riddled trenches of HIV, malaria, Ebola, SARS, and an ever-growing list of other nasties with shocking fatality rates. Particularly interesting is Quammen's notion that the historical rate of human population growth is itself an outbreak. We've proliferated like mad - at a speed unprecedented for a large mammal species. And what scientists know about outbreaks is that they always come to an end... While layman accessible, this detailed and hefty book takes perseverance, but it's well worth it for the amount of information you'll get in return. I'm going to go wash my hands now.

Back to my original review:Zoonotic pathogens, those that travel from other animals to human animals, have been with us, will be with us, have killed millions of people, will kill millions more. I read half of this book on the topic and got really really bored. Each chapter was ""And here's another example"" ""and here's yet another example."" He tried to spice that up with turning searching for the animal source of the pathogen into a mystery and by getting personal about the researchers (that is, applying fictional techniques to non fiction), but it couldn't disguise for me that it was all ""and here's another example."" I got the point by page 100. So I got past page 300 and then skimmed the rest. It's not badly written...it just got a bit boring for me.Here's the take-away advice I gleaned:1) Try to calm down. That zoonosis exists is largely beyond your control.2) To the extent you can control things: first, quit overbreeding. Overbreeding leads to human encroachment upon ecosystems where disease has happily been at equilibrium for tens of thousands of years. Overbreeding is awful for many reasons, but if you needed another, well, here's another. Overbreeders are bad world citizens.3) Don't, for heaven's sake, eat unusual game meat, particularly not game you find mysteriously dead on the ground with blood around its mouth. Also, glove/mask when treating sick domestic animals, yes, even beloved Fluffy, and when Fluffy does succumb, avoid kissing her bloody muzzle goodbye.4) Be rich and insured and ideally connected to the government in a first world country--not only can you buy farmed/ranched meat that's inspected and safe, if you do get sick, you'll get the best treatment available.5) That 33% of Americans aren't insured means the coming pandemic is going to be worse and spread faster and kill more here than in civilized countries where all citizens have access to health care. Not his point in the first 300 pages, but any thinking person can see it.6) Commercial airliners are really that dangerous for spreading disease--avoid if you can and rethink what ""vacation"" means to you. Sure, any given flight probably won't next Patient X on it...but it might. Is it really that important to board that plane?7) Religion helps spread pandemics because people pray and wallow in superstition instead of of getting treatment. When the next epidemic comes, pray/chant/positive-think/sacrifice a goat all you want, but not in a crowd, and get treatment, too."

He weaves narrative storytelling and science seamlessly like its the easiest thing ever. That's the source of the overall brilliance of the book. Quammen manages to use his own personal experiences with disease scientists at the centre of the research and others in the thick of things to make the book more entertaining. Billy Karesh studying chimps in Moba Bai, Beatrice Hahn at the heart of AIDS research, Engel and Jones-Engel a husband and wife team from New York investigating prevalence of a monkey virus in Bangladesh temples, a Chinese scientist searching for the reservoir of SARS, an Australian vet who survived the Hendra virus, etcThe book is basically about how animal diseases jump or spillover into humans. He narrates how these diseases, commonly classified as zoonoses first appeared on the scene and how people react to these diseases in the beginning, how scientific research unfolded and how they escalated into global epidemics in some cases. He also discusses the tiny pathogens responsible and their evolution into killer monsters. He deals with a long list of deadly diseases like Hendra, Ebola, malaria, AIDS, Lyme disease, Q fever, SARS, etc. All dangerous and potentially lethal bugs if not dealt with properly. A few themes appear throughout the book. One of them is how humans interfere with nature, eat what they are not supposed to or encroach on wild habitats. It's clear we are having more contact with animals, both domestic and wild, and this is one of the reasons why certain diseases have spilled over into humans. And also why in the future probably more lethal pathogens will spill over. As humans, we need to understand the nature of ecosystems better and try not to interfere with wildlife habitats. These diseases have killed millions and millions of people and it's clear that these bugs especially viruses have the upper hand over us and we should be weary of the potential devastation involved. Zoonotic diseases will continue to spill over in future. But how ling before we come across a pathogen capable of annihilating all of humankind?"

Quammen manages to make it understandable and compelling all at the same time. He helps the reader to understand the seriousness of the topic - and it is really serious -- without feeling alarmist. The book was published in 2012, so well before our current pandemic. After reading this, I feel much better equipped to decipher and understand the current reporting on COVID - 19, to make more educated decisions about what I am seeing on my news feed, to know when to be skeptical, and what my role can be in minimizing risk and spread (significant in all viruses with human to human transmission). I highly recommend this book if you want to understand more about viruses - their impact, their trajectory, and our options. With something as serious as what we are currently facing, I wanted more information that newspaper headlines and I wanted it to be, as much as possible, free from the political positioning -- just give me the science and the history so I can improve my context. Quammen did that exceptionally well. "

There are so many facts here, it's a little overwhelming -- I learned so much that I'd never even thought of before, including the fact that HIV can actually be traced back to, wait for it . . . 1908?! Yeah, I didn't believe it at first, either, but the author clearly presents this in a way that is easy even for a non-scientist like myself to understand.After reading this, I can tell you for sure that I will NEVER go anywhere near a bat again -- these beautiful animals are apparently THE virus clearinghouse, for reasons that are explored in depth in this book.Ever wonder why we were able to effectively eradicate smallpox, but can't seem to put an end to malaria? Yep, it's in here.Here are a couple of quotes from the end of the book that I found interesting:""So before we respond either calmly or hysterically, either intelligently or doltishly, we should understand in some measure the basic outlines and dynamics of the situation. We should appreciate that these recent outbreaks of new zoonotic diseases, as well as the recurrence and spread of old ones, are part of a larger pattern, and that humanity is responsible for generating that pattern. We should recognize that they reflect things that we're DOING, not just things that are HAPPENING to us. WE should understand that, although some of the human-caused factors may seem virtually inexorable, others are within our control.""""That's the salubrious thing about zoonotic diseases: They remind us, as St. Francis did, that we humans are inseparable from the natural world. In fact, there IS no ""natural world,"" it's a bad and artificial phrase. There is only the world."""" . . . Dwyer's models have shown that heterogeneity of behavior, even among forest insects, let alone among humans, can be very important in damping the spread of infectious disease. . . . individual effort, individual discernment, individual choice can have huge effects in averting the catastrophes that might otherwise sweep through a herd. An individual gypsy moth may inherit a slightly superior ability to avoid smears of NPV as it grazes on a leaf. An individual human may choose not to drink the palm sap, not to eat the chimpanzee, not to pen the pig beneath mango trees, not to clear the horse's windpipe with his bare hand, not to have unprotected sex with the prostitute, not to share the needle in a shooting gallery, not to cough without covering her mouth, not to board a plane while feeling ill, or not to coop his chickens along with his ducks. ""Any tiny little thing that people do,"" Dwyer said, if it makes them different from one another, from the idealized standard of herd behavior, ""is going to reduce infection rates."" ""So why only three stars? David Quammen -- I wanted to add his author link right there, but GR won't let me, but go look him up because he's written a ton of interesting books -- is more than capable of writing a non-fiction book that would hold anyone's interest, yet he insists on inserting some extremely long passages of pure fiction as he speculates on the exact circumstances leading to the emergence of HIV-1. My husband will tell you, I'm more of a ""just the facts"" kind of person -- I neither need nor want speculation, especially when the facts are compelling on their own. If that kind of thing doesn't bother you, you may rate this one higher.Even with that, I would still recommend this."
176,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,4,"This book is about zoonoses--illnesses that spread from animals to people. It describes the typical process: the virus or bacteria lives, long-term and harmlessly, in a reservoir species. When it infects an amplifier species, it can spread more quickly to humans. For example, the Hendra virus has its reservoir in flying foxes (large Australian bats), but when it infects horses, it can spread to people, who are in much closer contact with their sick horses than with bats. Not only are zoonoses threatening because new ones can appear unexpectedly (like SARS or HIV), they are also essentially impossible to eradicate, unlike (say) polio, which is only found in humans, whom you can vaccinate. Bats come off rather badly in this book. In the past, I've learned that you should like them because they eat harmful insects. It turns out that they are the source of all sorts of nasty bugs, in the virus sense of the word.Quammen writes quite a bit about his travels to research the book, or how one scientist introduces him to another. Not only does this give the book a bit of a travelogue feeling, it also acknowledges the essential contributions of the people who tranquilize angry macaques or go out in the middle of the night to rig up bat nets--without which none of the science would have happened. His style is vivid and entertaining, though there's one passage in the chapter about HIV/AIDS that is strangely novelistic. Not bad, just incongruous and unnecessary.Nothing in this book will make you change your behavior, unless you are remiss about handwashing or routinely eat things bats have shat on. At the end the author emphasizes: ""The purpose of this book is not to make you more worried. The purpose of this book is to make you more smart. That's what most distinguishes humans from, say, tent caterpillars and gypsy moths. Unlike them, we can be pretty smart."" I didn't find this book particularly scary--just informative--so don't avoid it just on those grounds.To the extent it contains a call to action, the book reminds us that human pressure on ecological systems creates havoc. A relatively short section deals with Lyme disease and reveals the startling conclusion that Lyme flourishes in isolated areas. Think the islands in a parking lot rather than a forest. It's where we come in contact with ecologies that we've disrupted that we find zoonoses.P.S. Bonus points for sending me to the dictionary: ""cadastral.""P.P.S. Further bonus points for this sentence, even if the sentiment isn't new: ""[A]nyone who favors Intelligent Design in lieu of evolution might pause to wonder why God devoted so much of His intelligence to designing malarial parasites."""
177,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1182891-sue,5,"This book is a gripping tale of disease “spillover” that will thrill those interested in science – and probably many who aren’t. After all, we all get sick occasionally. Quammen looks at the ways pathogens (usually viruses) have spilled from animals to humans. He traces the origins of, among others, Ebola, SARS, bird flu, Lyme disease, and AIDS. These zoonotic diseases can escalate rapidly into global pandemics when human-to-human transmission occurs. For five years Quammen trailed scientists in their labs and in the field. Worldwide exchange of information turns out to be essential in epidemiology, and the solution to mysterious epidemics often means gathering data in far-flung places. Quammen himself traveled to China, to Bangladesh, to the Congo, to Connecticut. Data moves among such places, and so did the author. Everywhere there is mystery, drama, and good science.A long chapter (more than 20% of the book) traces the origins of HIV to a chimpanzee in Cameroon in the early 20th century. It’s a fascinating story. The author first tracked the evidence, working with scientists as they examined tissue samples that showed the spillover to be not in the 1980s, when the Western world first encountered it, but in the first decade of the 20th century. Quammen then allowed himself to think through a possible scenario which would have brought the virus down river to the Congo, initially moving slowly because its carriers might have died early of other causes, because the virus moved through areas of low population density, because it did not yet have the opportunity afforded by global travel and multiple sex partners.Ten years ago I had to abort a trip to Vietnam and China because of SARS, so the episode was very personal to me. That dread virus ran a deadly but short course. It turned out that the disease was transmissible after the person became ill, so it was eventually within the power of the health system to halt the spread. But it could reemerge. Civets, a diet delicacy blamed initially for the disease, turned out to be “amplifier” hosts but not “reservoir” hosts. This latter term applies to animals who host and live amicably with a virus which may cause great mischief in humans. For SARS, the reservoir was a bat, the amplifier was a civet, and the human who ate the civet was an unlucky, violently ill person. In fact, the eating of exotic (and often illegal) meats was a persistent theme in the entire book.As a non-scientist, I’ve possibly gotten a couple of things wrong in this review. Apologies. But I am pretty sure I’m going to be paying attention to the news about epidemics – as well as to, for example, ticks or exotic meats."
178,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17766893-matty-swytla,5,"A very good bok with scientific, yet approachable explanations to why zoonoses (animal diseases that infect humans) are so scary and deadly, especially when it comes to certain new viruses. The fact is zoonotic viruses and other diseases infect humans on a regular basis. I know; I was infected with ringworm (Dermatophytosis) by my kittens a few years ago - it's a fungal infection that spreads like fire. No fun but no biggie either. But any pet owner knows the drill on vaccinations for rabies and other diseases for dogs and cats. Some of these make the jump to humans with devastating results.The differences between carriers, natural reservoirs, and amplifiers is fascinating and illuminating. Some animals only spread viruses, bacteria or other illness-inducing organisms (mosquitoes for malaria); others live with them, a certain population of infected yet not very ill reservoirs from whence other animals and humans can get infected (bats, monkeys); while some animals get very ill and spread the infections further (amplifiers - often some domestic animals like pigs or poultry). It's important to make the distinction bewteen these or we won't know where to fight the disease in the first place. The book highlights why we should care about natural habitats, treat our animals with care, and not board a plane when feeling sick (!), but it doesn't fear-monger in any way. Yes, it does point out what people should or shouldn't do, what are the risk factors for contracting some exotic diseases, but it also highlights that ordinary diseases kill far more people than ebola, for example. Coronary disease, cancers, diabetes, traffic accidents... familiar killers we've gotten used to don't scare us as they should, while the thought of contracting a virus from a bat makes some people fear them like the plague. What the author makes clear time and time again is that local farmers in some god-forsaken parts of third-world countries (but in the West as well - not everyone is an epidemiologist or veterinarian) can't understand the full impact of an outbreak among their flock before it spreads. So education is key, and fast response from laboratories, research facilites, and medical institutions. I was amazed how much difference fast cooperation among scientists and medical doctors makes in terms of outbreak containment. Why doesn't the media highlight these achievements more and make people interested in science? What will it take? The next big virus or outbreak is just around the corner - it may be our ordinary flu not ebola."

180,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,4,"Good book. It was interesting to learn about how viruses and disease can pass over to humans. Certainly, relevant to the current situation particularly the sections about bats. The organization and pace of the book is good. It’s a mix of information, interviews and the author’s experiences while observing the scientists at work. I usually don’t like author’s personal experiences in works like this, but since he focuses on the research itself it’s not too irritating. The writing is readable if a bit too snarky at times. The content is great. I learned a lot about viruses and the research behind figuring out pandemics. It’s all very interesting. This book exceeded my expectations.  So, I give this a 4. It’s mostly readable and always interesting with clear implications for the current situation.  "
181,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,3,"This holds a ton of information that is helpful to hold some specifics re virus infections that proceed to humans. But it's not completely upon the title material.In fact, the writing is well accomplished. It's often clear and better than some of the highly scientific particulars and nomenclatures of pure science reads (very dry) elsewhere. But as much as I can decide it DID make the reading easier than most material in this genre, it also holds another quality I thought was a considerable distraction from that positive prose form. Quammen has a kind of tone that's strange to read (it was for me) and quite difficult to describe. It's not Chicken Little on meth (or a hate rant like Gerta Thunberg either) but it's not a logical nor scientific bottom line ""norm"" either. If I'm overstating that, I'm sorry. But some of this assumption and oversight is just plain wrong when he tends to expand from ""one"" to ""some"" to ""all"". And it some cases it seems to me, that this emotive occludes to some of the very actual world reality of how MOST virus pass into pandemic outcomes. And how they did in the past, as well. Like the 1918 and the other human influenza forms that went lethal since. There are huge portions of this book that read like a memoir and travelogue. It's just not direct to the title at all, immense pages of asides/ tangents.The history of some of the worst spillovers (like Hendra or other bat vector virus) were the best and most accurate parts- and I am glad I read it for the understanding of how an intermediate ""amplify"" animal is also usually a HUGE part of the ""it depends"" serendipity that results in these horrific outcomes. First a small ""usual"" mammal, then a mid vector animal and then other species- such as monkeys/apes or humans.It's not a book I would necessarily recommend. His personality and slant, I just feel, is containing quite a bit of ""group think"" and not enough science. But now I do comprehend more easily the trail through 3 or 4 species this virus morph road can take."
182,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3230750-molly,5,"Thrilled to see that David Quammen had a new science book, I snatched this up. It’s been 15 years since his book ""Song of the Dodo” about island biogeography, which remains at the top of my favorite non-fiction. Can one *enjoy* a book about infectious disease? Anyone who's read Richard Preston's “The Hot Zone” will guiltily admit, yes (interestingly, he takes Preston to task for overplaying descriptions of Ebola infection. “Bleeding out"" is not accurate.)There is inherent narrative drama in the question of when the Next Big One (NBO) will hit and in the epidemiological sleuthing to identify viruses and their host animals when an epidemic breaks. What will turn a local outbreak into a pandemic? Do scientists think there IS a NBO lurking? Quite possibly. And if so, it will assuredly originate in animals, as has almost all human infectious disease. Influenza, SARS, Marburg, Lyme disease - Quammen covers them all and more, and turns up startling facts. For one, the subtitle of his book could just as well be, ""From Bats to Humans."" But what put the book over the top in excellence and dramatic page-turning was the penultimate chapter on the origin of AIDS. In some ways the whole book was moving toward this chapter. The origins of HIV can now be pinned to a year (much earlier than you’d think) and a single spillover event; chimp to human. And Quammen makes the poignant and chilling case that lest you wonder why we should care about exotic diseases such as Marbug, consider the exponential trajectory and devastation of AIDS. It too is a zoonotic disease, but one that has moved more slowly than an airborne NBO will surely do. Despite the theme – lively and buoyant writing. In other words, it’s readable. Quammen remains a master of science journalism. "

David is a great writer, his narrative drive and prose are magnificent. He does this while presenting the science in a very accessible yet amazingly informative way.What is astounding is the amount of work and research that must have gone into this book. David conducted a seemingly endless amount of interviews with scientists, researchers, doctors. To say he took it to the next level, well that is a vast understatement. This is science journalism/writing at its pinnacle.My particular favorite was the section on the ecology of borrelia (lyme). This is a subject that hits close to home for me.The section on malaria was very intriguing, learned a lot. The coolest thing was learning that a form of malaria had been used as therapy to treat syphilis (a form of therapy known as pyrotherapy). That blew my mind. If you're curious, here's an article on the subject: http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/bod...I was also fascinated by the HIV chapter. Could have done without his hypothesizing and reimagining of the original patient 0 story, I saw what he was trying to do, but that seemed a bit clunky and unnecessary.

Well, viruses and bacteria fascinate me and I'm piling up titles about the subject: Spillover is so far one of the best.

It is longer than most science/ medicine books, but do not let that deter you. I was extremely sad when this book ended. I wanted more!In the middle of reading this book, I made the mistake of putting this book on pause to read the more recent Pandemic by Sonia Shah. Science is obviously not the authors strong suit. It was extremely disappointing. It might fly with people who are less scientifically literate. She had more up to date info on Ebola, which might draw in a huge readership, but her book doesn't hold a candle to this book. Quammen's book is a big WOW, on every level. When I finally returned from Pandemic, I was in such a foul mood, it was detracting from my enjoyment of this book. That only lasted for a little bit. I could not help but get sucked right back into all of Quammen's case studies and histories of various outbreaks. This book was well researched, extremely thorough, scientifically sound, well written, and entertaining as hell. His passion for his subject spilled over into every page and into me. I do not even want to give a summary of all the wonder inside this book because he tells the story of each virus so well, anything I would relate here feels like an actual spoiler. It is a must read!

187,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"Where Do ""Emerging Diseases"" Emerge From?AIDS, Ebola, Marburg, SARS, H5N1 — every one of the world’s scariest diseases is a “zoonosis,” that is, a virus harbored by animals and transmitted to humans, often by other animals, in a complex minuet that often stretches out into decades.AIDS, for example. According to the latest research, reported by David Quammen in Spillover, Patient Zero was not that French-Canadian flight attendant you may have read about who went amok in the 1970s but a hunter in Southeast Cameroon around 1908 who killed a chimpanzee and somehow unwittingly allowed the animal’s blood to seep into his own circulatory system, either through a cut or by eating his prey’s raw flesh. This is the phenomenon that epidemiologists call “spillover.” At that point, a particularly virulent form of a recently emergent simian virus found a friendly and familiar environment in the hunter’s blood and flourished, becoming what we know today as HIV-1 (the more lethal form of the virus that causes AIDS). Later, the hunter passed along the virus to one or more women through sexual contact, and the disease slowly spread, both by sex and by transmission through reused needles, undetected as anything out of the ordinary, from Cameroon into what is now called the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and other sub-Saharan countries, and thence by happenstance to Haiti. It was a Haitian harboring HIV-1 who probably passed it along to that notorious Canadian flight attendant, setting off the epidemic among gay men in North America.In Spillover, Quammen tells tales like these in fascinating detail, relating the stories of the often-heroic scientists, physicians, and veterinarians who worked directly with deadly diseases, occasionally at the cost of their own lives. Quammen spent years writing this book. He appears to have read all the relevant scientific literature, attended specialized scientific conferences, and spent long hours tracking down and speaking face-to-face with the people who discovered these diseases, isolated the viruses, first treated the symptoms, and labored for thankless years on end in laboratories around the world to help humanity avert the next pandemic.You may have read Richard Preston’s best-selling 2001 treatment of the emergence of Ebola in The Hot Zone. If not, I can tell you that I vividly recall the book because it was so dramatic, and so terrifying. No doubt I had nightmares about contracting Ebola. But it turns out, according to Quammen and to the eminent scientists he interviewed, that Preston’s account was sensationalized and highly inaccurate in essential details. For example, he described tears of blood, massive hemorrhages, and melted internal organs, none of which has any basis in fact.However, Spillover, in its own way, is no less frightening. Quammen advances the popular theory that what appears to be the accelerating emergence of dangerous new pathogens became inevitable as a result of the enormous population growth of homo sapiens — because humanity has increasingly encroached on animal habitat and come into intimate contact with animals as never before. In discussions with noted biologists, he explores the concept of “breakout,” the explosive growth frequently seen in some animal species that shortly leads to sudden, catastrophic — through disease. He intimates that, with AIDS — or, all too possibly, with the next pandemic — humankind may experience something similar. Despite all the horrific details about AIDS, Ebola, Marburg, and the like, these are the book’s scariest passages.David Quammen writes about science, nature, and travel — a total of 10 nonfiction books and five novels to date. A former Rhodes Scholar, he was educated at Yale and Oxford.(From www.malwarwickonbooks.com)"
188,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58119141-elena-sala,5,"SPILLOVER: ANIMAL INFECTIONS AND THE NEXT HUMAN PANDEMIC (2012) was the result of David Quammen's five years of research interviewing scientists who were looking into the possibility of another horrific Ebola-type disease emerging. At that time, believe it or not, there was a widespread consensus: there would indeed be a new disease, likely from the coronavirus family, coming out of a bat, and it would likely emerge in or around a wet market in China. So, how could the world be SO unprepared for this nightmarish pandemic?? This book was written 8 years before this pandemic so it does not attempt to answer this question. Though we can probably guess some possible answers.This book is about zoonoses, infectious diseases that originate in animals and spread to humans. Rabies, for example, is a zoonotic disease. HIV is also a zoonotic disease. Dengue, yellow fever, malaria, influenza, Lyme disease, MERS, SARS, Zika and COVID are all zoonoses. The technical term scientists use to describe the leap of a pathogen from one animal to another is “spillover”. Most infections start as spillovers. Some, like Ebola and lesser-known viral diseases (Nipah, Hendra, Marburg), are highly transmissible and virulent, but so far have been limited to sporadic outbreaks. They persist because they are endemic in a reservoir population through a process of mutual adaptation.Quammen explores the correlation between these diseases that come up one after the other. It should not come as a surprise that they are not mere accidents but unwanted consequences of our actions. How do these pathogens make the leap from animals to humans? Quammen's answer: ""we invade tropical forests and other wild landscapes, which harbor so many species of animals and plants. And within those creatures, so many viruses. We cut the trees, we kill the animals or cage them and send them to markets. We disrupt ecosystems and we shake viruses loose from their natural hosts. When that happens, they need a new host. Often, we are it.” And why does this seem to be happening more frequently in recent times? The answer, again in Quammen's own words is: ""there’s 7.8 billion of us on this planet—four times the number of humans at the time of the 1918 influenza. And we have quadrupled the speed we travel around the planet; we have quadrupled the size of some of our cities. So there are a lot more of us large-bodied vertebrate animals, living in dense aggregations, moving fluidly from one place to another... We’re the world’s greatest target for a virus—a great ecosystem for them to colonize. So when a virus does get into a human and finds it can replicate and transmit to the next human, that virus has opened the door to vast opportunity.""Quammen's journeys have taken him all around the world: inside the air-locked sterility of high-security biological research labs, through the crowded alleyways of Chinese live animal markets, into remote African and Asian villages that have experienced outbreaks of some of the most lethal diseases yet known to mankind. He has interviewed survivors of these diseases and the scientists doing all the research. He has been a science writer for over 35 years, interested in ecology and evolutionary biology. He uses a conversational tone and, occasionally, some dark humor to give a frightening and eye opening summary of all that is known about these zoonotic diseases. This is a book I highly recommend, not only because it is written in an engaging and accessible way, sober, rational yet suspenseful, but because it is clear that COVID will not be the last pandemic we will see. There will be more zoonoses because we are disrupting the environment more and more. So we need to think about our own responsibility and how we relate to our environment. Each one of us has a responsibility, because we are all consumers of food, resources, and energy. Each of the choices that we make about what we’re going to eat, wear, or buy draws on these wild ecosystems. This book invites the reader to think about these choices while explaining how we got into this mess in the first place."

This has been a problem we have been aware of for quite some time with flu strains and aids, and Lyme disease, and zika virus, and ebola, and Marburg virus the list goes on. Only now the point is hammered home in a pandemic and a world-historical economic crisis. Some of us knew better but as usual, people didn't heed the warnings. They almost never do."

If you were to romanticize the whole concept then it becomes very easy to paint the pathogen as the most dreaded enemy of mankind/ nature’s revenge on us etc. However, a rational perspective tells a story which is entirely different and utterly fascinating in a deadly way. The microorganism’s capability to jump across species to man and thereby begin devastating outbreaks is the premise of the book and the scientific term for such a happening is Zoonosis. In the words of the author about the need of such a book :  Why obsess about Zoonoses ? In the larger balance of miseries, what makes anyone think they should be taken so seriously ? It’s a fair question but there are good answers. Some of those answers are intricate and speculative. Some are subjective. Others are objective and blunt. The bluntest is this : AIDS. Let’s look at some zoonotic diseases other than AIDS : Ebola, Marburg, Avian and Swine Flu, SARS, Malaria, Hendra are but a few of them. All of these are without doubt some of the deadliest killer that we have encountered. David Quammen does a book length investigation into the history, nature and where we stand in the understanding of the microorganisms which cause these diseases. Quammen’s writing style is approachable and far less sensational than what I encountered with Richard Preston’s Hot Zone. While Preston horrified and thrilled me, Quammen offers a more informative and grounded view at the pathogens and their effects. He also travels far and wide for his research and converses with recovered patients, eyewitnesses, doctors and scientists and ergo a much more well-rounded view of what actually transpires during a disease outbreak comes to light. Of special mention is the chapter named The Chimp and River which is an in depth detective story that traces the journey of HIV from the jungles of Africa into the world at large. There are two things about the book that really caught my attention : • The number of mice and monkeys that die in the name of betterment and advancement of science in this book is huge. There were times when I paused and wondered if more of these hapless animals perish than humans.• Quammen is a first rate travel writer. His descriptions of Asia and Africa are measured views of anthropology, wildlife and the inevitable clash between the two.Parts of the book especially on the mathematical connects between the nature of mass outbreaks and about the lifecycles of viruses were difficult to comprehend. But that aside this is a fantastic book to understand how much nature has in store which man has no idea of. It also corrected for me the notion that nature uses viruses to eventually get back at humans ( courtesy Richard Preston). A virus is a non-thinking organism and one for which in a majority of the cases, a human host is next to an evolutionary dead end. It just so happens that with our invasive lifestyle, we breach the habitats of the virus and get caught in their snares.Recommended."
191,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,5,"I see why Quammen is so well thought of. Spillover was amazingly informative, had a near perfect execution, explained very difficult, scientific subjects in a manner that a reader with little science background could understand without making it so dumbed down that the same reader found themselves lost in a nexus of weakening metaphors and feeling insulted (I'm looking at you, Winchester). This is how you speak to your audience! You do not dumbdown, but rather heighten the discourse and inform. I learned so much, and was so in awe of what I was learning, and the research that was done by Quammen, and even more by the researching actively trying to save us from the ""Next Big One"" that nightly over dinner I'd tell my husband excitedly that he just HAD to read Spillover, because did you know this or that about ebola? Its the only audiobook that I have honestly considered restarting immediately. There is just so much to process here, so much that I realize I just didn't know, and so much more that I could learn from a second reading.This is a book that I think every person should read. There is as much (if not more) human interest as science, it can honestly keep you on the edge of your seat. I love nature, but it can be such a scary place without considering that maybe you just inhaled infected bat shit or dust from an aborted goat. But its also a beautiful place, where ecology matters, where there is balance, and as the eruption of human population continues (presumably unchecked for now) that balance is disturbed. I cannot stress enough, especially during this election cycle, how important an informed populace is. How can we make decisions in domestic protection, how we raise our livestock, how we tour, how we travel across the globe, how we transport EVERYTHING, how we mine, and how we manufacture if we are not informed of the consequences and the possible dangers of what we are doing. I'm not crazy, I'm not saying lets halt the world, but we need to understand that its not just about global warming, when ecologists are warning us of what we are doing to the planet. We have rapidly interconnected this world in a way that has never before happened. There are risks and benefits to that. Scientists are trying to study and prepare for the next big one, but should the unthinkable happen (its not unthinkable, its more that we refuse to think of it) how are we, as a populace, prepared to respond? We need to consider this.And, man, wash your hands if you butcher something, okay?"
192,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60209410-jordan-buckley,4,"Good information on zoonotic diseases (diseases that live in animal hosts and can spread to humans), which are pretty relevant at the moment because COVID-19 is believed to be one. Many major diseases are zoonoses or started that way, including HIV, Ebola, rabies, Lyme disease, SARS, swine flu, etc.There were a few major takeaways for me. You can't eradicate a zoonotic disease if it's still silently thriving in some animal population (""reservoir host""). The pathogen may just live happily in one or more animal species without causing any obvious symptoms, but could be deadly if it infects humans. The other big takeaway is that human civilization and activity is often what unearths these diseases or gives them the opportunity to thrive. As we expand we move into forests and come into contact with animals that may carry all kinds of unknown pathogens. Our new methods of factory farming and cramming animals together in their own excrement creates new opportunities for these things to thrive and spread. Tragedies like the current pandemic aren't just ""acts of God"" that we have no control over; they are brought on by our own activity.Like most nonfiction books I read, I wish it was much shorter. The author does a good job of making it interesting, but I could have done without so much of the breathless recounting of the journalist's search for truth, tracking down different hypotheses, biographical descriptions of the various interviewees, the fanciful hypothetical story of the imagined ""voyager"" who brought HIV out of the jungle and into human civilization. The story of the SARS outbreak was interesting for comparison to COVID-19, and it was notable to see coronaviruses mentioned repeatedly among other candidates as a risk for the next pandemic."

Super, super relevant right now, and from my memory this book references EEE, though don't quote me. *Review*First things first. I hate when I look at a nonfiction book table of contents and can’t tell by the name of the chapters what they cover. For those who feel the same, here is the annotated table of contents:I. Pale Horse (Hendra virus)II. Thirteen Gorillas (Ebola virus)III. Everything Comes From Somewhere (Malaria)IV. Dinner at the Rat Farm (SARS)V. The Deer, the Parrot, & the Kid Next Door (Q Fever, Psittacosis, and Lyme disease)VI. Going Viral (General Virus Stuff, but Especially HIV)VII. Celestial Hosts (About Animals That Transmit Disease, Especially Bats, and Also Focuses on the Nipah virus)VIII. The Chimp and The River (HIV)IX. It Depends (Viruses of the Future)Onto the review.I wasn’t thinking about it when I snagged it at the library, but this was the perfect book to follow up The Hot Zone (and, in fact, this book references that one). That was a concentrated, focused look at one distinct family of viruses, the filoviruses. It was also more dramatized. This one takes that zoomed-in look and contextualizes it. Reminds us that 60% of all infections diseases that affect humans come from animals via zoonosis. Ebola, Marburg (the stars of The Hot Zone), rabies, hantavirus, anthrax, Lassa, Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, dengue, west nile, sars, typhus, mad cow disease, all forms of influenza, bubonic plague, Lyme disease, AIDS, and countless more. The author also points out something interesting- the diseases we’ve mostly eradicated, like smallpox and polio, are the rare ones that aren’t passed to humans by animals. That’s why we were able to eradicate them. People are easier to keep track of and vaccinate than animals. Nowhere for them to hide. Whereas Marburg or Ebola can lurk forever in hidden corners of caves, immortal. And why are these diseases popping up now? Practically all of these zoonotic (species-hopping) diseases are new. Like, zoonotic diseases barely existed at all before the 1960s, after which they started popping up everywhere in myriad forms. Why? Because we’re tearing apart ecosystems, breaking down the natural fabric of things, spreading ourselves where we ought not be a-spreadin’. These diseases had their natural hosts. They didn’t kill the hosts, they mostly lived in harmony with the host in some remote corner of the world. But when we wreck that natural host’s home and kill lots of them off, what’s a virus to do but to jump ship and latch onto humans if it wants to survive? Finally, I’d like to thank David Quammen for summarizing my feelings on life nicely: “Mathematics to me is like a language I don’t speak, though I admire its literature in translation.”"
196,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,5,"I try not to read books that make me paranoid or hypochondriac — and that's not the intention of this book — but I'll think twice next time that I'm in some exotic place and close to wild animals. The Monkey Forest in Bali was mentioned in this book in relation to herpes B (a deadly disease caused by a spillover from macaques monkeys to humans). Thanks goodness I feel a visceral revulsion towards monkeys. I didn't hand-feed any or let them climb up my head and shoulders so that I can take a picture with them. A little bite or scratch from the wrong monkey could seal your death sentence. This is a very well-researched, well-written, and highly-informative book on zoonosis — a pathogen leaping from an animal to humans. There have been recent scares with diseases like SARS and bird flu and swine flu that caused relatively limited damage and were contained. But you can never underestimate the danger of the Next Big One. We shouldn't forget that the Spanish flu at the end of the World War I killed by far more people than the war. As Quammen says, if you think we shouldn't concern ourselves too much with a local outbreak of an exotic disease like ebola that is caused by starving villagers in a remote corner of Congo eating a rotten dead chimp, the answer is: AIDS.The most interesting chapter of the book is the chapter on AIDS, which reads like a detective story. Here's the spoiler: the HIV virus first jumped from chimps to humans (quite likely when a hunter was butchering an infected chimp) somewhere in southeast Cameroon some time around 1908. What it was doing between then and the early 1980's when it became a global pandemic that has so far killed an estimated 35 million people is a fascinating story. "
197,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"Spillover is a well-written bio-thriller in the tradition of The Hot Zone, etc. It rehashes the same misleading theme of scary monster viruses waiting out there in the bushes to kill us all. It is good if you want a horror story, not if you want useful, accurate science about public health. As the subtitle indicates, it is focused on the hypothetical ""Next Big One"" but misses the point about what caused the actual Great Pandemic of 1918, repeating boilerplate nonsense about gene shifts etc. The demonstrably false idea that reassortment of the Hs and Ns in influenza virus is why you get a deadly pandemic is what caused the panics in 1976 and 2009 over the shift to H1N1. Both times there was no deadly pandemic. In 1976, the needless panic actually killed a bunch of people with a bad vaccine. In 2009, it cost billions and billions of dollars and created tremendous emotional stress for no apparent benefit. This is pretty obvious stuff. So why act as if nobody knows this and repeat old nonsense about what causes pandemics? The difference between a mild flu and a deadly one that kills 50 million people is not a reassortment of the genes. This is known. So what is the difference and how do we make germs be mild instead of lethal? That is a very important question, but you won't find the answer in this book. If you are interested in exploring this question, you may want to look at the TED talk by Paul Ewald: http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_ewald_a...."

It is scary, sure, because there are always new microbes out there ready to go rampaging through our vast society. It is also rather comforting, both the methodical search for vectors and reservoirs, the details of transmission and treatment, the stream of breakthroughs that enable researchers to locate and sequence. And through it all, Quammen maintains a casual, light conversational tone, reassuring the reader that sure, horrible new diseases can (and will) spring up seemingly out of nowhere to spread around the world, but that also we have been pretty good at controlling those sorts of outbreaks.There's quite a lot about Ebola here, written before this summer's outbreak. It should prove very comforting to everyone whose loved ones are not currently infected. I heap praise upon him for pointing out that it isn't nearly as grotesque as Preston painted it in The Hot Zone.The only part I really disliked was the pure fiction of The Voyager, which was too long and added nothing. This was particularly annoying as I was nearing the end and racing to finish quickly before the future biologist usurped in entirely.Library copyI don't usually comment on covers, but I will say that Chip Kidd managed to make a very disturbing one."

David Quammen convincingly argues that the greatest bugaboo for the human race should be a zoonosis, an infectious disease that spills over from an animal population into humans. He travels around the world and talks to scientists who have worked in the virus-riddled trenches of HIV, malaria, Ebola, SARS, and an ever-growing list of other nasties with shocking fatality rates. Particularly interesting is Quammen's notion that the historical rate of human population growth is itself an outbreak. We've proliferated like mad - at a speed unprecedented for a large mammal species. And what scientists know about outbreaks is that they always come to an end... While layman accessible, this detailed and hefty book takes perseverance, but it's well worth it for the amount of information you'll get in return. I'm going to go wash my hands now.

Back to my original review:Zoonotic pathogens, those that travel from other animals to human animals, have been with us, will be with us, have killed millions of people, will kill millions more. I read half of this book on the topic and got really really bored. Each chapter was ""And here's another example"" ""and here's yet another example."" He tried to spice that up with turning searching for the animal source of the pathogen into a mystery and by getting personal about the researchers (that is, applying fictional techniques to non fiction), but it couldn't disguise for me that it was all ""and here's another example."" I got the point by page 100. So I got past page 300 and then skimmed the rest. It's not badly written...it just got a bit boring for me.Here's the take-away advice I gleaned:1) Try to calm down. That zoonosis exists is largely beyond your control.2) To the extent you can control things: first, quit overbreeding. Overbreeding leads to human encroachment upon ecosystems where disease has happily been at equilibrium for tens of thousands of years. Overbreeding is awful for many reasons, but if you needed another, well, here's another. Overbreeders are bad world citizens.3) Don't, for heaven's sake, eat unusual game meat, particularly not game you find mysteriously dead on the ground with blood around its mouth. Also, glove/mask when treating sick domestic animals, yes, even beloved Fluffy, and when Fluffy does succumb, avoid kissing her bloody muzzle goodbye.4) Be rich and insured and ideally connected to the government in a first world country--not only can you buy farmed/ranched meat that's inspected and safe, if you do get sick, you'll get the best treatment available.5) That 33% of Americans aren't insured means the coming pandemic is going to be worse and spread faster and kill more here than in civilized countries where all citizens have access to health care. Not his point in the first 300 pages, but any thinking person can see it.6) Commercial airliners are really that dangerous for spreading disease--avoid if you can and rethink what ""vacation"" means to you. Sure, any given flight probably won't next Patient X on it...but it might. Is it really that important to board that plane?7) Religion helps spread pandemics because people pray and wallow in superstition instead of of getting treatment. When the next epidemic comes, pray/chant/positive-think/sacrifice a goat all you want, but not in a crowd, and get treatment, too."

He weaves narrative storytelling and science seamlessly like its the easiest thing ever. That's the source of the overall brilliance of the book. Quammen manages to use his own personal experiences with disease scientists at the centre of the research and others in the thick of things to make the book more entertaining. Billy Karesh studying chimps in Moba Bai, Beatrice Hahn at the heart of AIDS research, Engel and Jones-Engel a husband and wife team from New York investigating prevalence of a monkey virus in Bangladesh temples, a Chinese scientist searching for the reservoir of SARS, an Australian vet who survived the Hendra virus, etcThe book is basically about how animal diseases jump or spillover into humans. He narrates how these diseases, commonly classified as zoonoses first appeared on the scene and how people react to these diseases in the beginning, how scientific research unfolded and how they escalated into global epidemics in some cases. He also discusses the tiny pathogens responsible and their evolution into killer monsters. He deals with a long list of deadly diseases like Hendra, Ebola, malaria, AIDS, Lyme disease, Q fever, SARS, etc. All dangerous and potentially lethal bugs if not dealt with properly. A few themes appear throughout the book. One of them is how humans interfere with nature, eat what they are not supposed to or encroach on wild habitats. It's clear we are having more contact with animals, both domestic and wild, and this is one of the reasons why certain diseases have spilled over into humans. And also why in the future probably more lethal pathogens will spill over. As humans, we need to understand the nature of ecosystems better and try not to interfere with wildlife habitats. These diseases have killed millions and millions of people and it's clear that these bugs especially viruses have the upper hand over us and we should be weary of the potential devastation involved. Zoonotic diseases will continue to spill over in future. But how ling before we come across a pathogen capable of annihilating all of humankind?"

Quammen manages to make it understandable and compelling all at the same time. He helps the reader to understand the seriousness of the topic - and it is really serious -- without feeling alarmist. The book was published in 2012, so well before our current pandemic. After reading this, I feel much better equipped to decipher and understand the current reporting on COVID - 19, to make more educated decisions about what I am seeing on my news feed, to know when to be skeptical, and what my role can be in minimizing risk and spread (significant in all viruses with human to human transmission). I highly recommend this book if you want to understand more about viruses - their impact, their trajectory, and our options. With something as serious as what we are currently facing, I wanted more information that newspaper headlines and I wanted it to be, as much as possible, free from the political positioning -- just give me the science and the history so I can improve my context.

Yeah, I didn't believe it at first, either, but the author clearly presents this in a way that is easy even for a non-scientist like myself to understand.After reading this, I can tell you for sure that I will NEVER go anywhere near a bat again -- these beautiful animals are apparently THE virus clearinghouse, for reasons that are explored in depth in this book.Ever wonder why we were able to effectively eradicate smallpox, but can't seem to put an end to malaria? Yep, it's in here.Here are a couple of quotes from the end of the book that I found interesting:""So before we respond either calmly or hysterically, either intelligently or doltishly, we should understand in some measure the basic outlines and dynamics of the situation. We should appreciate that these recent outbreaks of new zoonotic diseases, as well as the recurrence and spread of old ones, are part of a larger pattern, and that humanity is responsible for generating that pattern. We should recognize that they reflect things that we're DOING, not just things that are HAPPENING to us. WE should understand that, although some of the human-caused factors may seem virtually inexorable, others are within our control.""""That's the salubrious thing about zoonotic diseases: They remind us, as St. Francis did, that we humans are inseparable from the natural world. In fact, there IS no ""natural world,"" it's a bad and artificial phrase. There is only the world."""" . . . Dwyer's models have shown that heterogeneity of behavior, even among forest insects, let alone among humans, can be very important in damping the spread of infectious disease. . . . individual effort, individual discernment, individual choice can have huge effects in averting the catastrophes that might otherwise sweep through a herd. An individual gypsy moth may inherit a slightly superior ability to avoid smears of NPV as it grazes on a leaf. An individual human may choose not to drink the palm sap, not to eat the chimpanzee, not to pen the pig beneath mango trees, not to clear the horse's windpipe with his bare hand, not to have unprotected sex with the prostitute, not to share the needle in a shooting gallery, not to cough without covering her mouth, not to board a plane while feeling ill, or not to coop his chickens along with his ducks. ""Any tiny little thing that people do,"" Dwyer said, if it makes them different from one another, from the idealized standard of herd behavior, ""is going to reduce infection rates."" ""So why only three stars? David Quammen -- I wanted to add his author link right there, but GR won't let me, but go look him up because he's written a ton of interesting books -- is more than capable of writing a non-fiction book that would hold anyone's interest, yet he insists on inserting some extremely long passages of pure fiction as he speculates on the exact circumstances leading to the emergence of HIV-1. My husband will tell you, I'm more of a ""just the facts"" kind of person -- I neither need nor want speculation, especially when the facts are compelling on their own.

206,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,4,"This book is about zoonoses--illnesses that spread from animals to people. It describes the typical process: the virus or bacteria lives, long-term and harmlessly, in a reservoir species. When it infects an amplifier species, it can spread more quickly to humans. For example, the Hendra virus has its reservoir in flying foxes (large Australian bats), but when it infects horses, it can spread to people, who are in much closer contact with their sick horses than with bats. Not only are zoonoses threatening because new ones can appear unexpectedly (like SARS or HIV), they are also essentially impossible to eradicate, unlike (say) polio, which is only found in humans, whom you can vaccinate. Bats come off rather badly in this book. In the past, I've learned that you should like them because they eat harmful insects. It turns out that they are the source of all sorts of nasty bugs, in the virus sense of the word.Quammen writes quite a bit about his travels to research the book, or how one scientist introduces him to another. Not only does this give the book a bit of a travelogue feeling, it also acknowledges the essential contributions of the people who tranquilize angry macaques or go out in the middle of the night to rig up bat nets--without which none of the science would have happened. His style is vivid and entertaining, though there's one passage in the chapter about HIV/AIDS that is strangely novelistic. Not bad, just incongruous and unnecessary.Nothing in this book will make you change your behavior, unless you are remiss about handwashing or routinely eat things bats have shat on. At the end the author emphasizes: ""The purpose of this book is not to make you more worried. The purpose of this book is to make you more smart. That's what most distinguishes humans from, say, tent caterpillars and gypsy moths. Unlike them, we can be pretty smart."" I didn't find this book particularly scary--just informative--so don't avoid it just on those grounds.To the extent it contains a call to action, the book reminds us that human pressure on ecological systems creates havoc. A relatively short section deals with Lyme disease and reveals the startling conclusion that Lyme flourishes in isolated areas. Think the islands in a parking lot rather than a forest. It's where we come in contact with ecologies that we've disrupted that we find zoonoses.P.S. Bonus points for sending me to the dictionary: ""cadastral.""P.P.S. Further bonus points for this sentence, even if the sentiment isn't new: ""[A]nyone who favors Intelligent Design in lieu of evolution might pause to wonder why God devoted so much of His intelligence to designing malarial parasites."""
207,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1182891-sue,5,"This book is a gripping tale of disease “spillover” that will thrill those interested in science – and probably many who aren’t. After all, we all get sick occasionally. Quammen looks at the ways pathogens (usually viruses) have spilled from animals to humans. He traces the origins of, among others, Ebola, SARS, bird flu, Lyme disease, and AIDS. These zoonotic diseases can escalate rapidly into global pandemics when human-to-human transmission occurs. For five years Quammen trailed scientists in their labs and in the field. Worldwide exchange of information turns out to be essential in epidemiology, and the solution to mysterious epidemics often means gathering data in far-flung places. Quammen himself traveled to China, to Bangladesh, to the Congo, to Connecticut. Data moves among such places, and so did the author. Everywhere there is mystery, drama, and good science.A long chapter (more than 20% of the book) traces the origins of HIV to a chimpanzee in Cameroon in the early 20th century. It’s a fascinating story. The author first tracked the evidence, working with scientists as they examined tissue samples that showed the spillover to be not in the 1980s, when the Western world first encountered it, but in the first decade of the 20th century. Quammen then allowed himself to think through a possible scenario which would have brought the virus down river to the Congo, initially moving slowly because its carriers might have died early of other causes, because the virus moved through areas of low population density, because it did not yet have the opportunity afforded by global travel and multiple sex partners.Ten years ago I had to abort a trip to Vietnam and China because of SARS, so the episode was very personal to me. That dread virus ran a deadly but short course. It turned out that the disease was transmissible after the person became ill, so it was eventually within the power of the health system to halt the spread. But it could reemerge. Civets, a diet delicacy blamed initially for the disease, turned out to be “amplifier” hosts but not “reservoir” hosts. This latter term applies to animals who host and live amicably with a virus which may cause great mischief in humans. For SARS, the reservoir was a bat, the amplifier was a civet, and the human who ate the civet was an unlucky, violently ill person. In fact, the eating of exotic (and often illegal) meats was a persistent theme in the entire book.As a non-scientist, I’ve possibly gotten a couple of things wrong in this review. Apologies. But I am pretty sure I’m going to be paying attention to the news about epidemics – as well as to, for example, ticks or exotic meats."
208,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17766893-matty-swytla,5,"A very good bok with scientific, yet approachable explanations to why zoonoses (animal diseases that infect humans) are so scary and deadly, especially when it comes to certain new viruses. The fact is zoonotic viruses and other diseases infect humans on a regular basis. I know; I was infected with ringworm (Dermatophytosis) by my kittens a few years ago - it's a fungal infection that spreads like fire. No fun but no biggie either. But any pet owner knows the drill on vaccinations for rabies and other diseases for dogs and cats. Some of these make the jump to humans with devastating results.The differences between carriers, natural reservoirs, and amplifiers is fascinating and illuminating. Some animals only spread viruses, bacteria or other illness-inducing organisms (mosquitoes for malaria); others live with them, a certain population of infected yet not very ill reservoirs from whence other animals and humans can get infected (bats, monkeys); while some animals get very ill and spread the infections further (amplifiers - often some domestic animals like pigs or poultry). It's important to make the distinction bewteen these or we won't know where to fight the disease in the first place. The book highlights why we should care about natural habitats, treat our animals with care, and not board a plane when feeling sick (!), but it doesn't fear-monger in any way. Yes, it does point out what people should or shouldn't do, what are the risk factors for contracting some exotic diseases, but it also highlights that ordinary diseases kill far more people than ebola, for example. Coronary disease, cancers, diabetes, traffic accidents... familiar killers we've gotten used to don't scare us as they should, while the thought of contracting a virus from a bat makes some people fear them like the plague. What the author makes clear time and time again is that local farmers in some god-forsaken parts of third-world countries (but in the West as well - not everyone is an epidemiologist or veterinarian) can't understand the full impact of an outbreak among their flock before it spreads. So education is key, and fast response from laboratories, research facilites, and medical institutions. I was amazed how much difference fast cooperation among scientists and medical doctors makes in terms of outbreak containment. Why doesn't the media highlight these achievements more and make people interested in science? What will it take? The next big virus or outbreak is just around the corner - it may be our ordinary flu not ebola."

Nice. I quite enjoyed this book, although it was a bit long. It featured a fictitious scenario about HIV patient zero that went on for more time than it was worth. Author David Qaummen is a science-writer. He actually traveled to Africa many times, accompanying scientists on their quest(s) to identify the wild reservoirs of Ebola and HIV viruses. A large portion of the book is devoted to these efforts. 

He covers many zoonotic infectious diseases here; Hendra virus, Malaria, the SARS coronavirus, among many others.The book has a great flow, and format; He breaks it down into ~100 different chapters, avoiding the common problem of super-long, run on chapters that become difficult to reference. He details many of the adventures he had in Africa, including capturing bats to take their blood.""Spillover"" (it's namesake the term used to describe occurrences when a reservoir population with a high pathogen prevalence comes into contact with a novel host population) also covers quite a lot of epidemiology and virology, as well. Great stuff!Quammen writes with a natural, easy style that doesn't struggle to hold the reader's attention, or ability to follow the plot.I enjoyed this book. It has a ton of super interesting writing and information.I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in infectious disease, or epidemiology.4.5 stars."

Certainly, relevant to the current situation particularly the sections about bats. The organization and pace of the book is good. It’s a mix of information, interviews and the author’s experiences while observing the scientists at work. I usually don’t like author’s personal experiences in works like this, but since he focuses on the research itself it’s not too irritating. The writing is readable if a bit too snarky at times. The content is great. I learned a lot about viruses and the research behind figuring out pandemics. It’s all very interesting. This book exceeded my expectations.  So, I give this a 4. It’s mostly readable and always interesting with clear implications for the current situation.  "
211,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,3,"This holds a ton of information that is helpful to hold some specifics re virus infections that proceed to humans. But it's not completely upon the title material.In fact, the writing is well accomplished. It's often clear and better than some of the highly scientific particulars and nomenclatures of pure science reads (very dry) elsewhere. But as much as I can decide it DID make the reading easier than most material in this genre, it also holds another quality I thought was a considerable distraction from that positive prose form. Quammen has a kind of tone that's strange to read (it was for me) and quite difficult to describe. It's not Chicken Little on meth (or a hate rant like Gerta Thunberg either) but it's not a logical nor scientific bottom line ""norm"" either. If I'm overstating that, I'm sorry. But some of this assumption and oversight is just plain wrong when he tends to expand from ""one"" to ""some"" to ""all"". And it some cases it seems to me, that this emotive occludes to some of the very actual world reality of how MOST virus pass into pandemic outcomes. And how they did in the past, as well. Like the 1918 and the other human influenza forms that went lethal since. There are huge portions of this book that read like a memoir and travelogue. It's just not direct to the title at all, immense pages of asides/ tangents.The history of some of the worst spillovers (like Hendra or other bat vector virus) were the best and most accurate parts- and I am glad I read it for the understanding of how an intermediate ""amplify"" animal is also usually a HUGE part of the ""it depends"" serendipity that results in these horrific outcomes. First a small ""usual"" mammal, then a mid vector animal and then other species- such as monkeys/apes or humans.It's not a book I would necessarily recommend. His personality and slant, I just feel, is containing quite a bit of ""group think"" and not enough science. But now I do comprehend more easily the trail through 3 or 4 species this virus morph road can take."
212,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3230750-molly,5,"Thrilled to see that David Quammen had a new science book, I snatched this up. It’s been 15 years since his book ""Song of the Dodo” about island biogeography, which remains at the top of my favorite non-fiction. Can one *enjoy* a book about infectious disease? Anyone who's read Richard Preston's “The Hot Zone” will guiltily admit, yes (interestingly, he takes Preston to task for overplaying descriptions of Ebola infection. “Bleeding out"" is not accurate.)There is inherent narrative drama in the question of when the Next Big One (NBO) will hit and in the epidemiological sleuthing to identify viruses and their host animals when an epidemic breaks. What will turn a local outbreak into a pandemic? Do scientists think there IS a NBO lurking? Quite possibly. And if so, it will assuredly originate in animals, as has almost all human infectious disease. Influenza, SARS, Marburg, Lyme disease - Quammen covers them all and more, and turns up startling facts. For one, the subtitle of his book could just as well be, ""From Bats to Humans."" But what put the book over the top in excellence and dramatic page-turning was the penultimate chapter on the origin of AIDS. In some ways the whole book was moving toward this chapter. The origins of HIV can now be pinned to a year (much earlier than you’d think) and a single spillover event; chimp to human. And Quammen makes the poignant and chilling case that lest you wonder why we should care about exotic diseases such as Marbug, consider the exponential trajectory and devastation of AIDS. It too is a zoonotic disease, but one that has moved more slowly than an airborne NBO will surely do. Despite the theme – lively and buoyant writing. In other words, it’s readable. Quammen remains a master of science journalism. "
213,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/259402-sebastien,5,"Superb! David Quammen brings to life the stories of a wide variety of infectious diseases and their spillover from animals to humans. David is a great writer, his narrative drive and prose are magnificent. He does this while presenting the science in a very accessible yet amazingly informative way.What is astounding is the amount of work and research that must have gone into this book. David conducted a seemingly endless amount of interviews with scientists, researchers, doctors. To say he took it to the next level, well that is a vast understatement. This is science journalism/writing at its pinnacle.My particular favorite was the section on the ecology of borrelia (lyme). This is a subject that hits close to home for me.The section on malaria was very intriguing, learned a lot. The coolest thing was learning that a form of malaria had been used as therapy to treat syphilis (a form of therapy known as pyrotherapy). That blew my mind. If you're curious, here's an article on the subject: http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/bod...I was also fascinated by the HIV chapter. Could have done without his hypothesizing and reimagining of the original patient 0 story, I saw what he was trying to do, but that seemed a bit clunky and unnecessary. But that's a minor quibble with an otherwise outstanding book. Dang, the ebola chapter was incredible as well... so much good stuff in here."

Well, viruses and bacteria fascinate me and I'm piling up titles about the subject: Spillover is so far one of the best. It doesn't try to add drama and it sticks to the chronicles; the exception is the AIDS chapter, in which the author allows himself to turn the hypothesis of how the AIDS left the African jungles into a sort of fable.

It is longer than most science/ medicine books, but do not let that deter you. I was extremely sad when this book ended. I wanted more!In the middle of reading this book, I made the mistake of putting this book on pause to read the more recent Pandemic by Sonia Shah. Science is obviously not the authors strong suit. It was extremely disappointing. It might fly with people who are less scientifically literate. She had more up to date info on Ebola, which might draw in a huge readership, but her book doesn't hold a candle to this book. Quammen's book is a big WOW, on every level. When I finally returned from Pandemic, I was in such a foul mood, it was detracting from my enjoyment of this book. That only lasted for a little bit. I could not help but get sucked right back into all of Quammen's case studies and histories of various outbreaks. This book was well researched, extremely thorough, scientifically sound, well written, and entertaining as hell. His passion for his subject spilled over into every page and into me. I do not even want to give a summary of all the wonder inside this book because he tells the story of each virus so well, anything I would relate here feels like an actual spoiler. It is a must read!

217,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"Where Do ""Emerging Diseases"" Emerge From?AIDS, Ebola, Marburg, SARS, H5N1 — every one of the world’s scariest diseases is a “zoonosis,” that is, a virus harbored by animals and transmitted to humans, often by other animals, in a complex minuet that often stretches out into decades.AIDS, for example. According to the latest research, reported by David Quammen in Spillover, Patient Zero was not that French-Canadian flight attendant you may have read about who went amok in the 1970s but a hunter in Southeast Cameroon around 1908 who killed a chimpanzee and somehow unwittingly allowed the animal’s blood to seep into his own circulatory system, either through a cut or by eating his prey’s raw flesh. This is the phenomenon that epidemiologists call “spillover.” At that point, a particularly virulent form of a recently emergent simian virus found a friendly and familiar environment in the hunter’s blood and flourished, becoming what we know today as HIV-1 (the more lethal form of the virus that causes AIDS). Later, the hunter passed along the virus to one or more women through sexual contact, and the disease slowly spread, both by sex and by transmission through reused needles, undetected as anything out of the ordinary, from Cameroon into what is now called the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and other sub-Saharan countries, and thence by happenstance to Haiti. It was a Haitian harboring HIV-1 who probably passed it along to that notorious Canadian flight attendant, setting off the epidemic among gay men in North America.In Spillover, Quammen tells tales like these in fascinating detail, relating the stories of the often-heroic scientists, physicians, and veterinarians who worked directly with deadly diseases, occasionally at the cost of their own lives. Quammen spent years writing this book. He appears to have read all the relevant scientific literature, attended specialized scientific conferences, and spent long hours tracking down and speaking face-to-face with the people who discovered these diseases, isolated the viruses, first treated the symptoms, and labored for thankless years on end in laboratories around the world to help humanity avert the next pandemic.You may have read Richard Preston’s best-selling 2001 treatment of the emergence of Ebola in The Hot Zone. If not, I can tell you that I vividly recall the book because it was so dramatic, and so terrifying. No doubt I had nightmares about contracting Ebola. But it turns out, according to Quammen and to the eminent scientists he interviewed, that Preston’s account was sensationalized and highly inaccurate in essential details. For example, he described tears of blood, massive hemorrhages, and melted internal organs, none of which has any basis in fact.However, Spillover, in its own way, is no less frightening. Quammen advances the popular theory that what appears to be the accelerating emergence of dangerous new pathogens became inevitable as a result of the enormous population growth of homo sapiens — because humanity has increasingly encroached on animal habitat and come into intimate contact with animals as never before. In discussions with noted biologists, he explores the concept of “breakout,” the explosive growth frequently seen in some animal species that shortly leads to sudden, catastrophic — through disease. He intimates that, with AIDS — or, all too possibly, with the next pandemic — humankind may experience something similar. Despite all the horrific details about AIDS, Ebola, Marburg, and the like, these are the book’s scariest passages.David Quammen writes about science, nature, and travel — a total of 10 nonfiction books and five novels to date. A former Rhodes Scholar, he was educated at Yale and Oxford.(From www.malwarwickonbooks.com)"
218,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58119141-elena-sala,5,"SPILLOVER: ANIMAL INFECTIONS AND THE NEXT HUMAN PANDEMIC (2012) was the result of David Quammen's five years of research interviewing scientists who were looking into the possibility of another horrific Ebola-type disease emerging. At that time, believe it or not, there was a widespread consensus: there would indeed be a new disease, likely from the coronavirus family, coming out of a bat, and it would likely emerge in or around a wet market in China. So, how could the world be SO unprepared for this nightmarish pandemic?? This book was written 8 years before this pandemic so it does not attempt to answer this question. Though we can probably guess some possible answers.This book is about zoonoses, infectious diseases that originate in animals and spread to humans. Rabies, for example, is a zoonotic disease. HIV is also a zoonotic disease. Dengue, yellow fever, malaria, influenza, Lyme disease, MERS, SARS, Zika and COVID are all zoonoses. The technical term scientists use to describe the leap of a pathogen from one animal to another is “spillover”. Most infections start as spillovers. Some, like Ebola and lesser-known viral diseases (Nipah, Hendra, Marburg), are highly transmissible and virulent, but so far have been limited to sporadic outbreaks. They persist because they are endemic in a reservoir population through a process of mutual adaptation.Quammen explores the correlation between these diseases that come up one after the other. It should not come as a surprise that they are not mere accidents but unwanted consequences of our actions. How do these pathogens make the leap from animals to humans? Quammen's answer: ""we invade tropical forests and other wild landscapes, which harbor so many species of animals and plants. And within those creatures, so many viruses. We cut the trees, we kill the animals or cage them and send them to markets. We disrupt ecosystems and we shake viruses loose from their natural hosts. When that happens, they need a new host. Often, we are it.” And why does this seem to be happening more frequently in recent times? The answer, again in Quammen's own words is: ""there’s 7.8 billion of us on this planet—four times the number of humans at the time of the 1918 influenza. And we have quadrupled the speed we travel around the planet; we have quadrupled the size of some of our cities. So there are a lot more of us large-bodied vertebrate animals, living in dense aggregations, moving fluidly from one place to another... We’re the world’s greatest target for a virus—a great ecosystem for them to colonize. So when a virus does get into a human and finds it can replicate and transmit to the next human, that virus has opened the door to vast opportunity.""Quammen's journeys have taken him all around the world: inside the air-locked sterility of high-security biological research labs, through the crowded alleyways of Chinese live animal markets, into remote African and Asian villages that have experienced outbreaks of some of the most lethal diseases yet known to mankind. He has interviewed survivors of these diseases and the scientists doing all the research. He has been a science writer for over 35 years, interested in ecology and evolutionary biology. He uses a conversational tone and, occasionally, some dark humor to give a frightening and eye opening summary of all that is known about these zoonotic diseases. This is a book I highly recommend, not only because it is written in an engaging and accessible way, sober, rational yet suspenseful, but because it is clear that COVID will not be the last pandemic we will see. There will be more zoonoses because we are disrupting the environment more and more. So we need to think about our own responsibility and how we relate to our environment. Each one of us has a responsibility, because we are all consumers of food, resources, and energy. Each of the choices that we make about what we’re going to eat, wear, or buy draws on these wild ecosystems. This book invites the reader to think about these choices while explaining how we got into this mess in the first place."
219,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4," Fairly good coverage of a topic that is all over the headlines at the current moment epidemics from diseases that jump from animal to human mostly viruses. It would be really hard at this point to not know about Coronavirus and the pandemic it caused and its likely source from animals (probably bats). This has been a problem we have been aware of for quite some time with flu strains and aids, and Lyme disease, and zika virus, and ebola, and Marburg virus the list goes on. Only now the point is hammered home in a pandemic and a world-historical economic crisis. Some of us knew better but as usual, people didn't heed the warnings. They almost never do."
220,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,4,"The hubris of homo sapiens lies in believing that it holds sway over this planet but then hidden away from anything but the most powerful electron microscopes are organisms that can wreak havoc on all of us. These microorganisms are hardy, smart and incredibly adaptable when it comes to the question of how to survive and thrive among the biodiversity of the earth. If you were to romanticize the whole concept then it becomes very easy to paint the pathogen as the most dreaded enemy of mankind/ nature’s revenge on us etc. However, a rational perspective tells a story which is entirely different and utterly fascinating in a deadly way. The microorganism’s capability to jump across species to man and thereby begin devastating outbreaks is the premise of the book and the scientific term for such a happening is Zoonosis. In the words of the author about the need of such a book :  Why obsess about Zoonoses ? In the larger balance of miseries, what makes anyone think they should be taken so seriously ? It’s a fair question but there are good answers. Some of those answers are intricate and speculative. Some are subjective. Others are objective and blunt. The bluntest is this : AIDS. Let’s look at some zoonotic diseases other than AIDS : Ebola, Marburg, Avian and Swine Flu, SARS, Malaria, Hendra are but a few of them. All of these are without doubt some of the deadliest killer that we have encountered. David Quammen does a book length investigation into the history, nature and where we stand in the understanding of the microorganisms which cause these diseases. Quammen’s writing style is approachable and far less sensational than what I encountered with Richard Preston’s Hot Zone. While Preston horrified and thrilled me, Quammen offers a more informative and grounded view at the pathogens and their effects. He also travels far and wide for his research and converses with recovered patients, eyewitnesses, doctors and scientists and ergo a much more well-rounded view of what actually transpires during a disease outbreak comes to light. Of special mention is the chapter named The Chimp and River which is an in depth detective story that traces the journey of HIV from the jungles of Africa into the world at large. There are two things about the book that really caught my attention : • The number of mice and monkeys that die in the name of betterment and advancement of science in this book is huge. There were times when I paused and wondered if more of these hapless animals perish than humans.• Quammen is a first rate travel writer. His descriptions of Asia and Africa are measured views of anthropology, wildlife and the inevitable clash between the two.Parts of the book especially on the mathematical connects between the nature of mass outbreaks and about the lifecycles of viruses were difficult to comprehend. But that aside this is a fantastic book to understand how much nature has in store which man has no idea of. It also corrected for me the notion that nature uses viruses to eventually get back at humans ( courtesy Richard Preston). A virus is a non-thinking organism and one for which in a majority of the cases, a human host is next to an evolutionary dead end. It just so happens that with our invasive lifestyle, we breach the habitats of the virus and get caught in their snares.Recommended."
221,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,5,"I see why Quammen is so well thought of. Spillover was amazingly informative, had a near perfect execution, explained very difficult, scientific subjects in a manner that a reader with little science background could understand without making it so dumbed down that the same reader found themselves lost in a nexus of weakening metaphors and feeling insulted (I'm looking at you, Winchester). This is how you speak to your audience! You do not dumbdown, but rather heighten the discourse and inform. I learned so much, and was so in awe of what I was learning, and the research that was done by Quammen, and even more by the researching actively trying to save us from the ""Next Big One"" that nightly over dinner I'd tell my husband excitedly that he just HAD to read Spillover, because did you know this or that about ebola? Its the only audiobook that I have honestly considered restarting immediately. There is just so much to process here, so much that I realize I just didn't know, and so much more that I could learn from a second reading.This is a book that I think every person should read. There is as much (if not more) human interest as science, it can honestly keep you on the edge of your seat. I love nature, but it can be such a scary place without considering that maybe you just inhaled infected bat shit or dust from an aborted goat. But its also a beautiful place, where ecology matters, where there is balance, and as the eruption of human population continues (presumably unchecked for now) that balance is disturbed. I cannot stress enough, especially during this election cycle, how important an informed populace is. How can we make decisions in domestic protection, how we raise our livestock, how we tour, how we travel across the globe, how we transport EVERYTHING, how we mine, and how we manufacture if we are not informed of the consequences and the possible dangers of what we are doing. I'm not crazy, I'm not saying lets halt the world, but we need to understand that its not just about global warming, when ecologists are warning us of what we are doing to the planet. We have rapidly interconnected this world in a way that has never before happened. There are risks and benefits to that. Scientists are trying to study and prepare for the next big one, but should the unthinkable happen (its not unthinkable, its more that we refuse to think of it) how are we, as a populace, prepared to respond? We need to consider this.And, man, wash your hands if you butcher something, okay?"
222,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60209410-jordan-buckley,4,"Good information on zoonotic diseases (diseases that live in animal hosts and can spread to humans), which are pretty relevant at the moment because COVID-19 is believed to be one. Many major diseases are zoonoses or started that way, including HIV, Ebola, rabies, Lyme disease, SARS, swine flu, etc.There were a few major takeaways for me. You can't eradicate a zoonotic disease if it's still silently thriving in some animal population (""reservoir host""). The pathogen may just live happily in one or more animal species without causing any obvious symptoms, but could be deadly if it infects humans. The other big takeaway is that human civilization and activity is often what unearths these diseases or gives them the opportunity to thrive. As we expand we move into forests and come into contact with animals that may carry all kinds of unknown pathogens. Our new methods of factory farming and cramming animals together in their own excrement creates new opportunities for these things to thrive and spread. Tragedies like the current pandemic aren't just ""acts of God"" that we have no control over; they are brought on by our own activity.Like most nonfiction books I read, I wish it was much shorter. The author does a good job of making it interesting, but I could have done without so much of the breathless recounting of the journalist's search for truth, tracking down different hypotheses, biographical descriptions of the various interviewees, the fanciful hypothetical story of the imagined ""voyager"" who brought HIV out of the jungle and into human civilization. The story of the SARS outbreak was interesting for comparison to COVID-19, and it was notable to see coronaviruses mentioned repeatedly among other candidates as a risk for the next pandemic."

Super, super relevant right now, and from my memory this book references EEE, though don't quote me. *Review*First things first. I hate when I look at a nonfiction book table of contents and can’t tell by the name of the chapters what they cover. For those who feel the same, here is the annotated table of contents:I. Pale Horse (Hendra virus)II. Thirteen Gorillas (Ebola virus)III. Everything Comes From Somewhere (Malaria)IV. Dinner at the Rat Farm (SARS)V. The Deer, the Parrot, & the Kid Next Door (Q Fever, Psittacosis, and Lyme disease)VI. Going Viral (General Virus Stuff, but Especially HIV)VII. Celestial Hosts (About Animals That Transmit Disease, Especially Bats, and Also Focuses on the Nipah virus)VIII. The Chimp and The River (HIV)IX. It Depends (Viruses of the Future)Onto the review.I wasn’t thinking about it when I snagged it at the library, but this was the perfect book to follow up The Hot Zone (and, in fact, this book references that one). That was a concentrated, focused look at one distinct family of viruses, the filoviruses. It was also more dramatized. This one takes that zoomed-in look and contextualizes it. Reminds us that 60% of all infections diseases that affect humans come from animals via zoonosis. Ebola, Marburg (the stars of The Hot Zone), rabies, hantavirus, anthrax, Lassa, Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, dengue, west nile, sars, typhus, mad cow disease, all forms of influenza, bubonic plague, Lyme disease, AIDS, and countless more. The author also points out something interesting- the diseases we’ve mostly eradicated, like smallpox and polio, are the rare ones that aren’t passed to humans by animals. That’s why we were able to eradicate them. People are easier to keep track of and vaccinate than animals. Nowhere for them to hide. Whereas Marburg or Ebola can lurk forever in hidden corners of caves, immortal. And why are these diseases popping up now? Practically all of these zoonotic (species-hopping) diseases are new. Like, zoonotic diseases barely existed at all before the 1960s, after which they started popping up everywhere in myriad forms. Why? Because we’re tearing apart ecosystems, breaking down the natural fabric of things, spreading ourselves where we ought not be a-spreadin’. These diseases had their natural hosts. They didn’t kill the hosts, they mostly lived in harmony with the host in some remote corner of the world. But when we wreck that natural host’s home and kill lots of them off, what’s a virus to do but to jump ship and latch onto humans if it wants to survive? Finally, I’d like to thank David Quammen for summarizing my feelings on life nicely: “Mathematics to me is like a language I don’t speak, though I admire its literature in translation.”"
226,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,5,"I try not to read books that make me paranoid or hypochondriac — and that's not the intention of this book — but I'll think twice next time that I'm in some exotic place and close to wild animals. The Monkey Forest in Bali was mentioned in this book in relation to herpes B (a deadly disease caused by a spillover from macaques monkeys to humans). Thanks goodness I feel a visceral revulsion towards monkeys. I didn't hand-feed any or let them climb up my head and shoulders so that I can take a picture with them. A little bite or scratch from the wrong monkey could seal your death sentence. This is a very well-researched, well-written, and highly-informative book on zoonosis — a pathogen leaping from an animal to humans. There have been recent scares with diseases like SARS and bird flu and swine flu that caused relatively limited damage and were contained. But you can never underestimate the danger of the Next Big One. We shouldn't forget that the Spanish flu at the end of the World War I killed by far more people than the war. As Quammen says, if you think we shouldn't concern ourselves too much with a local outbreak of an exotic disease like ebola that is caused by starving villagers in a remote corner of Congo eating a rotten dead chimp, the answer is: AIDS.The most interesting chapter of the book is the chapter on AIDS, which reads like a detective story. Here's the spoiler: the HIV virus first jumped from chimps to humans (quite likely when a hunter was butchering an infected chimp) somewhere in southeast Cameroon some time around 1908. What it was doing between then and the early 1980's when it became a global pandemic that has so far killed an estimated 35 million people is a fascinating story. "
227,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"Spillover is a well-written bio-thriller in the tradition of The Hot Zone, etc. It rehashes the same misleading theme of scary monster viruses waiting out there in the bushes to kill us all. It is good if you want a horror story, not if you want useful, accurate science about public health. As the subtitle indicates, it is focused on the hypothetical ""Next Big One"" but misses the point about what caused the actual Great Pandemic of 1918, repeating boilerplate nonsense about gene shifts etc. The demonstrably false idea that reassortment of the Hs and Ns in influenza virus is why you get a deadly pandemic is what caused the panics in 1976 and 2009 over the shift to H1N1. Both times there was no deadly pandemic. In 1976, the needless panic actually killed a bunch of people with a bad vaccine. In 2009, it cost billions and billions of dollars and created tremendous emotional stress for no apparent benefit. This is pretty obvious stuff. So why act as if nobody knows this and repeat old nonsense about what causes pandemics? The difference between a mild flu and a deadly one that kills 50 million people is not a reassortment of the genes. This is known. So what is the difference and how do we make germs be mild instead of lethal? That is a very important question, but you won't find the answer in this book. If you are interested in exploring this question, you may want to look at the TED talk by Paul Ewald: http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_ewald_a...."
228,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1072582-kaethe-douglas,4,"This is a book about zoonoses, diseases that come to humans from other animals. It is scary, sure, because there are always new microbes out there ready to go rampaging through our vast society. It is also rather comforting, both the methodical search for vectors and reservoirs, the details of transmission and treatment, the stream of breakthroughs that enable researchers to locate and sequence. And through it all, Quammen maintains a casual, light conversational tone, reassuring the reader that sure, horrible new diseases can (and will) spring up seemingly out of nowhere to spread around the world, but that also we have been pretty good at controlling those sorts of outbreaks.There's quite a lot about Ebola here, written before this summer's outbreak. It should prove very comforting to everyone whose loved ones are not currently infected. I heap praise upon him for pointing out that it isn't nearly as grotesque as Preston painted it in The Hot Zone.The only part I really disliked was the pure fiction of The Voyager, which was too long and added nothing. This was particularly annoying as I was nearing the end and racing to finish quickly before the future biologist usurped in entirely.Library copyI don't usually comment on covers, but I will say that Chip Kidd managed to make a very disturbing one."

David Quammen convincingly argues that the greatest bugaboo for the human race should be a zoonosis, an infectious disease that spills over from an animal population into humans. He travels around the world and talks to scientists who have worked in the virus-riddled trenches of HIV, malaria, Ebola, SARS, and an ever-growing list of other nasties with shocking fatality rates. Particularly interesting is Quammen's notion that the historical rate of human population growth is itself an outbreak. We've proliferated like mad - at a speed unprecedented for a large mammal species. And what scientists know about outbreaks is that they always come to an end... While layman accessible, this detailed and hefty book takes perseverance, but it's well worth it for the amount of information you'll get in return. I'm going to go wash my hands now. And stay the heck away from bats. It's always bats! "

Back to my original review:Zoonotic pathogens, those that travel from other animals to human animals, have been with us, will be with us, have killed millions of people, will kill millions more. I read half of this book on the topic and got really really bored. Each chapter was ""And here's another example"" ""and here's yet another example."" He tried to spice that up with turning searching for the animal source of the pathogen into a mystery and by getting personal about the researchers (that is, applying fictional techniques to non fiction), but it couldn't disguise for me that it was all ""and here's another example."" I got the point by page 100. So I got past page 300 and then skimmed the rest. It's not badly written...it just got a bit boring for me.Here's the take-away advice I gleaned:1) Try to calm down. That zoonosis exists is largely beyond your control.2) To the extent you can control things: first, quit overbreeding. Overbreeding leads to human encroachment upon ecosystems where disease has happily been at equilibrium for tens of thousands of years. Overbreeding is awful for many reasons, but if you needed another, well, here's another. Overbreeders are bad world citizens.3) Don't, for heaven's sake, eat unusual game meat, particularly not game you find mysteriously dead on the ground with blood around its mouth. Also, glove/mask when treating sick domestic animals, yes, even beloved Fluffy, and when Fluffy does succumb, avoid kissing her bloody muzzle goodbye.4) Be rich and insured and ideally connected to the government in a first world country--not only can you buy farmed/ranched meat that's inspected and safe, if you do get sick, you'll get the best treatment available.5) That 33% of Americans aren't insured means the coming pandemic is going to be worse and spread faster and kill more here than in civilized countries where all citizens have access to health care. Not his point in the first 300 pages, but any thinking person can see it.6) Commercial airliners are really that dangerous for spreading disease--avoid if you can and rethink what ""vacation"" means to you. Sure, any given flight probably won't next Patient X on it...but it might. Is it really that important to board that plane?7) Religion helps spread pandemics because people pray and wallow in superstition instead of of getting treatment. When the next epidemic comes, pray/chant/positive-think/sacrifice a goat all you want, but not in a crowd, and get treatment, too."
232,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85488700-derrick-stormblessed,5,"What a frightful but entertaining read!! David Quammen is a brilliant scientist and storyteller all at once. He weaves narrative storytelling and science seamlessly like its the easiest thing ever. That's the source of the overall brilliance of the book. Quammen manages to use his own personal experiences with disease scientists at the centre of the research and others in the thick of things to make the book more entertaining. Billy Karesh studying chimps in Moba Bai, Beatrice Hahn at the heart of AIDS research, Engel and Jones-Engel a husband and wife team from New York investigating prevalence of a monkey virus in Bangladesh temples, a Chinese scientist searching for the reservoir of SARS, an Australian vet who survived the Hendra virus, etcThe book is basically about how animal diseases jump or spillover into humans. He narrates how these diseases, commonly classified as zoonoses first appeared on the scene and how people react to these diseases in the beginning, how scientific research unfolded and how they escalated into global epidemics in some cases. He also discusses the tiny pathogens responsible and their evolution into killer monsters. He deals with a long list of deadly diseases like Hendra, Ebola, malaria, AIDS, Lyme disease, Q fever, SARS, etc. All dangerous and potentially lethal bugs if not dealt with properly. A few themes appear throughout the book. One of them is how humans interfere with nature, eat what they are not supposed to or encroach on wild habitats. It's clear we are having more contact with animals, both domestic and wild, and this is one of the reasons why certain diseases have spilled over into humans. And also why in the future probably more lethal pathogens will spill over. As humans, we need to understand the nature of ecosystems better and try not to interfere with wildlife habitats. These diseases have killed millions and millions of people and it's clear that these bugs especially viruses have the upper hand over us and we should be weary of the potential devastation involved. Zoonotic diseases will continue to spill over in future. But how ling before we come across a pathogen capable of annihilating all of humankind?"

Quammen manages to make it understandable and compelling all at the same time. He helps the reader to understand the seriousness of the topic - and it is really serious -- without feeling alarmist. The book was published in 2012, so well before our current pandemic. After reading this, I feel much better equipped to decipher and understand the current reporting on COVID - 19, to make more educated decisions about what I am seeing on my news feed, to know when to be skeptical, and what my role can be in minimizing risk and spread (significant in all viruses with human to human transmission). I highly recommend this book if you want to understand more about viruses - their impact, their trajectory, and our options. With something as serious as what we are currently facing, I wanted more information that newspaper headlines and I wanted it to be, as much as possible, free from the political positioning -- just give me the science and the history so I can improve my context. Quammen did that exceptionally well. "

235,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3397530-lea,3,"This is a very interesting analysis of emerging zoonotic diseases, focusing on SARS, HIV, and Ebola, among others. There are so many facts here, it's a little overwhelming -- I learned so much that I'd never even thought of before, including the fact that HIV can actually be traced back to, wait for it . . . 1908?! Yeah, I didn't believe it at first, either, but the author clearly presents this in a way that is easy even for a non-scientist like myself to understand.After reading this, I can tell you for sure that I will NEVER go anywhere near a bat again -- these beautiful animals are apparently THE virus clearinghouse, for reasons that are explored in depth in this book.Ever wonder why we were able to effectively eradicate smallpox, but can't seem to put an end to malaria? Yep, it's in here.Here are a couple of quotes from the end of the book that I found interesting:""So before we respond either calmly or hysterically, either intelligently or doltishly, we should understand in some measure the basic outlines and dynamics of the situation. We should appreciate that these recent outbreaks of new zoonotic diseases, as well as the recurrence and spread of old ones, are part of a larger pattern, and that humanity is responsible for generating that pattern. We should recognize that they reflect things that we're DOING, not just things that are HAPPENING to us. WE should understand that, although some of the human-caused factors may seem virtually inexorable, others are within our control.""""That's the salubrious thing about zoonotic diseases: They remind us, as St. Francis did, that we humans are inseparable from the natural world. In fact, there IS no ""natural world,"" it's a bad and artificial phrase. There is only the world."""" . . . Dwyer's models have shown that heterogeneity of behavior, even among forest insects, let alone among humans, can be very important in damping the spread of infectious disease. . . . individual effort, individual discernment, individual choice can have huge effects in averting the catastrophes that might otherwise sweep through a herd. An individual gypsy moth may inherit a slightly superior ability to avoid smears of NPV as it grazes on a leaf. An individual human may choose not to drink the palm sap, not to eat the chimpanzee, not to pen the pig beneath mango trees, not to clear the horse's windpipe with his bare hand, not to have unprotected sex with the prostitute, not to share the needle in a shooting gallery, not to cough without covering her mouth, not to board a plane while feeling ill, or not to coop his chickens along with his ducks. ""Any tiny little thing that people do,"" Dwyer said, if it makes them different from one another, from the idealized standard of herd behavior, ""is going to reduce infection rates."" ""So why only three stars? David Quammen -- I wanted to add his author link right there, but GR won't let me, but go look him up because he's written a ton of interesting books -- is more than capable of writing a non-fiction book that would hold anyone's interest, yet he insists on inserting some extremely long passages of pure fiction as he speculates on the exact circumstances leading to the emergence of HIV-1. My husband will tell you, I'm more of a ""just the facts"" kind of person -- I neither need nor want speculation, especially when the facts are compelling on their own. If that kind of thing doesn't bother you, you may rate this one higher.Even with that, I would still recommend this."
236,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,4,"This book is about zoonoses--illnesses that spread from animals to people. It describes the typical process: the virus or bacteria lives, long-term and harmlessly, in a reservoir species. When it infects an amplifier species, it can spread more quickly to humans. For example, the Hendra virus has its reservoir in flying foxes (large Australian bats), but when it infects horses, it can spread to people, who are in much closer contact with their sick horses than with bats. Not only are zoonoses threatening because new ones can appear unexpectedly (like SARS or HIV), they are also essentially impossible to eradicate, unlike (say) polio, which is only found in humans, whom you can vaccinate. Bats come off rather badly in this book. In the past, I've learned that you should like them because they eat harmful insects. It turns out that they are the source of all sorts of nasty bugs, in the virus sense of the word.Quammen writes quite a bit about his travels to research the book, or how one scientist introduces him to another. Not only does this give the book a bit of a travelogue feeling, it also acknowledges the essential contributions of the people who tranquilize angry macaques or go out in the middle of the night to rig up bat nets--without which none of the science would have happened. His style is vivid and entertaining, though there's one passage in the chapter about HIV/AIDS that is strangely novelistic. Not bad, just incongruous and unnecessary.Nothing in this book will make you change your behavior, unless you are remiss about handwashing or routinely eat things bats have shat on. At the end the author emphasizes: ""The purpose of this book is not to make you more worried. The purpose of this book is to make you more smart. That's what most distinguishes humans from, say, tent caterpillars and gypsy moths. Unlike them, we can be pretty smart."" I didn't find this book particularly scary--just informative--so don't avoid it just on those grounds.To the extent it contains a call to action, the book reminds us that human pressure on ecological systems creates havoc. A relatively short section deals with Lyme disease and reveals the startling conclusion that Lyme flourishes in isolated areas. Think the islands in a parking lot rather than a forest. It's where we come in contact with ecologies that we've disrupted that we find zoonoses.P.S. Bonus points for sending me to the dictionary: ""cadastral.""P.P.S. Further bonus points for this sentence, even if the sentiment isn't new: ""[A]nyone who favors Intelligent Design in lieu of evolution might pause to wonder why God devoted so much of His intelligence to designing malarial parasites."""
237,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1182891-sue,5,"This book is a gripping tale of disease “spillover” that will thrill those interested in science – and probably many who aren’t. After all, we all get sick occasionally. Quammen looks at the ways pathogens (usually viruses) have spilled from animals to humans. He traces the origins of, among others, Ebola, SARS, bird flu, Lyme disease, and AIDS. These zoonotic diseases can escalate rapidly into global pandemics when human-to-human transmission occurs. For five years Quammen trailed scientists in their labs and in the field. Worldwide exchange of information turns out to be essential in epidemiology, and the solution to mysterious epidemics often means gathering data in far-flung places. Quammen himself traveled to China, to Bangladesh, to the Congo, to Connecticut. Data moves among such places, and so did the author. Everywhere there is mystery, drama, and good science.A long chapter (more than 20% of the book) traces the origins of HIV to a chimpanzee in Cameroon in the early 20th century. It’s a fascinating story. The author first tracked the evidence, working with scientists as they examined tissue samples that showed the spillover to be not in the 1980s, when the Western world first encountered it, but in the first decade of the 20th century. Quammen then allowed himself to think through a possible scenario which would have brought the virus down river to the Congo, initially moving slowly because its carriers might have died early of other causes, because the virus moved through areas of low population density, because it did not yet have the opportunity afforded by global travel and multiple sex partners.Ten years ago I had to abort a trip to Vietnam and China because of SARS, so the episode was very personal to me. That dread virus ran a deadly but short course. It turned out that the disease was transmissible after the person became ill, so it was eventually within the power of the health system to halt the spread. But it could reemerge. Civets, a diet delicacy blamed initially for the disease, turned out to be “amplifier” hosts but not “reservoir” hosts. This latter term applies to animals who host and live amicably with a virus which may cause great mischief in humans. For SARS, the reservoir was a bat, the amplifier was a civet, and the human who ate the civet was an unlucky, violently ill person. In fact, the eating of exotic (and often illegal) meats was a persistent theme in the entire book.As a non-scientist, I’ve possibly gotten a couple of things wrong in this review. Apologies. But I am pretty sure I’m going to be paying attention to the news about epidemics – as well as to, for example, ticks or exotic meats."
238,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17766893-matty-swytla,5,"A very good bok with scientific, yet approachable explanations to why zoonoses (animal diseases that infect humans) are so scary and deadly, especially when it comes to certain new viruses. The fact is zoonotic viruses and other diseases infect humans on a regular basis. I know; I was infected with ringworm (Dermatophytosis) by my kittens a few years ago - it's a fungal infection that spreads like fire. No fun but no biggie either. But any pet owner knows the drill on vaccinations for rabies and other diseases for dogs and cats. Some of these make the jump to humans with devastating results.The differences between carriers, natural reservoirs, and amplifiers is fascinating and illuminating. Some animals only spread viruses, bacteria or other illness-inducing organisms (mosquitoes for malaria); others live with them, a certain population of infected yet not very ill reservoirs from whence other animals and humans can get infected (bats, monkeys); while some animals get very ill and spread the infections further (amplifiers - often some domestic animals like pigs or poultry). It's important to make the distinction bewteen these or we won't know where to fight the disease in the first place. The book highlights why we should care about natural habitats, treat our animals with care, and not board a plane when feeling sick (!), but it doesn't fear-monger in any way. Yes, it does point out what people should or shouldn't do, what are the risk factors for contracting some exotic diseases, but it also highlights that ordinary diseases kill far more people than ebola, for example. Coronary disease, cancers, diabetes, traffic accidents... familiar killers we've gotten used to don't scare us as they should, while the thought of contracting a virus from a bat makes some people fear them like the plague. What the author makes clear time and time again is that local farmers in some god-forsaken parts of third-world countries (but in the West as well - not everyone is an epidemiologist or veterinarian) can't understand the full impact of an outbreak among their flock before it spreads. So education is key, and fast response from laboratories, research facilites, and medical institutions. I was amazed how much difference fast cooperation among scientists and medical doctors makes in terms of outbreak containment. Why doesn't the media highlight these achievements more and make people interested in science? What will it take? The next big virus or outbreak is just around the corner - it may be our ordinary flu not ebola."

A large portion of the book is devoted to these efforts. 

He covers many zoonotic infectious diseases here; Hendra virus, Malaria, the SARS coronavirus, among many others.The book has a great flow, and format; He breaks it down into ~100 different chapters, avoiding the common problem of super-long, run on chapters that become difficult to reference. He details many of the adventures he had in Africa, including capturing bats to take their blood.""Spillover"" (it's namesake the term used to describe occurrences when a reservoir population with a high pathogen prevalence comes into contact with a novel host population) also covers quite a lot of epidemiology and virology, as well.

240,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,4,"Good book. It was interesting to learn about how viruses and disease can pass over to humans. Certainly, relevant to the current situation particularly the sections about bats. The organization and pace of the book is good. It’s a mix of information, interviews and the author’s experiences while observing the scientists at work. I usually don’t like author’s personal experiences in works like this, but since he focuses on the research itself it’s not too irritating. The writing is readable if a bit too snarky at times. The content is great. I learned a lot about viruses and the research behind figuring out pandemics. It’s all very interesting. This book exceeded my expectations.  So, I give this a 4. It’s mostly readable and always interesting with clear implications for the current situation.  "
241,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,3,"This holds a ton of information that is helpful to hold some specifics re virus infections that proceed to humans. But it's not completely upon the title material.In fact, the writing is well accomplished. It's often clear and better than some of the highly scientific particulars and nomenclatures of pure science reads (very dry) elsewhere. But as much as I can decide it DID make the reading easier than most material in this genre, it also holds another quality I thought was a considerable distraction from that positive prose form. Quammen has a kind of tone that's strange to read (it was for me) and quite difficult to describe. It's not Chicken Little on meth (or a hate rant like Gerta Thunberg either) but it's not a logical nor scientific bottom line ""norm"" either. If I'm overstating that, I'm sorry. But some of this assumption and oversight is just plain wrong when he tends to expand from ""one"" to ""some"" to ""all"". And it some cases it seems to me, that this emotive occludes to some of the very actual world reality of how MOST virus pass into pandemic outcomes. And how they did in the past, as well. Like the 1918 and the other human influenza forms that went lethal since. There are huge portions of this book that read like a memoir and travelogue. It's just not direct to the title at all, immense pages of asides/ tangents.The history of some of the worst spillovers (like Hendra or other bat vector virus) were the best and most accurate parts- and I am glad I read it for the understanding of how an intermediate ""amplify"" animal is also usually a HUGE part of the ""it depends"" serendipity that results in these horrific outcomes. First a small ""usual"" mammal, then a mid vector animal and then other species- such as monkeys/apes or humans.It's not a book I would necessarily recommend. His personality and slant, I just feel, is containing quite a bit of ""group think"" and not enough science. But now I do comprehend more easily the trail through 3 or 4 species this virus morph road can take."
242,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3230750-molly,5,"Thrilled to see that David Quammen had a new science book, I snatched this up. It’s been 15 years since his book ""Song of the Dodo” about island biogeography, which remains at the top of my favorite non-fiction. Can one *enjoy* a book about infectious disease? Anyone who's read Richard Preston's “The Hot Zone” will guiltily admit, yes (interestingly, he takes Preston to task for overplaying descriptions of Ebola infection. “Bleeding out"" is not accurate.)There is inherent narrative drama in the question of when the Next Big One (NBO) will hit and in the epidemiological sleuthing to identify viruses and their host animals when an epidemic breaks. What will turn a local outbreak into a pandemic? Do scientists think there IS a NBO lurking? Quite possibly. And if so, it will assuredly originate in animals, as has almost all human infectious disease. Influenza, SARS, Marburg, Lyme disease - Quammen covers them all and more, and turns up startling facts. For one, the subtitle of his book could just as well be, ""From Bats to Humans."" But what put the book over the top in excellence and dramatic page-turning was the penultimate chapter on the origin of AIDS. In some ways the whole book was moving toward this chapter. The origins of HIV can now be pinned to a year (much earlier than you’d think) and a single spillover event; chimp to human. And Quammen makes the poignant and chilling case that lest you wonder why we should care about exotic diseases such as Marbug, consider the exponential trajectory and devastation of AIDS. It too is a zoonotic disease, but one that has moved more slowly than an airborne NBO will surely do. Despite the theme – lively and buoyant writing. In other words, it’s readable. Quammen remains a master of science journalism. "

David is a great writer, his narrative drive and prose are magnificent. He does this while presenting the science in a very accessible yet amazingly informative way.What is astounding is the amount of work and research that must have gone into this book. David conducted a seemingly endless amount of interviews with scientists, researchers, doctors. To say he took it to the next level, well that is a vast understatement. This is science journalism/writing at its pinnacle.My particular favorite was the section on the ecology of borrelia (lyme). This is a subject that hits close to home for me.The section on malaria was very intriguing, learned a lot. The coolest thing was learning that a form of malaria had been used as therapy to treat syphilis (a form of therapy known as pyrotherapy). That blew my mind. If you're curious, here's an article on the subject: http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/bod...I was also fascinated by the HIV chapter. Could have done without his hypothesizing and reimagining of the original patient 0 story, I saw what he was trying to do, but that seemed a bit clunky and unnecessary.

Well, viruses and bacteria fascinate me and I'm piling up titles about the subject: Spillover is so far one of the best.

It is longer than most science/ medicine books, but do not let that deter you. I was extremely sad when this book ended. I wanted more!In the middle of reading this book, I made the mistake of putting this book on pause to read the more recent Pandemic by Sonia Shah. Science is obviously not the authors strong suit. It was extremely disappointing. It might fly with people who are less scientifically literate. She had more up to date info on Ebola, which might draw in a huge readership, but her book doesn't hold a candle to this book. Quammen's book is a big WOW, on every level. When I finally returned from Pandemic, I was in such a foul mood, it was detracting from my enjoyment of this book. That only lasted for a little bit. I could not help but get sucked right back into all of Quammen's case studies and histories of various outbreaks. This book was well researched, extremely thorough, scientifically sound, well written, and entertaining as hell. His passion for his subject spilled over into every page and into me. I do not even want to give a summary of all the wonder inside this book because he tells the story of each virus so well, anything I would relate here feels like an actual spoiler. It is a must read!

247,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"Where Do ""Emerging Diseases"" Emerge From?AIDS, Ebola, Marburg, SARS, H5N1 — every one of the world’s scariest diseases is a “zoonosis,” that is, a virus harbored by animals and transmitted to humans, often by other animals, in a complex minuet that often stretches out into decades.AIDS, for example. According to the latest research, reported by David Quammen in Spillover, Patient Zero was not that French-Canadian flight attendant you may have read about who went amok in the 1970s but a hunter in Southeast Cameroon around 1908 who killed a chimpanzee and somehow unwittingly allowed the animal’s blood to seep into his own circulatory system, either through a cut or by eating his prey’s raw flesh. This is the phenomenon that epidemiologists call “spillover.” At that point, a particularly virulent form of a recently emergent simian virus found a friendly and familiar environment in the hunter’s blood and flourished, becoming what we know today as HIV-1 (the more lethal form of the virus that causes AIDS). Later, the hunter passed along the virus to one or more women through sexual contact, and the disease slowly spread, both by sex and by transmission through reused needles, undetected as anything out of the ordinary, from Cameroon into what is now called the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and other sub-Saharan countries, and thence by happenstance to Haiti. It was a Haitian harboring HIV-1 who probably passed it along to that notorious Canadian flight attendant, setting off the epidemic among gay men in North America.In Spillover, Quammen tells tales like these in fascinating detail, relating the stories of the often-heroic scientists, physicians, and veterinarians who worked directly with deadly diseases, occasionally at the cost of their own lives. Quammen spent years writing this book. He appears to have read all the relevant scientific literature, attended specialized scientific conferences, and spent long hours tracking down and speaking face-to-face with the people who discovered these diseases, isolated the viruses, first treated the symptoms, and labored for thankless years on end in laboratories around the world to help humanity avert the next pandemic.You may have read Richard Preston’s best-selling 2001 treatment of the emergence of Ebola in The Hot Zone. If not, I can tell you that I vividly recall the book because it was so dramatic, and so terrifying. No doubt I had nightmares about contracting Ebola. But it turns out, according to Quammen and to the eminent scientists he interviewed, that Preston’s account was sensationalized and highly inaccurate in essential details. For example, he described tears of blood, massive hemorrhages, and melted internal organs, none of which has any basis in fact.However, Spillover, in its own way, is no less frightening. Quammen advances the popular theory that what appears to be the accelerating emergence of dangerous new pathogens became inevitable as a result of the enormous population growth of homo sapiens — because humanity has increasingly encroached on animal habitat and come into intimate contact with animals as never before. In discussions with noted biologists, he explores the concept of “breakout,” the explosive growth frequently seen in some animal species that shortly leads to sudden, catastrophic — through disease. He intimates that, with AIDS — or, all too possibly, with the next pandemic — humankind may experience something similar. Despite all the horrific details about AIDS, Ebola, Marburg, and the like, these are the book’s scariest passages.David Quammen writes about science, nature, and travel — a total of 10 nonfiction books and five novels to date. A former Rhodes Scholar, he was educated at Yale and Oxford.(From www.malwarwickonbooks.com)"
248,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58119141-elena-sala,5,"SPILLOVER: ANIMAL INFECTIONS AND THE NEXT HUMAN PANDEMIC (2012) was the result of David Quammen's five years of research interviewing scientists who were looking into the possibility of another horrific Ebola-type disease emerging. At that time, believe it or not, there was a widespread consensus: there would indeed be a new disease, likely from the coronavirus family, coming out of a bat, and it would likely emerge in or around a wet market in China. So, how could the world be SO unprepared for this nightmarish pandemic?? This book was written 8 years before this pandemic so it does not attempt to answer this question. Though we can probably guess some possible answers.This book is about zoonoses, infectious diseases that originate in animals and spread to humans. Rabies, for example, is a zoonotic disease. HIV is also a zoonotic disease. Dengue, yellow fever, malaria, influenza, Lyme disease, MERS, SARS, Zika and COVID are all zoonoses. The technical term scientists use to describe the leap of a pathogen from one animal to another is “spillover”. Most infections start as spillovers. Some, like Ebola and lesser-known viral diseases (Nipah, Hendra, Marburg), are highly transmissible and virulent, but so far have been limited to sporadic outbreaks. They persist because they are endemic in a reservoir population through a process of mutual adaptation.Quammen explores the correlation between these diseases that come up one after the other. It should not come as a surprise that they are not mere accidents but unwanted consequences of our actions. How do these pathogens make the leap from animals to humans? Quammen's answer: ""we invade tropical forests and other wild landscapes, which harbor so many species of animals and plants. And within those creatures, so many viruses. We cut the trees, we kill the animals or cage them and send them to markets. We disrupt ecosystems and we shake viruses loose from their natural hosts. When that happens, they need a new host. Often, we are it.” And why does this seem to be happening more frequently in recent times? The answer, again in Quammen's own words is: ""there’s 7.8 billion of us on this planet—four times the number of humans at the time of the 1918 influenza. And we have quadrupled the speed we travel around the planet; we have quadrupled the size of some of our cities. So there are a lot more of us large-bodied vertebrate animals, living in dense aggregations, moving fluidly from one place to another... We’re the world’s greatest target for a virus—a great ecosystem for them to colonize. So when a virus does get into a human and finds it can replicate and transmit to the next human, that virus has opened the door to vast opportunity.""Quammen's journeys have taken him all around the world: inside the air-locked sterility of high-security biological research labs, through the crowded alleyways of Chinese live animal markets, into remote African and Asian villages that have experienced outbreaks of some of the most lethal diseases yet known to mankind. He has interviewed survivors of these diseases and the scientists doing all the research. He has been a science writer for over 35 years, interested in ecology and evolutionary biology. He uses a conversational tone and, occasionally, some dark humor to give a frightening and eye opening summary of all that is known about these zoonotic diseases. This is a book I highly recommend, not only because it is written in an engaging and accessible way, sober, rational yet suspenseful, but because it is clear that COVID will not be the last pandemic we will see. There will be more zoonoses because we are disrupting the environment more and more. So we need to think about our own responsibility and how we relate to our environment. Each one of us has a responsibility, because we are all consumers of food, resources, and energy. Each of the choices that we make about what we’re going to eat, wear, or buy draws on these wild ecosystems. This book invites the reader to think about these choices while explaining how we got into this mess in the first place."
249,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,4," Fairly good coverage of a topic that is all over the headlines at the current moment epidemics from diseases that jump from animal to human mostly viruses. It would be really hard at this point to not know about Coronavirus and the pandemic it caused and its likely source from animals (probably bats). This has been a problem we have been aware of for quite some time with flu strains and aids, and Lyme disease, and zika virus, and ebola, and Marburg virus the list goes on. Only now the point is hammered home in a pandemic and a world-historical economic crisis. Some of us knew better but as usual, people didn't heed the warnings. They almost never do."
250,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2747498-arun-divakar,4,"The hubris of homo sapiens lies in believing that it holds sway over this planet but then hidden away from anything but the most powerful electron microscopes are organisms that can wreak havoc on all of us. These microorganisms are hardy, smart and incredibly adaptable when it comes to the question of how to survive and thrive among the biodiversity of the earth. If you were to romanticize the whole concept then it becomes very easy to paint the pathogen as the most dreaded enemy of mankind/ nature’s revenge on us etc. However, a rational perspective tells a story which is entirely different and utterly fascinating in a deadly way. The microorganism’s capability to jump across species to man and thereby begin devastating outbreaks is the premise of the book and the scientific term for such a happening is Zoonosis. In the words of the author about the need of such a book :  Why obsess about Zoonoses ? In the larger balance of miseries, what makes anyone think they should be taken so seriously ? It’s a fair question but there are good answers. Some of those answers are intricate and speculative. Some are subjective. Others are objective and blunt. The bluntest is this : AIDS. Let’s look at some zoonotic diseases other than AIDS : Ebola, Marburg, Avian and Swine Flu, SARS, Malaria, Hendra are but a few of them. All of these are without doubt some of the deadliest killer that we have encountered. David Quammen does a book length investigation into the history, nature and where we stand in the understanding of the microorganisms which cause these diseases. Quammen’s writing style is approachable and far less sensational than what I encountered with Richard Preston’s Hot Zone. While Preston horrified and thrilled me, Quammen offers a more informative and grounded view at the pathogens and their effects. He also travels far and wide for his research and converses with recovered patients, eyewitnesses, doctors and scientists and ergo a much more well-rounded view of what actually transpires during a disease outbreak comes to light. Of special mention is the chapter named The Chimp and River which is an in depth detective story that traces the journey of HIV from the jungles of Africa into the world at large. There are two things about the book that really caught my attention : • The number of mice and monkeys that die in the name of betterment and advancement of science in this book is huge. There were times when I paused and wondered if more of these hapless animals perish than humans.• Quammen is a first rate travel writer. His descriptions of Asia and Africa are measured views of anthropology, wildlife and the inevitable clash between the two.Parts of the book especially on the mathematical connects between the nature of mass outbreaks and about the lifecycles of viruses were difficult to comprehend. But that aside this is a fantastic book to understand how much nature has in store which man has no idea of. It also corrected for me the notion that nature uses viruses to eventually get back at humans ( courtesy Richard Preston). A virus is a non-thinking organism and one for which in a majority of the cases, a human host is next to an evolutionary dead end. It just so happens that with our invasive lifestyle, we breach the habitats of the virus and get caught in their snares.Recommended."
251,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky,5,"I see why Quammen is so well thought of. Spillover was amazingly informative, had a near perfect execution, explained very difficult, scientific subjects in a manner that a reader with little science background could understand without making it so dumbed down that the same reader found themselves lost in a nexus of weakening metaphors and feeling insulted (I'm looking at you, Winchester). This is how you speak to your audience! You do not dumbdown, but rather heighten the discourse and inform. I learned so much, and was so in awe of what I was learning, and the research that was done by Quammen, and even more by the researching actively trying to save us from the ""Next Big One"" that nightly over dinner I'd tell my husband excitedly that he just HAD to read Spillover, because did you know this or that about ebola? Its the only audiobook that I have honestly considered restarting immediately. There is just so much to process here, so much that I realize I just didn't know, and so much more that I could learn from a second reading.This is a book that I think every person should read. There is as much (if not more) human interest as science, it can honestly keep you on the edge of your seat. I love nature, but it can be such a scary place without considering that maybe you just inhaled infected bat shit or dust from an aborted goat. But its also a beautiful place, where ecology matters, where there is balance, and as the eruption of human population continues (presumably unchecked for now) that balance is disturbed. I cannot stress enough, especially during this election cycle, how important an informed populace is. How can we make decisions in domestic protection, how we raise our livestock, how we tour, how we travel across the globe, how we transport EVERYTHING, how we mine, and how we manufacture if we are not informed of the consequences and the possible dangers of what we are doing. I'm not crazy, I'm not saying lets halt the world, but we need to understand that its not just about global warming, when ecologists are warning us of what we are doing to the planet. We have rapidly interconnected this world in a way that has never before happened. There are risks and benefits to that. Scientists are trying to study and prepare for the next big one, but should the unthinkable happen (its not unthinkable, its more that we refuse to think of it) how are we, as a populace, prepared to respond? We need to consider this.And, man, wash your hands if you butcher something, okay?"
252,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60209410-jordan-buckley,4,"Good information on zoonotic diseases (diseases that live in animal hosts and can spread to humans), which are pretty relevant at the moment because COVID-19 is believed to be one. Many major diseases are zoonoses or started that way, including HIV, Ebola, rabies, Lyme disease, SARS, swine flu, etc.There were a few major takeaways for me. You can't eradicate a zoonotic disease if it's still silently thriving in some animal population (""reservoir host""). The pathogen may just live happily in one or more animal species without causing any obvious symptoms, but could be deadly if it infects humans. The other big takeaway is that human civilization and activity is often what unearths these diseases or gives them the opportunity to thrive. As we expand we move into forests and come into contact with animals that may carry all kinds of unknown pathogens. Our new methods of factory farming and cramming animals together in their own excrement creates new opportunities for these things to thrive and spread. Tragedies like the current pandemic aren't just ""acts of God"" that we have no control over; they are brought on by our own activity.Like most nonfiction books I read, I wish it was much shorter. The author does a good job of making it interesting, but I could have done without so much of the breathless recounting of the journalist's search for truth, tracking down different hypotheses, biographical descriptions of the various interviewees, the fanciful hypothetical story of the imagined ""voyager"" who brought HIV out of the jungle and into human civilization. The story of the SARS outbreak was interesting for comparison to COVID-19, and it was notable to see coronaviruses mentioned repeatedly among other candidates as a risk for the next pandemic."

He writes brilliantly and makes the study of zoonoses and concepts of epidemiology not only fascinating but comprehensible. And occasionally really funny. OCCASIONALLY! This is serious stuff. But he finds room for some levity while still keeping this impressively well organized and clearly explained. "

255,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,4,"*2019 Edit* Just swinging back here to call attention to this book for anyone interested in zoonotic (transferable form animal to human) viruses in the wake of the Eastern Equine Encephalitis outbreaks. Super, super relevant right now, and from my memory this book references EEE, though don't quote me. *Review*First things first. I hate when I look at a nonfiction book table of contents and can’t tell by the name of the chapters what they cover. For those who feel the same, here is the annotated table of contents:I. Pale Horse (Hendra virus)II. Thirteen Gorillas (Ebola virus)III. Everything Comes From Somewhere (Malaria)IV. Dinner at the Rat Farm (SARS)V. The Deer, the Parrot, & the Kid Next Door (Q Fever, Psittacosis, and Lyme disease)VI. Going Viral (General Virus Stuff, but Especially HIV)VII. Celestial Hosts (About Animals That Transmit Disease, Especially Bats, and Also Focuses on the Nipah virus)VIII. The Chimp and The River (HIV)IX. It Depends (Viruses of the Future)Onto the review.I wasn’t thinking about it when I snagged it at the library, but this was the perfect book to follow up The Hot Zone (and, in fact, this book references that one). That was a concentrated, focused look at one distinct family of viruses, the filoviruses. It was also more dramatized. This one takes that zoomed-in look and contextualizes it. Reminds us that 60% of all infections diseases that affect humans come from animals via zoonosis. Ebola, Marburg (the stars of The Hot Zone), rabies, hantavirus, anthrax, Lassa, Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, dengue, west nile, sars, typhus, mad cow disease, all forms of influenza, bubonic plague, Lyme disease, AIDS, and countless more. The author also points out something interesting- the diseases we’ve mostly eradicated, like smallpox and polio, are the rare ones that aren’t passed to humans by animals. That’s why we were able to eradicate them. People are easier to keep track of and vaccinate than animals. Nowhere for them to hide. Whereas Marburg or Ebola can lurk forever in hidden corners of caves, immortal. And why are these diseases popping up now? Practically all of these zoonotic (species-hopping) diseases are new. Like, zoonotic diseases barely existed at all before the 1960s, after which they started popping up everywhere in myriad forms. Why? Because we’re tearing apart ecosystems, breaking down the natural fabric of things, spreading ourselves where we ought not be a-spreadin’. These diseases had their natural hosts. They didn’t kill the hosts, they mostly lived in harmony with the host in some remote corner of the world. But when we wreck that natural host’s home and kill lots of them off, what’s a virus to do but to jump ship and latch onto humans if it wants to survive? Finally, I’d like to thank David Quammen for summarizing my feelings on life nicely: “Mathematics to me is like a language I don’t speak, though I admire its literature in translation.”"
256,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,5,"I try not to read books that make me paranoid or hypochondriac — and that's not the intention of this book — but I'll think twice next time that I'm in some exotic place and close to wild animals. The Monkey Forest in Bali was mentioned in this book in relation to herpes B (a deadly disease caused by a spillover from macaques monkeys to humans). Thanks goodness I feel a visceral revulsion towards monkeys. I didn't hand-feed any or let them climb up my head and shoulders so that I can take a picture with them. A little bite or scratch from the wrong monkey could seal your death sentence. This is a very well-researched, well-written, and highly-informative book on zoonosis — a pathogen leaping from an animal to humans. There have been recent scares with diseases like SARS and bird flu and swine flu that caused relatively limited damage and were contained. But you can never underestimate the danger of the Next Big One. We shouldn't forget that the Spanish flu at the end of the World War I killed by far more people than the war. As Quammen says, if you think we shouldn't concern ourselves too much with a local outbreak of an exotic disease like ebola that is caused by starving villagers in a remote corner of Congo eating a rotten dead chimp, the answer is: AIDS.The most interesting chapter of the book is the chapter on AIDS, which reads like a detective story. Here's the spoiler: the HIV virus first jumped from chimps to humans (quite likely when a hunter was butchering an infected chimp) somewhere in southeast Cameroon some time around 1908. What it was doing between then and the early 1980's when it became a global pandemic that has so far killed an estimated 35 million people is a fascinating story. "
257,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"Spillover is a well-written bio-thriller in the tradition of The Hot Zone, etc. It rehashes the same misleading theme of scary monster viruses waiting out there in the bushes to kill us all. It is good if you want a horror story, not if you want useful, accurate science about public health. As the subtitle indicates, it is focused on the hypothetical ""Next Big One"" but misses the point about what caused the actual Great Pandemic of 1918, repeating boilerplate nonsense about gene shifts etc. The demonstrably false idea that reassortment of the Hs and Ns in influenza virus is why you get a deadly pandemic is what caused the panics in 1976 and 2009 over the shift to H1N1. Both times there was no deadly pandemic. In 1976, the needless panic actually killed a bunch of people with a bad vaccine. In 2009, it cost billions and billions of dollars and created tremendous emotional stress for no apparent benefit. This is pretty obvious stuff. So why act as if nobody knows this and repeat old nonsense about what causes pandemics? The difference between a mild flu and a deadly one that kills 50 million people is not a reassortment of the genes. This is known. So what is the difference and how do we make germs be mild instead of lethal? That is a very important question, but you won't find the answer in this book. If you are interested in exploring this question, you may want to look at the TED talk by Paul Ewald: http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_ewald_a...."
258,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1072582-kaethe-douglas,4,"This is a book about zoonoses, diseases that come to humans from other animals. It is scary, sure, because there are always new microbes out there ready to go rampaging through our vast society. It is also rather comforting, both the methodical search for vectors and reservoirs, the details of transmission and treatment, the stream of breakthroughs that enable researchers to locate and sequence. And through it all, Quammen maintains a casual, light conversational tone, reassuring the reader that sure, horrible new diseases can (and will) spring up seemingly out of nowhere to spread around the world, but that also we have been pretty good at controlling those sorts of outbreaks.There's quite a lot about Ebola here, written before this summer's outbreak. It should prove very comforting to everyone whose loved ones are not currently infected. I heap praise upon him for pointing out that it isn't nearly as grotesque as Preston painted it in The Hot Zone.The only part I really disliked was the pure fiction of The Voyager, which was too long and added nothing. This was particularly annoying as I was nearing the end and racing to finish quickly before the future biologist usurped in entirely.Library copyI don't usually comment on covers, but I will say that Chip Kidd managed to make a very disturbing one."

David Quammen convincingly argues that the greatest bugaboo for the human race should be a zoonosis, an infectious disease that spills over from an animal population into humans. He travels around the world and talks to scientists who have worked in the virus-riddled trenches of HIV, malaria, Ebola, SARS, and an ever-growing list of other nasties with shocking fatality rates. Particularly interesting is Quammen's notion that the historical rate of human population growth is itself an outbreak. We've proliferated like mad - at a speed unprecedented for a large mammal species. And what scientists know about outbreaks is that they always come to an end... While layman accessible, this detailed and hefty book takes perseverance, but it's well worth it for the amount of information you'll get in return. I'm going to go wash my hands now.

Back to my original review:Zoonotic pathogens, those that travel from other animals to human animals, have been with us, will be with us, have killed millions of people, will kill millions more. I read half of this book on the topic and got really really bored. Each chapter was ""And here's another example"" ""and here's yet another example."" He tried to spice that up with turning searching for the animal source of the pathogen into a mystery and by getting personal about the researchers (that is, applying fictional techniques to non fiction), but it couldn't disguise for me that it was all ""and here's another example."" I got the point by page 100. So I got past page 300 and then skimmed the rest. It's not badly written...it just got a bit boring for me.Here's the take-away advice I gleaned:1) Try to calm down. That zoonosis exists is largely beyond your control.2) To the extent you can control things: first, quit overbreeding. Overbreeding leads to human encroachment upon ecosystems where disease has happily been at equilibrium for tens of thousands of years. Overbreeding is awful for many reasons, but if you needed another, well, here's another. Overbreeders are bad world citizens.3) Don't, for heaven's sake, eat unusual game meat, particularly not game you find mysteriously dead on the ground with blood around its mouth. Also, glove/mask when treating sick domestic animals, yes, even beloved Fluffy, and when Fluffy does succumb, avoid kissing her bloody muzzle goodbye.4) Be rich and insured and ideally connected to the government in a first world country--not only can you buy farmed/ranched meat that's inspected and safe, if you do get sick, you'll get the best treatment available.5) That 33% of Americans aren't insured means the coming pandemic is going to be worse and spread faster and kill more here than in civilized countries where all citizens have access to health care. Not his point in the first 300 pages, but any thinking person can see it.6) Commercial airliners are really that dangerous for spreading disease--avoid if you can and rethink what ""vacation"" means to you. Sure, any given flight probably won't next Patient X on it...but it might. Is it really that important to board that plane?7) Religion helps spread pandemics because people pray and wallow in superstition instead of of getting treatment. When the next epidemic comes, pray/chant/positive-think/sacrifice a goat all you want, but not in a crowd, and get treatment, too."

He weaves narrative storytelling and science seamlessly like its the easiest thing ever. That's the source of the overall brilliance of the book. Quammen manages to use his own personal experiences with disease scientists at the centre of the research and others in the thick of things to make the book more entertaining. Billy Karesh studying chimps in Moba Bai, Beatrice Hahn at the heart of AIDS research, Engel and Jones-Engel a husband and wife team from New York investigating prevalence of a monkey virus in Bangladesh temples, a Chinese scientist searching for the reservoir of SARS, an Australian vet who survived the Hendra virus, etcThe book is basically about how animal diseases jump or spillover into humans. He narrates how these diseases, commonly classified as zoonoses first appeared on the scene and how people react to these diseases in the beginning, how scientific research unfolded and how they escalated into global epidemics in some cases. He also discusses the tiny pathogens responsible and their evolution into killer monsters. He deals with a long list of deadly diseases like Hendra, Ebola, malaria, AIDS, Lyme disease, Q fever, SARS, etc. All dangerous and potentially lethal bugs if not dealt with properly. A few themes appear throughout the book. One of them is how humans interfere with nature, eat what they are not supposed to or encroach on wild habitats. It's clear we are having more contact with animals, both domestic and wild, and this is one of the reasons why certain diseases have spilled over into humans. And also why in the future probably more lethal pathogens will spill over. As humans, we need to understand the nature of ecosystems better and try not to interfere with wildlife habitats. These diseases have killed millions and millions of people and it's clear that these bugs especially viruses have the upper hand over us and we should be weary of the potential devastation involved. Zoonotic diseases will continue to spill over in future. But how ling before we come across a pathogen capable of annihilating all of humankind?"

Quammen manages to make it understandable and compelling all at the same time. He helps the reader to understand the seriousness of the topic - and it is really serious -- without feeling alarmist. The book was published in 2012, so well before our current pandemic. After reading this, I feel much better equipped to decipher and understand the current reporting on COVID - 19, to make more educated decisions about what I am seeing on my news feed, to know when to be skeptical, and what my role can be in minimizing risk and spread (significant in all viruses with human to human transmission). I highly recommend this book if you want to understand more about viruses - their impact, their trajectory, and our options. With something as serious as what we are currently facing, I wanted more information that newspaper headlines and I wanted it to be, as much as possible, free from the political positioning -- just give me the science and the history so I can improve my context.

We should appreciate that these recent outbreaks of new zoonotic diseases, as well as the recurrence and spread of old ones, are part of a larger pattern, and that humanity is responsible for generating that pattern. We should recognize that they reflect things that we're DOING, not just things that are HAPPENING to us. WE should understand that, although some of the human-caused factors may seem virtually inexorable, others are within our control.""""That's the salubrious thing about zoonotic diseases: They remind us, as St. Francis did, that we humans are inseparable from the natural world. In fact, there IS no ""natural world,"" it's a bad and artificial phrase. There is only the world."""" . . . Dwyer's models have shown that heterogeneity of behavior, even among forest insects, let alone among humans, can be very important in damping the spread of infectious disease. . . . individual effort, individual discernment, individual choice can have huge effects in averting the catastrophes that might otherwise sweep through a herd. An individual gypsy moth may inherit a slightly superior ability to avoid smears of NPV as it grazes on a leaf. An individual human may choose not to drink the palm sap, not to eat the chimpanzee, not to pen the pig beneath mango trees, not to clear the horse's windpipe with his bare hand, not to have unprotected sex with the prostitute, not to share the needle in a shooting gallery, not to cough without covering her mouth, not to board a plane while feeling ill, or not to coop his chickens along with his ducks. ""Any tiny little thing that people do,"" Dwyer said, if it makes them different from one another, from the idealized standard of herd behavior, ""is going to reduce infection rates."" ""So why only three stars? David Quammen -- I wanted to add his author link right there, but GR won't let me, but go look him up because he's written a ton of interesting books -- is more than capable of writing a non-fiction book that would hold anyone's interest, yet he insists on inserting some extremely long passages of pure fiction as he speculates on the exact circumstances leading to the emergence of HIV-1. My husband will tell you, I'm more of a ""just the facts"" kind of person -- I neither need nor want speculation, especially when the facts are compelling on their own. If that kind of thing doesn't bother you, you may rate this one higher.Even with that, I would still recommend this."
266,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,4,"This book is about zoonoses--illnesses that spread from animals to people. It describes the typical process: the virus or bacteria lives, long-term and harmlessly, in a reservoir species. When it infects an amplifier species, it can spread more quickly to humans. For example, the Hendra virus has its reservoir in flying foxes (large Australian bats), but when it infects horses, it can spread to people, who are in much closer contact with their sick horses than with bats. Not only are zoonoses threatening because new ones can appear unexpectedly (like SARS or HIV), they are also essentially impossible to eradicate, unlike (say) polio, which is only found in humans, whom you can vaccinate. Bats come off rather badly in this book. In the past, I've learned that you should like them because they eat harmful insects. It turns out that they are the source of all sorts of nasty bugs, in the virus sense of the word.Quammen writes quite a bit about his travels to research the book, or how one scientist introduces him to another. Not only does this give the book a bit of a travelogue feeling, it also acknowledges the essential contributions of the people who tranquilize angry macaques or go out in the middle of the night to rig up bat nets--without which none of the science would have happened. His style is vivid and entertaining, though there's one passage in the chapter about HIV/AIDS that is strangely novelistic. Not bad, just incongruous and unnecessary.Nothing in this book will make you change your behavior, unless you are remiss about handwashing or routinely eat things bats have shat on. At the end the author emphasizes: ""The purpose of this book is not to make you more worried. The purpose of this book is to make you more smart. That's what most distinguishes humans from, say, tent caterpillars and gypsy moths. Unlike them, we can be pretty smart."" I didn't find this book particularly scary--just informative--so don't avoid it just on those grounds.To the extent it contains a call to action, the book reminds us that human pressure on ecological systems creates havoc. A relatively short section deals with Lyme disease and reveals the startling conclusion that Lyme flourishes in isolated areas. Think the islands in a parking lot rather than a forest. It's where we come in contact with ecologies that we've disrupted that we find zoonoses.P.S. Bonus points for sending me to the dictionary: ""cadastral.""P.P.S. Further bonus points for this sentence, even if the sentiment isn't new: ""[A]nyone who favors Intelligent Design in lieu of evolution might pause to wonder why God devoted so much of His intelligence to designing malarial parasites."""
267,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1182891-sue,5,"This book is a gripping tale of disease “spillover” that will thrill those interested in science – and probably many who aren’t. After all, we all get sick occasionally. Quammen looks at the ways pathogens (usually viruses) have spilled from animals to humans. He traces the origins of, among others, Ebola, SARS, bird flu, Lyme disease, and AIDS. These zoonotic diseases can escalate rapidly into global pandemics when human-to-human transmission occurs. For five years Quammen trailed scientists in their labs and in the field. Worldwide exchange of information turns out to be essential in epidemiology, and the solution to mysterious epidemics often means gathering data in far-flung places. Quammen himself traveled to China, to Bangladesh, to the Congo, to Connecticut. Data moves among such places, and so did the author. Everywhere there is mystery, drama, and good science.A long chapter (more than 20% of the book) traces the origins of HIV to a chimpanzee in Cameroon in the early 20th century. It’s a fascinating story. The author first tracked the evidence, working with scientists as they examined tissue samples that showed the spillover to be not in the 1980s, when the Western world first encountered it, but in the first decade of the 20th century. Quammen then allowed himself to think through a possible scenario which would have brought the virus down river to the Congo, initially moving slowly because its carriers might have died early of other causes, because the virus moved through areas of low population density, because it did not yet have the opportunity afforded by global travel and multiple sex partners.Ten years ago I had to abort a trip to Vietnam and China because of SARS, so the episode was very personal to me. That dread virus ran a deadly but short course. It turned out that the disease was transmissible after the person became ill, so it was eventually within the power of the health system to halt the spread. But it could reemerge. Civets, a diet delicacy blamed initially for the disease, turned out to be “amplifier” hosts but not “reservoir” hosts. This latter term applies to animals who host and live amicably with a virus which may cause great mischief in humans. For SARS, the reservoir was a bat, the amplifier was a civet, and the human who ate the civet was an unlucky, violently ill person. In fact, the eating of exotic (and often illegal) meats was a persistent theme in the entire book.As a non-scientist, I’ve possibly gotten a couple of things wrong in this review. Apologies. But I am pretty sure I’m going to be paying attention to the news about epidemics – as well as to, for example, ticks or exotic meats."
268,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17766893-matty-swytla,5,"A very good bok with scientific, yet approachable explanations to why zoonoses (animal diseases that infect humans) are so scary and deadly, especially when it comes to certain new viruses. The fact is zoonotic viruses and other diseases infect humans on a regular basis. I know; I was infected with ringworm (Dermatophytosis) by my kittens a few years ago - it's a fungal infection that spreads like fire. No fun but no biggie either. But any pet owner knows the drill on vaccinations for rabies and other diseases for dogs and cats. Some of these make the jump to humans with devastating results.The differences between carriers, natural reservoirs, and amplifiers is fascinating and illuminating. Some animals only spread viruses, bacteria or other illness-inducing organisms (mosquitoes for malaria); others live with them, a certain population of infected yet not very ill reservoirs from whence other animals and humans can get infected (bats, monkeys); while some animals get very ill and spread the infections further (amplifiers - often some domestic animals like pigs or poultry). It's important to make the distinction bewteen these or we won't know where to fight the disease in the first place. The book highlights why we should care about natural habitats, treat our animals with care, and not board a plane when feeling sick (!), but it doesn't fear-monger in any way. Yes, it does point out what people should or shouldn't do, what are the risk factors for contracting some exotic diseases, but it also highlights that ordinary diseases kill far more people than ebola, for example. Coronary disease, cancers, diabetes, traffic accidents... familiar killers we've gotten used to don't scare us as they should, while the thought of contracting a virus from a bat makes some people fear them like the plague. What the author makes clear time and time again is that local farmers in some god-forsaken parts of third-world countries (but in the West as well - not everyone is an epidemiologist or veterinarian) can't understand the full impact of an outbreak among their flock before it spreads. So education is key, and fast response from laboratories, research facilites, and medical institutions. I was amazed how much difference fast cooperation among scientists and medical doctors makes in terms of outbreak containment. Why doesn't the media highlight these achievements more and make people interested in science? What will it take? The next big virus or outbreak is just around the corner - it may be our ordinary flu not ebola."

Author David Qaummen is a science-writer. He actually traveled to Africa many times, accompanying scientists on their quest(s) to identify the wild reservoirs of Ebola and HIV viruses. A large portion of the book is devoted to these efforts. 

He covers many zoonotic infectious diseases here; Hendra virus, Malaria, the SARS coronavirus, among many others.The book has a great flow, and format; He breaks it down into ~100 different chapters, avoiding the common problem of super-long, run on chapters that become difficult to reference. He details many of the adventures he had in Africa, including capturing bats to take their blood.""Spillover"" (it's namesake the term used to describe occurrences when a reservoir population with a high pathogen prevalence comes into contact with a novel host population) also covers quite a lot of epidemiology and virology, as well.

270,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72479728-bryan-alkire,4,"Good book. It was interesting to learn about how viruses and disease can pass over to humans. Certainly, relevant to the current situation particularly the sections about bats. The organization and pace of the book is good. It’s a mix of information, interviews and the author’s experiences while observing the scientists at work. I usually don’t like author’s personal experiences in works like this, but since he focuses on the research itself it’s not too irritating. The writing is readable if a bit too snarky at times. The content is great. I learned a lot about viruses and the research behind figuring out pandemics. It’s all very interesting. This book exceeded my expectations.  So, I give this a 4. It’s mostly readable and always interesting with clear implications for the current situation.  "
271,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,3,"This holds a ton of information that is helpful to hold some specifics re virus infections that proceed to humans. But it's not completely upon the title material.In fact, the writing is well accomplished. It's often clear and better than some of the highly scientific particulars and nomenclatures of pure science reads (very dry) elsewhere. But as much as I can decide it DID make the reading easier than most material in this genre, it also holds another quality I thought was a considerable distraction from that positive prose form. Quammen has a kind of tone that's strange to read (it was for me) and quite difficult to describe. It's not Chicken Little on meth (or a hate rant like Gerta Thunberg either) but it's not a logical nor scientific bottom line ""norm"" either. If I'm overstating that, I'm sorry. But some of this assumption and oversight is just plain wrong when he tends to expand from ""one"" to ""some"" to ""all"". And it some cases it seems to me, that this emotive occludes to some of the very actual world reality of how MOST virus pass into pandemic outcomes. And how they did in the past, as well. Like the 1918 and the other human influenza forms that went lethal since. There are huge portions of this book that read like a memoir and travelogue. It's just not direct to the title at all, immense pages of asides/ tangents.The history of some of the worst spillovers (like Hendra or other bat vector virus) were the best and most accurate parts- and I am glad I read it for the understanding of how an intermediate ""amplify"" animal is also usually a HUGE part of the ""it depends"" serendipity that results in these horrific outcomes. First a small ""usual"" mammal, then a mid vector animal and then other species- such as monkeys/apes or humans.It's not a book I would necessarily recommend. His personality and slant, I just feel, is containing quite a bit of ""group think"" and not enough science. But now I do comprehend more easily the trail through 3 or 4 species this virus morph road can take."
272,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3230750-molly,5,"Thrilled to see that David Quammen had a new science book, I snatched this up. It’s been 15 years since his book ""Song of the Dodo” about island biogeography, which remains at the top of my favorite non-fiction. Can one *enjoy* a book about infectious disease? Anyone who's read Richard Preston's “The Hot Zone” will guiltily admit, yes (interestingly, he takes Preston to task for overplaying descriptions of Ebola infection. “Bleeding out"" is not accurate.)There is inherent narrative drama in the question of when the Next Big One (NBO) will hit and in the epidemiological sleuthing to identify viruses and their host animals when an epidemic breaks. What will turn a local outbreak into a pandemic? Do scientists think there IS a NBO lurking? Quite possibly. And if so, it will assuredly originate in animals, as has almost all human infectious disease. Influenza, SARS, Marburg, Lyme disease - Quammen covers them all and more, and turns up startling facts. For one, the subtitle of his book could just as well be, ""From Bats to Humans."" But what put the book over the top in excellence and dramatic page-turning was the penultimate chapter on the origin of AIDS. In some ways the whole book was moving toward this chapter. The origins of HIV can now be pinned to a year (much earlier than you’d think) and a single spillover event; chimp to human. And Quammen makes the poignant and chilling case that lest you wonder why we should care about exotic diseases such as Marbug, consider the exponential trajectory and devastation of AIDS. It too is a zoonotic disease, but one that has moved more slowly than an airborne NBO will surely do. Despite the theme – lively and buoyant writing. In other words, it’s readable. Quammen remains a master of science journalism. "
273,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/259402-sebastien,5,"Superb! David Quammen brings to life the stories of a wide variety of infectious diseases and their spillover from animals to humans. David is a great writer, his narrative drive and prose are magnificent. He does this while presenting the science in a very accessible yet amazingly informative way.What is astounding is the amount of work and research that must have gone into this book. David conducted a seemingly endless amount of interviews with scientists, researchers, doctors. To say he took it to the next level, well that is a vast understatement. This is science journalism/writing at its pinnacle.My particular favorite was the section on the ecology of borrelia (lyme). This is a subject that hits close to home for me.The section on malaria was very intriguing, learned a lot. The coolest thing was learning that a form of malaria had been used as therapy to treat syphilis (a form of therapy known as pyrotherapy). That blew my mind. If you're curious, here's an article on the subject: http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/bod...I was also fascinated by the HIV chapter. Could have done without his hypothesizing and reimagining of the original patient 0 story, I saw what he was trying to do, but that seemed a bit clunky and unnecessary. But that's a minor quibble with an otherwise outstanding book. Dang, the ebola chapter was incredible as well... so much good stuff in here."

Well, viruses and bacteria fascinate me and I'm piling up titles about the subject: Spillover is so far one of the best.

It is longer than most science/ medicine books, but do not let that deter you. I was extremely sad when this book ended. I wanted more!In the middle of reading this book, I made the mistake of putting this book on pause to read the more recent Pandemic by Sonia Shah. Science is obviously not the authors strong suit. It was extremely disappointing. It might fly with people who are less scientifically literate. She had more up to date info on Ebola, which might draw in a huge readership, but her book doesn't hold a candle to this book. Quammen's book is a big WOW, on every level. When I finally returned from Pandemic, I was in such a foul mood, it was detracting from my enjoyment of this book. That only lasted for a little bit. I could not help but get sucked right back into all of Quammen's case studies and histories of various outbreaks. This book was well researched, extremely thorough, scientifically sound, well written, and entertaining as hell. His passion for his subject spilled over into every page and into me. I do not even want to give a summary of all the wonder inside this book because he tells the story of each virus so well, anything I would relate here feels like an actual spoiler. It is a must read!

277,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4739424-mal-warwick,5,"Where Do ""Emerging Diseases"" Emerge From?AIDS, Ebola, Marburg, SARS, H5N1 — every one of the world’s scariest diseases is a “zoonosis,” that is, a virus harbored by animals and transmitted to humans, often by other animals, in a complex minuet that often stretches out into decades.AIDS, for example. According to the latest research, reported by David Quammen in Spillover, Patient Zero was not that French-Canadian flight attendant you may have read about who went amok in the 1970s but a hunter in Southeast Cameroon around 1908 who killed a chimpanzee and somehow unwittingly allowed the animal’s blood to seep into his own circulatory system, either through a cut or by eating his prey’s raw flesh. This is the phenomenon that epidemiologists call “spillover.” At that point, a particularly virulent form of a recently emergent simian virus found a friendly and familiar environment in the hunter’s blood and flourished, becoming what we know today as HIV-1 (the more lethal form of the virus that causes AIDS). Later, the hunter passed along the virus to one or more women through sexual contact, and the disease slowly spread, both by sex and by transmission through reused needles, undetected as anything out of the ordinary, from Cameroon into what is now called the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and other sub-Saharan countries, and thence by happenstance to Haiti. It was a Haitian harboring HIV-1 who probably passed it along to that notorious Canadian flight attendant, setting off the epidemic among gay men in North America.In Spillover, Quammen tells tales like these in fascinating detail, relating the stories of the often-heroic scientists, physicians, and veterinarians who worked directly with deadly diseases, occasionally at the cost of their own lives. Quammen spent years writing this book. He appears to have read all the relevant scientific literature, attended specialized scientific conferences, and spent long hours tracking down and speaking face-to-face with the people who discovered these diseases, isolated the viruses, first treated the symptoms, and labored for thankless years on end in laboratories around the world to help humanity avert the next pandemic.You may have read Richard Preston’s best-selling 2001 treatment of the emergence of Ebola in The Hot Zone. If not, I can tell you that I vividly recall the book because it was so dramatic, and so terrifying. No doubt I had nightmares about contracting Ebola. But it turns out, according to Quammen and to the eminent scientists he interviewed, that Preston’s account was sensationalized and highly inaccurate in essential details. For example, he described tears of blood, massive hemorrhages, and melted internal organs, none of which has any basis in fact.However, Spillover, in its own way, is no less frightening. Quammen advances the popular theory that what appears to be the accelerating emergence of dangerous new pathogens became inevitable as a result of the enormous population growth of homo sapiens — because humanity has increasingly encroached on animal habitat and come into intimate contact with animals as never before. In discussions with noted biologists, he explores the concept of “breakout,” the explosive growth frequently seen in some animal species that shortly leads to sudden, catastrophic — through disease. He intimates that, with AIDS — or, all too possibly, with the next pandemic — humankind may experience something similar. Despite all the horrific details about AIDS, Ebola, Marburg, and the like, these are the book’s scariest passages.David Quammen writes about science, nature, and travel — a total of 10 nonfiction books and five novels to date. A former Rhodes Scholar, he was educated at Yale and Oxford.(From www.malwarwickonbooks.com)"
278,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58119141-elena-sala,5,"SPILLOVER: ANIMAL INFECTIONS AND THE NEXT HUMAN PANDEMIC (2012) was the result of David Quammen's five years of research interviewing scientists who were looking into the possibility of another horrific Ebola-type disease emerging. At that time, believe it or not, there was a widespread consensus: there would indeed be a new disease, likely from the coronavirus family, coming out of a bat, and it would likely emerge in or around a wet market in China. So, how could the world be SO unprepared for this nightmarish pandemic?? This book was written 8 years before this pandemic so it does not attempt to answer this question. Though we can probably guess some possible answers.This book is about zoonoses, infectious diseases that originate in animals and spread to humans. Rabies, for example, is a zoonotic disease. HIV is also a zoonotic disease. Dengue, yellow fever, malaria, influenza, Lyme disease, MERS, SARS, Zika and COVID are all zoonoses. The technical term scientists use to describe the leap of a pathogen from one animal to another is “spillover”. Most infections start as spillovers. Some, like Ebola and lesser-known viral diseases (Nipah, Hendra, Marburg), are highly transmissible and virulent, but so far have been limited to sporadic outbreaks. They persist because they are endemic in a reservoir population through a process of mutual adaptation.Quammen explores the correlation between these diseases that come up one after the other. It should not come as a surprise that they are not mere accidents but unwanted consequences of our actions. How do these pathogens make the leap from animals to humans? Quammen's answer: ""we invade tropical forests and other wild landscapes, which harbor so many species of animals and plants. And within those creatures, so many viruses. We cut the trees, we kill the animals or cage them and send them to markets. We disrupt ecosystems and we shake viruses loose from their natural hosts. When that happens, they need a new host. Often, we are it.” And why does this seem to be happening more frequently in recent times? The answer, again in Quammen's own words is: ""there’s 7.8 billion of us on this planet—four times the number of humans at the time of the 1918 influenza. And we have quadrupled the speed we travel around the planet; we have quadrupled the size of some of our cities. So there are a lot more of us large-bodied vertebrate animals, living in dense aggregations, moving fluidly from one place to another... We’re the world’s greatest target for a virus—a great ecosystem for them to colonize. So when a virus does get into a human and finds it can replicate and transmit to the next human, that virus has opened the door to vast opportunity.""Quammen's journeys have taken him all around the world: inside the air-locked sterility of high-security biological research labs, through the crowded alleyways of Chinese live animal markets, into remote African and Asian villages that have experienced outbreaks of some of the most lethal diseases yet known to mankind. He has interviewed survivors of these diseases and the scientists doing all the research. He has been a science writer for over 35 years, interested in ecology and evolutionary biology. He uses a conversational tone and, occasionally, some dark humor to give a frightening and eye opening summary of all that is known about these zoonotic diseases. This is a book I highly recommend, not only because it is written in an engaging and accessible way, sober, rational yet suspenseful, but because it is clear that COVID will not be the last pandemic we will see. There will be more zoonoses because we are disrupting the environment more and more. So we need to think about our own responsibility and how we relate to our environment. Each one of us has a responsibility, because we are all consumers of food, resources, and energy. Each of the choices that we make about what we’re going to eat, wear, or buy draws on these wild ecosystems. This book invites the reader to think about these choices while explaining how we got into this mess in the first place."

It would be really hard at this point to not know about Coronavirus and the pandemic it caused and its likely source from animals (probably bats). This has been a problem we have been aware of for quite some time with flu strains and aids, and Lyme disease, and zika virus, and ebola, and Marburg virus the list goes on. Only now the point is hammered home in a pandemic and a world-historical economic crisis. Some of us knew better but as usual, people didn't heed the warnings. They almost never do."

These microorganisms are hardy, smart and incredibly adaptable when it comes to the question of how to survive and thrive among the biodiversity of the earth. If you were to romanticize the whole concept then it becomes very easy to paint the pathogen as the most dreaded enemy of mankind/ nature’s revenge on us etc. However, a rational perspective tells a story which is entirely different and utterly fascinating in a deadly way. The microorganism’s capability to jump across species to man and thereby begin devastating outbreaks is the premise of the book and the scientific term for such a happening is Zoonosis. In the words of the author about the need of such a book :  Why obsess about Zoonoses ? In the larger balance of miseries, what makes anyone think they should be taken so seriously ? It’s a fair question but there are good answers. Some of those answers are intricate and speculative. Some are subjective. Others are objective and blunt. The bluntest is this : AIDS. Let’s look at some zoonotic diseases other than AIDS : Ebola, Marburg, Avian and Swine Flu, SARS, Malaria, Hendra are but a few of them. All of these are without doubt some of the deadliest killer that we have encountered. David Quammen does a book length investigation into the history, nature and where we stand in the understanding of the microorganisms which cause these diseases. Quammen’s writing style is approachable and far less sensational than what I encountered with Richard Preston’s Hot Zone. While Preston horrified and thrilled me, Quammen offers a more informative and grounded view at the pathogens and their effects. He also travels far and wide for his research and converses with recovered patients, eyewitnesses, doctors and scientists and ergo a much more well-rounded view of what actually transpires during a disease outbreak comes to light. Of special mention is the chapter named The Chimp and River which is an in depth detective story that traces the journey of HIV from the jungles of Africa into the world at large. There are two things about the book that really caught my attention : • The number of mice and monkeys that die in the name of betterment and advancement of science in this book is huge. There were times when I paused and wondered if more of these hapless animals perish than humans.• Quammen is a first rate travel writer. His descriptions of Asia and Africa are measured views of anthropology, wildlife and the inevitable clash between the two.Parts of the book especially on the mathematical connects between the nature of mass outbreaks and about the lifecycles of viruses were difficult to comprehend. But that aside this is a fantastic book to understand how much nature has in store which man has no idea of. It also corrected for me the notion that nature uses viruses to eventually get back at humans ( courtesy Richard Preston). A virus is a non-thinking organism and one for which in a majority of the cases, a human host is next to an evolutionary dead end. It just so happens that with our invasive lifestyle, we breach the habitats of the virus and get caught in their snares.Recommended."

Spillover was amazingly informative, had a near perfect execution, explained very difficult, scientific subjects in a manner that a reader with little science background could understand without making it so dumbed down that the same reader found themselves lost in a nexus of weakening metaphors and feeling insulted (I'm looking at you, Winchester). This is how you speak to your audience! You do not dumbdown, but rather heighten the discourse and inform. I learned so much, and was so in awe of what I was learning, and the research that was done by Quammen, and even more by the researching actively trying to save us from the ""Next Big One"" that nightly over dinner I'd tell my husband excitedly that he just HAD to read Spillover, because did you know this or that about ebola? Its the only audiobook that I have honestly considered restarting immediately. There is just so much to process here, so much that I realize I just didn't know, and so much more that I could learn from a second reading.This is a book that I think every person should read. There is as much (if not more) human interest as science, it can honestly keep you on the edge of your seat. I love nature, but it can be such a scary place without considering that maybe you just inhaled infected bat shit or dust from an aborted goat. But its also a beautiful place, where ecology matters, where there is balance, and as the eruption of human population continues (presumably unchecked for now) that balance is disturbed. I cannot stress enough, especially during this election cycle, how important an informed populace is. How can we make decisions in domestic protection, how we raise our livestock, how we tour, how we travel across the globe, how we transport EVERYTHING, how we mine, and how we manufacture if we are not informed of the consequences and the possible dangers of what we are doing. I'm not crazy, I'm not saying lets halt the world, but we need to understand that its not just about global warming, when ecologists are warning us of what we are doing to the planet. We have rapidly interconnected this world in a way that has never before happened. There are risks and benefits to that. Scientists are trying to study and prepare for the next big one, but should the unthinkable happen (its not unthinkable, its more that we refuse to think of it) how are we, as a populace, prepared to respond? We need to consider this.And, man, wash your hands if you butcher something, okay?"
282,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/60209410-jordan-buckley,4,"Good information on zoonotic diseases (diseases that live in animal hosts and can spread to humans), which are pretty relevant at the moment because COVID-19 is believed to be one. Many major diseases are zoonoses or started that way, including HIV, Ebola, rabies, Lyme disease, SARS, swine flu, etc.There were a few major takeaways for me. You can't eradicate a zoonotic disease if it's still silently thriving in some animal population (""reservoir host""). The pathogen may just live happily in one or more animal species without causing any obvious symptoms, but could be deadly if it infects humans. The other big takeaway is that human civilization and activity is often what unearths these diseases or gives them the opportunity to thrive. As we expand we move into forests and come into contact with animals that may carry all kinds of unknown pathogens. Our new methods of factory farming and cramming animals together in their own excrement creates new opportunities for these things to thrive and spread. Tragedies like the current pandemic aren't just ""acts of God"" that we have no control over; they are brought on by our own activity.Like most nonfiction books I read, I wish it was much shorter. The author does a good job of making it interesting, but I could have done without so much of the breathless recounting of the journalist's search for truth, tracking down different hypotheses, biographical descriptions of the various interviewees, the fanciful hypothetical story of the imagined ""voyager"" who brought HIV out of the jungle and into human civilization. The story of the SARS outbreak was interesting for comparison to COVID-19, and it was notable to see coronaviruses mentioned repeatedly among other candidates as a risk for the next pandemic."

Super, super relevant right now, and from my memory this book references EEE, though don't quote me. *Review*First things first. I hate when I look at a nonfiction book table of contents and can’t tell by the name of the chapters what they cover. For those who feel the same, here is the annotated table of contents:I. Pale Horse (Hendra virus)II. Thirteen Gorillas (Ebola virus)III. Everything Comes From Somewhere (Malaria)IV. Dinner at the Rat Farm (SARS)V. The Deer, the Parrot, & the Kid Next Door (Q Fever, Psittacosis, and Lyme disease)VI. Going Viral (General Virus Stuff, but Especially HIV)VII. Celestial Hosts (About Animals That Transmit Disease, Especially Bats, and Also Focuses on the Nipah virus)VIII. The Chimp and The River (HIV)IX. It Depends (Viruses of the Future)Onto the review.I wasn’t thinking about it when I snagged it at the library, but this was the perfect book to follow up The Hot Zone (and, in fact, this book references that one). That was a concentrated, focused look at one distinct family of viruses, the filoviruses. It was also more dramatized. This one takes that zoomed-in look and contextualizes it. Reminds us that 60% of all infections diseases that affect humans come from animals via zoonosis. Ebola, Marburg (the stars of The Hot Zone), rabies, hantavirus, anthrax, Lassa, Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, dengue, west nile, sars, typhus, mad cow disease, all forms of influenza, bubonic plague, Lyme disease, AIDS, and countless more. The author also points out something interesting- the diseases we’ve mostly eradicated, like smallpox and polio, are the rare ones that aren’t passed to humans by animals. That’s why we were able to eradicate them. People are easier to keep track of and vaccinate than animals. Nowhere for them to hide. Whereas Marburg or Ebola can lurk forever in hidden corners of caves, immortal. And why are these diseases popping up now? Practically all of these zoonotic (species-hopping) diseases are new. Like, zoonotic diseases barely existed at all before the 1960s, after which they started popping up everywhere in myriad forms. Why? Because we’re tearing apart ecosystems, breaking down the natural fabric of things, spreading ourselves where we ought not be a-spreadin’. These diseases had their natural hosts. They didn’t kill the hosts, they mostly lived in harmony with the host in some remote corner of the world. But when we wreck that natural host’s home and kill lots of them off, what’s a virus to do but to jump ship and latch onto humans if it wants to survive? Finally, I’d like to thank David Quammen for summarizing my feelings on life nicely: “Mathematics to me is like a language I don’t speak, though I admire its literature in translation.”"
286,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,5,"I try not to read books that make me paranoid or hypochondriac — and that's not the intention of this book — but I'll think twice next time that I'm in some exotic place and close to wild animals. The Monkey Forest in Bali was mentioned in this book in relation to herpes B (a deadly disease caused by a spillover from macaques monkeys to humans). Thanks goodness I feel a visceral revulsion towards monkeys. I didn't hand-feed any or let them climb up my head and shoulders so that I can take a picture with them. A little bite or scratch from the wrong monkey could seal your death sentence. This is a very well-researched, well-written, and highly-informative book on zoonosis — a pathogen leaping from an animal to humans. There have been recent scares with diseases like SARS and bird flu and swine flu that caused relatively limited damage and were contained. But you can never underestimate the danger of the Next Big One. We shouldn't forget that the Spanish flu at the end of the World War I killed by far more people than the war. As Quammen says, if you think we shouldn't concern ourselves too much with a local outbreak of an exotic disease like ebola that is caused by starving villagers in a remote corner of Congo eating a rotten dead chimp, the answer is: AIDS.The most interesting chapter of the book is the chapter on AIDS, which reads like a detective story. Here's the spoiler: the HIV virus first jumped from chimps to humans (quite likely when a hunter was butchering an infected chimp) somewhere in southeast Cameroon some time around 1908. What it was doing between then and the early 1980's when it became a global pandemic that has so far killed an estimated 35 million people is a fascinating story. "
287,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,2,"Spillover is a well-written bio-thriller in the tradition of The Hot Zone, etc. It rehashes the same misleading theme of scary monster viruses waiting out there in the bushes to kill us all. It is good if you want a horror story, not if you want useful, accurate science about public health. As the subtitle indicates, it is focused on the hypothetical ""Next Big One"" but misses the point about what caused the actual Great Pandemic of 1918, repeating boilerplate nonsense about gene shifts etc. The demonstrably false idea that reassortment of the Hs and Ns in influenza virus is why you get a deadly pandemic is what caused the panics in 1976 and 2009 over the shift to H1N1. Both times there was no deadly pandemic. In 1976, the needless panic actually killed a bunch of people with a bad vaccine. In 2009, it cost billions and billions of dollars and created tremendous emotional stress for no apparent benefit. This is pretty obvious stuff. So why act as if nobody knows this and repeat old nonsense about what causes pandemics? The difference between a mild flu and a deadly one that kills 50 million people is not a reassortment of the genes. This is known. So what is the difference and how do we make germs be mild instead of lethal? That is a very important question, but you won't find the answer in this book. If you are interested in exploring this question, you may want to look at the TED talk by Paul Ewald: http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_ewald_a...."

It is scary, sure, because there are always new microbes out there ready to go rampaging through our vast society. It is also rather comforting, both the methodical search for vectors and reservoirs, the details of transmission and treatment, the stream of breakthroughs that enable researchers to locate and sequence. And through it all, Quammen maintains a casual, light conversational tone, reassuring the reader that sure, horrible new diseases can (and will) spring up seemingly out of nowhere to spread around the world, but that also we have been pretty good at controlling those sorts of outbreaks.There's quite a lot about Ebola here, written before this summer's outbreak. It should prove very comforting to everyone whose loved ones are not currently infected. I heap praise upon him for pointing out that it isn't nearly as grotesque as Preston painted it in The Hot Zone.The only part I really disliked was the pure fiction of The Voyager, which was too long and added nothing. This was particularly annoying as I was nearing the end and racing to finish quickly before the future biologist usurped in entirely.Library copyI don't usually comment on covers, but I will say that Chip Kidd managed to make a very disturbing one."

David Quammen convincingly argues that the greatest bugaboo for the human race should be a zoonosis, an infectious disease that spills over from an animal population into humans. He travels around the world and talks to scientists who have worked in the virus-riddled trenches of HIV, malaria, Ebola, SARS, and an ever-growing list of other nasties with shocking fatality rates. Particularly interesting is Quammen's notion that the historical rate of human population growth is itself an outbreak. We've proliferated like mad - at a speed unprecedented for a large mammal species. And what scientists know about outbreaks is that they always come to an end... While layman accessible, this detailed and hefty book takes perseverance, but it's well worth it for the amount of information you'll get in return. I'm going to go wash my hands now.

Back to my original review:Zoonotic pathogens, those that travel from other animals to human animals, have been with us, will be with us, have killed millions of people, will kill millions more. I read half of this book on the topic and got really really bored. Each chapter was ""And here's another example"" ""and here's yet another example."" He tried to spice that up with turning searching for the animal source of the pathogen into a mystery and by getting personal about the researchers (that is, applying fictional techniques to non fiction), but it couldn't disguise for me that it was all ""and here's another example."" I got the point by page 100. So I got past page 300 and then skimmed the rest. It's not badly written...it just got a bit boring for me.Here's the take-away advice I gleaned:1) Try to calm down. That zoonosis exists is largely beyond your control.2) To the extent you can control things: first, quit overbreeding. Overbreeding leads to human encroachment upon ecosystems where disease has happily been at equilibrium for tens of thousands of years. Overbreeding is awful for many reasons, but if you needed another, well, here's another. Overbreeders are bad world citizens.3) Don't, for heaven's sake, eat unusual game meat, particularly not game you find mysteriously dead on the ground with blood around its mouth. Also, glove/mask when treating sick domestic animals, yes, even beloved Fluffy, and when Fluffy does succumb, avoid kissing her bloody muzzle goodbye.4) Be rich and insured and ideally connected to the government in a first world country--not only can you buy farmed/ranched meat that's inspected and safe, if you do get sick, you'll get the best treatment available.5) That 33% of Americans aren't insured means the coming pandemic is going to be worse and spread faster and kill more here than in civilized countries where all citizens have access to health care. Not his point in the first 300 pages, but any thinking person can see it.6) Commercial airliners are really that dangerous for spreading disease--avoid if you can and rethink what ""vacation"" means to you. Sure, any given flight probably won't next Patient X on it...but it might. Is it really that important to board that plane?7) Religion helps spread pandemics because people pray and wallow in superstition instead of of getting treatment. When the next epidemic comes, pray/chant/positive-think/sacrifice a goat all you want, but not in a crowd, and get treatment, too."

He weaves narrative storytelling and science seamlessly like its the easiest thing ever. That's the source of the overall brilliance of the book. Quammen manages to use his own personal experiences with disease scientists at the centre of the research and others in the thick of things to make the book more entertaining. Billy Karesh studying chimps in Moba Bai, Beatrice Hahn at the heart of AIDS research, Engel and Jones-Engel a husband and wife team from New York investigating prevalence of a monkey virus in Bangladesh temples, a Chinese scientist searching for the reservoir of SARS, an Australian vet who survived the Hendra virus, etcThe book is basically about how animal diseases jump or spillover into humans. He narrates how these diseases, commonly classified as zoonoses first appeared on the scene and how people react to these diseases in the beginning, how scientific research unfolded and how they escalated into global epidemics in some cases. He also discusses the tiny pathogens responsible and their evolution into killer monsters. He deals with a long list of deadly diseases like Hendra, Ebola, malaria, AIDS, Lyme disease, Q fever, SARS, etc. All dangerous and potentially lethal bugs if not dealt with properly. A few themes appear throughout the book. One of them is how humans interfere with nature, eat what they are not supposed to or encroach on wild habitats. It's clear we are having more contact with animals, both domestic and wild, and this is one of the reasons why certain diseases have spilled over into humans. And also why in the future probably more lethal pathogens will spill over. As humans, we need to understand the nature of ecosystems better and try not to interfere with wildlife habitats. These diseases have killed millions and millions of people and it's clear that these bugs especially viruses have the upper hand over us and we should be weary of the potential devastation involved. Zoonotic diseases will continue to spill over in future. But how ling before we come across a pathogen capable of annihilating all of humankind?"

Quammen manages to make it understandable and compelling all at the same time. He helps the reader to understand the seriousness of the topic - and it is really serious -- without feeling alarmist. The book was published in 2012, so well before our current pandemic. After reading this, I feel much better equipped to decipher and understand the current reporting on COVID - 19, to make more educated decisions about what I am seeing on my news feed, to know when to be skeptical, and what my role can be in minimizing risk and spread (significant in all viruses with human to human transmission). I highly recommend this book if you want to understand more about viruses - their impact, their trajectory, and our options. With something as serious as what we are currently facing, I wanted more information that newspaper headlines and I wanted it to be, as much as possible, free from the political positioning -- just give me the science and the history so I can improve my context.

There are so many facts here, it's a little overwhelming -- I learned so much that I'd never even thought of before, including the fact that HIV can actually be traced back to, wait for it . . . 1908?! Yeah, I didn't believe it at first, either, but the author clearly presents this in a way that is easy even for a non-scientist like myself to understand.After reading this, I can tell you for sure that I will NEVER go anywhere near a bat again -- these beautiful animals are apparently THE virus clearinghouse, for reasons that are explored in depth in this book.Ever wonder why we were able to effectively eradicate smallpox, but can't seem to put an end to malaria? Yep, it's in here.Here are a couple of quotes from the end of the book that I found interesting:""So before we respond either calmly or hysterically, either intelligently or doltishly, we should understand in some measure the basic outlines and dynamics of the situation. We should appreciate that these recent outbreaks of new zoonotic diseases, as well as the recurrence and spread of old ones, are part of a larger pattern, and that humanity is responsible for generating that pattern. We should recognize that they reflect things that we're DOING, not just things that are HAPPENING to us. WE should understand that, although some of the human-caused factors may seem virtually inexorable, others are within our control.""""That's the salubrious thing about zoonotic diseases: They remind us, as St. Francis did, that we humans are inseparable from the natural world. In fact, there IS no ""natural world,"" it's a bad and artificial phrase. There is only the world."""" . . . Dwyer's models have shown that heterogeneity of behavior, even among forest insects, let alone among humans, can be very important in damping the spread of infectious disease. . . . individual effort, individual discernment, individual choice can have huge effects in averting the catastrophes that might otherwise sweep through a herd. An individual gypsy moth may inherit a slightly superior ability to avoid smears of NPV as it grazes on a leaf. An individual human may choose not to drink the palm sap, not to eat the chimpanzee, not to pen the pig beneath mango trees, not to clear the horse's windpipe with his bare hand, not to have unprotected sex with the prostitute, not to share the needle in a shooting gallery, not to cough without covering her mouth, not to board a plane while feeling ill, or not to coop his chickens along with his ducks. ""Any tiny little thing that people do,"" Dwyer said, if it makes them different from one another, from the idealized standard of herd behavior, ""is going to reduce infection rates."" ""So why only three stars? David Quammen -- I wanted to add his author link right there, but GR won't let me, but go look him up because he's written a ton of interesting books -- is more than capable of writing a non-fiction book that would hold anyone's interest, yet he insists on inserting some extremely long passages of pure fiction as he speculates on the exact circumstances leading to the emergence of HIV-1. My husband will tell you, I'm more of a ""just the facts"" kind of person -- I neither need nor want speculation, especially when the facts are compelling on their own.

296,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily,4,"This book is about zoonoses--illnesses that spread from animals to people. It describes the typical process: the virus or bacteria lives, long-term and harmlessly, in a reservoir species. When it infects an amplifier species, it can spread more quickly to humans. For example, the Hendra virus has its reservoir in flying foxes (large Australian bats), but when it infects horses, it can spread to people, who are in much closer contact with their sick horses than with bats. Not only are zoonoses threatening because new ones can appear unexpectedly (like SARS or HIV), they are also essentially impossible to eradicate, unlike (say) polio, which is only found in humans, whom you can vaccinate. Bats come off rather badly in this book. In the past, I've learned that you should like them because they eat harmful insects. It turns out that they are the source of all sorts of nasty bugs, in the virus sense of the word.Quammen writes quite a bit about his travels to research the book, or how one scientist introduces him to another. Not only does this give the book a bit of a travelogue feeling, it also acknowledges the essential contributions of the people who tranquilize angry macaques or go out in the middle of the night to rig up bat nets--without which none of the science would have happened. His style is vivid and entertaining, though there's one passage in the chapter about HIV/AIDS that is strangely novelistic. Not bad, just incongruous and unnecessary.Nothing in this book will make you change your behavior, unless you are remiss about handwashing or routinely eat things bats have shat on. At the end the author emphasizes: ""The purpose of this book is not to make you more worried. The purpose of this book is to make you more smart. That's what most distinguishes humans from, say, tent caterpillars and gypsy moths. Unlike them, we can be pretty smart."" I didn't find this book particularly scary--just informative--so don't avoid it just on those grounds.To the extent it contains a call to action, the book reminds us that human pressure on ecological systems creates havoc. A relatively short section deals with Lyme disease and reveals the startling conclusion that Lyme flourishes in isolated areas. Think the islands in a parking lot rather than a forest. It's where we come in contact with ecologies that we've disrupted that we find zoonoses.P.S. Bonus points for sending me to the dictionary: ""cadastral.""P.P.S. Further bonus points for this sentence, even if the sentiment isn't new: ""[A]nyone who favors Intelligent Design in lieu of evolution might pause to wonder why God devoted so much of His intelligence to designing malarial parasites."""
297,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1182891-sue,5,"This book is a gripping tale of disease “spillover” that will thrill those interested in science – and probably many who aren’t. After all, we all get sick occasionally. Quammen looks at the ways pathogens (usually viruses) have spilled from animals to humans. He traces the origins of, among others, Ebola, SARS, bird flu, Lyme disease, and AIDS. These zoonotic diseases can escalate rapidly into global pandemics when human-to-human transmission occurs. For five years Quammen trailed scientists in their labs and in the field. Worldwide exchange of information turns out to be essential in epidemiology, and the solution to mysterious epidemics often means gathering data in far-flung places. Quammen himself traveled to China, to Bangladesh, to the Congo, to Connecticut. Data moves among such places, and so did the author. Everywhere there is mystery, drama, and good science.A long chapter (more than 20% of the book) traces the origins of HIV to a chimpanzee in Cameroon in the early 20th century. It’s a fascinating story. The author first tracked the evidence, working with scientists as they examined tissue samples that showed the spillover to be not in the 1980s, when the Western world first encountered it, but in the first decade of the 20th century. Quammen then allowed himself to think through a possible scenario which would have brought the virus down river to the Congo, initially moving slowly because its carriers might have died early of other causes, because the virus moved through areas of low population density, because it did not yet have the opportunity afforded by global travel and multiple sex partners.Ten years ago I had to abort a trip to Vietnam and China because of SARS, so the episode was very personal to me. That dread virus ran a deadly but short course. It turned out that the disease was transmissible after the person became ill, so it was eventually within the power of the health system to halt the spread. But it could reemerge. Civets, a diet delicacy blamed initially for the disease, turned out to be “amplifier” hosts but not “reservoir” hosts. This latter term applies to animals who host and live amicably with a virus which may cause great mischief in humans. For SARS, the reservoir was a bat, the amplifier was a civet, and the human who ate the civet was an unlucky, violently ill person. In fact, the eating of exotic (and often illegal) meats was a persistent theme in the entire book.As a non-scientist, I’ve possibly gotten a couple of things wrong in this review. Apologies. But I am pretty sure I’m going to be paying attention to the news about epidemics – as well as to, for example, ticks or exotic meats."
298,0393346617,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17766893-matty-swytla,5,"A very good bok with scientific, yet approachable explanations to why zoonoses (animal diseases that infect humans) are so scary and deadly, especially when it comes to certain new viruses. The fact is zoonotic viruses and other diseases infect humans on a regular basis. I know; I was infected with ringworm (Dermatophytosis) by my kittens a few years ago - it's a fungal infection that spreads like fire. No fun but no biggie either. But any pet owner knows the drill on vaccinations for rabies and other diseases for dogs and cats. Some of these make the jump to humans with devastating results.The differences between carriers, natural reservoirs, and amplifiers is fascinating and illuminating. Some animals only spread viruses, bacteria or other illness-inducing organisms (mosquitoes for malaria); others live with them, a certain population of infected yet not very ill reservoirs from whence other animals and humans can get infected (bats, monkeys); while some animals get very ill and spread the infections further (amplifiers - often some domestic animals like pigs or poultry). It's important to make the distinction bewteen these or we won't know where to fight the disease in the first place. The book highlights why we should care about natural habitats, treat our animals with care, and not board a plane when feeling sick (!), but it doesn't fear-monger in any way. Yes, it does point out what people should or shouldn't do, what are the risk factors for contracting some exotic diseases, but it also highlights that ordinary diseases kill far more people than ebola, for example. Coronary disease, cancers, diabetes, traffic accidents... familiar killers we've gotten used to don't scare us as they should, while the thought of contracting a virus from a bat makes some people fear them like the plague. What the author makes clear time and time again is that local farmers in some god-forsaken parts of third-world countries (but in the West as well - not everyone is an epidemiologist or veterinarian) can't understand the full impact of an outbreak among their flock before it spreads. So education is key, and fast response from laboratories, research facilites, and medical institutions. I was amazed how much difference fast cooperation among scientists and medical doctors makes in terms of outbreak containment. Why doesn't the media highlight these achievements more and make people interested in science? What will it take? The next big virus or outbreak is just around the corner - it may be our ordinary flu not ebola."
