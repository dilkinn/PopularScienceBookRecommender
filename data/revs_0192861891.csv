0,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/368200-nathan,5,"Michio Kaku apparently spent his childhood building super-colliders in his parents' garage. It paid off. He's clearly brilliant, and best of all, he's not lost his imagination. One sad fact of modern physicists is that precious few of them have any imagination, and are incapable of thought experiments and relative flights of fantasy. As Kaku has pointed out, fantasy fueled more great discoveries in science than pure science ever did on its own. In this book he uses what we know about quantum physics to explore possibilities formerly relegated exclusively to science fiction. In doing so, he should be admired. He is merely asking us to consider what some great minds in both literature and physics have imagined, and in doing so, manages to make what we do know seem almost simple by showing us how much we truly don't know. He's amazingly talented, imaginative, and best of all, he knows his math. He also knows how to use that math to dream of what's possible. An absolutely fun book to read.NC"

It is a really good crash course on just what the hell Quantum, String, Unified Field Theory ad Superstring actually are. Lays down the history and concepts in a way that makes sense and makes you get it.Particularly savvy readers will start making the other logical leaps. If we are thinking energy vibrating along a 10-dimensional string, what does that say about the frequency of sentience in the universe? Since energy can't go anywhere and sentience is a factor of energy, what the hell really does happen to us when we die?Enjoy your trip down the rabbit hole."
2,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45364364-kelvin,1,"DNF at chapter 10. It was a bit too dry and technical for me. While the chapter names were intriguing and there were interesting anecdotes in each chapter, it was still slightly too boring, even with the pictures, for me to read into and understand the developments of modern physics. There wasn't much holding it together, i.e. the book only follows the overthrow of each theory as its organizing structure. It also seemed to ramble on with analogies that weren't that great to follow, eg the wood vs marble and flatland comparisons. Though I'm sure that Michio Kaku is quite knowledgable about the theories mentioned in the book (as evidenced by his other books) I expected this book to be more in story form like Flatterland and thus easier to read. Overall, this book was just disappointing for me. I expected it to be a fun and informative telling of the evolution of dimensional theories but ended up getting a book that was difficult to read and closer to a paper than novel."

4,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1846986-kesseljunkie,2,"It was OK just because the science fiction at the end was a lot of fun.Dr. Kaku alternates through two styles -- talking to the reader like they're completely stupid and then talking to them like they've taken a college physics class. I'm neither, I understood what he was writing, and was just insulted. The cornerstone of Hyperspace theory is that there were 10 dimensions for a fraction of a fraction of time in the first fraction of time of existence for this universe, but 6 of them probably don't exist since. Um, so there aren't 10 dimensions -- there might have been. And then the whole premise is that I should accept the premises in the book even though he acknowledges there may never be proof? And the difference between this and religion is....oh, I see, there is none. Fifth dimensional beings could exist, but not God? Interesting assertion. So long as we're just accepting things on faith, let me toss this one out there: God is a 5th dimensional being.But of course, it's sexy to act like you're smart -- and when someone like Dr. Kaku publishes a sexy bit of science fiction and calls it researched science, everyone's afraid to look like they don't ""get it."" It's like living in a Rand novel. It's OK to call bullsh*t on someone in the sciences, people. And in this instance, I do."
5,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/227682-steve,5,"If you've thought science is dull or perhaps too far beyond you, then please meet Michio Kaku. He writes about theoretical physics in a way that will fill you with wonder and possibility. He takes what would otherwise be very complex concepts and conveys them using metaphors that every average joe can understand. The number of a-ha moments I had reading this book were too many to count. What a terrific read."
6,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1287856-david,3,"Started strong. An introduction to non-Euclidian geometry, string theory, and related concepts. Made me fantasize about learning the math. Got more and more speculative toward the end, and not so interestingly so. Like many books, this one would have been improved by a ruthless editor. Still, worth a read if the topic interests you. "
7,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/477898-shawna,4,"This is one of the popular science books that got me so interested in doing physics in the first place. Accessible to me before I even took a physics class, it should be accessible to most anyone with interest. Very interesting questions raised about space and time/parallel universes/etc. New ideas (as of date published: 1994) are discussed in a non-technical way. Also, very well written and easy to read (with humor and everything!)."
8,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7289539-rich-paz,5,I am now officially a Michio Kaku fan. This book explains physics as it should be taught in school. His simplistic approach begs the reader for more information. I also love physics now because I understand it a lot more thanks to Mr. Kaku's books. The school systems should think about this book as part of their cirriculum to teach the importance of understanding physics. Highly recommended.
9,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18218857-marc,4,"Michio Kaku makes some amazingly complex and mind-bending concepts accessible to the lay reader (i.e., me, and maybe you, too, if you're also not a physicist). He sprinkles the book with entertaining and informative anecdotes and his passion for the topic is infectious. Still, I shudder to think that no author ever addresses Schr√∂dinger's ailurophobia. Here's hoping the 6-dimensional universe opens up just as this one closes!"

It's a bit dated, as it was written in the 1990s, but I wanted to start with some of Kaku's earliest works to get a solid foundation of the concepts in here, before moving to his more recent books.Hyperspace has left my mind buzzing with possibilities, with the wonder of the universe, as it took me through concepts like quantum physics, string theory, and higher dimensions.This has been rewarding as a theoretical physics fan, and inspiring as a science fiction writer.I'm excited to read Kaku's next book. It's already sitting on my shelf! üòåThis was my first hardcore science book, but it definitely won't be the last. :)))"

In fact, according to this theory, matter is nothing but the harmonies created by this vibrating string. Since there are an infinite number of harmonies that can be composed for the violin, there are an infinite number of forms of matter that can be constructed out of vibrating strings. This explains the richness of the particles in nature. Likewise, the laws of physics can be compared to the laws of harmony allowed on the string. The universe itself, composed of countless vibrating strings, would then be comparable to a symphony.‚Äù"
13,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1335294-ricardo,3,"It's up there, though not as accessible, as Hawking's ""A Brief History of Time"" and ""The Universe in a Nutshell"". Dr. Kaku does spend a considerable time walking the reader through how the theories of space-time and hyperspace arose and some of the historical and more mathematical stuff can be a little dense. However, the book opens really nicely with very vivid and amazing explanations of just how freaky hyperspace can be as well as the implications for the world of physics. The book also ends really well with how hyperspace can tell us something about how the universe will end as well as how it may help us, if we're still around, at that time as well as how to build a time machine and the potential evolution of an intelligent species into one capable of manipulating time and space.I imagine his other book ""Physics of The Impossible"" which focuses more on trying to explain with physics for well-known sci-fi concepts would be as good as the beginning and end of this book. However, if you find that kind of topic, theoretical physics, black holes, time travel, 10 dimensional space, then I would recommend this book. "
14,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63821926-logan-scoles,3,"Intriguing topics and Dr. Kaku is one of the few people who writes for the science enthusiast. Lot of information here. However, it was not conveyed in terms understandable for the general reader. Multitude of topics discussed without ever being broken down as to why I should care or what that means in terms I can relate to. Good book for someone well versed in mathematics or physics. I enjoy the topics discussed, but they need to be broken down in a way in which anyone could understand and relate to."
15,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67164439-aenea-jones,5,"I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone interested in Quantum Physics.Kaku covers both the basics (Schroedinger's Cat, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, double-slit experiment, etc) and the newest insights into the String Theory. One reason why his books are so popular is because he manages to explain difficult and logic-defying processes in an understandable way."

If you're looking forward to seeing another triangle drawn on a saddle or reading another synopsis of that Heinlein story about the girl who became her own parents, Kaku's your guy. (For a while he had me wondering if I'd already read this one and just forgot to review it, but no.)The physics stuff is mostly‚Å∞ covered in the exact same (shallow) way almost everyone else has covered it,¬π but he doesn't stick to that, because other writers don't. His inevitable discussion of things like the anthropic principle and the cosmological argument (you know: those things that were in all pop-sci from, say, the '80s all through The God Delusion, after which they mysteriously became less fashionable) seem calculated to miss the point in a way that's meant to annoy literally anyone with any opinion at all, but they're not even the most embarrassing sections of the book‚Äîthat would be the ``futurology''¬≤ that takes up most of the last quarter of it (I hope you like reading about the Kardashev scale again!).In fairness I should also point out that this book was published in 1994, so it does predate a few hundred (but by no means all) of the books that made popular physics such a tired and derivative cottage industry; I don't think that excuses this one.Writers who have written this exact book in a more competent way include Brian Greene, Brian Cox, and Michio Kaku.--------‚Å∞ His discussion of Schr√∂dinger's cat is notably worse.¬π Kaku did manage to do something Lee Smolin and Peter Woit never could: make me doubt that string theory is actually a meaningful thing and not just a mathematical artefact; a lot of the big insights in his own actual work that he brings up do seem to come down to realising something he came up with was just a way of rephrasing older laws.¬≤ A ``futurologist'', of course, being a sci-fi nerd with delusions of grandeur."

The most egregious spoiler is when he recounts Asimov's The Last Question. Do yourself a favor, before you read this, go read that one first at the very least. Other than the story spoilers this is a great and accessible synthesis of twentieth century physics."
22,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2925334-anusha-sridharan,5,The most intriguing book I have read in recent times.

A good portion of the book discusses the history and progression of humanity's conceptions of higher dimensions, and how those ideas affected art, religion, and other aspects of society (and how, in turn, the science was affected by the results of that cross-pollination). While the science has surely matured since this was written, it's a thought-provoking read about the nature of our universe, and our quest to understand it."
25,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55798799-veronika,4,"Good book. Toward the end I felt like I am reading sci-fi instead of science, which is great. Where would all the science be, without a good dose of imagination. "

27,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44370756-benjamin-park,4,Hyperspace makes the obtuse and opaque concepts of theoretical physics accessible to anyone with an interest in science. I was delighted to learn about the world of physics that lies beyond the three dimensions that we perceive. I did find parts of the book to be too dense or technical so I just skipped over those sections.
28,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6770267-chris,3,"Whew!! The evolution of theoretical physics up to 1994. Was waiting for a more current book, but started this in the interim. Part I, the first four chapters and Parts III & IV, which covered 6 chapters were pretty easy to read for this non-physics person and quite interesting especially those things involving cosmology. Part II, had my brain often saying Whaaaat???! More technical definitely. So why would a non-physics person, much less theoretical physics want to read this book? Well the novel Dark Matter to be precise. It piqued my interest in the titled Dark Matter-what is it? Parallel worlds, wormholes and the like. "
29,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24160488-jim-nielsen,4,"I found this to be an enjoyable, relatively accessible look at some of the most advanced theories of physics (and mathematics) in modern science. Granted, I didn't understand everything in this book, The overview on the brilliant theories of specific and general relativity and their consequences I found fascinating and understandable. Once you start getting into quantum theory and its mathematics things get a little strange and complicated. But why shouldn't they? Quantum mechanics, as the author explains, is a convoluted, ugly theory that is only still around because of its abilities to quite precisely predict experimental data. After an overview in these theories you begin to see the dichotomy between the two and how string theory represents a possibly elegant solution to unify all the laws of physics under a single theory. As the author states many times in the book, you begin to see how the laws of physics can be much more elegantly and beautifully expressed when brought into higher dimensions, an intriguing and fascinating concept. I couldn't put this book down!"

Although some of the book was way over my head, I read the rest with great interest and learned a busload of new things about Quantum Theory. I enjoyed the read though it took me a long time to get through the book. I did have to skip some of the more technical stuff, but every once in a while a light would go on and I would be elated.I can't comment on the book professionally of course, but if you are interested in Quantum Theory, Dr. Kaku's writing style is extremely easy to read, entertaining in some spots and thoroughly engaging."
32,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2833296-bob,4," Good general history of 20th century physics. I enjoyed the layout of the book -- first half of the book is the history of hyperspace, second half is what can come out of the theory. Loved this part. Wormholes, time travel, black holes and the death of the universe. The author does a good job bringing in sci-fi stories to explain or illustrate the various theories. Some times he would go off on a tangent and try to bring the point back in a rough way."

He also explained a few concepts, which I had come across before but not fully understood, and made it clear. This book as the tagline explains takes the reader through the tenth dimension. His flow is consistent and he achieves this by reducing his data into four parts. I: Entering the fifth dimension where he takes the reader on a journey from special relativity to general relativity; II: Unification in ten dimensions where he takes the reader on a journey from general relativity to string theory; III: Wormholes where he deals with black holes and time machines and how time travel is not merely possible but probable and it's different types; IV: Masters of Hyperspace where he deals with the question of our future civilization and how the fate of the universe would be inescapable for even them unless the density of the universe was more than 10 raised to -29 gram per cubic centimeter then perhaps our species may have a chance to use the six dimensions towards the end to escape.He discusses the Kardashev scale (to categorise civilizations) and the difficulties our species may have to face reaching Type-I considering that we have discovered the power of element 92 (U), with the help of Einstein's famous e=mc2 equation, without having reached the social development to ensure that we don't unleash it on ourselves (aka self destruct). I actually enjoyed reading this book despite the fact that it was written ages ago even before Edward Witten proclaimed that the string theory was actually M-theory. This was one of my first books by Michio Kaku and I thoroughly enjoyed it except for when he pontificated (throughout) at how this theory found in the 20th century was made for the 21st, considering how we still are not better off.All in all its a popular science read, simple for a lay reader who is interested in understanding a few bits of the only compatible theory of everything. A good readüëç"
52,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4547369-p-dreadful,5,"An Odyssey, indeed. And an entertaining one at that. The book is divided into four parts. The first part discusses the need for a fourth spatial dimension. The second and the third deal with ten-dimensional universes and wormholes (and wormholes within black holes), while the last part is about the death of our universe. The underlying theme of the book is that all the laws of physics can co-exist only in a higher dimension. I had come across terms such as transversible black holes, Casimir effect, quarks, leptons, false vacuum, etc. but I had no idea how they all fitted together. This book explains that and more. The author, one of the founders of the superstring theory, does a brilliant job in explaining complex concepts in a simple, easily digestible format. He explains why there was a need for a higher dimension and goes on to discuss the greatest scientific achievements since Newton that led to the development of a unified field theory. I found the diagrams particularly helpful, especially the ones depicting Flatlanders (living in two-dimensional worlds). Some of the amazing things I learnt from this book are given below: 1. The number of dimensions can only be ten or twenty-six, but it's probably ten(?). Why ten?Because of the factor (N-10) that appears in some equations. 2. Our original ten-dimensional universe was unstable hence it broke up into two four-dimensional (ours) and six-dimensional universes. The latter is tiny (Planck's scale) and folded up. It might be in the shape of a six-dimensional torus (or a doughnut). Have fun trying to visualise that. But this sister universe is not entirely useless. When our universe starts to undergo the Big Crunch (that is, contract at an alarming rate), we can escape into this six-dimensional universe which will expand. 3. Nature prefers symmetry.4. Black holes may be gateways to alternate, mirror universes.5. The concept of world lines. 6. Our sun may have a sister called Nemesis. We may be a part of a binary star system.Absolutely unputdownable.

53,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5065158-denise,5,"This was an interesting and challenging read for me. I do not have a background in physics or mathematics, but Kaku made String Theory accessible to folks like us. The broader picture and the impact the notion of Hyperspace has on our perceived world is effectively conveyed in his pleasant writing style. I have to admit that the chapters on the specifics of the different theories were the challenging part for me. The math went completely over my head. Luckily understanding grad school level equations was not necessary. I found the need to consult secondary sources to better understand the specific theories, some of which may or may not have been written for grade school students. This is no reflection on Kaku's abilities. Given that he admits that some physicists don't completely understand Quantum and String Theory, this is obviously difficult material to explain to laypersons. As a non-scientist, I mostly enjoyed the philosophical and theological discussions of how the String Theory and Hyperspace change and affect our perception of the universe and our place in it. I especially enjoyed the account of how the various theories and discoveries have influenced the arts, particularly literature. Thanks to this book, I now have a long list of science fiction books and short stories to hunt down.The final section includes a detailed prediction of how civilization will advance, both technologically and scientifically as well as socially, and the various obstacles humanity must overcome in order to master Hyperspace in the distant future. Kaku also discusses the possibility of humanity's ultimate fate. This is not so much the predictions of a fortune teller, but rather educated speculation based on current knowledge. He could be wrong, but he doesn't think so. I found this fascinating, and tried to Imagine what it would be like to be a part of a Type III civilization.Lastly, Kaku mentions Star Trek quite often throughout the text, which alone makes this book really cool. All in all, it's an engaging read, and I feel a tiny bit smarter now."
54,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29920947-andrew,2,"Rife with overly simplistic analogies which serve to muddy rather than illuminate the underlying physical and mathematical principles, this feels like a book written for people that the author believes not only aren‚Äôt educated about said principles (or about the mathematics necessary to truly represent them) but who are also incapable of ever truly understanding them. The former should obviously be held to be true, but the latter makes this book often read like it was written for fools.Kaku also makes many leaps to suppose causation that are laden with fallacy. Every third page seems to present a ‚Äútherefore‚Äù clause that either doesn‚Äôt hold up to simple formal logical scrutiny or which is missing the key causal link that would clarify for the reader. He uses the word multiplet without providing a definition but then dedicates multiple pages of visual diagrams to simply show us matrices of expanding dimensionality, saying ‚Äúthe forces fit together like a jigsaw puzzle‚Äù which belies the basic relation between matrices and dimensions/transformation - something which Kaku never assumes we know nor simply clarifies at any particular point.This felt like reading a bad freshman year Physics For Poets lecture that never ends. It‚Äôs overly dumbed-down science and as a result, unintentionally I‚Äôm sure, much of it constructs a false picture for the reader in the desperate hope of constructing the simplest picture possible."

The author makes complex principles and challenges in physics accessible to the lay reader and argues forcefully that the hyperspace-superstring-10 dimension theory simplifies and synthesizes all known physical observations and the requirements of the conflicting quantum principles of the micro world and the time-space principles of the macro world. Unfortunately, Kaku points out that the energy levels that would be required to provide demonstrable evidence that this theoretical framework are unlikely to be available to humankind in the current millenium, and the limitations of mathematics in its present form doesn't allow a pure math-based ""proof"" of the theory. I found the final chapters outlining the obstacles to continued growth and progression of a late stage 0 civilization like ours and the philosophical and religious implications of the hyperspace theory to be the most intriguing parts of the book. The book is worth a read if you are curious about where the astounding progress in physics might be leading. You will understand much more about the core challenges facing physicists and mathmeticians today and what might lie ahead. "

As a literature, it's ok to read but even as a pop science writer, I found him dabble in areas that aren't his expertise.As a writer, he may be great (Though I read only a few books of him ), but I don't appreciate his method of popularizing science; as it may implant a very wrong perspective in the minds of the viewers.Maybe, guys like Dr. Kaku, Bill Nye, Tyson are the bridges between academic and the public.Because the fact is general public don't read the technical literature usually. Besides, popularization is more about stretching imagination and explaining why science did in expensive labs is relevant than about training anyone to do physics. In that light, I think Dr. Kaku was working. But, the effectiveness of his approach to popularizing science could be debated and I prefer Lawrence Krauss more for the same approach."

Unfortunately Kaku's no Feinmann, and the narrative jumps from place to place sometimes taking the reader for a conjectural fool, something the previous generation of popularizer physicists wouldn't do, as to present science-fiction for science.I never finished this one, and I'd really love someone not ""famous"" (i.e. not like Kaku or Neil DeGrasse Tyson) to write a full multitome update of the Feinmann's physics, something that Hawking never did, considering his state it was no surprise, but especially now it is too late; because it has been almost 60 years since Feinmann, physics has expanded and instead of a general, even if ever so huge collection of understandable physics, what we have now is self-promoting science celebrities each working in their own corner, and each having a very cursory understanding of others' work.Skip this book."

I would read a chapter, then spend several days researching the topics presented. I LOVE working through a book like this. Kaku makes you think critically, but it's not so aloof as to be inaccessible.I had this on the self for a few years before finally cracking it open. It's not for the faint of heart. You may run into something you don't like or can't make sense of. You have to be in the right head space, willing to challenge your opinions and explore theoretical (and seemingly whimsical) statements without a clear destination in mind. You may feel existential dread or overwhelming hope; sometimes both at the same time.One of the greatest tragedies and advantages of the human condition is to conceptualize futures that you'll never be a part of. Kaku's a great lecturer and author. Highly recommend reading this and others by him. (Also, read Our Mathematical Universe, Max Tegmark and The Elegant Universe, Brian Greene)"
60,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55651694-mars-smith,4,"This book, as the name might imply, discusses different dimensions such as the 10th and the 26th dimension. Michio Kaku refers to another book called ""Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions"" in order to coherently explain why higher dimensions can simplify the laws of physics rather than complicating them. Pro: This book is great for people who want to learn more about higher dimensions and how it might affect future civilizations as we go from what we currently are a Type 0 civilization to what we potentially could be which would be a Type III civilization.Con: Unfortunately, a lot of what he talks about cannot be proven in the lab. We simply do not have the technology or know how to show experimental evidence for higher dimensions. The author knows this but is still rather fascinated by the idea that there might be."
61,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22068229-ben,3,"I have many of Kaku's books, but this was the first I've actually read so far. I've been a fan of his for many years and had ""hyper"" expectations for it. Overall, Hyperspace was worth reading. The first and last 100 pages were excellent, but the middle 100 were overwhelmingly dense theoretical physics, and pretty repetitive. Having taken college physics, theoretical math/computer, and many other science classes at his own alma mater of UC Berkeley, it was still a bit hard at times to grasp. But for what Kaku does, explaining the most extreme theories known to man, he does it in an entertaining and humble manner. I loved how he emphasized the roles of philosophy and religion, and even drew upon biology to ground theoretical physics in a meaningful way for all of humanity. I'm looking forward to reading Parallel Worlds next, and his Physics of the... books. "
62,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47627566-niel,4,"Appearing in another dimension, Michio Kaku explains and enlightens on the quest for unification of the various forces of nature. He reveals from the eyes of Huxley that the universe is ""not only queerer than we suppose but queerer than we can suppose."" He lets the matter he talks about bring about wonder in itself with little or no occupation on the overwhelming grandiosity of what he refers (which I believe would have been reconciled in more stronger hands) Following from this, he enlightens those who can accompany him on the journey to the understanding of the universe, and where we might reappear if our technology increases exponentially and our political disputes are conquered by the need for self preservation on a cosmic timeline, while showing confidence that hyperspace is where we might come to this experience."

The author has discussed the various aspects of the ""Tenth Dimension"" in a very simple fashion and has chronologically outlined its development through the decades. He has again analysed the vast sea of knowledge that might become accessible to us once we rise beyond our conventional three-dimensional world (and time). At the same time, he hasn't shied away from the mere technological disability of the present century to experimentally verify the theoretical implications of the String theory. The best part is, however, the Conclusion where he succinctly describes the relation of this outlandish scientific theory on philosophy and religion. I particularly enjoyed his view of God as the God of order and God of Miracle. It was fun reading this book, Dr. Kaku!"
64,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19033159-nisha-sadasivan,5,"Absolutely loved the book. Kaku is by far the best astrophysics writer I have encountered thus far. The book takes the reader on a ride through the history of dimensions in Mathematics and Physics, the various theories that were postulated, the ones that succeeded, the ones that failed to see the light of the day, and some that were even resurrected - often interspersed with many an interesting sci-fi story. The author's depiction of Thorne's calculation for Time Travel is sheer brilliance.Did you know that you can travel back in time, if you could only learn to travel faster than light? But, the problem is, once you enter the Einstein-Rosen bridge popularly known as a wormhole, you're doomed, because the entrance will then close up.Well then, hope to meet you in the 10th dimension, a few millennia from today. Bye for now :) "
65,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19100966-micah-mccoin,4,"This book is designed as a ground-up layperson's guide to the scientific journey to a unified theory of all natural forces. The solution: ten-dimensional hyperspace. The writing is crisp and full of visualizations to help the reader get a grasp on the concepts. In many places, the concepts progress from zero to 100 quickly, and I found myself totally following the narrative one moment and then falling off a cliff of incomprehension the next moment. I think the author, who is himself a physicist involved in the academic discourse around the hyperspace theory, needed a co-writer to further ground the more abstract concepts.A fascinating read. My main gripe is that the end of the book sort of circles the airport and continues to introduce new concepts and conversations instead of closing strong with a recap and resolution of the hyperspace theory itself."
66,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41024537-daksh-jindal,3,This book captures one of the most important scientific debates of the human life. The question that every human asks themselves about their origins. The author takes you on an amazing journey starting from early mathematics by Riemman to modern theory of physics by Stephen Hawkings.The analogies int he book are brilliant and makes you really think outside the box on how the universe we live in could so multi dimensional due to the simple laws of physics. It‚Äôs fascinating to see how our minds without even leaving our planet has come up with all the realistic testable theories about unifying the 4 major forces of nature.The book does a little complicated and repetitive in the middle which breaks the flow but the end wraps up the book nicely.It is a good read for someone looking to get a glimpse into the past and the future of physics and humanity as a whole.
67,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59451697-jerry,4,"Author Michio Kaku once stated, ‚ÄúSome people seek meaning in life through personal gain, through personal relationship, or through personal experiences. However, it seems to me that being blessed with the intellect to divine the ultimate secrets of nature gives meaning enough to life.‚Äù In other words, physicists study physics because it gives their lives a purpose. By understanding the secrets of nature in Michio Kaku's book, people can gain meaning in life. The book Hyperspace by Michio Kaku records and explains all the latest developments of theoretical physics. The book contains many interesting ideas, such as higher dimensions, dark energy, and the quest for a grand unified theory of the universe. Hyperspace is organized like a story, with each section highlighting an advancement in physics and detailing an explanation. Each part connects to the previous and the following section in some way. Every part is understandable because Michio Kaku explains the advanced concepts he introduces in simple terms that everybody can understand. Discovering more about the intricacies of quantum physics was fascinating, specifically the focus on black holes and time travel.	I would rate this book four stars because I enjoyed the ideas presented but not the fine print. Being a fan of science, I liked learning about black holes. Kaku describes black holes and parallel universes, stating, ‚ÄúIf a space probe were shot into the top or bottom [of a spinning black hole]...the gravitational force would not be infinite,‚Äù meaning that the black hole would allow access to other universes. This understanding of black holes means that entering a black hole and avoiding being crushed is possible. I had always assumed that if one was to enter a black hole, one would become quantum soup. I was excited to realize that traveling to another dimension was possible. Michio Kaku also discusses how to build a time machine, explaining that it is possible although scientists dismiss it: ‚ÄúProponents of time travel point out that Einstein‚Äôs equations for general relativity do allow some forms of time travel. They acknowledge, however, that the energies necessary to twist time into a circle are so great that Einstein‚Äôs equations break down.‚Äù I loved learning that time travel was not just science fiction but possible. Usually people think of Einstein as the greatest physicist but even his equations stop working eventually. This fact taught me that science is evolving beyond Einstein and into new territories. While I enjoyed discovering more about physics, the print was so small that sometimes I lost my spot. If the print were larger, I would enjoy the book more. 	Ultimately, people who enjoy physics will enjoy this book. Although the material might seem advanced, Kaku explains everything in terms that any reader would understand. He reveals that the ideas in science fiction books might become a reality someday."
68,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25582110-kate-savage,3,"Yeah pop physics books! This was one of the first books written on superstring theory for a lay audience. Though it was written in the 90s, if you add one more dimension to make it eleven, the fundamentals still hold (as far as I can tell, but my brain's only three dimensions after all).Two quibbles:1) The author could have cut out some sections, which seemed redundant and served more to increase book length than to explain.2) Physicists, who are careful to allow incredible complexity and nuance in the physical world, write about the human social world like it's obvious, simple, and heading toward some clear goal. When Kaku writes about our likely future, I find his ideas both naive and unimaginative."

Kaku has a very engaging style of writing wherein he gives the readers a good view into the history / background of each of these top physicists and mathematicians, who ended up shaping higher dimensional math and physics. I particularly like the parallels that he draws between the life and times of great minds like Riemann and Ramanujan. I guess the language of math and physics is universal!

The author ranges widely through the various disciplines, developments, theories, crackpot notions, and wild guesses that have brought scientific thinking to its present, ever-roiing state, and even dares to suggest how the insights of philosophy and religion contribute to thinking about the connectedness of everything and dealing with paradox.I approached this book cautiously, expecting at any moment to be plunged into pages of incomprehensible string theory and arcane mathematical jargon, but it never happened, and I was actually reluctant to come to the end."
71,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53294527-roberto-paredes,4,"The word ""Hyperspace"" had a totally different meaning (or lack of thereof) to me before reading this book.I didn't know exactly what to expect, as I just knew this was a very popular (popular) science book and I liked physics. Michio Kaku does a great job explaining in layman terms what are Hyperspace and String Theory, along with some related physical topics and their historic context; and why is it currently the most popular candidate for a theory of everything.Curious fact: one year after this edition was published, Ed Witten proposed M-Theory, which I believe is the most recent and advanced version of a superstring theory to date; and it has 11 dimensions, instead of the 10-dimensional theories discussed in the book."
72,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1224710-j-e,4,"At times fascinating, at others overly technical name soup. I love Michio Kaku's light-hearted style on his radio show and documentaries so I was expecting the same here, but it got pretty heavy at times. I suppose that kinda comes with the territory when you're discussing... you know, the ultimate theory of everything that exists. (Especially when that theory is one that can't be seen, tested, or really even explained using ordinary language.) That being said, at times I think this was trying to be too many things to too many audiences. Is it pop science? Is it intellectual history? Is it a textbook? Maybe all of the above."
73,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28103847-dan-walters,3,"+ Good structure. Subsections are relatively small giving you time to process thoughts before delving further.+ Time taken to clearly explain experimental concepts that have lead to the proposal of Hyperspace theory.- Kaku uses a very anecdotal and story-like style to explain physical concepts; often with multiple scenarios for the same concept - feels overdone.- Quite early on you get the sense that no firm conclusion can yet be made - and that humanity is unlikely to posses the energy levels to test the theoretical idea of hyperspace for many years to come. Discussion is interesting, but far too excessive.  "
74,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19124904-charles-sheard,2,"Ultimately, I feel that Kaku tries to explain and support his untestable, unlikely theories with analogies and explanations that are themselves unrealistic. I also feel that he fudges things too often, or accepts things on faith, simply because they would (if accurate) make his theories more solid. Finally, I found far too much of the book to be quotes from others, or retellings of SciFi literature or television ideas, whose purpose never went beyond ""gee, isn't that a neat idea"", without ever being incorporated into his arguments. Hopefully his later books improved, but I don't know if I'll bother giving them a try."

Another 6 dimensional universe went somewhere, but it is/was so small we can't measure it. Read the book for full details! I didn't expect to enjoy this so much, but the author made the concepts easy to understand. Also, I didn't realise that physicists are okay with the concept of extraterrestrial beings. Unfortunately it's highly unlikely however, that humans and E.Ts would exist in the same time period. They could have been, or they will be, perhaps long after our extinction."

93,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/198798-linda,5,"Super interesting book that I almost understood! Only the math gets in the way, although Michio Kaku has a great way of explaining complicated ideas so that even a non-scientific person can catch a glimpse of the universe!"
94,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66751237-armand,4,"Entirely dedicated to one of my favourite topics, but not always an enjoyable read. It seemed to me that Kaku repeated or restated some facts ad nauseam, but barely explained others. It was almost as though there was no clear audience in mind, with regards to physics literacy. "
95,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3442177-amanda,3,"Very interesting, but extremely long-winded at times. The author easily gives three to four examples of everything he discusses, even at places where one, two or even none would be enough. Nevertheless, if you aren't too bothered by that, this is a very fun read."
96,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13294490-arvind-jeena,5,"Reading this book felt like an sci-fi adventure, only this one is real. The science in the book, though a bit complicated for average person, is highly facinating. Lot of things to learn and to wonder about. A must read."
97,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6093437-joseph-siry,4,"Impressively clear and thorough description of the dimensions of the universe as revealed in astrophysical theory, experimental evidence, and carful observations of the subatomic and post-relativity world."
98,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55718787-ph-ng-minh,5,"Only intent to skim a book to get a central idea, however, the book is written so well such that it captivates my attention in three hours long to read through every page before my computer runs out of battery. So, try it out if you are a true fan of physics, mathematics, and science in general."
99,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/85657914-eric-nguyen,5,"I'm more of a biology person, but this still fascinates me to this day. A lot of information about string theory and related topics are discussed. You probably need some basic physics to fully understand everything he says though, despite his effort to simplify them. "
100,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/98839732-samsclub,3,"After reading this book, you will look at the world differently. ""A koi fish swimming in a shallow pond has no idea how big reality maybe until he is briefly picked up out of the pond"". Are we in the same state as a koi fish? Book gets tougher to follow as it progresses. "
101,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55898901-ben,5,"A brilliant account about the composition of the universe, how we as humans look at it, all in a conventional language that even the common lay-man can understand. Would recommend for anyone interested in anything. "
102,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71623655-zoe,4,Definitely not an easy read; the author really makes you think. I didn't understand a lot of it (haven't gotten past high school geometry) but the parts that did make sense were really cool to think about. 
103,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/105140962-john-rojewski,4,Not his first book! Kaku has a deep background in physics and an inspirational way of visualizing those things which are often difficult to explain. This book is extraordinary in 'Symmetry Breaking' and providing a pathway into that which we cannot see and yet know is possible.
104,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89501914-kamila-jast,5,"I am a fan of Michio‚Äôs books, have read 5 of them, interested in science and progress behind string theory, etc, but this one is my favourite so far. Topics and theories as presented here are just mind-blowing. Reads very well as all Michio‚Äô books."
105,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/114601439-micha,0,"holy shit my mind is warped, if you like multidimensional theories of space, time, and the beauty of our distorted, geometric, unseen dimensions and have not yet attuned your psychic powers,,, Kaku's mapped it out mathematically and symbolically "
106,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/116243731-jhuan,0,"Tackles things from the bigger scale. Mainly focuses on discussing the developments in areas of cosmology and astronomy, leading up to the birth of the theory of everything; string theory and membrane theory."
107,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/67767182-alen-54321,4,"Interesting! Kaku has very good presentation skills. + simple writing, thought provoking- Kaku sometimes feels a bit naive like Dawkins. Mostly when I get the feel that he talks so much."
108,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20812843-shourie,4,"This book was so intelligently written, with great ideas put so effortlessly into honest language. Higher Dimensions is a great idea."
109,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/74731381-ashley-wells,4,Hyperspace is an easy read that doesn't shy away from advanced material. I would definitely recommend it to anyone without a formal background in physics.
110,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/80971100-conlan,5,Mind-boggling and life-changing. I read this in elementary school and began my journey of interest in theoretical physics.
111,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/64812551-jeff-kilpatrick,5,A book I go back to often - so much thought provoking material laid out in a way easy to understand
112,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51074227-aishwarya,5,A must read for science enthusiasts.
113,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79695072-sheng,4,Read at the end couldn‚Äôt be understanded.
114,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63075023-jude-molloy,5,Explores advanced ideas in a way that is accessible to most. A great book.
115,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1354727-dave,5,Filled many gaping holes in my knowledge. Entertaining and wonderfully informative. 
116,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6624611-simon-yoong,3,Probably the best book to introduce someone to Kaku.
117,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71397344-michael-chen,5,great
118,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/89839974-john,5,Superb.
119,0192861891,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91163281-ren,5,Hypersimetry what a concept. Very good book.
