0,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53165-warwick,2,"All right so this is not the book I thought it was when I got it, and I apologise for a rating that would surely be higher if I were part of the target audience. I was hoping it was a survey of the latest scientific research into arousal disorders and sexuality; in fact, it's a very selective presentation of those pieces of research that are considered helpful in ‘promoting women's sexual well-being, autonomy and pleasure’. Studies, however revealing, which do not promote such things are ignored. In other words, the book is primarily therapy, not science. Perhaps not surprising given that the author is a sex therapist, but I hadn't realised that – I thought she was a researcher.I've been very intentional about the empirical details I've included or excluded. I asked myself, “Does this fact help women have better sex lives, or is it just a totally fascinating and important empirical puzzle?”And I cut the puzzles.This means that, although there is some useful information here, it is interspersed with a lot of rather irritating, vaguely encouraging bullshit about ‘living with confidence and joy inside your body’, reassurances that you are ‘all normal, all beautiful’, and exhortations to ‘listen with your heart, not with your fear’. Naturally as a British passport-holder I cannot read this stuff without feeling my toes clench and my testicles retract into my body, and the narrative tone doesn't help either. Nagoski writes in the earnest, chatty way of someone trying to write a book for people who don't read books, with lots of forcedly colloquial comments like, ‘Wait: what?’ and, ‘For realsie real.’OK, fine, I am clearly not the target audience, I get that, but for me it gets incredibly grating when every hint of scientific information is hedged around with encouragements and stupid metaphors and open condescension: before a section on the hedonic centres of the mesolimbic cortex (which Nagoski calls ‘your emotional One Ring’), she warns, ‘It gets pretty nerdy here […] Ready? Okay’, and afterwards pats us on the head by asking, ‘Did you make it? Phew! That was the hard part. Nice job.’ Gee thanks, Dr Nagoski!Aristophanes, in Plato's Symposium—and for those of you who very understandably just fell asleep, replace that with the song “The Origin of Love” from John Cameron Mitchell's Hedwig and the Angry Itch—offers this parable about why humans love…Really? What I found so infuriating about all this is the implied gendering of her tone – it's somehow pitched at a certain idea of women, as though they have no interest in hard science and need their research presented in the form of a Cosmo quiz. It's really outrageous; I don't know if I should be taking it as some reflection on the state of US science education, but the total horror of any scientific terminology, combined with the girlfriends-chatting-over-a-Manhattan tone, just left a really bad taste in the mouth. (Men come off no better – Nagoski writes that she has to ‘translate the science of women's sexual well-being into Manly Fix-It Dude-Speak’ to talk to her clients' partners….)The reason this is so frustrating is that the actual research presented is pretty important and, in some cases, not so well known. The two presiding ideas in the book, I think, are the concept of responsive v. spontaneous desire, and the dual control model of sexual arousal. The terms ‘responsive desire’ and ‘spontaneous desire’ have been floating around for over a decade now – I think the key paper was Basson et al. 2003 (although Nagoski says they were coined by Ellen Laan and Stephanie Both, which may be true; Laan is one of the authors of that paper). The basic idea is that while some people can get turned on while walking down the street or doing the dishes, for others it's something that only happens in response to situations that have already been made explicitly erotic. Arousal first, desire second.The disparity between these different kinds of desire is, of course, behind a lot of relationship stresses, whence Nagoski's clinical interest. For her what's important here is to point out that responsive desire is perfectly OK and is not the same as ‘low desire’.A woman can be perfectly normal and healthy and never experience spontaneous sexual desire. Instead, she may experience ‘responsive’ desire, in which her desire emerges only in a highly erotic context.She writes ‘a woman’ – and there may well be a sex divide. Nagoski estimates (on somewhat shaky data, because research into this is limited) that five percent of men and thirty percent of women have responsive desire, compared with seventy-five percent of men and five percent of women whose desire is ‘spontaneous’. (This leaves most women and twenty percent of men whose desire style changes based on the context – a rather large amount which does slightly throw the whole model into question. Asexuality is not addressed.) Nagoski is understandably worried about the idea that sexual desire which differs from the male norm is pathologised as ‘broken’ or defective in some way, something to be ‘fixed’ by taking a so-far-mythical pill; she wrote an op-ed piece for the New York Times back in February on this subject.It's all good stuff and it's certainly a vocabulary that more people should have at their disposal. However, it should be noted that other models of sexual desire are available. It's also worth saying that all we are really doing here is playing semantics. Thinking about responsive desire as a thing might help people to feel better about themselves and not to feel broken – which is good, and they're not – but it doesn't really say anything about what's actually going on. What affects whether desire is spontaneous or responsive? Hormones? Neurology? Upbringing? Culture?(This semantics issue is something the whole book suffers from – same goes for her long and heartfelt rant about why we do not have a sex ‘drive’ but rather an ‘incentive motivation system’. For the life of me after reading that section several times, I couldn't work out what the difference was supposed to be.) Even more than responsive desire, Nagoski is excited about something called the Dual Control Model of Arousal. This is the idea developed by two researchers at the Kinsey Institute in 2006 (the paper's here) and essentially what it does is to consider libido in terms of those psychosomatic processes that promote sexual arousal, and in terms of those that restrain it. The paper posits a Sexual Excitation System (SES) on the one hand, and a Sexual Inhibition System (SIS) on the other; Nagoski calls them the accelerators and the brakes. The SES is that part of you that constantly scans your thoughts and the world around you for sexually-relevant data; the SIS is – not inhibitions in the layman's sense, but a necessary consideration of negative consequences of any sexual activity, whether medical, social, psychological or whatever.Conceptualising things in this way turns out to add quite a lot of nuance to how we think about arousal. People with arousal problems differ fundamentally in where the issue lies: some have a low SES (i.e. not many things actually turn them on in principle), while others have a very rich SES but just a highly sensitive inhibition system which stops them reacting as fully as they otherwise might, unless conditions are ideal. Similarly, sexual risk-taking like unprotected sex, cheating and so on, is sometimes correlated with low SIS and sometimes with abnormally high SES.Nagoski very sensibly suggests that a prerequisite to overcoming arousal problems is understanding one's own SES and SIS – getting familiar with what exactly it is that turns you on and turns you off, and creating contexts where the former are maximised and the latter minimised. There are lots of interesting studies that bear on these ideas in various ways. It was found, for example, that wearing socks made it easier for women to orgasm while masturbating in a brain imaging machine. This is not because there are more sock fetishists than previously appreciated, but simply because it's distracting if you have cold feet, and depending on your personal SIS little distractions of this kind can add up fast (especially, one presumes, when trying to get off inside a brain imaging machine).It's clear that Nagoski wants to back up her ideas by using interviews with her clients, to demonstrate how helpful these concepts can be. And some interviews like this would indeed have been great – books like Brett Kahr's Sex and the Psyche show how well clinical transcripts can work in books of this kind. But, pleading confidentiality issues, Nagoski instead invents fictional couples who she says are composites of the many people she has treated in real life, and the book is interspersed with transcripts of how these fictional people were fictionally treated. Reading these made-up conversations with made-up couples, who nod and gasp appropriately at all her revelations, is an exercise in pure frustration.There were times when I wanted to throw this book across the room, and it's only thanks to the good fortune that I was reading it on my iPad that I was forced to press on. Nevertheless, there are small parts of it that I'd like to cut out and circulate to everyone I know, so it is an odd mix. Parts of the book, I mean, not my iPad. Nagoski is after all basically coming from the right place and talking about the right things, and she's not afraid of making some big claims for her field either.Do I think that living with confidence and joy and respecting everyone's sexual autonomy could play a role in preventing cancer, solving the climate crisis, or building world peace? Yes, actually.No way I can one-star a book saying something as close to my heart as that. And I guess if what you want is something therapeutic rather than just informative, then this will fit the bill pretty well. Still, despite all the interesting material to be uncovered in here, it is hard to shake off the vague feeling that you're getting a lecture on sexual dysfunction from a children's television presenter.(Oct 2015)"

(Ok the introduction and chapter 8 and appendix one might be, but the rest is science over myth), If it did not come so highly recommended from a respected friend of mine from uni. I probably would not every given it the first look. Read is as some ""light reading"" doing her PhD in Psychology. So of course she decided to experiment on her friend to get a male perspective on the book. So let me get this out of the way first. No!! This is not a collection of sex stories. There are actual case studies. They are not written to be provocative but to understand the feeling or the accelerators and the breaks. Thought Emily does quote a number of scientific theories and is by her own admission a ""nerd"" (no judgement I have been a proud geek for years), you do not have to be to understand the book, it is written in an easy to read way. I found there is a lot of truth to this book, and even though it is written primarily for women in mind I think both me men and women can lean a lot from it and will see traits of both in the case studies.I also think there are some very important messages in this book the main one being the first like and echoed through out the book ""you are OK. You are normal. You are not broken"". Usually when ever we do not fit the mold or something does not live up out our expectations one of those three thought does through our heads. the other messages that she tries to show us are the messages we are bombarded with through out our lives the ""that is wrong"", ""you should look like this"", or ""that is not normal"". I quite like the idea of celebrating differences then persecuting people for them.This is a great book with a lot of insightful theories, and science against myth and breaking down some pretty big wall. theories of sex ans psychology have been linked since Sigmund Freud, as some theories have moved on others we still have so much to learn about in others. A great book that should be read by everyone, and commented on what you agree with or disagree with."
2,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33447134-book-riot-community,0,"It’s hard not to love a book with a pseudo-vagina on the front; it’s even harder not to love that same book for smashing all the preconceived ideas we have about female (and by comparison, male) sexuality. Like, for example, did you know that the hymen as an indication of virginity is entirely a social construction and there is no scientific evidence backing it? Using actual, real science, Dr. Emily Nagoski – a speak-the-truth-and-only-the-truth sex educator/professor – breaks down all the things we think we know about sex and desire and drive and, in the process, makes you feel like not are you normal, but we’re ALL normal. As she says over and over and over, “We’re all made up of the same basic parts, just organized differently.” In other words, there is no normal. This is a game changer of a human sexuality book – not just for women, who have always been told that men’s sexuality is the default (HINT: it’s not) – but for men who love women and don’t understand why the things that work for them, don’t work for women. Just….just go buy this. Buy this and read it and try not to be that weird person pushing a sex book on every single lady person you know. Because these are all lessons we need to learn. Better for us, better for everyone. — Rachel Manwillfrom The Best Books We Read in April: http://bookriot.com/2015/05/01/riot-r..."
3,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/702266-jennie,3,"The information in this book is solid gold. A copy should be put in the hands of every person, ideally before they've had sexual contact with another person. But. BUT. The metaphors. Dear Lord, the metaphors. We have sexuality as an accelerator and brakes, sexuality as an overgrown garden, sexuality as a hot water heater, complex feelings as a sleeping hedgehog, sexual interest as a customers seeking a diner, sexual expectations as a touchy monitor tapping her fingernails, our brains as a flock of birds, and SO MANY OTHERS I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER. I understand and applaud what Nagoski is doing in terms of wanting to convey big complicated cognitive functions in more relatable prose. But it touches a nerve for me when writers anthropomorphize female sexuality. I find it infantilizing. I'm a big girl, just tell me what my brain is doing, I can read about chemicals and neurons and whatnot. I don't need to imagine my brain as a lion and my pelvis as a caveman or whatever other nonsense. So 5 stars for the content, 4 stars for the chatty conversational writing style (which did not annoy me but will probably polarize some readers) and 1 star for the overworked metaphors. "
4,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4129164-jess,5,"Come As You Are is absolutely the best book I've ever read, not just on sex, but on life and well being in general. Why read another book on sex? Because Emily describes how your brain and your life work together to create desire, and how to experience more pleasure, more joy, and more confidence with your relationships AND with sex. But this isn't the usual sex book with lavish promises of ecstasy by learning detailed techniques of where to put this and how to put it there. Emily gives you science that feels like a warm, soothing hug for all of the insecurities you've ever felt about your body, your sex, and your relationships, and then she describes how to apply science to your life so that you end up with the pleasure, joy and confidence. To be honest, after finishing a draft of this book, I felt more peace and well being than I'd felt in about ten years, which is about when I started worrying about my body and sex. And it's because Emily is describing how your brain interprets stress and how your body responds because of that, how to actually manage stress without just trying to relax, and how you can create a life that your body will respond all kinds of YES to. Then add in science about how your brain works with goals, and what kind of goal you have around your sex life, and then you can appreciate how to work with the reality of your life and not just the fantasy of what you want your love life to be. I've read Emily's blog for a couple years now, but the way she puts everything together and elaborates on all the science makes everything click in a way that feels reassuring and full of potential. I'm now reading parts of the draft again, and understanding even better how all of the elements work together to build joy and confidence and pleasure. It's truly beautiful.Come As You Are is the most practical book I've ever read about sex, and with this book and Sheri Winston's Anatomy of Arousal, I would never have needed any other book on sex. And I bought hundreds. I'm also not the most sciencey person, and luckily, Emily explains really complicated concepts in an easy to apply way. I really think this book could change our culture's whole idea of sexuality in a way that creates more pleasure for everyone. "
5,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/732347-kelly,5,"Books like this are why I LOVE non-fiction.This should be required reading on female sexuality, both for those with vaginas and those who are interested in or love someone with a vagina. I mention the parts here because they ARE a big component of the book. This is a guide to how everyone has the same parts, rearranged differently, and it's our perception of that and relationship with that mentality that changes our feelings, perceptions, and experiences of sex itself. Nagoski writes in an empowering, encouraging, fun, and yes, FUNNY, manner. I would hand this to every single woman I know. For me, the biggest take away, the moment which took this from really good to outstanding, was her discussion on body image, on body weight, and how it is our culture plus some that screws us up so bad. In short, it's the patriarchy that smashes female desire, love, and interest in sex and in their own sexual beings and experiences. We accept male-as-default forgetting that also means women lose out over and over and over again. Buy this one. Read it. Then pass it along. Seriously. It's THAT good. "
6,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2473504-jennifer,3,"Come as You Are: The Surprising New Science that Will Transform Your Sex Life is a nonfiction, self-help book written by sex educator, researcher, and author Emily Nagoski. It educates about a variety of issues that impact women's sexuality, and while some of it got quite repetitive in my opinion and I didn't quite take away as much new information as I expected to, I'm glad I read it. My favorite part discussed how the model of sexual response is based entirely on how men work, and if women fail to be like men, they are often not considered sexually normal. Any woman can tell you this isn't breaking news but I thought having a whole section themed with ""you are normal, it's the world around you that's broken"" was incredibly validating. I will forever and a day support women who choose the science field, and I have a high appreciation for Ms. Nagoski's reasons for writing this book in the first place. Check it out! My favorite quote:""When people ask me, ""Am I normal?"" They're asking, ""Do I belong?"" The answer is yes. You belong in your body. You belong in the world. You've belonged since the day you were born, this is your home. You don't have to earn it by conforming to some externally imposed sexual standard.""7/6/16: I'm actually super excited about this book. No shame ladies - learning is good!"
7,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4776032-cher,2,"2 stars - Meh. Just ok.I love the concept behind this book and it started off very interesting and introduced several facts of which I was not previously aware. Unfortunately, it then became a long repetitive read with the bulk majority of the information being mostly common sense, and started to feel like a self-help book vs a nonfiction book on a fascinating topic. I found myself doing a lot of skimming on the back half wondering if there would be another interesting chapter coming up (like the start of the book), but the back 75% was rather dull for me. Worth a read if you feel clueless in this area. -------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: Women have cultural permission to criticize ourselves, but we are punished if we praise ourselves, if we dare to say that we like ourselves the way we are.First Sentence: To be a sex educator is to be asked questions."
8,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10463035-caseythecanadianlesbrarian,3,"For some women I have no doubt this would be a life-changing book. I definitely learned some cool stuff, things I am pissed that I did not know (because, patriarchy). But I guess I'm lucky enough that I don't really need the 'self-help' of this book to help with my sex life, and this aspect is really the meat of the book. Also, Nagoski acknowledges that the book is for and about cisgender women, so that omission didn't bother me (there isn't enough science about trans women or enby people), but I did still feel like it was suited for straight women in long term monogamous relationships, which Nagoski doesn't give a disclaimer for like she does the focus on cis women. The examples of lesbians didn't really feel like they were specific to those experiences and bi women don't come up at all. Single and poly women wouldn't get a lot out of this that would speak specifically to those experiences either, I don't think. Plus, the metaphors used to explain absolutely everything got to me after a while."
9,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/857820-diana,5,"Updating review: I wrote this review almost five years ago. I'm cringing at using ""lady parts"". I still stick to my five star review, it helped me open up a lot sexually. I still recommend it to everyone, whether you identify as man or woman. Original review:I picked up this book because I was interested in the science and emotion connecting woman’s sexuality without sounding like a text-book or a Cosmo article. This book doesn’t just talk about your lady parts, it celebrates them, a notion I’m not familiar with. I felt for the first time I got a glimpse of how I am as a woman and how my sexuality is connected to every part of life. I think every woman should read this book- if it will help a fellow reader understand their body better, it’s worth reading. Even if you don’t have sex, are a virgin, hate sex or have an amazing sex life, don’t let the title throw you off. It’s a book to celebrate the female body, and the emotions and sexuality involved. I’ll admit I didn’t even want to add this book to “currently reading” list on Goodreads because I was embarrassed. There’s nothing embarrassing about being a 30-something year old healthy woman who enjoys sex but I just thought talking about sex was something shameful. If I had this book years ago, I can’t imagine the stress it would have saved me. Regardless if the topic of sex makes you blush or not, please read this book."

I want to buy a copy for every bridal shower I ever go to (for the bride AND groom). I want to buy two copies to save and give to my daughters one day. It's just great. Emily Nagoski. Can we be friends please? She's such a wise, understanding, encouraging, inspiring scientist! Her main ideas are that women's sexuality is not men's-sexuality-lite, that women approach sex (attraction, desire, arousal) differently and that's normal, and also that women often approach things differently from other women - and that's normal! It's all about accepting yourself where you are and recognizing the ways that culture & media have told us lies about our bodies and sexuality. It's about being a whole person who is forgiving and patient and kind to herself in all areas of life - including sexuality. I keep writing and then deleting this review so I'm just going to end it here w a quote. ""When people ask me ""Am I normal?"" They're asking, ""Do I belong?"" The answer is yes. You belong in your body. You belong in the world. You've belonged since the day you were born, this is your home. You don't have to earn by conforming to some externally imposed standard. ...You are normal. Beautiful. And as long as you're not experiencing pain, you're healthy. So when you notice yourself feeling dissatisfied with your sexuality, when you notice shame or frustration or grief, allow yourself to direct those feelings away from yourself and instead focus those emotions toward the culture that told you the wrong story."""

I listened an interview with the writer in a podcast and read couple of chapters and enjoyed it. However the remaining of the book is pretty disappointing. Writer thinks she is funny and she is not. And the style is mostly for teenagers. There are some useful information but it feels too redundant since she keeps repeating the same things over and over again. Some arguments are pretty fallacious. I laughed out loud when she made an analogy on losing weight - removing your brain makes you lose 4 pounds of fat, or amputation would make your BMI go down. My laugh was not because she is funny but because of the ridiculous analogies she made. And ""Don't yuck others yum""?! Seriously sounds like a book for kindergarten kids."
15,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26091478-cassandra,3,"This book was awesome for some reasons and a bit cringe-worthy for others. I'll start out with the good: This book is full of things that any person even remotely interested in sex should know. The author references specific studies, which lend credibility to her concepts. The book is empowering to women, assuring them that it is the sex culture that is the problem, not the way that women experience pleasure and desire - the map is wrong, not the terrain. This is a valuable message for people on the entire sexual spectrum. Unfortunately, while the tone of the writing was meant to be friendly and casual (and sometimes it is), other times it comes off as too cheeky for my taste. The book was also repetitive. I think that was on purpose, so that someone could read any given chapter and understand what came before it and what will come next, which is great if you want to share a specific concept with someone else. If you're going to read the book straight through, though, it gets a little irritating. Then, the book was written exclusively for women, despite the fact that men need to hear this too. I think some small tweaks would have made this empowering for women (and it's important that the focus is on women) but accessible to men as well."

I do think this book has the power to improve the sex lives of those who read it, but not because it's some kind of kinky how-to book. It can do this because it's a great explanation of how women's bodies work and how history and culture have done us a great disservice through the myths they disseminate.

18,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1991298-ana,2,"When the title of a book claims to tackle “The Surprising New Science,” I would expect to actually have new research references and more sciencey information about “responsive desire” vs “spontaneous desire,” arousal disorders, and women sexuality. But then again, it is followed by the highly self-help-ish “Will Transform Your Sex Life,” so I should have known better. The author does throw in some studies and articles - plus some Plato, for good measure -, but the chatty tone of the book is rather that of a therapy session, if not downright colloquial. I felt like overhearing a very long conversation between girlfriends. The reassurance that “we are all normal” and that our differences are “all normal, all beautiful” soon became an irritating catchphrase and an insufficient explanation. I also found the two teensy-tiny sections addressing traumatic experiences, by emphasizing that “you can simply begin practicing mindfulness, and gradually the trauma will work its way out, like shrapnel from an old wound,” almost laughable!When you’re using phrases like “for realsie real” and “have all the feels” (with tons of ‘feels” variations) it is very hard for me to take you seriously.

21,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1343864-ashley,4,"I actually first heard about this book from Alyssa Cole. When she visited the Tucson Festival of Books last year, I went to a panel she was on about consent being sexy, and she mentioned that she was reading it, and had learned a lot of things people assume about women’s sexuality was wrong. I put it on my TBR but just never got around to it, despite sexuality being one of my favorite things to read about. Luckily one of my IRL book club members picked this for our next read, and I was immediately excited (one of the other members, my longtime friend, wasn’t paying attention because she was chasing after her toddler, so when the book arrived in the mail from Amazon with its suggestive pseudo-vagina cover, she got quite the shock; this story has no point, I just like it, and the text exchanges were very amusing to me).The book wasn’t quite what I was expecting, though. I was expecting an informative, science-based book, aimed at educating the public about how sex really works, with a feminist focus. And it was that! But, it is also a self-help book. This makes sense, because Nagoski is a sex therapist, and she wrote the book not only to educate in a general sense, but to literally help anyone who reads the book to have a better, more satisfying sex life through understanding how their sexual responses actually work.Will note here, as the book does up front: there just hasn’t been enough research on trans women’s bodies, or those people who identify as non-binary, for Nagoski to have drawn conclusions about how their bodies work, if there are differences. So this is a book focused on sex responses in cis women (and to a much, much smaller extent, cis men).The main premise of the book is that most of our cultural understandings about sex treat women’s bodies and sexualities the same as men’s, and that if women’s bodies are seen to work in ways that are different, they are considered broken. Nagoski’s main thing is to prove that for various social, genetic, and other environmental factors, women’s bodies work different than men’s when it comes to sex. Her other main thing is stressing that unless you are in pain, your body and your reactions are entirely normal. There is a huge range of diversity built into human sexuality, and no matter where you are on the spectrum, you do not need to be “fixed”. Instead, through evidence based techniques, she shows you how to adjust your thinking and your environment (your “context”) instead of thinking you are broken and trying to fix yourself. The main focus is definitely on the individual (and the individual’s partner), but she does stress that cultural change would make a lot of this easier for everyone.I thought the two strongest chapters were when she talked about nonconcordance (the idea that bodily reactions do not always correspond to actual arousal; in men concordance only happens 50% of the time, in women 10%), and the chapter where she talked about stress. I’m not even going to try and go into the details, because her arguments live in those details that she provides, and I will bungle it. I will just say that she provides some really neat shifts in perspective that seem like they would be incredibly helpful. And all of it is backed by actual science, and explanations for how and why the body does what it does.Highly recommend this one!"

But then again a big narrative of this book is that where you are mentally affects where you are sexually, which makes sense. The book has 9 chapters and at the end of each chapter it has a TL;DR section, so I'm going to do that for this review. Here are MY main takeaways:1. Everyone is born with a garden to tend (that's our sexuality). What's planted in that garden isn't up to us, it's up to our parents and other outside influences. How we tend that garden is influenced by social construct. Some of us were planted with flowers and taught to love and care for our garden (positive outlook on sexuality) while other gardens were planted with weeds and left to rot (negative outlook). It is never too late though to change how you tend your garden (your outlook on sexuality)2. While we can be really good at dealing with stressors, we're actually not that good at dealing with the actual stress. ""Keeping calm"" is all well and good but our bodies were built to process stress fully and so we need to do that, either with physical activity, screaming, or some other sort of release. 3. Speaking of gardens, just because I have an aloe garden that only needs a little bit of sunlight, that doesn't make it any better or worse than your tomato garden that needs lots of sunlight. It just makes it different. It also doesn't mean that you should also have an aloe garden instead of a tomato garden, or that I should also have a tomato garden instead of my aloe garden. 4. Women have been taught that we are ""broken"" because our libidos and our arousal differs than men, because men are the default preferred sexual functioning, when really we're just women. 5. It's not how you feel, it's how you feel ABOUT how you feel. We've been taught that negative emotions are not ok and so we feel bad when we DO have them. Which then just makes us feel worse. It's a dangerous cycle. So just recognize that you're having a negative emotion, process it completely, and then move on. 6. Our Western Puritan views on sex and sexuality have really fucked women over, but it's not too late to change. I think this is one of those where, even if you have a great sex life, you could still gain something from this book. "
23,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50899158-hanna,5,"I’m not exaggerating when I say that this book changed my life. So here’s my long review. For the next year, I will be gifting this book to every single woman in my life, so if we’re irl friends, be prepared. This book is comprehensive, yet accessible. I learned SO MUCH (nonconcordance, stress cycles, and the way arousal & desire actually work!?) and it made me realize how little we teach folks about female sexual pleasure & functioning.Needless to say, I grew up to be pretty sex-negative (aside from the overall sex negative culture we live in, I was raised in a conservative catholic household). I’ve never felt comfortable talking to friends about sex or my anatomy and have always felt fear & shame in response to those two topics, but this book truly opened up my world. (I’m not kidding, it’s a huge deal that I even feel comfortable sharing with you all that I read a book about sex!!)Emily Nagoski did a great job in this book of breaking down complex biological/physiological/psychological concepts in a way that was easy to understand and fun to read. She also takes a relatively intersectional approach to the topic, not discounting the effects of race, class, and ability in regards to sex. It also isn’t heteronormative, but she does stick to the science about cisgender folks because there simply isn’t enough research about trans & non-binary folks (though Nagoski suspects their sexual functioning works much the same way).This book serves the purpose of helping you understand your likes & dislikes, open your world to maximize your sexual pleasure, and realize YOU ARE NORMAL!!!If you have a vagina, read this book! If you love someone with a vagina, read this book! Honestly, I wish everyone would just read this book!!!"
24,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7497921-susanne,5,"I'd like to recommend this book to every human being I know! What a gift to relationships it would be! This is a book about the science of arousal and sexual desire, well-written with humor and affection, happily sex positive. Having taught sexuality education within the structures of the UU church, this is the book I wish we had all had as background reading before we began. Well done! The basic message: ""You are all different and you are normal."" Yes, it is repeated many, many times, but some folks need that."
25,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene,2,"I didn't love the self-help aspect of this book. The author included some science - studies, explanation of the biological/neurological aspects involved in various sexual processes-- but felt a little too Deepak Chopra for me. The metaphors were not great- sexual self as garden, orgasm as birds or flock of birds. She should have either gone with the science *or* gone with the inspirational, feel good, nonscientific approach. Trying to use pretend science to promote Chopra-like inspirations just didn't work. At first, I thought, even if the reader doesn't need the self help, it's still a great subject to learn more about. I am a strong believer in talking openly about sex. I saw this book on the nominee list for best nonfiction and I wanted to like it. The first half of the book was much better than the second half. I should have just stopped reading, but I thought the good would peak through again. It didn't. The author made sweeping unsupported statements and promoted generalized ""cures"" for sexual disfunction that seemed like maybe they might or might not work, but where is the evidence? I realize this was supposed to be a master's class but it was not a class I feel I would learn a lot from. Sadly, March Roach's sarcastic look at sex, Bonk, taught me far more actual facts about sex. I enjoyed it much more than this. "
26,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9245694-jo,4,"I loved this book. Nagoski's writing is engaging but firmly grounded in the literature, like being on the second bottle of wine with a friend who's also an academic. She debunks common myths about ""how sexuality works"" and presents some alternative models -- the accelerator/brake model for arousal, the idea that sex is not a drive, a thought-provoking definition of what an orgasm is, and on and on and on. This is some of the most educational lunchtime reading I've ever done at work! :D"
27,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4810889-emily-joyce,5,"I can't recommend this book strongly enough, not just for women but for anyone who feels let down by mainstream ideals of what sex ""should"" be. Blending sex science with emotional wellness, Emily Nagoski empowers readers to understand their bodies and to set their sexual experiences to their own internal compasses. Along with What You Really Really Want and The Ethical Slut, I would put Come As You Are on my short list of books everyone who is dating and boning should read. "
28,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2360394-stacy,5,"My summary of this book, written by a sex therapist and geared mostly towards a female audience, would be: Your sexuality and body, almost without exception, are normal and beautiful. Can you accept that truth? I would recommend this book to every sexually active woman I know. The research and information found here is helpful, debunking many, many culturally held misconceptions about female sexuality in particular. Ok, now for my copious notes, for my future forgetful self and for those who want the brief version. (But read the full version, in case I don't do it justice.)Male and female bodies start the same in the womb, but eventually turn into either male or female sex organs. The penis is the equivalent of the clitoris, and that's why women can orgasm despite this function serving no evolutionary purpose. (That doesn't mean it isn't important.) We all have the same parts, just organized differently.Sexual desire is controlled by SES and SIS systems. SES is like the accelerator, picking up on environmental clues relating to sex (naked man/woman, smells, flirting), and SIS is like the breaks, picking up on information that would prevent you from having sex (fear of pregnancy, STI, kids in the hallway). Everyone has different levels of sensitivity. Men in general tend to have stronger SES (accelerators) and women (esp moms!) tend to have stronger SIS (brakes), but there are many exceptions, of course. She has an excellent quiz that will tell you and/or your partner how you rank on both systems, which was FASCINATING. If you're having trouble with sexual desire, the easiest solution is the remove or minimize the ""breaks"" (get a babysitter so the kids don't interrupt you, lower your stress level any way you can, stop making orgasm the ""goal"" and just enjoy the sensations and pleasure instead). There are 2 types of desire: spontaneous (I feel like I want to have sex!) and responsive (you may not initially feel horny, but once your partner stimulates you sexually, it feels good and NOW you're into it). Again, in general, men tend to be more spontaneous and women more responsive IN GENERAL. That doesn't mean either one is better, they're just different.One reason many women feel inadequate about their sexuality is patriarchy - the idea that if your desire doesn't match with the traditional male sexual drive (spontaneous desire, followed by organism during vaginal penetration), then there is something wrong with you. The author asserts that unless you're experiencing pain, there is probably NOT anything wrong with you, except the damaging cultural messages you've been receiving. (Note: Only 25% of women reliably orgasm during vaginal penetration, so really. Totally a patriarchal misconception.)Sex is NOT A DRIVE - it is a desire or an interest. This matters because if it is considered a physical need, then sexual exploitation of girls in India, for example, is justifiable because it fills a male ""need"". If it is an interest or a drive, on the other hand, it can be viewed as the unacceptable exploitation is truly is.There is NO CONNECTION between size of penis/clitoris and sexual desire.There is NO CONNECTION between having a hymen intact and virginity. For women, there is only a 10% association between vaginal wetness and arousal. This is called non concordance. I'll say it again for the people in the back- just because a women is wet does not mean she is aroused. For men, there is a 50% association between wetness and arousal - much higher, but it still does not follow that just because any human is wet that they are aroused and welcoming sexual advances. A woman's collection of sexual parts are NOT CALLED A VAGINA - it's a VULVA. The vagina is the hole itself.There is no erectile dysfunction medication that works for women because women are too complex and orgasm happens in the brain, not the body.Flatliners lose desire for sex when stressed or depressed, but 10-20% of people actually desire sex more in those situations. Meditation/mindfulness usually helps with this.Not all women want or experience orgasms. And that's ok.What matters isn't so much your sexuality or body- it's how YOU FEEL ABOUT your sexuality and body! Learning to allow yourself to experience pleasure is the greatest gift you can give yourself and your partner.Great read, great tips, and could possibly save you lots of money on therapy. :-D"
29,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14036822-blair,5,"If you read only one book on human sexuality, make it Come as You Are. This isn't your standard sex book. There are no promises here that learning one trick will drive you or your lover wild. But there is a lot of science, presented in an approachable manner, that provides great insight into how people work sexually (and, to be honest, in general as well). The book's stated audience is women, but I think anyone can benefit from the science that Nagoski covers in her book, regardless of sex. Sure, if you are a guy you'll read some things that don't directly apply to you, but I recommend you read this book anyway. It is that important.Why? Because what this book teaches you is immently important to your health, your sexual well being, and just general understanding of how you, and those you are intimate with, work. For instance, Nagoski's discussion of the dual control model, or the ""brakes"" and ""accelerator"" of arousal, provides an understanding of people can have a different level of arousal for similar events.Nagoski also talks about how stress impacts your arousability, and how stress can affect level of arousal differently for people (some people more aroused, others much less). She discusses how stress worked in the past for humans (when running from lions, for instance), and how we no longer allow stress ourselves to complete the full stress cycle. This discussion of how we, as a society, don't allow stress to complete the cycle is important, regardless of how it affects your sex life. I thought her point of how our method of dealing with stress is to avoid stressors, when it would be much healthier to learn to allow the stress cycle to complete, spot-on and more sensible than the common advice to avoid stress.One important item the book covers is genital nonconcordance, or how the brain and genitals can react two very different ways to the same stimulus at the same instant. I'd argue that it is important not only for couples to understand that, but individuals, both men and women, and for society at large. Why? Because we have this assumption that the genitals are the best, or the only way, to determine if someone is turned on, and it has dangerous repercussions in our society.I'd love to point to any particular section and say that it is the most important section. But I can't. Nagoski has provided a whole book full of facts, research, and understanding that makes it impossible to say any one part is more important. The whole book is important. I doubt you'll get through the book without wondering, ""why haven't I learned this before?""Why haven't I learned this before? Because no one told us. But Ms. Nagoski has, in an very approachable, and very readable book. Please, consider purchasing it, and highlighting it. Mark it up and dog-ear it. I honestly think that this book is that important to your, your health, and that of our society at large."
30,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5251385-jacqueline,5,"This is a really interesting and important book that I would recommend to any of my girl friends (or any woman reading this, really, and any man who's curious) who struggle with their sex life and feeling completely comfortable with sexual matters, whether that involves a partner or not. Without going into too much detail about my own sexual issues (I know my loyal GR followers are thirsty for those juicy tidbits, but you'll have to buy me a beer first), I found this book incredibly educational. And not just involving sex and becoming more comfortable with your sexuality, but becoming comfortable with YOURSELF in general, and practicing self-compassion with all aspects of yourself. And that totally makes sense, because to be truly comfortable with sex, you need to be present and mindful, and that starts with working on yourself and being kind to yourself. How can you orgasm or enjoy sex if you hate yourself and feel like you're broken, or that there's something wrong with you?The author dispels a lot of myths involving sex which actually blew my mind. I always considered myself a relatively sex-positive and well-educated person in that sense, but there was actually so little that I knew, and so many misconceptions that I had.A few topics:- Arousal nonconcordance- Changing the context to enjoy sex- Spontaneous desire vs responsive desire- A lot of other things I'm too lazy to explain. You'll have to read the book yourself.Edit: I had to mention that this happens to be my 69th book read this year *chuckles immaturely*"

32,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,4,"Come As You Are: The Surprising New Science that Will Transform Your Sex Life has been on my to-read list for a while (I blame Hannah Witton), but I finally bought it as a birthday present for a friend who shares my interest in these subjects. Emily Nagoski’s book is a comprehensive guide to how people with vulvas can become more comfortable and fulfilled in their sex lives. It’s a little bit science text, a little bit self-help, and a lot of interesting discussion of the ways in which our mental states affect our physical wellbeing.Much of the book builds on research done by Erick Janssen and John Bancroft into a framework for sexual response involving two systems: the Sexual Excitement System, SES, your accelerator; and the Sexual Inhibition System, SIS, or your brake. This alone, as well as Nagoski’s related explication of the homologous nature of male and female sex organs, would make the book worth reading. The accelerator/brake framework offers a useful way of describing how external stimuli can work to turn one on or turn one off—these are not always direct inverses. Nagoski uses her experience as an academic and a sex therapist to translate the work of Janssen and Bancroft, as well as others, into understandable contexts for the rest of us. I really appreciate that, while the tone of this book is definitely one of therapy/self-help, it is relentlessly grounded in a scientific mindset and draws on the latest available information at the time. Nagoski refuses to fall back on reductive, binary stereotypes about how “men are like this” and “women are like that” when it comes to sex. She makes generalizations, of course—one must—while pointing out that the variation within a group is still greater than the variation between groups; i.e., we are all more the same than we are different.Along the same lines, Nagoski’s overall thesis—that whatever your experience, whatever your body’s responses, whatever you crave or desire to get yourself off, it’s normal—is also laudable. Come As You Are is prescriptive only in the sense that it wants you to find what works best for you. This is not a book full of “quick and easy tips” as promised on the cover of Cosmopolitan. Indeed, Nagoski regularly reminds the reader that gains in this area are almost always the result of dedicated effort and time. She doesn’t guarantee mind-blowing orgasms—but she does guarantee you’ll come away from this book with a better understanding of how our sexual response works.Now, this book doesn’t apply to me from a practical point of view for two reasons—I lack the right genitalia, and I’m asexual. But I don’t think that would disqualify someone as a potential reader. Really, people with vulvas should read this because it gives insight into their sex lives; people who might be into having sex with people with vulvas should read this to understand how to be more responsible, caring partners. Those of us who probably aren’t having sex with anyone can read this (if it’s not going to repulse you) to better understand this activity that everyone else seems fairly obsessed with.I don’t like how Nagoski frames asexuality. She defines it in a endnote, and through later implicit comparisons, as a lack of sexual desire. That’s not true—asexual people may or may not desire sex and might masturbate or even have sex with a partner if they so choose. Indeed, an asexual person with a vulva would probably find this book quite instructive even if all they’re interested in is self-pleasure. Asexuality is the lack of sexual attraction, an entire subject that Nagoski doesn’t really explore at all in this book. So, while the book overall tries to be agnostic about the partners of the subject, it doesn’t quite get the lived experience of asexuality right. Sigh.That gripe aside, it’s difficult to fault Come As You Are for its organization, depth of content, or goals. This is definitely more of a “sipping” book than it is something you swallow all at once—I pushed myself to read it all at once, because I needed to send it to my friend, and it still took me more than a week. The density of information here just makes it difficult (at least in my opinion) to fly through the book while still absorbing. If anything, you’d probably want to keep this book as reference material, returning to a chapter each time you need to refresh yourself about a particular point Nagoski makes.Overall, Come As You Are is a very thorough and compassionate look at a subject that is still not discussed seriously enough. (Even when we talk about female sexuality in most media, we often do it superficially or with an emphasis on pleasure rather than comfort and fulfillment. Female sexuality remains inextricably wrapped up in our patriarchal, heteronormative narratives about the roles different genders play in relationships and in sex.) This is the kind of book you want to grab to undo years of useless or non-existent sex education and to give you the permission to explore, if you want, what’s “normal” for you.

33,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1484853-simone,4,"This is an amazing book. A must read for anyone with a vagina or people interested in being sexually involved with vagina have-ers. As Nagoski argues for too long we've basically thought about women's sexuality (when we think about it) as men's sexuality lite. There's a model of men's sexuality which is overwhelmingly fast-responsive and concordant, and when women's sexuality doesn't match that ideal it's considered broken. But this book is about more than just the science behind why women's sexuality is different than men's sexuality. Not better, not worse, just different. This book is warm, funny, and generous. Nagoski encourages women to own all their feelings and be gentle with themselves, not just with regard to their sexuality, but in all aspects of their lives. More than any other book on the science of sex that I've read this is a book that focuses on the context of feelings and why understanding that contexts matters. ""The day you were born, the world had a choice about what to teach you about your body. It could have taught you to live with confidence and joy inside your body. It could have taught you that your body and your sexuality are beautiful gifts. But instead, the world taught you to feel critical and dissatisfied with your sexuality and your body. You were taught to value and expect something from your sexuality that does not match what your sexuality actually is. You were told a story about what would happen in your sexual life, and that story was false. You were lied to. I am pissed, on your behalf, at the world for that lie. And I'm working to create a world that doesn't lie to women about their bodies anymore. I can't change the injury that the world inflicted on you, and neither can you. What you can do is heal. Like your genitals, your sexuality is perfect and beautiful exactly as it is. You are normal. Beautiful. And as long as you're not experiencing pain, you're healthy. So when you notice yourself feeling dissatisfied with your sexuality, when you notice shame or frustration or grief, allow yourself to direct those feelings away from yourself and instead focus the emotions toward the culture that told you the wrong story.""Indeed. Everyone please read this book and we can rage against the culture together. "
34,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3335221-kaila,4,"It took me a long time to read this book because the writing style annoyed me so much. SO MUCH. The anecdotes, the smarmy metaphors, the constant use of Star Trek style explanations (Like a balloon and...SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS.) It got on my nerves. A LOT. She started talking about sleepy hedgehogs, the little monitor, and rats who listen to Iggy Pop, as well as others. I would have been happier with the science, I forgot what ""sleepy hedgehog"" meant basically immediately. It was like she was writing to be That Cool Professor Who Gets You Kids. I make Iggy Pop references! Y'all get that, right? We're on the level?It's very monogamous. Not straight, so that's good, but not a book for someone who identifies as asexual. If I remember correctly, all the examples in the book were in a long term, sexual, life partnership. That got frustrating.So why 4 stars?It's a self-help book. This book is therapy. It's about accepting yourself. There was a refrain she kept saying, ""You are ok. You are normal,"" and every time it made me cry. Writing that right now made me cry. Stupid crying. Being told I'm ok is like the number one thing to make me form a little puddle on the ground and ache about how I don't actually feel ok.It's heartbreaking that women (or maybe people in general) have to be told that, but here we are. Sexual shame is insidious and infiltrates all sorts of parts of someone's life. Come to find out, that's ok. That's normal. Embrace it and make it a part of your story so that it doesn't remain shame forever but is simply part of your tapestry, an intricately woven web of a million influences forming to make a beautiful, sexual being, who has learned to turn around and say This is Me and I Am Lovable."

I was so excited to find that her voice moved easily from radio to page, and I have to tell you, I have never recommended anything to EVERYONE IN THE WORLD more strongly. Yes. Literally everyone. This is not your average, run of the mill self-help book. This is a beautifully researched compendium by a PhD'd sex educator. Her voice is a fun, millennial-friendly one full of nerdy Tumblr-esque references and fantastic analogies that will have you exclaiming 'that makes so much sense!' every few pages. Nagoski also acknowledges the experience of all kinds of women, including survivors of trauma. She addresses but peels away all of the judgement strewn about in our culture about women's bodies and sexualities, in all its diversity. She is sex-positive and body-positive.

40,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5975841-stephanie,5,"  Whether or not you are sexually active, have a desire or not to be sexually active ever, I highly recommend this book. It addresses sexuality and sex and so much more from a more scientific standpoint, without coming across as inaccessible because of the science. On the contrary, it is very accessible, with just the right amount of science and supporting anecdotes to really round it out.   On a more personal note, I found this book not only rather enlightening in a more general sense, but it also offered me a sense of relief and gratitude. One of the mantras goes “You are normal” – everyone is made of the same parts, just arranged in different ways. It helped me feel vindicated, in a way, as it drove home sneaking suspicions that I had been beginning to have about sex and sexual performance, all the while supporting it with the results of years of scientific sex and sex education research. It pretty well gave me the final tools to finish the undoing of negative ideas/views which had been planted in my head as I grew up (whether consciously or unconsciously) and were reinforced during my first (and, well, bad) relationship, and which I had been subsequently slowly hacking away at ever since then.   By and large, it goes to show and prove – successfully, I might add – how much context affects not only how we view sex, but also how we react/act in the moment as well. Ms. Nagoski offers up many different types of situations between her aggregate “characters” and the various pulled-from-real-life example she uses to illustrate different points. This variety helps support and confirm her points that everyone is made of the same stuff, just organized in a different way, and that you are normal despite what you may have been taught. It makes for rich and varied examples, to get an idea of just how many ways there are to be different yet normal, and how there is not really one “mold” into which everyone or even a majority (or even a minority!) will be able to fit.  In particular focus during one chapter, she even acknowledges – without any shying away from – the different filters through which we learn about sexuality such as the media, morality, and religion. The cultural context of sex is very much a “thing,” and something which we all have been doused in, though the exact proportions of that mixture is varies widely. There are some aspects of this cultural context which are flat out wrong – e.g. about the hymen being a sign of virginity – and have been used to enforce certain ideals – e.g. the “lack” of a hymen means a woman has has sex and is no longer a virgin. Ms. Nagoski goes through some of these examples, and details further the myth about the hymen as well as the scientific design and purpose (or really, lack thereof) of the hymen in women.  Ms. Nagoski covers this and so much more in Come as You Are, and it is well worth the time spent reading it, and also doing the little physical, emotional, and experiential examinations and reflections that she provides. I have recommended it to so many of my friends already, and I will keep wholeheartedly recommending it to anyone who has ever wondered, even for a moment, about any little thing regarding sex – the physical aspect, the emotional aspect, the cultural aspect, anything. Really, this is a must-read book for everyone, whether they have very little or quite a lot of experience with sex and all it entails. Single, married, gay, asexual, everyone can benefit in some way from reading Come as You Are. And if you are looking for futher reading, or to read the studies and cases she reference, there is a lenghty and accessible list of references at the back for further information.Favorite Quotes/Ideas:  This may be the most important consequence of understanding the way context influences how your brain processes sexually relevant stimuli: When sex doesn’t feel great, it doesn’t mean there’s something wrong with you. Maybe there’s been a change in your external circumstances or your other motivational systems (like stress) that’s influencing your sexual response. Which means that you can create positive change without changing you. – page 91  (view spoiler)[But in modern culture, there’s a contradiction built into the social remedies to stress. On the one hand, being around other people is often a core part of allowing our stress response to complete, particularly for women. On the other hand, we put the brakes on, self-inhibiting our stress response, in order to stay socially appropriate and not make other people uncomfortable. We hold on to our incomplete stress response in order to access the security of being with our tribe.  And, of course, this contradiction is even more pronounced for women, who are the culturally sanctioned “managers of relationships.” When the going gets tough in a heterosexual relationship, it often falls to the woman to rein in her own stress response, in order to create space for the man to feel his Feels. In other words, if there is stress in a relationship, cultural rules make it likely to impact the woman more than the man, and it’s likely to impact her sexual interest and response. And because she has to hold on to her stress, so that her partner can let his go, she is more likely to become stuck in her stress, while he moves through his. – page 145  Emotional pain is exhausting, and sometimes it’s necessary to take a break from the pain, numb out for a while. Just remember what happens when the sedated lion comes out from under anesthesia. The cycle has to complete, it wants to complete. Self-compassion is being patient with yourself through that process—and being patient with yourself when you need to take a break. – page 179 (hide spoiler)]  And even though I’d love you to find meaning in every page, every paragraph of this book, cherry-pick from here, too. We’re all different, so what’s relevant for you is definitely, absolutely not the same as what’s relevant for me or for any of the many hundreds of women I’ve taught. Take what’s relevant. Ignore what isn’t; it’s there for somebody else who needs it. – page 185  Genital response doesn’t mean anything but sexually relevant--expecting, essentially a conditioned reflex—not enjoying. It doesn’t indicate desire or pleasure or anything else. And by carving out space, once and for all, for nonconcordance, we’re actually making the world a better place for everyone. – page 205  (view spoiler)[But pathologizing responsive desire as low desire isn’t the worst consequence of the sex-as-drive myth. There’s a larger social justice reason for sex educators’ fighting against the myth of sex as a drive for more than a hundred years. A far worse consequence is that when sex is conceptualized as a need, it creates an environment that fosters men’s sense of sexual entitlement. […] Because if sex is a drive, like hunger, then potential partners are like food. Or like animals to be hunted for food.  And that’s both factually incorrect and just wrong. – page 232  Give Partner B space and time away from sex. Let sex drop away from your relationship—for a little while—and be there, fully present, emotionally and physically. Lavish your partner with affection, on the understanding that affection is not a preamble to sex. Be warm and generous with your love. You won’t run out.  Put simply, the best way to deal with differential desire is: Be kind to each other. – page 255  […B]ut more importantly I gained a radically more healthful attitude: that a woman’s body and her pleasure belong to her and no one else; that it’s possible to say no to intercourse without saying no to all other things that come with it—the love and the affection and the pleasure and the play; and that my own internal experience was a legitimate guide for whether or not I wanted to try something. – page 305 (hide spoiler)]"

I'm really glad I got over myself, because this book is fantastic.There's a lot of science referenced here, which she footnotes so you can dig even further if you want. And the science is stuff above, beyond, and more recent than what I learned in high school and college. Which is why I was constantly amazed that what I learned (in the classroom, and by living in society) was so very wrong. The crux of why is that sex has been studied and understood as a men-as-default thing, which by nature sets up the differences between the sexes as ""women are broken"". The truth, as the author repeats often, is that there is no default or normal, and as long as you aren't experiencing pain with sex, your sexuality is healthy and normal. She goes into the biological aspects (how we all have the same parts, arranged in different ways), the psychological aspects (how control centers in the brain act as taskmasters and why we experience frustration, orgasm, nonconcordance, etc), the physiological aspects (how you feel about how you feel during sex, for example, being a huge detractor from enjoying the experience), the cultural aspects (contrary to social shorthand, sex is NOT a drive), etc. She throws in anecdotes as well, which I found helpful in breaking up the science parts and giving me a context for real-life application. She also has worksheets and suggestions about addressing any of a myriad of issues, which she encounters commonly as a human sexuality educator. Occasionally, as the book goes on, her repeating of phrases and question/answer posing felt a little too ""in the classroom"" to me...I didn't feel like she was speaking down to me, necessarily, but it made me twitch just a bit.Overall, I really enjoyed this book: I learned a lot, it empowered me to improve some areas of my sexuality that I've been unsatisfied with (and did that beyond platitudes, with actual, practical advice), and it made me realize the root of some of my core issues (not just as pertains to sex, but with my self-esteem, my self-definition as an adult woman, my relationship fears, etc). I guarantee you, even if you're 100% happy with your sexuality and body, you'll still get something out of this book. And while the tone is definitely specifically aimed at women, it's got a lot of info in there useful to men (in understanding their own biology, brain relationship to sexuality, etc)."
42,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12818720-kazen,3,"In medicine there's a knowledge translation gap. Information about a new treatment or a better way of doing things takes, on average, fifteen years to become standard practice. Fifteen years! In the realm of human sexuality, though, the gap feels more like thirty years. Nagoski navigates that chasm by taking clinical research, wrapping it in a bit of self-help, and presenting it in an approachable way.And the information is so important. She busts sexual myths and beliefs that media, medicine, and moral authorities have perpetuated in our culture. Women rarely experience spontaneous desire, so they're broken (nope, it's probably responsive desire instead). If a woman is wet, she's aroused (nope, there's this thing called non-concordance - genitals don't always match mood). If a woman is too stressed to be into sex, she should just lighten up (nope, but completing the stress cycle may help). If you have or interact with a vulva there's lots of ideas and exercises that help, as the title states, to transform your sex life.Nagoski is a professor and the book feels a bit like a sexuality 101 lecture given to incoming freshmen. The tone is informal, she drops in references to Snapchat and Facebook, and the main ideas get repeated a ton. This probably works very well over the course of a semester-long class but squished into 400 pages it feels like a bit much.I didn't mind the informal tone, perhaps because I listened to the audiobook. The author reads it herself and her investment in and passion for the material come through loud and clear. While some things still irked me (""feels"" regularly substituted for ""feelings"", for example) sex can be an offputting subject and the tone will make it more accessible to more people, something I'm all for.I'm also all for the way she acknowledges and accepts people of all sexualities and orientations. One of the four couples followed through the book is lesbian. There are shoutouts when what she's talking about won't match the experience, say, of trans or polyamorous people. Sections dealing with violence against women are marked so you can skip them if you'd like.Reading this book has helped me reexamine my sex life and given me tools to go about fine tuning things I'm not happy with. Even if you're completely happy with what happens in the bedroom you'll still learn about how a woman's body works, which is valuable to pretty much everyone. Read and rock on, sister."
43,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35059638-lov2laf,5,"This is in the top three best non-fiction books I've ever read. This book truly is life changing...its title makes a bold claim but I'd say it doesn't go far enough...it'll not only transform your sex-life, it will transform your *entire* life if you let it. It's much more than a how-to sex manual or some biology textbook on how the female body works. The author, Emily Nagoski, gives us the red pill from the Matrix and reveals much more and does so in an amazingly engaging way...as if she's one of your best friends who's sat you down to have a deep talk...and some good laughs. You can really feel how much the author cares for both the women and men who read her book...which is a nice bonus.This is not one of those vague doctor-like, ""Hey, if you just remove stress, improve your self-esteem and amp up the romance you'll love sex!""...like, yeah, no kidding Sherlock...No, no, no...In this case, the author breaks down the fundamentals of the body, blows away myths, turns things on their head, describes various sex-life scenarios and then actually gives us strategies that *work*...work to do what, you ask? To make whatever you have, better. In her writing, the author pulls in a ton of science, research and proven psychological methods, lending credibility to her already credible background as a sex educator so you know what you're reading isn't fluff or some new fad psycho-babble.I think this is a fantastic book for any woman to read, from those who love their sex life to self-proclaimed sex experts to the clueless to the average to the asexuals to those who have female sexual dysfunction to those who are frustrated or bored or to those recovering from sexual trauma. The author is sensitive to all women and ""Come as you are"" is not just a clever throw away line for the title of her book. This is a fantastic read for any woman that fundamentally wants to understand herself and to any person that wants physical intimacy with a woman.Loved this book! "
44,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3760321-gauri,5,"I’d highly recommend (which is one level below mandatory reading) this book to cis women or partners of cis women. There are two main aspects that the book is split into: (1) exactly how sexuality is studied and thought about from a current scientific and psychological standpoint, and how that’s different from what our common perceptions of sexuality is like (2) how one’s mental health and mindframes largely impact one’s sexual experiences, and solutions to develop a healthier outlook and manage emotions better with specificity on better sexual health For people who have already worked on mental health from a CBT or DBT approach and/or have practiced mindfulness and meditation, the latter part of this book will be very familiar."
45,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50817191-alecsandra-litu,5,"I found this book on Alina's feed in Goodreads and got captivated by its gorgeous cover :) Considering the sensitive topic (woman's sexuality), I was wondering if it would be filled with the Cosmo type of nonsense, or it will actually be useful for me and my clients. But if you're a woman wondering whether or not you're a ""normal"" sexual being, or struggling with anything related to sex (desire, arousal, orgasm...), read it! It's a little gem - deeply human and witty. Also, if you're a guy (or gal for that matter), wondering if your partner's broken - yes, read it! And for you, the best part is that Emily has short summaries at the end of each chapter, so you only need to go through those to start connecting to your partner's issues in a healthier way.Most of all, this book is not just about sex, but it's mostly about how our emotional mind works in a sexual context. And there's tons of information about how to manage your emotions, create better contexts and live happier sex lives. In short, here are my top 3 favorite things about this book:1. Research based - she's got a Ph.D. on the topic and has been researching and teaching it for 20 years2. Brilliant metaphors - they make dry concepts come alive and stick, so I can't wait to use them in my trainings or 1-2-1 sessions3. Practical - no bullshit, simple, funny and clear"

48,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10877329-alix,4,"Whew, this felt like a really long read. I went into it knowing there’d be a lot of science/learning, but it still felt like a lot to me. I appreciate that the author is giving you advice and providing the why for everything along the way. I didn’t appreciate the “I’ll teach you this in chapter nine” or “I’m going to teach you this, explain that, and you’ll understand such and such”. It felt so redundant! All in all, I learned things and reflected a lot. Hooray for more knowledge and understanding of women’s sexual health. 🙌🏼"
49,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/72655545-kim,5,I am a better man for reading this book !
50,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/611031-kater-cheek,3,"My general rule of thumb for non-fiction is that if I learn one new thing that changes my view of the world, it's worth the time it took to read it. I certainly learned some important things about women's sexuality in this book. How could I not? As Nagoski says, women's sexuality in this culture is usually depicted as ""exactly like men's, only not as good."" It's no big secret that there's a lot of baggage surrounding cultural expectations of women's sexuality. We're told practically from birth that we are sex objects, and that we should simultaneously live up to this and fight against this. We should enjoy sex enthusiastically and also never enjoy sex. We're lied to again and again, sometimes in ridiculous ways. One of the biggest eye-openers in this book was exposing the lie that a woman's body-response or lack of response to a sexually charged situation reflects her mental state. That is, if a woman says she's ready for sex but she's not wet, it doesn't mean she's lying. If a woman is wet but says she's not turned on, it also doesn't mean she's lying. Just because a woman got wet (or even orgasmed) during rape does not mean that she ""secretly wanted it"" any more than a boy having an erection watching a nature video means that he secretly craves hot monkey love or that a middle-aged man not being able to get it up while in the presence of a beautiful woman means that he's suddenly become gay. We don't claim those men are lying, but our culture has so many terrible ideas around women and sex that the default answer is usually ""whatever she's doing is wrong."" It's kind of like parenting in that way. Doesn't matter what you do, it's wrong.Nagoski offers a few tips for how to get past these blocks. She uses the metaphors of ""accelerator"" (things that make a person aroused) and ""brake"" (things/situations that stop arousal.) A pink Viagra hasn't been invented because most of the time if a woman isn't having the amount of sex she wants it's not because of physiological issues. She gives a few pointers on how to get through the stress cycle so that stress won't put the brakes on (animals fleeing danger rarely stop to get nookie. Stress frequently tamps down on non-essential activities, such as getting aroused.) She has a few pointers on how to combat that age-old problem of differing sex drives between couples.She also fights against the notion of sex as a ""drive."" It's like curiosity. People are healthier if they can indulge in it, and generally are born with a desire for it, but not satisfying your desire for sex won't cause any tissue damage, nor will it kill you any more than not finding out how that mystery novel ended will kill you. You might want it real bad, but it's not a need like food or sleep. This is an insidious myth, especially when it plays into my pet peeve of the people who teach their boys and girls that a woman is put on earth to satisfy men's ""need"" for sex.Some of how the book is structured is useful. Some is less useful. It has sections on physiology, neurology, and psychology. It has notes sections to fill in your own experiences, which I generally dislike (and also dislike in this situation.) It feels like pointless fill, a waste of paper. Nagoski uses very modern language, such as tl;dr sections at the end for people who want a summary of the chapter. She also has the tendency to introduce characters as examples, then cut off before she answers their question with a ""we'll answer that in Chapter X.""The most frustrating thing about this book were that not all of the metaphors worked for me. Some of them did, such as the brake and accelerator. Others just confused me. She talked about an internal ""monitor"" but I never was able to grasp that. I understood it a little better when she brought in the map/terrain discrepancy analogy, but I never liked the ""monitor"" metaphor. I also didn't like the ""emotion is like a tunnel, you have to get through it."" She brought up the ""you have to get through your emotions"" point more than once, emphasizing it as crucially important to a healthy life of any way, but it just plain did not make sense to me. Neither did ""treat your sexuality gently and with kindness, like a sleepy hedgehog."" I just can't make good use of that.This book was valuable to me because I haven't read many books about women's sexuality so I got a lot of insightful ideas to think about. Her writing isn't perfect, but her research was completely new to me, so it was worth a little bit of confusion."
51,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1724074-callista-cassady,5,"You don't need to read this if you meet all the following criteria: you've never felt ashamed or othered for your emotional response to anything, you've got the stress cycle down pat, you know that sex isn't a drive, you've never had a sexual or emotional response that you didn't utterly understand and agree with, and you don't know anyone that ever has. Yeah, you need to read this. One note, however. If you, like me, have been blaming yourself for everything under the sun your whole life, it will be difficult to read. If you avoid hugs because they make you cry, if words get stuck in your throat until you feel like you're suffocating, you have to read this. You won't enjoy it, not really, but you need it."

I learned so much from Nagoski (her fact checking about the hymen blew my mind) and truly appreciated her resounding exhortation, ""you are normal."" Her insights will go a long way toward undoing the misinformation so many of us have been fed and even patriarchal oppression. I feel incredibly empowered!"
53,1476762090,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14375759-kara,5,"This was quite good. Everyone should read this, but especially women. The concepts of brakes and accelerator alone are worth the effort, and things like non concordance (even if you are aware of what that is already) and responsive vs spontaneous desire simply add more motivation to pick this up immediately.

Added to my list of facts I am gonna tell people about on the next party!Some of the things in the book that made me go "":-O"" while reading: 1. No one really knows what the hymen is for and yet it is one of the most discussed body parts ???2. The female orgasm has no evolutionary function (and yet is so much fun)3. Why sex with an abuser is 50 times better and what's wrong with that4. Monogamy is NOT the problem It is amazing how she touches so many subjects in the book without it getting too big or too much. Nagoski manages to do the balancing act and writes both scientifically and reader-friendly. And, boy, is there a lot of myths I agreed on and did not know about. I liked that she also added an appendix with the science and papers she used for the books which makes it a whole lot more approachable. The one thing I did have to get used to was her writing style as it seemed to my kind of over the top but I guess that comes with writing a science book for a public audience.She has a talent for inventing funny allegories or examples that carry her message!It is practical. It is helpful. It teaches you how to be gentle with yourself. (The fact that she repeated that we are all normal and all beautiful annoyed me in the beginning and then - when I allowed it - made me tear up everytime). This aspect was my favorite part about the book because she got into big detail about how emotions and context work (in relationships and sexual relationships) and I felt like I just attended a very good therapy session with my therapist.This is definitely a book I'd recommend to all of my friends."
