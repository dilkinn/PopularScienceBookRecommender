0,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,4,"What a fun book! I love books that are chock-full of facts and that is what Liquid Rules is. Mark Miodownik takes us along on a flight he was on from London to San Francisco. Now, if you don't fancy being on a plane that long, not to worry. You'll still be able to sit in a comfy chair whilst reading this book, you won't feel any turbulence (though if you're in an earthquake-prone area you might feel the ground shake), and you won't be holding your breath because your neighbour inconsiderately indulged in a great big bowl of beans before climbing aboard. You will, however, probably have to get up and get your own drink and food (which will no doubt taste better than that on a plane so it's worth it), and you won't have a pilot directing you to stay in your seat if you do experience an earthquake. So, let's take off. Mr. Miodownik discusses several different liquids that are involved in his flight. Beginning with the peanut butter he is not allowed to take on board, he breaks the liquids down to a molecular level, explaining why it is they behave in the manner they do. Why do some liquids flow more than others? Why are some viscous? Why can't you pour peanut butter into a glass and drink it and why the hell can't airport security tell the difference between innocent peanut butter and an explosive? We learn about the fuels that power planes, we learn why some are more combustible than others. We next get to the stickiness of liquids and learn that planes' wings are glued on! Thankfully I never sat next to Mr. Miodownik on a flight because I'd be worried the entire time that the wings would fall off (though he does explains why this is not going to happen). After reading that, I couldn't help but thinking of all the following liquids discussed in a different setting than the plane flying over an ocean. Instead, you're on the ground, on a deserted island, after the glue melted and the plane's wings fell off. If you're lucky, your parachute worked and you just happened to be over a tiny bit of land at the time. So now we've entered ""Lost"" and liquids take on a whole new meaning. Maybe your luck went even further and the drinks trolley happened to land next to you on the island. You have bottles of water, juice, and if you're really lucky, wine! So as we learn why we get drunk, what makes the molecules and chemicals in alcohol affect us in the way that they do, you can picture yourself sitting on a beach, enjoying a nice glass of red whilst watching the sun set over the horizon. We also learn about oceans -- why we can swim and float, how tsunamis work, and why tides crash against the shore. We learn about LCD screens, which you probably won't be able to watch now, which is disappointing because you were in the middle of a movie when the plane unfortunately decided to break apart. We learn about clouds, which is important to know when you're stuck on a deserted island.... when you see certain kinds, you will know you better get your ass moving and start working on a shelter rather than sitting and wondering how the movie ended. We learn how to brew the perfect cups of coffee and tea, just in case you are lucky and some coffee beans or tea leaves happened to make their way to the island with you. Of course, you'll need to be able to start a fire so hopefully you can find some dry wood and.... damn! Now you remember airport security took your lighter and matches and you refused to go to Girl/Boy Scouts when you were a kid which means you don't know how to start a fire by rubbing two sticks together. Now you have no way of making a fire and all the knowledge you've just acquired about brewing the perfect cup of tea or coffee is wasted. Know what else you've just learned and can't make? Soap. Turns out you need ashes to make soap and ashes come from fire sooo... looks like you're SOL. Why oh why couldn't they have let you take just one lighter with you aboard the plane??? Didn't they care how much it would help your chance of survival if the plane's wings fell off and you managed to safely float to a deserted island somewhere in the middle of a huge ocean? Such uncaring people!Next we learn about volcanoes and lava and you really hope your luck holds out and this island you've found yourself on is not actually an active volcano.... if it is, well..... you're not so lucky after all.The author ends the book discussing ways in which we can use liquids to make our materials more sustainable, which may or may not be of use to you on your new island home.All in all, this was a very interesting read. Sometimes the chemistry was a bit over my head but I learned a lot which is the most important factor when reading NF. I was even able to share a fun tidbit with a co-worker this morning -- that sticky stuff on the back of a Post-It note? It's rubber! So, fun book, fun facts = a book worth reading.One question I'm left with after reading this book though, is how the hell did the author get a DIRECT flight from London to San Francisco???"
1,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3292905-julie,4,A surprisingly fun read. The author takes us on a journey on an airplane with some delightful side trips including various discoveries. My favorite part was when he describes making a refreshing cup of tea. Narration by Michael Page is sublime.
2,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8101737-peter-tillman,4,"I enjoyed this well-researched book by a materials scientist. He mixes stuff from his own experience with more general commentary. It's an easy, non-technical read, though he gets a bit preachy at times. Here's the best review I saw online, from Science magazine: https://blogs.sciencemag.org/books/20... This is the one to read first, and I don't have much to add. (For some reason, this edition is showing a Spanish blurb.) The framing device, a flight from London to San Francisco, worked pretty well, but got a little strained. Overall: 3.7 stars, rounded up. Recommended reading.From my notes: Kerosene, aka jet fuel. Pretty safe to handle, but it has a LOT of potential energy. A fully-fueled jetliner makes a fine flying bomb, as we discovered in the terror attacks on 9-11-2001.The author liked to go swimming in the sea off Dublin, even in winter -- a surprisingly popular activity there. Until one day, when he went out by himself, and found out why no one else was there.... He almost drowned.And I loved the story of the invention of the ballpoint pen! By a Hungarian named Biro, in the 1940s. Ballpoints are still called ""biros"" in the UK. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballpoi... His chapter on the origins and history of inks and pens, from ancient Egypt to modern times, is one of the highlights of the book."
3,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,4,"The amount of stuff we consume these days is staggering, but there are some things that we use day in day out that barely get our attention, the water that comes out of the tap that goes into the kettle to make your coffee. The liquid soap that you use to wash your hands, the ink that stays in the pen until you scribble on a notepad, the glass of something cold that helps you relax at the end of a busy week. All of these are liquids and they all lubricate our lives in one way or another.But, if someone was to place three glasses full of clear liquids in front of you, which could you drink that is essential to life, which would power an aircraft and which would kill you if you knocked it over? Mark Miodownik is best placed to explain all of these things being a materials engineer and Professor of Materials and Society at UCL and in this highly entertaining journey from London to San Francisco on a plane he describes and enlightens us about all the liquids that we use in the modern world. Beginning as he passes through security, and why we can't take more than 100ml of fluids on board now, on to the pre-dinner drinks, the oceans that he is flying over and what liquids hold the plane he is on together.The film he watches after diner allows him to explain liquid crystals and the way that most modern TV's work before he nods off and wakes up dribbling on the passenger alongside him. From a discussion on body fluids, he moves swiftly onto the delights of coffee and tea and why they don't taste quite the same over the Atlantic. A wash and brush up and then onto the history of inks, musings about clouds and liquids that sometimes think that they are solids, liquids that can flow uphill and new modern technologies like self-healing roads. I thought that was a great companion volume to Stuff Matters and another very well written book by Miodownik. He has used a fair amount of artistic license to ensure that the narrative flows and to give him plenty of subjects to discuss as he travels from the UK to the United States. I do like the way that he talks about science in an engaging manner and the whole book is stuffed full of facts and interesting anecdotes, but there is only so much you can do from the viewpoint of an airline seat and he does veer a little off course occasionally. Well worth reading. 4.5 stars"
4,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9628169-charles-j,4,"""Liquid Rules,"" like most good books in its genre, explains in an interesting way why certain things are the way they are. This is popularized science, and such books tend to fall into one of two categories, straight science or politicized science. I could have, if I had wanted to read the latter on vacation, picked instead ""The Uninhabitable Earth,"" a recent screed on global warming by David Wallace-Wells. Fortunately, however, I chose wisely, and therefore learned a few things while enjoying myself, instead of choking on the dry and boring leftovers of global warming alarmism.The frame of ""Liquid Rules"" is of a London to San Francisco flight, during which the author, Mark Miodownik (a materials scientist), meditates on the various liquids with which he comes into contact. Expertly and seamlessly worked into each discussion is the science behind liquids. Miodownik begins, as the plane takes off, with explosive liquids, not so much of the terrorist kind but of the fuel kind, focusing on kerosene (which, technically, is not explosive). Then, as he tries to relax, intoxicating liquids, where he confirms what I’ve tended to believe, that most wine appreciation is essentially a fraud, as shown by among other things that experts given white wine dyed red almost uniformly describe it with the nomenclature they use only for red wines. Next comes water. We also get glues; paints; expectorated bodily fluids such as saliva and mucus; cleaning fluids; coolants; ink; clouds; and magma. All in all, a fascinating brief tour.Miodownik manages to get his facts right nearly one hundred percent of the time, a rare feat for popularized writing, which for some reason seems to attract basic errors like flies to honey, even though you’d think editors would find it easier to fact check than technical writing. And I certainly learned a wide variety of interesting facts, some about liquids, some only indirectly related. For example, the master nurse Florence Nightingale was not only a crusader for sanitation in military hospitals in the Crimean War; she was also a non-trivial mathematician, and, more importantly, the inventor of new graphical means of presenting data, including a type of pie chart. (She is not to blame for PowerPoint.) Beyond mere interesting facts, two major thoughts occurred to me on reading this book, one about the history of science, the other about airplane service. They are grumpy and only tangentially related to the book, I warn you.Ruminating on ink, Miodownik ascribes the invention of the fountain pen to engineers employed by “the caliph of the Maghreb . . . in the year 974.” Of itself, this is of only passing interest, but if examined closely, it is emblematic of the political corruption of the history of science. One part of that corruption is that false claims for Islamic scientific superiority completely pervade popular writing about science history, due to an unceasing global campaign of propaganda by Muslim apologists. If you read any Wikipedia article about any scientific invention prior to A.D. 1800 or so, for example, you are nearly certain to be treated to a lengthy discourse, in a special section, about how Muslims, or those living under Muslim rule, invented the object or process in question. Books are not much better, though the publishing process sometimes culls out the most obvious falsehoods.This is not terribly surprising; it is the normal approach for all groups with a severe inferiority complex. The Soviets and the East Germans, for example, used to claim that Communists invented everything, from fire to the telephone. But that had much less impact on public knowledge, because there was no pressure in the West to believe such silly things, and it was before the internet and Wikipedia, when facts were always filtered through professional editors rather than propagated directly to the masses by bored, unemployed ideologues who cannot be made responsible for errors or lies. Back then, you had to read Pravda, or visit an East Bloc museum, to even hear the claims. Today, though, it’s not just Muslims pushing self-puffery, because Muslims are an approved victim group in the liturgy of intersectionality. And lifting them out of oppression requires, by all people who are woke, exaggerating or manufacturing historical contributions for the chosen groups, including Muslims. We are doubtless only a year or two away from Muslim History Month, if any free months can be found. You heard it here first.So presumably Wikipedia is from where Miodownik got this obscure tidbit on a Fatimid caliph’s supposed role in inventing the fountain pen. But if examined closely, one can see how the claim is totally false, and how such false claims are dealt into common knowledge. A fountain pen is a pen with a reservoir that applies ink to the page by capillary action, a difficult technical task. Although he does say he thinks that “this seems unlikely,” due to its difficulty, Miodownik also states as fact that the caliph “was presented with the first fountain pen recorded in history.” The only source for this appears to be an article from 1981 in the Journal of Semitic Studies, entitled “A Medieval Islamic Prototype of the Fountain Pen?” Wikipedia also summarizes the takeaway of the article as the caliph “was provided” such a pen. But the article actually only reports that the caliph asked for a pen with a reservoir, that could be held upside down, and when told this was not possible, replied “It is possible if God so wills.” There is no suggestion such a pen was really made, or even developed in theory, and given that it was only in the nineteenth century that such a pen was created, after innumerable failures (including by Leonardo da Vinci), the chances are pretty clearly zero that it was. Yet we are expected to swallow this, and thousands of other similarly dubious claims, as evidence that supposedly oppressed groups really are responsible for modern science and the benefits of the modern world, instead of hated straight white males. Such propaganda is wholesaled across our entire society, in an attempt to, for a wide variety of supposedly oppressed groups, either claim accomplishments that they did not make, or exaggerate or manufacture the importance of unimportant accomplishments.True, inventors in Islamic societies for a few hundred years made a variety of second-order scientific discoveries, some of which were used as building blocks by later, far more successful, Western scientists. To call those, as they always are, “Muslim inventions” is also propaganda; it ignores that many or most inventions in the Golden Age of Islam were actually done by Christians or Jews, since Islam always had a tense relationship with science. (It also gives its propaganda nature away by that Western discoveries are not called “Christian inventions.”) By itself, how the fountain pen was invented is not very important. But this little propaganda vignette illustrates the corruption of reality by political ideology. Tens of millions of people over the past several years, since this project really got going, have had implanted in their brains the delusional idea that Islam, or for that matter any culture other than the West, had a great deal to do with modern science. Is this the worst thing ever? I suppose not, but it’s just another example of the rank stupidity of the present. Indulging fantasies about the past is no way to make the future flourish.Let’s switch focus to a different oppressed group: airline passengers. Since Miodownik is on an airline flight, in economy class, he notes several times in passing the various accompanying discomforts, chief among them awful service. He discusses the tea and coffee he is offered, by a flight attendant “who looked at me with a combination of boredom and impatience.” Bingo. I’ve been flying for thirty years now, and I never cease to be amazed at how the abysmal service of flight attendants every year manages to plumb new depths. But why is this?Bad service, meaning incompetent, rude, or nonexistent, is a different complaint from the general discomfort of flying, where we are all subjected to security theater and are packed into ever smaller seats with ever fewer amenities. That is a function of cost, and the simple fact is that most people demand incompatible ends—they want the cheapest possible flights, and they then complain when they are offered the cheapest possible way of getting them somewhere. Moreover, the airlines, due to the power of big data and algorithms, have the upper hand, able for the first time in many decades to consistently extract profits (aided hugely by the failure of US regulators to forbid anti-competitive consolidation), by slicing and dicing the pricing of flights and amenities. But that is not why service by flight attendants is bad.Flight attendants today do almost no actual work. They provide nearly zero service even on the longest flights. We can all attest to this, or at least economy class flyers can. I was on a fourteen-hour flight last year, and a few hours after takeoff, small bottles of water were offered. When I declined, I was admonished in no uncertain terms that the offer would not be repeated, so I had better take it; the tone made clear I was not to ask later, either. When yesterday I flew on a three-hour flight, the four economy-class flight attendants relaxed, reading books and using iPads, in the very back of the plane (except for one in first class)—and drew a thick, opaque curtain between themselves and the passengers so they would not be bothered. They only appeared in the aisles twice: once to throw crackers at us, and once right before landing to flog credit cards to a captive audience.Oh, sure, there are occasional excellent flight attendants who go above and beyond the unbelievably minimal service requirements set by the airlines. My family had one on a flight five or six years ago. Not since then, though. And the exception proves the rule. Supposedly Southwest flight attendants are better, though in my limited experience they don’t actually provide service, they’re just somewhat more pleasant.The natural evolution of this would be to have fewer flight attendants. From the airlines’ perspective, a lot of money could be saved by not paying people to do nothing. But FAA regulations (14 CFR § 121.391) require a set number of flight attendants, and the required number of flight attendants has not changed since 1965. The FAA’s theory is that flight attendants are there for the passengers’ safety. From the FAA’s perspective, this is true. But from the perspective of both the airlines and the passengers, it is not true, since flight attendants have always had the dual, independent, roles of service and safety. In practice, the former role is vastly more important, given that safety incidents in which flight attendants are relevant are vanishingly few.If anyone’s safety is important to attendants, it is theirs—witness their rage in 2013 when their union howled down the FAA’s desire to allow short pocketknives on flights again—and then in 2017 demanded, and got, a federal law forbidding the FAA from ever permitting such a thing, openly celebrating their victory over the infamous “knife lobby.” Heaven forbid that flight attendants take any risk, no matter how small, when the costs can instead be pushed off onto passengers! And on the very few times I’ve seen a call button pressed in the past ten years, the barely restrained anger of the flight attendant at being summoned like a servant by someone she regards as a peon, when she finally shows up, is always a sight to behold. Along similar lines, on most flights the “fasten seat belts” sign is on for seventy or more percent of the flight, not for safety reasons, but to discourage movement that might inconvenience the attendants (and also to limit possible liability for the airlines, in the very unlikely event of enough unexpected turbulence to injure unsecured passengers). Twenty years ago, the norm was to turn off the sign during the middle phase of ascent. It certainly suits flight attendants’ hauteur to claim their primary role is safety. But in a free economic system, now that on any flight less than five hours there is essentially zero service, the airlines, given they cannot trim the number of attendants, would instead require them to provide service, so as to achieve customer satisfaction. But they don’t. Why? As far as I can tell, this is largely a function of unions, and also of anti-discrimination laws.The union has to exercise its power in some way. It can’t negotiate on keeping its members’ jobs, because they aren’t under any threat. They could negotiate on pay, but as with most unions, that is not their primary goal, or at least it does not appear to be. Their primary goal seems to be to allow flight attendants to choose flight assignments based on seniority. This means that the most elderly, and widest, grim battleaxes serve on the plum long-haul flights, where service would be most necessary, but where the attendants can instead run their eBay stores from the back of the plane while relaxing (something I have personally witnessed).In a brief search, I quickly turned up a 2016 Washington Post article, which describes what else the unions are now doing for their members. “The flight attendants union has been pushing for some time now for federal legislation that would require airlines to give them the same minimum 10 hours rest between flights that pilots must receive.” Yup, really. Now those who serve us coffee and tea (rarely and badly) need more rest. Their rationale? “Since Sept. 11, we became the last line of defense in aviation security,” said Sara Nelson, a United Airlines flight attendant who became international president of The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, AFL-CIO, in June 2014. ‘Flight attendants handle threats and security threats all the time that many passengers don’t even know about.’ ” Sure they do. Right after they finish shipping their latest eBay purchase. The reality is that flight attendants have nothing to do with security. They know as well as we do that if they were to dare to, for example, point out a suspicious-looking Muslim individual, the only type of individual likely to attack a US plane, they would be severely punished both by their employer and the press, and pilloried in social media. And if there were any fighting to be done, it wouldn’t be done by the flight attendants, but by male passengers on the flight capable of fighting.What would a rational system look like? Well, it might look like the 1960s and 1970s, where young unmarried women could see the world and find a husband by becoming flight attendants. If you were ugly, fat, or old, no need to apply. This system has a long pedigree; it was used by Fred Harvey in the creation of his chain of Western restaurants, where the servers were the famous Harvey Girls. For many international airlines, this is still the case. But for United States carriers, and others in the same civilizational dead end such as British Airways and Qantas, age- and sex-discrimination rules prevent this today. (I don’t think there should be any such rules; I would only have the government ban private discrimination in employment against African Americans—no other group.) Of course, given the caliber of today’s passengers, that system probably wouldn’t work today anyway. I have not flown on any of the international airlines that maintain the old system, like Cathay Pacific, but presumably they are higher priced, and therefore attract a different clientele. Surveying the average United States airline flight down the middle aisle is similar to surveying the average Wal Mart aisle—it does not show a lot of high-quality marriage material for a young woman. Which society-wide lack of marriage material, along with the degradation brought by feminism and a host of related, Hillbilly Elegy-type problems, is a big part of why marriage and birth rates are in the basement.I’m not sure if the old marriage-market system, for flight attendants and other forms of primarily female employment, is a good one, or the best one. It certainly wouldn’t work in isolation; such things are part of an organic societal whole. The system is of interest, though, as I continue to evaluate what society should look like, instead of what we are told by the Left society should look like, since soon enough their project is going to come to an end, and something is going to replace it. A marriage market seems like a small thing, but relations among the sexes are core to any society, and they need to be based on reality, recognizing different needs and goals, rather than on a false equivalency.One possible objection is that such a setup oppresses women; we are often pointed to the television series Mad Men as demonstration of how women were oppressed in the 1960s and 1970s. I wasn’t around then, so I don’t know, but we should keep in mind that like all entertainment media today, including such things as computer games, Mad Men is not just entertainment, but also skillful leftist propaganda, in this case coated with a thick layer of apparent realism to give it verisimilitude. As with most stories of oppression (the sole exception being African Americans), the idea that women have been systematically oppressed by men throughout history, at least for the past two thousand years under Christian systems, is a total falsehood, so I suspect that in reality the 1960s system served women quite well.What does the history of science and the roles of flight attendants have to do with Mark Miodownik’s book? Not much, I have to admit. But then, much of Miodownik’s book doesn’t have much to do with liquids. Still, I think I am just particularly curmudgeonly today. I have at least ten books to review, along with a very long piece on Francisco Franco and the Spanish Civil War to complete. That’s my excuse. Nonetheless, being curmudgeonly doesn’t mean I’m wrong."

A lot of interesting liquid facts, from kerosene, tar, ink (and pen), wine, cloud (rain) to tea and coffee, to research on self-repairing roads and liquid computers. Each piece is well-written and humous. The last chapter touches climate change. Highly recommended. Suitable for adults and children 12+."

While information wise this was enjoyable, I found the frame of the book--his airplane ride from the UK to San Francisco--annoying and superfluous.

8,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6548813-natalie-curiousreader,3,"Liquid Rules is a historical and informative journey into a select number of liquids that govern our lives on planet Earth. The book is structured around one single plane-journey, and various liquids that can be found there – water, alcohol, soap, etc.; all which are given the focused attention of a chapter or so as Mark Miodownik explores the particularities in the liquid type and some of the things that makes it ‘tick’, all the while painting a broader picture of what liquids as a form really are – how they behave, how they differ from gas or solids, how they can be useful and at the same time dangerous, depending on the situation. With wit, and of a mind clearly fascinated by the dualities and contradictions of the form – Miodownik interweaves some personal anecdotes, groundbreaking discoveries, fascinating stories and useful information to the reader interested in learning more about the world all around us, which we are always seeing but as Holmes would say – not always observing, and makes us consider anew some of the substances we take for granted, or question how we expect them to behave.Full Review: https://curiousreaderr.wordpress.com/...

The First Mate and I both read his amazing book stuff matters and so we listened to this follow up book together. We would stop after each chapter and discuss. It was fun. Favourites in this book include learning about ink, liquid soap, oceans, and the effect of glaciers on tectonic plates. Seriously both books are must reads. I want another book asap. Arrrr!Side note: Michael Page is seriously an awesome narrator."
10,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3951282-pongsak-sarapukdee,4,"""Liquid Rules"" is quite similar to ""Stuff Matters,"" which tells the various materials around us in general life. But, this book gives the materials in only fluid things. Moreover, he made the story to take us to travel with him on a plane from London to San Francisco, and the liquids that were picked to explain are around him on that flight.If you like Stuff Matters, you going to love this book."
11,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3093693-angie-boyter,4,"Mark Miodownik is Professor of Materials and Society at the University College London. He studies the properties of matter and their applications to various areas of science and engineering. His first book for a general audience, Stuff Matters, so fascinated me that I wanted to go back and reread it as soon as I had finished it! In Liquid Rules Miodownik continues his exploration of one important type of material, liquids. Before he discusses specific liquids, like a good scientist he defines his terms. Just what makes something a liquid? Is peanut butter a liquid? Yes, he says, and so does TSA in American airports! ( In layman’s terms, liquids are just things that assume the shape of their container.) After the introduction, each chapter talks about a different type of liquid, specifically the liquids he encounters on a transatlantic plane trip: Explosive (jet fuel), Intoxicating (alcohol), Sticky (glue), etc. There is a LOT of science, including diagrams of molecular structure (There were some passages where my eyes glazed over a bit.), but also history, little-known information like the fact that George Orwell, in addition to writing about dystopias in 1984 and Animal Farm, wrote about how to approach utopia by publishing eleven rules for making the perfect cup of tea, and just fun tales, like Miodinow’s account of his experience getting VERY close to an active volcano or Professor Thomas Parnell of the University of Queensland, who studied what happens if you dump a bunch of tar into a funnel and let it sit for more than 80 years. While Miodownik is explaining the properties of various liquids, he naturally talks about how they are used. I confess that I never thought about how wings are attached to airplanes, and I was more than a little disconcerted to learn that they are GLUED on…until Miodownik described the nature of glues and put my mind at rest. Well, mostly at rest.Some of the liquids he chooses to tell us about are fairly obvious choices, like the jet fuel; others are more idiosyncratic. I was especially intrigued by the discussion of saliva in the chapter Visceral. Saliva is certainly not something that we think about very often, but it plays a big role in our everyday lives, as Mlodinow engagingly explains. I confess I never realized quite all the good things saliva does for me, and I am once again amazed and grateful for the wonder that is my body. Given his intimate acquaintance with saliva and everything it can do for our gustatory pleasures, I guess I should not have been surprised by his rapturous description of just what a good cup of tea should taste like or be surprised by his cogently argued case for why you should order coffee rather than tea if you are in an economy-class seat on a plane.Any reader interested in the world around them will find delights in this book, but it will be of most interest to those who can remember a fair bit from their chemistry classes in high school or, better yet, college. Others may need to skip a few paragraphs here and there and move on. So just relax and go with the flow; after all, that is what liquids do!NOTE: I received an advance review copy of this book from Edelweiss and the publisher."
12,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20508475-raluca,3,"I adored Stuff Matters, absolutely adored it, and recommended it to everyone. So when I heard the sequel was coming, I was delighted.Unfortunately, Liquid Rules falls well short of Miodownik's first. Still interesting and enjoyable, don't get me wrong, but somehow... scattered, jumpy, lacking the riotous creativity and variety and joy of Stuff Matters. The author uses a framing device again, but where the repeating picture in Stuff Matters was a simple and cute basis for looking at various solids, the story of a flight in Liquid Rules feels hamfisted and overemphasizes - do we really need a detailed account of your seatmate's outfit and facial expressions?Giving it 3 stars as a partially justified punishment. Had I read this one first, it might have been a slightly generous 4, but as it is, it doesn't hold a candle to its predecessor and it kind of broke my heart.(Did not fit into the PopSugar Reading Challenge 2020)"
13,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4492706-babbs,3,"I enjoyed the general topic concerning the history and significance of many of the fluids you find around you in daily life which make, in many cases, modern life possible. I felt the airplane tagalong as a thread to tie the topics together more fluff than anything and detracted from the more interesting tidbits. Even within a single topic, the author sometimes lacked focus and would add side comments only very loosely tied to the topic. I might be a little harsher on this than the book really deserves because I already felt distracted by riding on a plane with Susan when I'm reading to learn interesting things about the world around me. I think ""Stuff Matters"", the authors first book, has a similar feel, focusing on material science and discovery, but was better executed. I found the hand drawn chemical structures and example cartoons amateurish instead of charming, as they were likely intended. I also found their insertion sometimes a filler as well--I think we've all seen a coffee pot, and the random unrelated personal stories and photos of the author felt forced to pull topics together. Once again, personal soapbox of mine. Overall, a 2-3 star rating I rounded up. This was a surprising bummer for me because I did enjoy his first book."

I think this makes me a pretty boring person, but I would have preferred a book solely about the scientific aspects and facts we learned about liquids, rather than the plane ride storyline that was involved. To me, it distracted from the point of the book and I was just waiting for each chapter to actually “start.” A fantastic idea, but not the ideal execution. I loved learning about tea, ink, soap, you name it, but it came at the cost of waiting through random tangents and reading about the author taking forever in the bathroom during turbulence. "

If you don't, you may find out way too much about liquids and how the tons of kerosene you're currently sitting over on that plane - could blast you into smithereens.This is a fascinating book about everything you ever wanted to know about liquids - and some things you never wanted to know.The author has an infectious and slightly morbid enthusiasm for his subject. And you can't help but be fascinated as you read.I loved the book - and I'm leaving it at home when I take my next flight!"

21,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6569017-anneke,5,"Book Review: Liquid RulesAuthor: Mark MiodownikPublisher: Houghton Mifflin HarcourtPublication Date: February 19, 2019Review Date: March 7, 2019I received a free copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.This is a fantastic non-fiction book about Liquids. One of those very easy to read and engaging pop-nonfiction books. Mark Miodownik is a British materials scientist, engineer, broadcaster and writer at University College London. Previously, he was the head of the Materials Research Group at King's College London, and a co-founder of Materials Library.To give you an idea of the shape of this book, here’s from the blurb:“Set over the course of a flight from London to San Francisco, Liquid Rules offers readers a fascinating tour of these formless substances, told through the language of molecules, droplets, heartbeats, and ocean waves. Throughout the trip, we encounter fluids within the plane—from a seemingly ordinary cup of tea to a liquid crystal display screen—and without, in the volcanoes of Iceland, the frozen expanse of Greenland, and the marvelous California coastline. We come to see liquids as substances of wonder and fascination, and to understand their potential for death and destruction. Just as in Stuff Matters, Mark Miodownik’s unique brand of scientific storytelling brings liquids and their mysterious properties to life in a captivating new way.”I loved reading this book. Not too hard on my brain, but completely engaging and fascinating. The book kept my interest all the way through, as he changed topics and points of view, as our flight continued.This is comparable to an easy going vacation read, except it’s not a novel or fiction. It’s not every real scientist that can break down his/her topic of study in a way that that captures the average non-scientific reader. This would be a perfect gift with someone who has a wide range of interests, and might want to dabble in some form of science without having to take Linear Algebra or Quantum Physics or other REAL science course, like my nephew who is an Aerospace Engineering Student.There is a slight sense of humor throughout the whole book, as if saying, who knew that science could be so fun? I highly recommend this book, especially if you’ve just finished a very intense piece of fiction. A kind of literary clearing the palate. Thank you to Houghton Mifflin Harcourt for allowing me an early look that this great book.My review will be posted on NetGalley, Goodreads and Amazon.#netgalley #liquidrules #houghtonmifflinharcourt"

The author takes the reader through the history and chemistry behind... liquids, of all things. I know it sounds as boring as can be, but the author narrates it in such an entertaining, approachable manner that it kept my attention throughout. Not only that, but I have a renewed appreciation for all things liquid - from all the ballpoint pens we toss around without a second thought to the paint on my walls to ketchup... yes, ketchup! Highly recommend, and can’t wait to check out more of this author’s books."
23,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24230013-wesley,2,"If this were marketed as a book our interaction with materials in our daily lives, I would have enjoyed it much more. However, it was marketed as a book about liquid and it spent more time talking about decidedly non-liquid things than it did about liquid. A lot of the information was interesting. The contrived and constrained tying of the information to a flight was jarring and forced. Overall I really wanted to like this book but it just felt like it was trying too hard to be something other than what it was. Which is a shame because what it was (a book about materials) was pretty good. "

At one point I was quietly lamenting to myself that I absorbed Liquid Rules so quickly that I hadn't retained any of the information flowing out of it. A few days after I finished Liquid Rules the weather was really hot so I set to work annoying my partner with how air conditioners work.Then the fridge made a noise and I annoyed her with the story about Einstein spending 20 years trying to make fridges safe...Then we hung out the washing and I annoyed my partner with the story about where the water on the wet clothing goes...Then I noticed contrails in the sky and I annoyed my partner with a story about how contrails are made...Then it started raining and I annoyed my partner with a story about how clouds are actually transparent...Then I wondered if it was going to storm and I annoyed my partner with a story about how many people get hit by lightning....Then we had lunch and I annoyed my partner with a story about how having more saliva means your food will taste better...Then my partner had a cup of tea and I had a coffee, and I annoyed her with a story about how to make the perfect cup of tea and how to roast beans to make a great coffee. That lead to a story about orange juice and wine and smell versus taste...That night we were talking about the new flooring we're getting with our renovation and I annoyed my partner with a story about how - if you really want to manipulate some science facts- linoleum is a liquid... Then I washed the dishes and annoyed my partner with a story about how soap and grease and oils works...Then I washed my hands and annoyed my partner with a story about soap and foaming...Then my hands felt dry and I annoyed my partner with a story about moisturiser...Then I decided I just couldn't keep the history and science of pens all to myself - I'm not a selfish person, and sharing is caring - so I grabbed a retractable biro, discovered where my partner was hiding, and told her the story of pens...Then on Monday after work I annoyed my partner with a story about how Post-Its work but she already knew thanks to a movie called Romy and Michelle. I felt very deflated by that.My partner is sick of hearing about liquids. If you too would like to annoy your friends and loved ones with awesome facts read Liquid Rules.

26,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3272448-tudor,4,"I wish I had the author as a Chemistry, Physics and History teacher. It's a short book for such an enormous field, but it was perfect to make me interested in Materials Science.If you watched and enjoyed the TV Series ""How It's Made"" you will love this book, though it is less about the process (of making something) and more about the science and history behind those inventions. The book is packed with interesting examples of liquids their amazing properties:One of the most interesting inventions is the ballpoint pen and the ink used in them. You find out about the tricky nature of ink and the properties it has to have in order to be an effective means for writing: stored as a liquid to flow freely onto paper, but also quick to dry and long-lasting. You learn all of this through the history of different technological advancements in this field, some scientists focusing on refining the pen and others the ink.If you like wine, tea or coffee you will definitely enjoy those chapters. I was fascinated by the awesome properties of liquid crystals, soap, saliva and clouds. (I never knew some countries performed experiments to control the weather on a large scale)I listened to the audio version of the book, but I would recommend reading the physical book instead. There are helpful drawings and images in the book and since the book is packed with information it is much harder to follow along just by listening.I would also recommend people start with his first book, Stuff Matters: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1..., which presents materials more generally, using very interesting examples nonetheless."
27,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7331806-rob-adey,4,"Nice, well-constructed tour of liquids, their properties and histories. I'm not sure if there has been/will be a BBC4 series - you can see how a lot of this material would easily become scripts, though fortunately there's a lot more actual content here than a BBC4 version would get through. There's a slightly odd mismatch in detail levels - there's not much on general physical principles, but there is quite a bit about exactly how molecules are made up; I could have done with more of the former to help explain the latter. But! Another very readable pop science book here; presumably something on gas is next. "
28,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31061871-alex,5,Another great book by the author of Stuff Rules! There's so much to learn. The book frames the exploration of various types of liquids through a journey on the airplane.I will say that the author's segues between different topics are amusingly far-fetched at times (but still hilarious nevertheless).

He organizes the story around a plane trip that he took, using the often funny thoughts and experiences to prompt a discussion of another liquid, from jet fuel to hand soap, from the perfect cup of tea to glue. It was scientifically strong, but never dry. One of the best science books I've read in years."

42,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,4,"I'd really enjoyed Miodownik's Stuff Matters, on the science of different solid materials like glass, metal, concrete and graphite, and was excited that he had a book on liquids. Whereas Stuff Matters covered the materials that Miodownik presumably found the most fascinating and significant in terms of daily life, the conceit for Liquid is the different kinds of liquids Miodownik encounters on a flight - oils, alcohol, water, glue, liquid crystals, saliva, tea and coffee, soap, refrigerants, ink, clouds, magma and tar (the latter two signifying the end of his journey when the plane lands). In Liquid, Miodownik weaves a fascinating narrative that draws from chemistry, physics, science history, earth science, to name a few. It's full of fascinating nuggets. Like why it is dangerous to consume home brews or alcohol-based liquids for a cheap high because the methanol in them hasn't been removed; methanol is metabolised into formic acid and formaldehyde in the body, where the formic acid attacks your nerve cells, especially the optic nerve, leaving you blind (hence the expression 'blind drunk'). Like how it is rubber that gives Post-It Notes their stickiness; the notes have an adhesive layer of rubber on them where the microscopic spheres of rubber bond tightly to the note but create only a small adhesive force when pressed onto a surface. Or that sticky tape has three layers, a bottom layer of adhesive, a middle layer of cellophane for strength and transparency and a top layer of non-stick material like Teflon. And the fascinating universe of two-part adhesives. Or how he unpacks the complexities involved in brewing the perfect cup of tea, as it involves striking the right balance of temperature (too low and the flavour molecules in the tea won't dissolve; too high and many of the tannins and polyphenols that give a bitter taste and astringency will also dissolve), timing (to ensure the perfect balance of the different kinds of volatiles), compared to the (relative) ease of making a decent cup of coffee.And the marvels of how soap works - that when you mix fat with an alkali (like ash water), the alkali transforms the fat molecules into hybrid molecules with a charged head that dissolves in water and a carbon tail that dissolves in fats. The carbon tails of hybrid soap molecules embed themselves in fat blobs, creating a charged surface with their heads that can dissolve in water. Thus allowing the fat blob to be washed away. [Fascinating factoids: Egg is the surfactant in mayonnaise, allowing the oil and water in mayo to bind. It's like soap in that respect and you can use egg yolk to clean your hair. P&G invented Ivory Soap and part of its marketing strategy was to sponsor serial dramas targeting housewives at home during the day. Hence the name 'soap opera'.]Like Stuff Matters, Liquid is very accessibly written, even for the science phobe. But unlike Stuff Matters, the conceit of Liquid - to wrap the material science within the larger narrative arc of Miodownik's flight, and his interactions with his fellow passenger, Susan - is distracting. Miodownik's attempts at humour - the disgust he evokes when he falls asleep and drools on Susan, when he sneezes on another passenger, when he obsesses about why the inflight safety video remains silent on the largest hazard of all, the fact that they will be in the air with thousands of gallons of combustible fuel - are pedestrian and awkward. For Stuff Matters, I'd felt that the sections where Miodownik tried to jazz things up a bit, to perhaps take a more creative treatment of the topic fell flat. Like when he discussed porcelain in the context of his parents' wedding tea set. The main thing here is really the fascinating science of liquids but Miodownik sometimes seems to forget this. Still, this is a fairly minor complaint in what is overall, a fun and fascinating read. "
43,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66635467-keen,4,"“Liquids have a duality: they are neither a gas nor solid, but something in-between. They are exciting and powerful, on the one hand, while being anarchic and slightly terrifying on the other.” Travelling on a trans-Atlantic flight from London to San Francisco, Miodownik uses a number of observations and thoughts as creative jumping off points to get into some whimsical and fascinating territory throughout the journey.This is a largely, but not always accessible investigation of sorts into some of the many liquids that most of us will encounter in our daily lives. A quirky odyssey loaded with lots of colourful facts and trivia to pull out down the pub or indeed any social occasion. I had no idea that the de Havilland Mosquito bomber used during WWII was made of plywood, which made it the fastest aircraft in the sky or that we use around 16 billion litres of oil every day throughout the world.Apparently there is 150’000 litres of kerosene stored in a jumbo jet (50’000 in the fuel tank below your feet and another 50’000 stored in each wing). And yet you could throw a lit match at it and it wouldn’t ignite. But mix it with the right amount of oxygen and it suddenly becomes an oil ten times as powerful as nitroglycerine.He talks about the crucial difference between ethanol and methanol, pure methanol can cause permanent blindness. Your body metabolises it into formic acid and formaldehyde. Formic acid attacks nerve cells, especially the optic nerve, hence the saying ‘blind drunk’. It also goes after your liver and kidneys and can cause permanent damage. Three glasses of it will kill you.Miodownik explains why drinking wine is a multi-sensory experience, and how more often than not many people enjoy paying for the brand more than the experience, “Some people love having the most expensive cars, they get real enjoyment out of what that says about them as a person. It’s the same with wines. But this doesn’t mean that these are better wines or better cars, or even that the owners are more sophisticated people.” He cites the experiments that managed to fool so called ‘wine experts’ that convinced them that they were drinking white wine, but thanks to a flavourless red dye they got suckered into describing it in detail as a red wine.He also covers many more interesting topics from 3-D printing, the humble yet fascinating biro pen and even the wonderful properties of tar and asphalt, he talks of the pitch drop experiment set up in 1927 by Prof Thomas Parnell at the University of Queensland, the first drop fell in 1938, the second in 1947, the third in 1954 and the ninth and most recent drop fell in 2014.One of the minor pitfalls in this book is that occasionally some of the topics get a little tedious and there are too many complex and bewildering diagrams of molecular structures for my taste, but that is sure to appeal to science and chemistry buffs alike, but you don’t have to study or understand them to enjoy the book.This reminded me of Paul Vanhoenacker’s “Skyfaring” (the book is mentioned in the further reading section). This book relies on a format used repeatedly by the likes of Gavin Francis, Alain de Botton and many others, which takes everyday subjects, and makes them relatively accessible, whilst allowing us to view seemingly mundane objects with a renewed sense of wonder. It’s a style that peppers the book with helpful and occasionally light-hearted images and the books are never too long. It’s a format that I happen to enjoy and it’s clearly a popular one too."
44,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20280886-sarah-smith,3,"More often than I care to admit my wee brain gets a bit overwhelmed and when this happens I tend to look for things that are objective as opposed to subjective. And it sort of gives me a break. Today’s break came in the form of a popular science book (Side note, I LOVE books classed as popular science) called Liquids by Mark Miodownik. Oddly enough it is a book about Liquids, from tea to superliquid Helium, kerosene and ink, the sea to lava. A whole plethora of them each with their own weird, dangerous and fascinating properties. And were it has the potential to be an excellent book it falls a little short. The major issue I had is how Miodownik frames the narrative. He is on a flight from London to San Francisco and he introduces the different liquids in an increasingly strained and conceited way related to this flight. This quickly starts to grate, the tone of these bits is sort of akin to an over enthusiastic kids TV presenter who has forgotten they are on Newsnight and are talking to Kirsty Wark as opposed to a group of pubescent children. But although I’ve started with the bad, it almost redeems itself as there is much to interest. I was born in 1986 and all I remember from primary school (we shall not read in to why I remember so little) concerns the Gulf War, an oil spill, and the ozone layer having a massive whole in it. And it was only in reading this I realised why in primary school we where told all about the whole in the ozone, as it was around this time the world realised the damage CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons) had done to the ozone, CFCs where used in refrigerators as a coolant, as they were seemingly harmless and inert, and then everyone realised this was not the case. It was actually the same fella responsible for this that said lead in petrol was safe too, so he’s not so much the greatest really. Apart from learning about coolants used in refrigerators, you also get to learn about so many things you would never stop to consider. How the ink in biros work, can you tell the difference between red and white wine if you cant see them (I to be fair would struggle to distinguish either from vinegar), why Eastenders is a soap, how ships float, and planes fly, that roads to a certain extent are self healing on account of the viscosity of tar(tar is actually a liquid, just a million times as viscous as peanut butter) man made clouds (Russia uses them every May to make sure May Day celebrations are rain free, the little rascals) also just you know clouds in general. It’s almost a history of the world told via the scientific progress concerning liquids that are often vital to our existence without us really ever thinking too much about them. Despite all of this I was left feeling a little short changed. It is possible I expect too much, I’ve been spoiled by books such as those written by Simon Singh (Fermats last theorem, Big Bang) or Sam Kean’s The Disappearing Spoon which have a more consistent tone, and I found to captivate me more, but just because these are better doesn’t make Liquids bad, just not as good as I had hoped. Mostly it suffers from how he introduces the liquids in each instance, and I know I’ve written about how it is interesting but like an under seasoned soup there wasn’t quite enough of the interesting. It felt a little padded in parts and too much time was spent on irrelevant personal anecdotes. Sadly not nearly as good as it could have been."
45,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4137725-phoebe,5,"Right now I'm experiencing that 4pm listlessness. It's either coffee or nap. Resistance is futile. No one is productive at 4pm. So here I am, writing about a book about liquids instead of...never you mind.Liquid Rules: The Delightful and Dangerous Substances That Flowed Through Our Lives (2020) is Mark Miodownik's follow-up to Stuff Matters: The Strange Stories of the Marvellous Materials that Shape Our Man-made World (2014), which won the 2014 Royal Society Winton Prize for Science books and the 2015 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Communication Award. I didn’t know either awards existed but they seem relevant and most likely well-deserved because it is so, so easy to commend the quality of his writing.I wouldn’t say Liquid Rules bears epistemological significance. But you don’t read a book about liquids because you think there’s some quintessential knowledge you’re missing. You read it because you passed year 12 chemistry and now you can have that moment of vainglory realising you didn’t memorise chemical compounds and equations for nothing because you actually understand what an actual scientist gasp is saying. HA. Just kidding. I liked the title and thought it sounded unusual and entertaining. More importantly, I knew it wasn’t gonna be emotionally taxing. The kind of tension I’ve been experiencing has been unreal and I can’t explain why I’m so tense. I blame it on animal crossing which is meant to be a relaxing game but my perfectionism is ruining it for me. (Why can’t I place THIS bush next to THIS rock?!) In any case, I need something breezy but not fluffy.What makes Liquid Rules entertaining is how casual Miodownik sounds. The entire book is structured around Miodownik’s flight to San Francisco where he is to attend a scientific conference. As he is going through customs and security, he muses on what makes peanut butter a liquid and not a solid according to airline regulations. As the plane is taking off, he considers the discovery of kerosene in the premodern era and the incredible fact that no one knew its awesome power. Then mid-flight, he provides an endless stream of anecdotes about the terrifying power of storm clouds (when the plane experiences turbulence), why he prefers soap bars over liquid soap (when he goes to the bathroom), why we find snot disgusting (when curry dribbles down his chin), why the invention of biro was a complex problem with a surprisingly simple solution (when he signs the arrival card), and finally, the future when we can store man-made data like digital photographs inside droplets of liquid (as he arrives at the scientific conference). It feels like you’re flying and you’re listening in to all the amusing did-you-knows as the person next to you chatters on about the marvellous things we’re seeing. All in all, it’s like being offered a gaze into a secret network of things, where whaling in the nineteenth century is somehow related to the rise of the soap industry which is also related to the creation of soap opera during morning hours. The connective ‘thingness’ of life is suddenly made apparent and it is a wondrous sight. The world is a connected place. It’s connected by the seeping, oozing, dripping and molten liquids that flow in and out of us, around us, beneath us, and above us. Humans are 60% water and our planet is 70% water. We are living in an aqueous state on an aqueous planet, so it’s almost self-deceiving to think the world around us is solid and concrete when our body is formed in amniotic fluids and ends with being decomposed into minerals, water and gas. And isn’t it just the strangest thing to think one day, instead of relying on computers that speak in 0s and 1s, we will have biochemical computation that takes place on a molecular level? Yep. Mind blown. "
46,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109535466-mike-parkes,4,"Entertaining but scattered book describing the chemistry and applications of assorted liquids. I think this goes by different names in North America and Europe – the version I have is just titled “Liquid”. Lots of interesting details, and Miodownik is an entertaining and informative writer. However, the choice of liquids and their properties is random, with the organizing principle of the book being liquids one comes across on a flight (or is otherwise impacted by, e.g. clouds). The connecting interludes between chapters become annoying quite early on in the book (e.g. a trip to the lavatory provides the opportunity to discuss soaps and cleaning products). By the end, you’re left with a pastiche of chapters on different topics, some enlightening, some less so, but not a good grasp on liquids as a whole. A strong introductory chapter on the properties of liquids would really have helped. Not quite as good as Miodownik’s “Stuff Matters” which was similar in format but dealt with common solid materials (primarily structural).A few chapters I enjoyed in “Liquid” were:•	How the volatility and flash point of hydrocarbon liquids such as kerosene (jet fuel) and oils affected their use in lighting and energy products (ch 1)•	Glues, liquids that change to solids and form permanent bonds (ch 4). •	Refrigeration and air conditioning, from liquids that boil near room temperature, enabling them to transfer a large amount of heat through phase changes (ch 9).•	Pen inks, and the engineering and chemistry of designing a pen with ink that will flow on the page and turn into a solid without making a mess (ch 10).Other chapters deal with the intoxicating properties of alcohols (ch 2), the properties of the ocean (ch 3), liquid crystal displays (ch 5), bodily fluids (ch 6), the chemistry of tea and coffee (ch 7), soaps and detergents (ch 8), clouds (ch 11), the slow flow of ice and rocks on the earrh’s surface (ch 12), and sustainable materials such as self-healing asphalt (ch 13)."
47,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90301926-kaj,2,"You might think that “Liquid Rules” is about the science of liquids. Don’t be fooled. It’s actually one long kinda cringy story about Mark Miodownik’s flying experience, with some chemistry asides.I loved Miodownik’s previous book, “Stuff Matters,” where he explains how the big properties of everyday materials come from their chemical structure. Why are alloys sometimes stronger than the metals they’re made from? What does it mean to be conductive? Miodownik keeps his explanations simple and mechanistic, aided by small hand-drawn doodles. Unlike many other pop sci books, “Stuff Matters” never falls into the trap of focusing too much on what is important to know, rather than what’s interesting and informative. The info:tainment ratio is good- accessible enough for high school level students while still interesting for scientists. Sure, he sprinkles in some occasionally boring personal anecdotes, but every materials chem book would benefit from a few breathers.“Liquid Rules” doubles down on the bad parts of “Stuff Matters” while forgetting what made it great. Each chapter focuses on a different liquid. A major part of the book is trying to relate each liquid to something that happens on a single trans-Atlantic flight. This plot device seems to be an attempt to make the liquid chemistry seem useful by relating it to real-world phenomena, but the cumulative effect is the opposite. Too much time spent on why these chemicals are important, and not enough on why they’re interesting, mixed with long personal anecdotes and scientist biographies that are neither important nor interesting. For a book about fluids, “Liquid Rules” is just a little bit too dry."
48,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4261166-marshall,5,"I love the way Mark Miodownik writes. He addresses subjects that are seemingly boring (if you say it out loud like when I told my girlfriend I was reading about glue, and tape, and tvs) and opens up the mystery entirely, sparking a fascinating world of chemical wonder. His rhetoric and storytelling can deliver the scientific details in an easily digestible manner without using any scientific tools such as graphs, charts, and data sheets, only rudimentary drawings (which helped a whole lot and were very welcome enterprises). I was tremendously inspired by this book and every single chapter tapped into a childlike awe of the materials of the world around me. I learned and relearned many aspects of earth science and things I've only imagined. Honestly, I wish someone like a teacher or mentor would have been able to put this book in my hands when I was in early high school because I believe it may have changed the trajectory of my life. I might have sought out a career in material science. So, since that obviously didn't happen seeing how he wrote this book in the recent decade, I will be sure to pass it along to a young friend or a deer friend's young adult. In any case, this book just goes to show that there is ALWAYS something to marvel at, even if you find yourself experiencing a bit of ennui. Just walk outside and check out a flower or if you're stuck inside pick up a pen and peer a little bit closer into all that makes it possible. Absolutely LOVED both of Miodownik's books. I will be buying these two and looking forward to the next one (please write another!)!"
49,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92179113-patrick-green,4,"I typically associate scientists with tall guys in lab coats. Careful, fastidious, and, when in the lab, organized. I know this is a crude generalization, but there is certainly a nugget of truth to this statement. The scientist of this book, Mark Miodownik, should have kept this nugget of truth in mind when he was writing this book. ""Liquid Rules"" is messy and disjointed, primarily because of the framework that Miodownik uses to explain the properties and everyday uses of certain liquids. This made the reading experience for myself at times boring. I cared more for his explanations on the properties of tea, coffee, and ink for example than I did for kerosene or soap. I also did not care for his tangents. I was mostly looking for information on how certain liquids, or liquids in general, function. I did not care much to hear about his trip from England to San Francisco. It was a very plain framework. The details surrounding this framework, the scientific extrapolations on liquids, propelled my interest.I enjoyed the information on the liquids that Miodownik provided. I also relished some of the historical background of these liquids. They taught some valuable conclusions that I should make on certain liquids. For example, I can definitively say that I am a coffee drinker, not a tea drinker. And now I have scientific evidence to support my subjective opinion. Thank you, Miodownik.The last pleasant note that I found on the book was the laid back pace. I felt as though I could read it on a nice Sunday afternoon while also getting some mental exercise. Despite how messy and boring the framework was, it's a very enjoyable book to read, and I would recommend it."
50,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1109379-colette,3,"“Liquids are the alter ego of dependable solid stuff. Whereas solid materials are humanity’s faithful friend, taking on the permanent shapes of clothes, shoes, phones, cars, and indeed airports, liquids are fluid; they will take on any shape, but only while contained. When they’re not contained, they are always on the move, seeping, corroding, dripping, and escaping our control. If you put a solid material somewhere, it stays there—barring forcible removal—often doing something very useful, like holding up a building or supplying electricity for a whole community. Liquids, on the other hand, are anarchic: they have a knack for destroying things. In a bathroom, for instance, it is a constant battle to keep water from seeping into cracks and pooling under the floor, where it gets up to no good, rotting and undermining the wooden joists; on a smooth tile floor, water is the perfect slip hazard, causing an enormous number of injuries; and when it gathers in the corners of the bathroom, it can harbor black slimy fungus and bacteria, which threaten to infiltrate our bodies and make us sick. And yet, despite all this treachery, we love the stuff; we love bathing in water, and showering in it, drenching the whole body. And what bathroom is complete without a cornucopia of bottled liquid soaps, shampoos, and conditioners, jars of cream, and tubes of toothpaste? We delight in these miraculous liquids and yet we worry about them too: Are they bad for us? Do they cause cancer? Do they ruin the environment? With liquids, delight and suspicion go hand in hand. They are duplicitous by nature, neither a gas nor a solid but something in between, something inscrutable and mysterious.”"
51,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83179136-catherine-puma,4,"I was delighted when I saw Miodownik was coming out with another book. Having enjoyed his ""Stuff Matters"", I acquired ""Liquid Rules"" and was not disappointed. Framed by the narrative device of observing liquids around him while flying from Britain to California, Miodownik describes oceans, glaciers, clouds, wine, saliva, droplets in the pressurized cabin, tea, coffee, blood... to name a few. I learned so much! As a result, I found myself not just noticing all the liquids I encounter in my life, but also contemplating what properties they have in relation to one another. This included pondering the process of converting my bar of solid soap into a liquid substance by interacting it with water, another liquid. Miodownik's section on hand soap vs. liquid soap (and his preference for the former) was thus especially interesting. My only quibble with this work was its lack of acknowledging its own limitations. The subtitle implies that ""dangerous"" liquids would also be discussed, but--with the exception of mercury--the diversity of naturally occurring toxins and poisons are not mentioned. Of course it is unrealistic to expect such a short work to touch upon everything, but I wish there was more of a ""there's so much more to learn and discuss"" preface and/or conclusion. That being said, this was extremely eye opening, as ""Stuff Matters"" was, and I will be recommending it to many. This is a great way to inspire a natural curiosity for the natural observation of fluid dynamics. I can even see myself re-reading it again! "
52,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/964960-george,4,"As with his earlier Stuff Matters: Exploring the Marvelous Materials That Shape Our Man-Made World, Miodownik selects a convenient frame in which to hang his description of various types of liquids and the ways in which they affect our lives. In this case, it's a transatlantic flight from London to San Francisco, giving him the opportunity to reflect on, among other things, the hot beverages served by the flight attendants, refrigeration systems, the glue that holds the plane's wings to the fuselage, and of course the large body of water over which he flies. Like most popular books about science, there are parts that are going to be overly simplistic for experts, or even knowledgeable non-experts, but Miodownik is among the group of writers who, I think, manages to strike the right balance. The framework is contrived, yes, but it has also helped me to retain a fair amount of what was discussed, and I found myself thinking about it on my own flight to California (especially the part about the glue...). My only real criticism is that his observations of his seatmate, Susan, while in the name of setting us up for a reveal later on, came off as a bit creepy at times. "
53,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/190448-karen,4,"If you're into science, this book is a gem.It's written by a material scientist and the story is told on a flight from London to San Francisco, ostensibly focusing on all the liquids on board but it's really just a premise to tell the stories he wants to tell. The fact that he was on board a flight was cute but seemed contrived a bit at parts. But I didn't really care because the science and stories were super interesting to me. This book has 12 chapters, each chapter focusing on a different substance like glue, ink, etc. I loved the bits about how candles work and how the wick pulls water up against the force of gravity. I learned about how the World Trade Centers buckled due to the strength of the steel decreasing under such high heat and then putting pressure on the lower floors, etc. And how flavor is a multi-sensory experience (and how we assume and 'can taste' flavors related to the color.) I also loved reading how icarus story wouldn't be possible because it gets colder when you fly higher :) I loved learning about ballpoint pens and how they work (and how amazing they are!!) and about tar and all the interesting new innovations they are making to help the roads last longer.There is just so much fascinating science in this book. Highly enjoyable. thanks to netgalley for an advanced copy in exchange for an honest review."
54,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7273557-gary,3," Mark Miodownik book Liquid Rules takes the reader on a transatlantic flight from London to San Francisco. His profession is in materials. The security line examining for liquids and then the pre-flight safety lecture triggers in him what liquids are we talking about? For one, the jet you are flying in is really a bomb, full of kerosene. After getting you all panicked about ever flying again, there is talk of alcohol, tea, coffee, soaps, ketchup, and many other items. His explanations are very readable and when he traces inventions, it makes the subject matter come alive.The book is told in sections, divided by the type of liquids he encounters along the way. He leads an interesting discussion about why the liquids are different and how various liquids you would not associate are similar. I found that after about the fifth chapter of this, I was getting a bit overwhelmed with the detail of explanation-I usually find details like he presents as interesting. So I am not sure why this bugs me. I would chalk it up to the reader more than the writer.I would recommend this book. But if you do read the book, try taking the book in smaller chunks rather than as a book to read straight through.For more of my thoughts, please see my book blog."
55,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"Mark Miodownik explores the mundanely marvelous liquids that make up our lives in the framework of a transatlantic flight from London to San Francisco with Liquid Rules. Liquid Rules explores the different aspects of liquids as they relate to making our lives easier. Take Kerosene as an example. Kerosene was first discovered back in 900 CE or around that century by an Arabic Alchemist and Scholar. The only problem was that Olive Oil was preferred for lamps since the government could tax it.Miodownik goes over a great many subjects and ideas. He writes about distillation, flashpoints, chemical structures, and so much more. The book reminds me a bit of Gravity’s Rainbow with all of the different information that the author stuffs into the pages, but this book is far more accessible.There are a lot of different things that Miodownik brings to your attention. Think of the humble candle as a great example. It might seem easy to understand, but there is a lot of physics going on to make sure that a candle works properly. Another thing to think about is as simple as a ballpoint pen. Even the ink had to be engineered for the proper viscosity and binding properties.I will probably search for Miodownik’s other books like Stuff Matters, assuming I haven’t read them already. "
56,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102314750-sam,0,"Liquid Rules is a book that examines in the depth the relationships between various liquids and how they affect our world. Traveling between London, San Francisco, and on the plane ride between, Mark Miodownik teaches us the surprising truth of how reliant we are as a people on liquids. While diving into the mechanical sciences of things, often discussing liquids in regards to thermal properties, the 2nd law of thermodynamics, and quantum relationships, he doesn't become completely absorbed in this writing remembering to include more colloquial evaluations. These reviews, often revolve around a specific liquids contribution to society, the history of how it was created (or found, and how it may be revolutionized in the future, and provides a sense balance and completion to his writing. Unlike many scientists who often thrive and exploit the mysticism (or more correctly lack of education) around their work to make themselves more interesting Mark Miodownik takes pride in his humanity, often talking about how his work around liquids stems from the want to learn. Overall, Liquid Rules is a unique book, that relays with humor and wit how the science, history, and properties of many liquids bear a pivotal role in the development of our modern industrialized society."
57,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40472466-dan,5,"Once again, after Stuff Matters, Mark Miodownik brings about the joy of acknowledging the material matters around us. It is an excellent book if you want to follow the meandering thoughts of the author.""Liquids have a duality: they are neither a gas nor a solid, but something in between. They are exciting and powerful, on the one hand, while anarchic and slightly terrifying on the other. That is their nature.""The liquid is a core part of what makes us living beings, how we interact with the world. Earth's molten-metal liquid core creates a magnetic field that protects water from being dried up due to the solar wind. We wouldn't have a vast amount of water in the sea without the core.Our energy source is often in a liquid form, e.g., whale oil, gasoline, kerosene, diesel. Some explosives are in liquid form like nitroglycerin, which is the reason why a certain amount of liquid is not allowed to carry on planes.Of course, we drink water, alcohol (ethanol, not methanol), wine, coffee, and tea. Our body is also mostly liquid. Our saliva helps us digest, kills pain, and protects us from bacterias (and bad breath). We cry and drop tears. We put on perfumes (methanol). We clean using soap.We watch (LCD: liquid crystal displays).Look up and see clouds? They are liquid too.The author tells these stories while he takes a flight to his conference. His perspectives are refreshing especially since flying is one of the worst experiences that I have to endure. It is cramped. There is an invisible tension over the armrest. The middle seat gets the two, does anyone disagree? The air is too dry. Food is usually horrible if served. A trip to the bathroom is bothersome. Now I know what to do. Order coffee instead of tea. Sleep without drooling. Watch movies which I would enjoy more. Last but not least, appreciate liquids!"
58,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48901937-kyle-dinges,4,"Liquid Rules by Mark Miodownik is a book that looks at some of the most important liquids that society depends on and gives a bit of a brief background on their chemical makeup and how they were created or discovered. It is easily accessible, which is something I usually look for in non-fiction about science. Like his first book, Stuff Matters, Miodownik has a knack for writing about complex scientific ideas in a way that are easy for the lay person to understand. He sprinkles in plenty of humor to keep things lively and never drones on for too long about one subject. The idea to use an airplane ride to introduce each liquid, and demonstrate their abundance in life, was a good way to present each liquid in a logical order and talk about real life applications. All of this just serves to make the book more entertaining and interesting. There's a delicate balance to making a book like this informative and entertaining, and Miodownik does a good job in that regard.Someone looking for a more expansive an in depth text might be a bit let down, but for someone just looking for an entertaining ""pop-science"" read, I think this book more than fits the bill."
59,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12527649-kristin,4,"Generally speaking, this was a good overview of various properties of liquids, how we interact with them, and how they affect us. It took an extremely broad area of knowledge and made it understandable (and enjoyable!) for the semi-layperson. I especially enjoyed the chapter on saliva (weird, I know, but it was of professional interest haha). I also enjoyed the chapter on tea, coffee, and other beverages. The reason I knocked a star off of my review is because the author often says “double blind studies have shown...” or “studies have shown...” but does not cite these studies or sources. There is a “further reading” section at the end of the book, but none of the resources are linked to the specific claims presented in the main body. I know this is supposed to be a general overview, but if sources are claimed, they should be cited. This normally wouldn’t bug me so much, but I would actually like to read some of those studies.... (including the one mentioned in the cooling chapter, where the author talks about perfluorocarbons as a substitute for blood and the subsequent clinical trials). IT’S BREATHABLE LIQUID. Doesn’t that sound like some worthwhile further reading?"

72,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,4,"I'd really enjoyed Miodownik's Stuff Matters, on the science of different solid materials like glass, metal, concrete and graphite, and was excited that he had a book on liquids. Whereas Stuff Matters covered the materials that Miodownik presumably found the most fascinating and significant in terms of daily life, the conceit for Liquid is the different kinds of liquids Miodownik encounters on a flight - oils, alcohol, water, glue, liquid crystals, saliva, tea and coffee, soap, refrigerants, ink, clouds, magma and tar (the latter two signifying the end of his journey when the plane lands). In Liquid, Miodownik weaves a fascinating narrative that draws from chemistry, physics, science history, earth science, to name a few. It's full of fascinating nuggets. Like why it is dangerous to consume home brews or alcohol-based liquids for a cheap high because the methanol in them hasn't been removed; methanol is metabolised into formic acid and formaldehyde in the body, where the formic acid attacks your nerve cells, especially the optic nerve, leaving you blind (hence the expression 'blind drunk'). Like how it is rubber that gives Post-It Notes their stickiness; the notes have an adhesive layer of rubber on them where the microscopic spheres of rubber bond tightly to the note but create only a small adhesive force when pressed onto a surface. Or that sticky tape has three layers, a bottom layer of adhesive, a middle layer of cellophane for strength and transparency and a top layer of non-stick material like Teflon. And the fascinating universe of two-part adhesives. Or how he unpacks the complexities involved in brewing the perfect cup of tea, as it involves striking the right balance of temperature (too low and the flavour molecules in the tea won't dissolve; too high and many of the tannins and polyphenols that give a bitter taste and astringency will also dissolve), timing (to ensure the perfect balance of the different kinds of volatiles), compared to the (relative) ease of making a decent cup of coffee.And the marvels of how soap works - that when you mix fat with an alkali (like ash water), the alkali transforms the fat molecules into hybrid molecules with a charged head that dissolves in water and a carbon tail that dissolves in fats. The carbon tails of hybrid soap molecules embed themselves in fat blobs, creating a charged surface with their heads that can dissolve in water. Thus allowing the fat blob to be washed away. [Fascinating factoids: Egg is the surfactant in mayonnaise, allowing the oil and water in mayo to bind. It's like soap in that respect and you can use egg yolk to clean your hair. P&G invented Ivory Soap and part of its marketing strategy was to sponsor serial dramas targeting housewives at home during the day. Hence the name 'soap opera'.]Like Stuff Matters, Liquid is very accessibly written, even for the science phobe. But unlike Stuff Matters, the conceit of Liquid - to wrap the material science within the larger narrative arc of Miodownik's flight, and his interactions with his fellow passenger, Susan - is distracting. Miodownik's attempts at humour - the disgust he evokes when he falls asleep and drools on Susan, when he sneezes on another passenger, when he obsesses about why the inflight safety video remains silent on the largest hazard of all, the fact that they will be in the air with thousands of gallons of combustible fuel - are pedestrian and awkward. For Stuff Matters, I'd felt that the sections where Miodownik tried to jazz things up a bit, to perhaps take a more creative treatment of the topic fell flat. Like when he discussed porcelain in the context of his parents' wedding tea set. The main thing here is really the fascinating science of liquids but Miodownik sometimes seems to forget this. Still, this is a fairly minor complaint in what is overall, a fun and fascinating read. "
73,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66635467-keen,4,"“Liquids have a duality: they are neither a gas nor solid, but something in-between. They are exciting and powerful, on the one hand, while being anarchic and slightly terrifying on the other.” Travelling on a trans-Atlantic flight from London to San Francisco, Miodownik uses a number of observations and thoughts as creative jumping off points to get into some whimsical and fascinating territory throughout the journey.This is a largely, but not always accessible investigation of sorts into some of the many liquids that most of us will encounter in our daily lives. A quirky odyssey loaded with lots of colourful facts and trivia to pull out down the pub or indeed any social occasion. I had no idea that the de Havilland Mosquito bomber used during WWII was made of plywood, which made it the fastest aircraft in the sky or that we use around 16 billion litres of oil every day throughout the world.Apparently there is 150’000 litres of kerosene stored in a jumbo jet (50’000 in the fuel tank below your feet and another 50’000 stored in each wing). And yet you could throw a lit match at it and it wouldn’t ignite. But mix it with the right amount of oxygen and it suddenly becomes an oil ten times as powerful as nitroglycerine.He talks about the crucial difference between ethanol and methanol, pure methanol can cause permanent blindness. Your body metabolises it into formic acid and formaldehyde. Formic acid attacks nerve cells, especially the optic nerve, hence the saying ‘blind drunk’. It also goes after your liver and kidneys and can cause permanent damage. Three glasses of it will kill you.Miodownik explains why drinking wine is a multi-sensory experience, and how more often than not many people enjoy paying for the brand more than the experience, “Some people love having the most expensive cars, they get real enjoyment out of what that says about them as a person. It’s the same with wines. But this doesn’t mean that these are better wines or better cars, or even that the owners are more sophisticated people.” He cites the experiments that managed to fool so called ‘wine experts’ that convinced them that they were drinking white wine, but thanks to a flavourless red dye they got suckered into describing it in detail as a red wine.He also covers many more interesting topics from 3-D printing, the humble yet fascinating biro pen and even the wonderful properties of tar and asphalt, he talks of the pitch drop experiment set up in 1927 by Prof Thomas Parnell at the University of Queensland, the first drop fell in 1938, the second in 1947, the third in 1954 and the ninth and most recent drop fell in 2014.One of the minor pitfalls in this book is that occasionally some of the topics get a little tedious and there are too many complex and bewildering diagrams of molecular structures for my taste, but that is sure to appeal to science and chemistry buffs alike, but you don’t have to study or understand them to enjoy the book.This reminded me of Paul Vanhoenacker’s “Skyfaring” (the book is mentioned in the further reading section). This book relies on a format used repeatedly by the likes of Gavin Francis, Alain de Botton and many others, which takes everyday subjects, and makes them relatively accessible, whilst allowing us to view seemingly mundane objects with a renewed sense of wonder. It’s a style that peppers the book with helpful and occasionally light-hearted images and the books are never too long. It’s a format that I happen to enjoy and it’s clearly a popular one too."
74,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20280886-sarah-smith,3,"More often than I care to admit my wee brain gets a bit overwhelmed and when this happens I tend to look for things that are objective as opposed to subjective. And it sort of gives me a break. Today’s break came in the form of a popular science book (Side note, I LOVE books classed as popular science) called Liquids by Mark Miodownik. Oddly enough it is a book about Liquids, from tea to superliquid Helium, kerosene and ink, the sea to lava. A whole plethora of them each with their own weird, dangerous and fascinating properties. And were it has the potential to be an excellent book it falls a little short. The major issue I had is how Miodownik frames the narrative. He is on a flight from London to San Francisco and he introduces the different liquids in an increasingly strained and conceited way related to this flight. This quickly starts to grate, the tone of these bits is sort of akin to an over enthusiastic kids TV presenter who has forgotten they are on Newsnight and are talking to Kirsty Wark as opposed to a group of pubescent children. But although I’ve started with the bad, it almost redeems itself as there is much to interest. I was born in 1986 and all I remember from primary school (we shall not read in to why I remember so little) concerns the Gulf War, an oil spill, and the ozone layer having a massive whole in it. And it was only in reading this I realised why in primary school we where told all about the whole in the ozone, as it was around this time the world realised the damage CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons) had done to the ozone, CFCs where used in refrigerators as a coolant, as they were seemingly harmless and inert, and then everyone realised this was not the case. It was actually the same fella responsible for this that said lead in petrol was safe too, so he’s not so much the greatest really. Apart from learning about coolants used in refrigerators, you also get to learn about so many things you would never stop to consider. How the ink in biros work, can you tell the difference between red and white wine if you cant see them (I to be fair would struggle to distinguish either from vinegar), why Eastenders is a soap, how ships float, and planes fly, that roads to a certain extent are self healing on account of the viscosity of tar(tar is actually a liquid, just a million times as viscous as peanut butter) man made clouds (Russia uses them every May to make sure May Day celebrations are rain free, the little rascals) also just you know clouds in general. It’s almost a history of the world told via the scientific progress concerning liquids that are often vital to our existence without us really ever thinking too much about them. Despite all of this I was left feeling a little short changed. It is possible I expect too much, I’ve been spoiled by books such as those written by Simon Singh (Fermats last theorem, Big Bang) or Sam Kean’s The Disappearing Spoon which have a more consistent tone, and I found to captivate me more, but just because these are better doesn’t make Liquids bad, just not as good as I had hoped. Mostly it suffers from how he introduces the liquids in each instance, and I know I’ve written about how it is interesting but like an under seasoned soup there wasn’t quite enough of the interesting. It felt a little padded in parts and too much time was spent on irrelevant personal anecdotes. Sadly not nearly as good as it could have been."
75,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4137725-phoebe,5,"Right now I'm experiencing that 4pm listlessness. It's either coffee or nap. Resistance is futile. No one is productive at 4pm. So here I am, writing about a book about liquids instead of...never you mind.Liquid Rules: The Delightful and Dangerous Substances That Flowed Through Our Lives (2020) is Mark Miodownik's follow-up to Stuff Matters: The Strange Stories of the Marvellous Materials that Shape Our Man-made World (2014), which won the 2014 Royal Society Winton Prize for Science books and the 2015 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Communication Award. I didn’t know either awards existed but they seem relevant and most likely well-deserved because it is so, so easy to commend the quality of his writing.I wouldn’t say Liquid Rules bears epistemological significance. But you don’t read a book about liquids because you think there’s some quintessential knowledge you’re missing. You read it because you passed year 12 chemistry and now you can have that moment of vainglory realising you didn’t memorise chemical compounds and equations for nothing because you actually understand what an actual scientist gasp is saying. HA. Just kidding. I liked the title and thought it sounded unusual and entertaining. More importantly, I knew it wasn’t gonna be emotionally taxing. The kind of tension I’ve been experiencing has been unreal and I can’t explain why I’m so tense. I blame it on animal crossing which is meant to be a relaxing game but my perfectionism is ruining it for me. (Why can’t I place THIS bush next to THIS rock?!) In any case, I need something breezy but not fluffy.What makes Liquid Rules entertaining is how casual Miodownik sounds. The entire book is structured around Miodownik’s flight to San Francisco where he is to attend a scientific conference. As he is going through customs and security, he muses on what makes peanut butter a liquid and not a solid according to airline regulations. As the plane is taking off, he considers the discovery of kerosene in the premodern era and the incredible fact that no one knew its awesome power. Then mid-flight, he provides an endless stream of anecdotes about the terrifying power of storm clouds (when the plane experiences turbulence), why he prefers soap bars over liquid soap (when he goes to the bathroom), why we find snot disgusting (when curry dribbles down his chin), why the invention of biro was a complex problem with a surprisingly simple solution (when he signs the arrival card), and finally, the future when we can store man-made data like digital photographs inside droplets of liquid (as he arrives at the scientific conference). It feels like you’re flying and you’re listening in to all the amusing did-you-knows as the person next to you chatters on about the marvellous things we’re seeing. All in all, it’s like being offered a gaze into a secret network of things, where whaling in the nineteenth century is somehow related to the rise of the soap industry which is also related to the creation of soap opera during morning hours. The connective ‘thingness’ of life is suddenly made apparent and it is a wondrous sight. The world is a connected place. It’s connected by the seeping, oozing, dripping and molten liquids that flow in and out of us, around us, beneath us, and above us. Humans are 60% water and our planet is 70% water. We are living in an aqueous state on an aqueous planet, so it’s almost self-deceiving to think the world around us is solid and concrete when our body is formed in amniotic fluids and ends with being decomposed into minerals, water and gas. And isn’t it just the strangest thing to think one day, instead of relying on computers that speak in 0s and 1s, we will have biochemical computation that takes place on a molecular level? Yep. Mind blown. "
76,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109535466-mike-parkes,4,"Entertaining but scattered book describing the chemistry and applications of assorted liquids. I think this goes by different names in North America and Europe – the version I have is just titled “Liquid”. Lots of interesting details, and Miodownik is an entertaining and informative writer. However, the choice of liquids and their properties is random, with the organizing principle of the book being liquids one comes across on a flight (or is otherwise impacted by, e.g. clouds). The connecting interludes between chapters become annoying quite early on in the book (e.g. a trip to the lavatory provides the opportunity to discuss soaps and cleaning products). By the end, you’re left with a pastiche of chapters on different topics, some enlightening, some less so, but not a good grasp on liquids as a whole. A strong introductory chapter on the properties of liquids would really have helped. Not quite as good as Miodownik’s “Stuff Matters” which was similar in format but dealt with common solid materials (primarily structural).A few chapters I enjoyed in “Liquid” were:•	How the volatility and flash point of hydrocarbon liquids such as kerosene (jet fuel) and oils affected their use in lighting and energy products (ch 1)•	Glues, liquids that change to solids and form permanent bonds (ch 4). •	Refrigeration and air conditioning, from liquids that boil near room temperature, enabling them to transfer a large amount of heat through phase changes (ch 9).•	Pen inks, and the engineering and chemistry of designing a pen with ink that will flow on the page and turn into a solid without making a mess (ch 10).Other chapters deal with the intoxicating properties of alcohols (ch 2), the properties of the ocean (ch 3), liquid crystal displays (ch 5), bodily fluids (ch 6), the chemistry of tea and coffee (ch 7), soaps and detergents (ch 8), clouds (ch 11), the slow flow of ice and rocks on the earrh’s surface (ch 12), and sustainable materials such as self-healing asphalt (ch 13)."
77,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90301926-kaj,2,"You might think that “Liquid Rules” is about the science of liquids. Don’t be fooled. It’s actually one long kinda cringy story about Mark Miodownik’s flying experience, with some chemistry asides.I loved Miodownik’s previous book, “Stuff Matters,” where he explains how the big properties of everyday materials come from their chemical structure. Why are alloys sometimes stronger than the metals they’re made from? What does it mean to be conductive? Miodownik keeps his explanations simple and mechanistic, aided by small hand-drawn doodles. Unlike many other pop sci books, “Stuff Matters” never falls into the trap of focusing too much on what is important to know, rather than what’s interesting and informative. The info:tainment ratio is good- accessible enough for high school level students while still interesting for scientists. Sure, he sprinkles in some occasionally boring personal anecdotes, but every materials chem book would benefit from a few breathers.“Liquid Rules” doubles down on the bad parts of “Stuff Matters” while forgetting what made it great. Each chapter focuses on a different liquid. A major part of the book is trying to relate each liquid to something that happens on a single trans-Atlantic flight. This plot device seems to be an attempt to make the liquid chemistry seem useful by relating it to real-world phenomena, but the cumulative effect is the opposite. Too much time spent on why these chemicals are important, and not enough on why they’re interesting, mixed with long personal anecdotes and scientist biographies that are neither important nor interesting. For a book about fluids, “Liquid Rules” is just a little bit too dry."
78,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4261166-marshall,5,"I love the way Mark Miodownik writes. He addresses subjects that are seemingly boring (if you say it out loud like when I told my girlfriend I was reading about glue, and tape, and tvs) and opens up the mystery entirely, sparking a fascinating world of chemical wonder. His rhetoric and storytelling can deliver the scientific details in an easily digestible manner without using any scientific tools such as graphs, charts, and data sheets, only rudimentary drawings (which helped a whole lot and were very welcome enterprises). I was tremendously inspired by this book and every single chapter tapped into a childlike awe of the materials of the world around me. I learned and relearned many aspects of earth science and things I've only imagined. Honestly, I wish someone like a teacher or mentor would have been able to put this book in my hands when I was in early high school because I believe it may have changed the trajectory of my life. I might have sought out a career in material science. So, since that obviously didn't happen seeing how he wrote this book in the recent decade, I will be sure to pass it along to a young friend or a deer friend's young adult. In any case, this book just goes to show that there is ALWAYS something to marvel at, even if you find yourself experiencing a bit of ennui. Just walk outside and check out a flower or if you're stuck inside pick up a pen and peer a little bit closer into all that makes it possible. Absolutely LOVED both of Miodownik's books. I will be buying these two and looking forward to the next one (please write another!)!"
79,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92179113-patrick-green,4,"I typically associate scientists with tall guys in lab coats. Careful, fastidious, and, when in the lab, organized. I know this is a crude generalization, but there is certainly a nugget of truth to this statement. The scientist of this book, Mark Miodownik, should have kept this nugget of truth in mind when he was writing this book. ""Liquid Rules"" is messy and disjointed, primarily because of the framework that Miodownik uses to explain the properties and everyday uses of certain liquids. This made the reading experience for myself at times boring. I cared more for his explanations on the properties of tea, coffee, and ink for example than I did for kerosene or soap. I also did not care for his tangents. I was mostly looking for information on how certain liquids, or liquids in general, function. I did not care much to hear about his trip from England to San Francisco. It was a very plain framework. The details surrounding this framework, the scientific extrapolations on liquids, propelled my interest.I enjoyed the information on the liquids that Miodownik provided. I also relished some of the historical background of these liquids. They taught some valuable conclusions that I should make on certain liquids. For example, I can definitively say that I am a coffee drinker, not a tea drinker. And now I have scientific evidence to support my subjective opinion. Thank you, Miodownik.The last pleasant note that I found on the book was the laid back pace. I felt as though I could read it on a nice Sunday afternoon while also getting some mental exercise. Despite how messy and boring the framework was, it's a very enjoyable book to read, and I would recommend it."
80,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1109379-colette,3,"“Liquids are the alter ego of dependable solid stuff. Whereas solid materials are humanity’s faithful friend, taking on the permanent shapes of clothes, shoes, phones, cars, and indeed airports, liquids are fluid; they will take on any shape, but only while contained. When they’re not contained, they are always on the move, seeping, corroding, dripping, and escaping our control. If you put a solid material somewhere, it stays there—barring forcible removal—often doing something very useful, like holding up a building or supplying electricity for a whole community. Liquids, on the other hand, are anarchic: they have a knack for destroying things. In a bathroom, for instance, it is a constant battle to keep water from seeping into cracks and pooling under the floor, where it gets up to no good, rotting and undermining the wooden joists; on a smooth tile floor, water is the perfect slip hazard, causing an enormous number of injuries; and when it gathers in the corners of the bathroom, it can harbor black slimy fungus and bacteria, which threaten to infiltrate our bodies and make us sick. And yet, despite all this treachery, we love the stuff; we love bathing in water, and showering in it, drenching the whole body. And what bathroom is complete without a cornucopia of bottled liquid soaps, shampoos, and conditioners, jars of cream, and tubes of toothpaste? We delight in these miraculous liquids and yet we worry about them too: Are they bad for us? Do they cause cancer? Do they ruin the environment? With liquids, delight and suspicion go hand in hand. They are duplicitous by nature, neither a gas nor a solid but something in between, something inscrutable and mysterious.”"
81,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83179136-catherine-puma,4,"I was delighted when I saw Miodownik was coming out with another book. Having enjoyed his ""Stuff Matters"", I acquired ""Liquid Rules"" and was not disappointed. Framed by the narrative device of observing liquids around him while flying from Britain to California, Miodownik describes oceans, glaciers, clouds, wine, saliva, droplets in the pressurized cabin, tea, coffee, blood... to name a few. I learned so much! As a result, I found myself not just noticing all the liquids I encounter in my life, but also contemplating what properties they have in relation to one another. This included pondering the process of converting my bar of solid soap into a liquid substance by interacting it with water, another liquid. Miodownik's section on hand soap vs. liquid soap (and his preference for the former) was thus especially interesting. My only quibble with this work was its lack of acknowledging its own limitations. The subtitle implies that ""dangerous"" liquids would also be discussed, but--with the exception of mercury--the diversity of naturally occurring toxins and poisons are not mentioned. Of course it is unrealistic to expect such a short work to touch upon everything, but I wish there was more of a ""there's so much more to learn and discuss"" preface and/or conclusion. That being said, this was extremely eye opening, as ""Stuff Matters"" was, and I will be recommending it to many. This is a great way to inspire a natural curiosity for the natural observation of fluid dynamics. I can even see myself re-reading it again! "
82,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/964960-george,4,"As with his earlier Stuff Matters: Exploring the Marvelous Materials That Shape Our Man-Made World, Miodownik selects a convenient frame in which to hang his description of various types of liquids and the ways in which they affect our lives. In this case, it's a transatlantic flight from London to San Francisco, giving him the opportunity to reflect on, among other things, the hot beverages served by the flight attendants, refrigeration systems, the glue that holds the plane's wings to the fuselage, and of course the large body of water over which he flies. Like most popular books about science, there are parts that are going to be overly simplistic for experts, or even knowledgeable non-experts, but Miodownik is among the group of writers who, I think, manages to strike the right balance. The framework is contrived, yes, but it has also helped me to retain a fair amount of what was discussed, and I found myself thinking about it on my own flight to California (especially the part about the glue...). My only real criticism is that his observations of his seatmate, Susan, while in the name of setting us up for a reveal later on, came off as a bit creepy at times. "
83,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/190448-karen,4,"If you're into science, this book is a gem.It's written by a material scientist and the story is told on a flight from London to San Francisco, ostensibly focusing on all the liquids on board but it's really just a premise to tell the stories he wants to tell. The fact that he was on board a flight was cute but seemed contrived a bit at parts. But I didn't really care because the science and stories were super interesting to me. This book has 12 chapters, each chapter focusing on a different substance like glue, ink, etc. I loved the bits about how candles work and how the wick pulls water up against the force of gravity. I learned about how the World Trade Centers buckled due to the strength of the steel decreasing under such high heat and then putting pressure on the lower floors, etc. And how flavor is a multi-sensory experience (and how we assume and 'can taste' flavors related to the color.) I also loved reading how icarus story wouldn't be possible because it gets colder when you fly higher :) I loved learning about ballpoint pens and how they work (and how amazing they are!!) and about tar and all the interesting new innovations they are making to help the roads last longer.There is just so much fascinating science in this book. Highly enjoyable. thanks to netgalley for an advanced copy in exchange for an honest review."
84,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7273557-gary,3," Mark Miodownik book Liquid Rules takes the reader on a transatlantic flight from London to San Francisco. His profession is in materials. The security line examining for liquids and then the pre-flight safety lecture triggers in him what liquids are we talking about? For one, the jet you are flying in is really a bomb, full of kerosene. After getting you all panicked about ever flying again, there is talk of alcohol, tea, coffee, soaps, ketchup, and many other items. His explanations are very readable and when he traces inventions, it makes the subject matter come alive.The book is told in sections, divided by the type of liquids he encounters along the way. He leads an interesting discussion about why the liquids are different and how various liquids you would not associate are similar. I found that after about the fifth chapter of this, I was getting a bit overwhelmed with the detail of explanation-I usually find details like he presents as interesting. So I am not sure why this bugs me. I would chalk it up to the reader more than the writer.I would recommend this book. But if you do read the book, try taking the book in smaller chunks rather than as a book to read straight through.For more of my thoughts, please see my book blog."
85,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"Mark Miodownik explores the mundanely marvelous liquids that make up our lives in the framework of a transatlantic flight from London to San Francisco with Liquid Rules. Liquid Rules explores the different aspects of liquids as they relate to making our lives easier. Take Kerosene as an example. Kerosene was first discovered back in 900 CE or around that century by an Arabic Alchemist and Scholar. The only problem was that Olive Oil was preferred for lamps since the government could tax it.Miodownik goes over a great many subjects and ideas. He writes about distillation, flashpoints, chemical structures, and so much more. The book reminds me a bit of Gravity’s Rainbow with all of the different information that the author stuffs into the pages, but this book is far more accessible.There are a lot of different things that Miodownik brings to your attention. Think of the humble candle as a great example. It might seem easy to understand, but there is a lot of physics going on to make sure that a candle works properly. Another thing to think about is as simple as a ballpoint pen. Even the ink had to be engineered for the proper viscosity and binding properties.I will probably search for Miodownik’s other books like Stuff Matters, assuming I haven’t read them already. "
86,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102314750-sam,0,"Liquid Rules is a book that examines in the depth the relationships between various liquids and how they affect our world. Traveling between London, San Francisco, and on the plane ride between, Mark Miodownik teaches us the surprising truth of how reliant we are as a people on liquids. While diving into the mechanical sciences of things, often discussing liquids in regards to thermal properties, the 2nd law of thermodynamics, and quantum relationships, he doesn't become completely absorbed in this writing remembering to include more colloquial evaluations. These reviews, often revolve around a specific liquids contribution to society, the history of how it was created (or found, and how it may be revolutionized in the future, and provides a sense balance and completion to his writing. Unlike many scientists who often thrive and exploit the mysticism (or more correctly lack of education) around their work to make themselves more interesting Mark Miodownik takes pride in his humanity, often talking about how his work around liquids stems from the want to learn. Overall, Liquid Rules is a unique book, that relays with humor and wit how the science, history, and properties of many liquids bear a pivotal role in the development of our modern industrialized society."
87,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40472466-dan,5,"Once again, after Stuff Matters, Mark Miodownik brings about the joy of acknowledging the material matters around us. It is an excellent book if you want to follow the meandering thoughts of the author.""Liquids have a duality: they are neither a gas nor a solid, but something in between. They are exciting and powerful, on the one hand, while anarchic and slightly terrifying on the other. That is their nature.""The liquid is a core part of what makes us living beings, how we interact with the world. Earth's molten-metal liquid core creates a magnetic field that protects water from being dried up due to the solar wind. We wouldn't have a vast amount of water in the sea without the core.Our energy source is often in a liquid form, e.g., whale oil, gasoline, kerosene, diesel. Some explosives are in liquid form like nitroglycerin, which is the reason why a certain amount of liquid is not allowed to carry on planes.Of course, we drink water, alcohol (ethanol, not methanol), wine, coffee, and tea. Our body is also mostly liquid. Our saliva helps us digest, kills pain, and protects us from bacterias (and bad breath). We cry and drop tears. We put on perfumes (methanol). We clean using soap.We watch (LCD: liquid crystal displays).Look up and see clouds? They are liquid too.The author tells these stories while he takes a flight to his conference. His perspectives are refreshing especially since flying is one of the worst experiences that I have to endure. It is cramped. There is an invisible tension over the armrest. The middle seat gets the two, does anyone disagree? The air is too dry. Food is usually horrible if served. A trip to the bathroom is bothersome. Now I know what to do. Order coffee instead of tea. Sleep without drooling. Watch movies which I would enjoy more. Last but not least, appreciate liquids!"
88,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48901937-kyle-dinges,4,"Liquid Rules by Mark Miodownik is a book that looks at some of the most important liquids that society depends on and gives a bit of a brief background on their chemical makeup and how they were created or discovered. It is easily accessible, which is something I usually look for in non-fiction about science. Like his first book, Stuff Matters, Miodownik has a knack for writing about complex scientific ideas in a way that are easy for the lay person to understand. He sprinkles in plenty of humor to keep things lively and never drones on for too long about one subject. The idea to use an airplane ride to introduce each liquid, and demonstrate their abundance in life, was a good way to present each liquid in a logical order and talk about real life applications. All of this just serves to make the book more entertaining and interesting. There's a delicate balance to making a book like this informative and entertaining, and Miodownik does a good job in that regard.Someone looking for a more expansive an in depth text might be a bit let down, but for someone just looking for an entertaining ""pop-science"" read, I think this book more than fits the bill."
89,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12527649-kristin,4,"Generally speaking, this was a good overview of various properties of liquids, how we interact with them, and how they affect us. It took an extremely broad area of knowledge and made it understandable (and enjoyable!) for the semi-layperson. I especially enjoyed the chapter on saliva (weird, I know, but it was of professional interest haha). I also enjoyed the chapter on tea, coffee, and other beverages. The reason I knocked a star off of my review is because the author often says “double blind studies have shown...” or “studies have shown...” but does not cite these studies or sources. There is a “further reading” section at the end of the book, but none of the resources are linked to the specific claims presented in the main body. I know this is supposed to be a general overview, but if sources are claimed, they should be cited. This normally wouldn’t bug me so much, but I would actually like to read some of those studies.... (including the one mentioned in the cooling chapter, where the author talks about perfluorocarbons as a substitute for blood and the subsequent clinical trials). IT’S BREATHABLE LIQUID. Doesn’t that sound like some worthwhile further reading?"

102,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,4,"I'd really enjoyed Miodownik's Stuff Matters, on the science of different solid materials like glass, metal, concrete and graphite, and was excited that he had a book on liquids. Whereas Stuff Matters covered the materials that Miodownik presumably found the most fascinating and significant in terms of daily life, the conceit for Liquid is the different kinds of liquids Miodownik encounters on a flight - oils, alcohol, water, glue, liquid crystals, saliva, tea and coffee, soap, refrigerants, ink, clouds, magma and tar (the latter two signifying the end of his journey when the plane lands). In Liquid, Miodownik weaves a fascinating narrative that draws from chemistry, physics, science history, earth science, to name a few. It's full of fascinating nuggets. Like why it is dangerous to consume home brews or alcohol-based liquids for a cheap high because the methanol in them hasn't been removed; methanol is metabolised into formic acid and formaldehyde in the body, where the formic acid attacks your nerve cells, especially the optic nerve, leaving you blind (hence the expression 'blind drunk'). Like how it is rubber that gives Post-It Notes their stickiness; the notes have an adhesive layer of rubber on them where the microscopic spheres of rubber bond tightly to the note but create only a small adhesive force when pressed onto a surface. Or that sticky tape has three layers, a bottom layer of adhesive, a middle layer of cellophane for strength and transparency and a top layer of non-stick material like Teflon. And the fascinating universe of two-part adhesives. Or how he unpacks the complexities involved in brewing the perfect cup of tea, as it involves striking the right balance of temperature (too low and the flavour molecules in the tea won't dissolve; too high and many of the tannins and polyphenols that give a bitter taste and astringency will also dissolve), timing (to ensure the perfect balance of the different kinds of volatiles), compared to the (relative) ease of making a decent cup of coffee.And the marvels of how soap works - that when you mix fat with an alkali (like ash water), the alkali transforms the fat molecules into hybrid molecules with a charged head that dissolves in water and a carbon tail that dissolves in fats. The carbon tails of hybrid soap molecules embed themselves in fat blobs, creating a charged surface with their heads that can dissolve in water. Thus allowing the fat blob to be washed away. [Fascinating factoids: Egg is the surfactant in mayonnaise, allowing the oil and water in mayo to bind. It's like soap in that respect and you can use egg yolk to clean your hair. P&G invented Ivory Soap and part of its marketing strategy was to sponsor serial dramas targeting housewives at home during the day. Hence the name 'soap opera'.]Like Stuff Matters, Liquid is very accessibly written, even for the science phobe. But unlike Stuff Matters, the conceit of Liquid - to wrap the material science within the larger narrative arc of Miodownik's flight, and his interactions with his fellow passenger, Susan - is distracting. Miodownik's attempts at humour - the disgust he evokes when he falls asleep and drools on Susan, when he sneezes on another passenger, when he obsesses about why the inflight safety video remains silent on the largest hazard of all, the fact that they will be in the air with thousands of gallons of combustible fuel - are pedestrian and awkward. For Stuff Matters, I'd felt that the sections where Miodownik tried to jazz things up a bit, to perhaps take a more creative treatment of the topic fell flat. Like when he discussed porcelain in the context of his parents' wedding tea set. The main thing here is really the fascinating science of liquids but Miodownik sometimes seems to forget this. Still, this is a fairly minor complaint in what is overall, a fun and fascinating read. "

They are exciting and powerful, on the one hand, while being anarchic and slightly terrifying on the other.” Travelling on a trans-Atlantic flight from London to San Francisco, Miodownik uses a number of observations and thoughts as creative jumping off points to get into some whimsical and fascinating territory throughout the journey.This is a largely, but not always accessible investigation of sorts into some of the many liquids that most of us will encounter in our daily lives. A quirky odyssey loaded with lots of colourful facts and trivia to pull out down the pub or indeed any social occasion. I had no idea that the de Havilland Mosquito bomber used during WWII was made of plywood, which made it the fastest aircraft in the sky or that we use around 16 billion litres of oil every day throughout the world.Apparently there is 150’000 litres of kerosene stored in a jumbo jet (50’000 in the fuel tank below your feet and another 50’000 stored in each wing). And yet you could throw a lit match at it and it wouldn’t ignite. But mix it with the right amount of oxygen and it suddenly becomes an oil ten times as powerful as nitroglycerine.He talks about the crucial difference between ethanol and methanol, pure methanol can cause permanent blindness. Your body metabolises it into formic acid and formaldehyde. Formic acid attacks nerve cells, especially the optic nerve, hence the saying ‘blind drunk’. It also goes after your liver and kidneys and can cause permanent damage. Three glasses of it will kill you.Miodownik explains why drinking wine is a multi-sensory experience, and how more often than not many people enjoy paying for the brand more than the experience, “Some people love having the most expensive cars, they get real enjoyment out of what that says about them as a person. It’s the same with wines. But this doesn’t mean that these are better wines or better cars, or even that the owners are more sophisticated people.” He cites the experiments that managed to fool so called ‘wine experts’ that convinced them that they were drinking white wine, but thanks to a flavourless red dye they got suckered into describing it in detail as a red wine.He also covers many more interesting topics from 3-D printing, the humble yet fascinating biro pen and even the wonderful properties of tar and asphalt, he talks of the pitch drop experiment set up in 1927 by Prof Thomas Parnell at the University of Queensland, the first drop fell in 1938, the second in 1947, the third in 1954 and the ninth and most recent drop fell in 2014.One of the minor pitfalls in this book is that occasionally some of the topics get a little tedious and there are too many complex and bewildering diagrams of molecular structures for my taste, but that is sure to appeal to science and chemistry buffs alike, but you don’t have to study or understand them to enjoy the book.This reminded me of Paul Vanhoenacker’s “Skyfaring” (the book is mentioned in the further reading section). This book relies on a format used repeatedly by the likes of Gavin Francis, Alain de Botton and many others, which takes everyday subjects, and makes them relatively accessible, whilst allowing us to view seemingly mundane objects with a renewed sense of wonder. It’s a style that peppers the book with helpful and occasionally light-hearted images and the books are never too long. It’s a format that I happen to enjoy and it’s clearly a popular one too."
104,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20280886-sarah-smith,3,"More often than I care to admit my wee brain gets a bit overwhelmed and when this happens I tend to look for things that are objective as opposed to subjective. And it sort of gives me a break. Today’s break came in the form of a popular science book (Side note, I LOVE books classed as popular science) called Liquids by Mark Miodownik. Oddly enough it is a book about Liquids, from tea to superliquid Helium, kerosene and ink, the sea to lava. A whole plethora of them each with their own weird, dangerous and fascinating properties. And were it has the potential to be an excellent book it falls a little short. The major issue I had is how Miodownik frames the narrative. He is on a flight from London to San Francisco and he introduces the different liquids in an increasingly strained and conceited way related to this flight. This quickly starts to grate, the tone of these bits is sort of akin to an over enthusiastic kids TV presenter who has forgotten they are on Newsnight and are talking to Kirsty Wark as opposed to a group of pubescent children. But although I’ve started with the bad, it almost redeems itself as there is much to interest. I was born in 1986 and all I remember from primary school (we shall not read in to why I remember so little) concerns the Gulf War, an oil spill, and the ozone layer having a massive whole in it. And it was only in reading this I realised why in primary school we where told all about the whole in the ozone, as it was around this time the world realised the damage CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons) had done to the ozone, CFCs where used in refrigerators as a coolant, as they were seemingly harmless and inert, and then everyone realised this was not the case. It was actually the same fella responsible for this that said lead in petrol was safe too, so he’s not so much the greatest really. Apart from learning about coolants used in refrigerators, you also get to learn about so many things you would never stop to consider. How the ink in biros work, can you tell the difference between red and white wine if you cant see them (I to be fair would struggle to distinguish either from vinegar), why Eastenders is a soap, how ships float, and planes fly, that roads to a certain extent are self healing on account of the viscosity of tar(tar is actually a liquid, just a million times as viscous as peanut butter) man made clouds (Russia uses them every May to make sure May Day celebrations are rain free, the little rascals) also just you know clouds in general. It’s almost a history of the world told via the scientific progress concerning liquids that are often vital to our existence without us really ever thinking too much about them. Despite all of this I was left feeling a little short changed. It is possible I expect too much, I’ve been spoiled by books such as those written by Simon Singh (Fermats last theorem, Big Bang) or Sam Kean’s The Disappearing Spoon which have a more consistent tone, and I found to captivate me more, but just because these are better doesn’t make Liquids bad, just not as good as I had hoped. Mostly it suffers from how he introduces the liquids in each instance, and I know I’ve written about how it is interesting but like an under seasoned soup there wasn’t quite enough of the interesting. It felt a little padded in parts and too much time was spent on irrelevant personal anecdotes. Sadly not nearly as good as it could have been."
105,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4137725-phoebe,5,"Right now I'm experiencing that 4pm listlessness. It's either coffee or nap. Resistance is futile. No one is productive at 4pm. So here I am, writing about a book about liquids instead of...never you mind.Liquid Rules: The Delightful and Dangerous Substances That Flowed Through Our Lives (2020) is Mark Miodownik's follow-up to Stuff Matters: The Strange Stories of the Marvellous Materials that Shape Our Man-made World (2014), which won the 2014 Royal Society Winton Prize for Science books and the 2015 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Communication Award. I didn’t know either awards existed but they seem relevant and most likely well-deserved because it is so, so easy to commend the quality of his writing.I wouldn’t say Liquid Rules bears epistemological significance. But you don’t read a book about liquids because you think there’s some quintessential knowledge you’re missing. You read it because you passed year 12 chemistry and now you can have that moment of vainglory realising you didn’t memorise chemical compounds and equations for nothing because you actually understand what an actual scientist gasp is saying. HA. Just kidding. I liked the title and thought it sounded unusual and entertaining. More importantly, I knew it wasn’t gonna be emotionally taxing. The kind of tension I’ve been experiencing has been unreal and I can’t explain why I’m so tense. I blame it on animal crossing which is meant to be a relaxing game but my perfectionism is ruining it for me. (Why can’t I place THIS bush next to THIS rock?!) In any case, I need something breezy but not fluffy.What makes Liquid Rules entertaining is how casual Miodownik sounds. The entire book is structured around Miodownik’s flight to San Francisco where he is to attend a scientific conference. As he is going through customs and security, he muses on what makes peanut butter a liquid and not a solid according to airline regulations. As the plane is taking off, he considers the discovery of kerosene in the premodern era and the incredible fact that no one knew its awesome power. Then mid-flight, he provides an endless stream of anecdotes about the terrifying power of storm clouds (when the plane experiences turbulence), why he prefers soap bars over liquid soap (when he goes to the bathroom), why we find snot disgusting (when curry dribbles down his chin), why the invention of biro was a complex problem with a surprisingly simple solution (when he signs the arrival card), and finally, the future when we can store man-made data like digital photographs inside droplets of liquid (as he arrives at the scientific conference). It feels like you’re flying and you’re listening in to all the amusing did-you-knows as the person next to you chatters on about the marvellous things we’re seeing. All in all, it’s like being offered a gaze into a secret network of things, where whaling in the nineteenth century is somehow related to the rise of the soap industry which is also related to the creation of soap opera during morning hours. The connective ‘thingness’ of life is suddenly made apparent and it is a wondrous sight. The world is a connected place. It’s connected by the seeping, oozing, dripping and molten liquids that flow in and out of us, around us, beneath us, and above us. Humans are 60% water and our planet is 70% water. We are living in an aqueous state on an aqueous planet, so it’s almost self-deceiving to think the world around us is solid and concrete when our body is formed in amniotic fluids and ends with being decomposed into minerals, water and gas. And isn’t it just the strangest thing to think one day, instead of relying on computers that speak in 0s and 1s, we will have biochemical computation that takes place on a molecular level? Yep. Mind blown. "
106,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109535466-mike-parkes,4,"Entertaining but scattered book describing the chemistry and applications of assorted liquids. I think this goes by different names in North America and Europe – the version I have is just titled “Liquid”. Lots of interesting details, and Miodownik is an entertaining and informative writer. However, the choice of liquids and their properties is random, with the organizing principle of the book being liquids one comes across on a flight (or is otherwise impacted by, e.g. clouds). The connecting interludes between chapters become annoying quite early on in the book (e.g. a trip to the lavatory provides the opportunity to discuss soaps and cleaning products). By the end, you’re left with a pastiche of chapters on different topics, some enlightening, some less so, but not a good grasp on liquids as a whole. A strong introductory chapter on the properties of liquids would really have helped. Not quite as good as Miodownik’s “Stuff Matters” which was similar in format but dealt with common solid materials (primarily structural).A few chapters I enjoyed in “Liquid” were:•	How the volatility and flash point of hydrocarbon liquids such as kerosene (jet fuel) and oils affected their use in lighting and energy products (ch 1)•	Glues, liquids that change to solids and form permanent bonds (ch 4). •	Refrigeration and air conditioning, from liquids that boil near room temperature, enabling them to transfer a large amount of heat through phase changes (ch 9).•	Pen inks, and the engineering and chemistry of designing a pen with ink that will flow on the page and turn into a solid without making a mess (ch 10).Other chapters deal with the intoxicating properties of alcohols (ch 2), the properties of the ocean (ch 3), liquid crystal displays (ch 5), bodily fluids (ch 6), the chemistry of tea and coffee (ch 7), soaps and detergents (ch 8), clouds (ch 11), the slow flow of ice and rocks on the earrh’s surface (ch 12), and sustainable materials such as self-healing asphalt (ch 13)."
107,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90301926-kaj,2,"You might think that “Liquid Rules” is about the science of liquids. Don’t be fooled. It’s actually one long kinda cringy story about Mark Miodownik’s flying experience, with some chemistry asides.I loved Miodownik’s previous book, “Stuff Matters,” where he explains how the big properties of everyday materials come from their chemical structure. Why are alloys sometimes stronger than the metals they’re made from? What does it mean to be conductive? Miodownik keeps his explanations simple and mechanistic, aided by small hand-drawn doodles. Unlike many other pop sci books, “Stuff Matters” never falls into the trap of focusing too much on what is important to know, rather than what’s interesting and informative. The info:tainment ratio is good- accessible enough for high school level students while still interesting for scientists. Sure, he sprinkles in some occasionally boring personal anecdotes, but every materials chem book would benefit from a few breathers.“Liquid Rules” doubles down on the bad parts of “Stuff Matters” while forgetting what made it great. Each chapter focuses on a different liquid. A major part of the book is trying to relate each liquid to something that happens on a single trans-Atlantic flight. This plot device seems to be an attempt to make the liquid chemistry seem useful by relating it to real-world phenomena, but the cumulative effect is the opposite. Too much time spent on why these chemicals are important, and not enough on why they’re interesting, mixed with long personal anecdotes and scientist biographies that are neither important nor interesting. For a book about fluids, “Liquid Rules” is just a little bit too dry."
108,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4261166-marshall,5,"I love the way Mark Miodownik writes. He addresses subjects that are seemingly boring (if you say it out loud like when I told my girlfriend I was reading about glue, and tape, and tvs) and opens up the mystery entirely, sparking a fascinating world of chemical wonder. His rhetoric and storytelling can deliver the scientific details in an easily digestible manner without using any scientific tools such as graphs, charts, and data sheets, only rudimentary drawings (which helped a whole lot and were very welcome enterprises). I was tremendously inspired by this book and every single chapter tapped into a childlike awe of the materials of the world around me. I learned and relearned many aspects of earth science and things I've only imagined. Honestly, I wish someone like a teacher or mentor would have been able to put this book in my hands when I was in early high school because I believe it may have changed the trajectory of my life. I might have sought out a career in material science. So, since that obviously didn't happen seeing how he wrote this book in the recent decade, I will be sure to pass it along to a young friend or a deer friend's young adult. In any case, this book just goes to show that there is ALWAYS something to marvel at, even if you find yourself experiencing a bit of ennui. Just walk outside and check out a flower or if you're stuck inside pick up a pen and peer a little bit closer into all that makes it possible. Absolutely LOVED both of Miodownik's books. I will be buying these two and looking forward to the next one (please write another!)!"
109,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92179113-patrick-green,4,"I typically associate scientists with tall guys in lab coats. Careful, fastidious, and, when in the lab, organized. I know this is a crude generalization, but there is certainly a nugget of truth to this statement. The scientist of this book, Mark Miodownik, should have kept this nugget of truth in mind when he was writing this book. ""Liquid Rules"" is messy and disjointed, primarily because of the framework that Miodownik uses to explain the properties and everyday uses of certain liquids. This made the reading experience for myself at times boring. I cared more for his explanations on the properties of tea, coffee, and ink for example than I did for kerosene or soap. I also did not care for his tangents. I was mostly looking for information on how certain liquids, or liquids in general, function. I did not care much to hear about his trip from England to San Francisco. It was a very plain framework. The details surrounding this framework, the scientific extrapolations on liquids, propelled my interest.I enjoyed the information on the liquids that Miodownik provided. I also relished some of the historical background of these liquids. They taught some valuable conclusions that I should make on certain liquids. For example, I can definitively say that I am a coffee drinker, not a tea drinker. And now I have scientific evidence to support my subjective opinion. Thank you, Miodownik.The last pleasant note that I found on the book was the laid back pace. I felt as though I could read it on a nice Sunday afternoon while also getting some mental exercise. Despite how messy and boring the framework was, it's a very enjoyable book to read, and I would recommend it."
110,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1109379-colette,3,"“Liquids are the alter ego of dependable solid stuff. Whereas solid materials are humanity’s faithful friend, taking on the permanent shapes of clothes, shoes, phones, cars, and indeed airports, liquids are fluid; they will take on any shape, but only while contained. When they’re not contained, they are always on the move, seeping, corroding, dripping, and escaping our control. If you put a solid material somewhere, it stays there—barring forcible removal—often doing something very useful, like holding up a building or supplying electricity for a whole community. Liquids, on the other hand, are anarchic: they have a knack for destroying things. In a bathroom, for instance, it is a constant battle to keep water from seeping into cracks and pooling under the floor, where it gets up to no good, rotting and undermining the wooden joists; on a smooth tile floor, water is the perfect slip hazard, causing an enormous number of injuries; and when it gathers in the corners of the bathroom, it can harbor black slimy fungus and bacteria, which threaten to infiltrate our bodies and make us sick. And yet, despite all this treachery, we love the stuff; we love bathing in water, and showering in it, drenching the whole body. And what bathroom is complete without a cornucopia of bottled liquid soaps, shampoos, and conditioners, jars of cream, and tubes of toothpaste? We delight in these miraculous liquids and yet we worry about them too: Are they bad for us? Do they cause cancer? Do they ruin the environment? With liquids, delight and suspicion go hand in hand. They are duplicitous by nature, neither a gas nor a solid but something in between, something inscrutable and mysterious.”"
111,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83179136-catherine-puma,4,"I was delighted when I saw Miodownik was coming out with another book. Having enjoyed his ""Stuff Matters"", I acquired ""Liquid Rules"" and was not disappointed. Framed by the narrative device of observing liquids around him while flying from Britain to California, Miodownik describes oceans, glaciers, clouds, wine, saliva, droplets in the pressurized cabin, tea, coffee, blood... to name a few. I learned so much! As a result, I found myself not just noticing all the liquids I encounter in my life, but also contemplating what properties they have in relation to one another. This included pondering the process of converting my bar of solid soap into a liquid substance by interacting it with water, another liquid. Miodownik's section on hand soap vs. liquid soap (and his preference for the former) was thus especially interesting. My only quibble with this work was its lack of acknowledging its own limitations. The subtitle implies that ""dangerous"" liquids would also be discussed, but--with the exception of mercury--the diversity of naturally occurring toxins and poisons are not mentioned. Of course it is unrealistic to expect such a short work to touch upon everything, but I wish there was more of a ""there's so much more to learn and discuss"" preface and/or conclusion. That being said, this was extremely eye opening, as ""Stuff Matters"" was, and I will be recommending it to many. This is a great way to inspire a natural curiosity for the natural observation of fluid dynamics. I can even see myself re-reading it again! "
112,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/964960-george,4,"As with his earlier Stuff Matters: Exploring the Marvelous Materials That Shape Our Man-Made World, Miodownik selects a convenient frame in which to hang his description of various types of liquids and the ways in which they affect our lives. In this case, it's a transatlantic flight from London to San Francisco, giving him the opportunity to reflect on, among other things, the hot beverages served by the flight attendants, refrigeration systems, the glue that holds the plane's wings to the fuselage, and of course the large body of water over which he flies. Like most popular books about science, there are parts that are going to be overly simplistic for experts, or even knowledgeable non-experts, but Miodownik is among the group of writers who, I think, manages to strike the right balance. The framework is contrived, yes, but it has also helped me to retain a fair amount of what was discussed, and I found myself thinking about it on my own flight to California (especially the part about the glue...). My only real criticism is that his observations of his seatmate, Susan, while in the name of setting us up for a reveal later on, came off as a bit creepy at times. "
113,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/190448-karen,4,"If you're into science, this book is a gem.It's written by a material scientist and the story is told on a flight from London to San Francisco, ostensibly focusing on all the liquids on board but it's really just a premise to tell the stories he wants to tell. The fact that he was on board a flight was cute but seemed contrived a bit at parts. But I didn't really care because the science and stories were super interesting to me. This book has 12 chapters, each chapter focusing on a different substance like glue, ink, etc. I loved the bits about how candles work and how the wick pulls water up against the force of gravity. I learned about how the World Trade Centers buckled due to the strength of the steel decreasing under such high heat and then putting pressure on the lower floors, etc. And how flavor is a multi-sensory experience (and how we assume and 'can taste' flavors related to the color.) I also loved reading how icarus story wouldn't be possible because it gets colder when you fly higher :) I loved learning about ballpoint pens and how they work (and how amazing they are!!) and about tar and all the interesting new innovations they are making to help the roads last longer.There is just so much fascinating science in this book. Highly enjoyable. thanks to netgalley for an advanced copy in exchange for an honest review."
114,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7273557-gary,3," Mark Miodownik book Liquid Rules takes the reader on a transatlantic flight from London to San Francisco. His profession is in materials. The security line examining for liquids and then the pre-flight safety lecture triggers in him what liquids are we talking about? For one, the jet you are flying in is really a bomb, full of kerosene. After getting you all panicked about ever flying again, there is talk of alcohol, tea, coffee, soaps, ketchup, and many other items. His explanations are very readable and when he traces inventions, it makes the subject matter come alive.The book is told in sections, divided by the type of liquids he encounters along the way. He leads an interesting discussion about why the liquids are different and how various liquids you would not associate are similar. I found that after about the fifth chapter of this, I was getting a bit overwhelmed with the detail of explanation-I usually find details like he presents as interesting. So I am not sure why this bugs me. I would chalk it up to the reader more than the writer.I would recommend this book. But if you do read the book, try taking the book in smaller chunks rather than as a book to read straight through.For more of my thoughts, please see my book blog."
115,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"Mark Miodownik explores the mundanely marvelous liquids that make up our lives in the framework of a transatlantic flight from London to San Francisco with Liquid Rules. Liquid Rules explores the different aspects of liquids as they relate to making our lives easier. Take Kerosene as an example. Kerosene was first discovered back in 900 CE or around that century by an Arabic Alchemist and Scholar. The only problem was that Olive Oil was preferred for lamps since the government could tax it.Miodownik goes over a great many subjects and ideas. He writes about distillation, flashpoints, chemical structures, and so much more. The book reminds me a bit of Gravity’s Rainbow with all of the different information that the author stuffs into the pages, but this book is far more accessible.There are a lot of different things that Miodownik brings to your attention. Think of the humble candle as a great example. It might seem easy to understand, but there is a lot of physics going on to make sure that a candle works properly. Another thing to think about is as simple as a ballpoint pen. Even the ink had to be engineered for the proper viscosity and binding properties.I will probably search for Miodownik’s other books like Stuff Matters, assuming I haven’t read them already. "
116,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102314750-sam,0,"Liquid Rules is a book that examines in the depth the relationships between various liquids and how they affect our world. Traveling between London, San Francisco, and on the plane ride between, Mark Miodownik teaches us the surprising truth of how reliant we are as a people on liquids. While diving into the mechanical sciences of things, often discussing liquids in regards to thermal properties, the 2nd law of thermodynamics, and quantum relationships, he doesn't become completely absorbed in this writing remembering to include more colloquial evaluations. These reviews, often revolve around a specific liquids contribution to society, the history of how it was created (or found, and how it may be revolutionized in the future, and provides a sense balance and completion to his writing. Unlike many scientists who often thrive and exploit the mysticism (or more correctly lack of education) around their work to make themselves more interesting Mark Miodownik takes pride in his humanity, often talking about how his work around liquids stems from the want to learn. Overall, Liquid Rules is a unique book, that relays with humor and wit how the science, history, and properties of many liquids bear a pivotal role in the development of our modern industrialized society."
117,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40472466-dan,5,"Once again, after Stuff Matters, Mark Miodownik brings about the joy of acknowledging the material matters around us. It is an excellent book if you want to follow the meandering thoughts of the author.""Liquids have a duality: they are neither a gas nor a solid, but something in between. They are exciting and powerful, on the one hand, while anarchic and slightly terrifying on the other. That is their nature.""The liquid is a core part of what makes us living beings, how we interact with the world. Earth's molten-metal liquid core creates a magnetic field that protects water from being dried up due to the solar wind. We wouldn't have a vast amount of water in the sea without the core.Our energy source is often in a liquid form, e.g., whale oil, gasoline, kerosene, diesel. Some explosives are in liquid form like nitroglycerin, which is the reason why a certain amount of liquid is not allowed to carry on planes.Of course, we drink water, alcohol (ethanol, not methanol), wine, coffee, and tea. Our body is also mostly liquid. Our saliva helps us digest, kills pain, and protects us from bacterias (and bad breath). We cry and drop tears. We put on perfumes (methanol). We clean using soap.We watch (LCD: liquid crystal displays).Look up and see clouds? They are liquid too.The author tells these stories while he takes a flight to his conference. His perspectives are refreshing especially since flying is one of the worst experiences that I have to endure. It is cramped. There is an invisible tension over the armrest. The middle seat gets the two, does anyone disagree? The air is too dry. Food is usually horrible if served. A trip to the bathroom is bothersome. Now I know what to do. Order coffee instead of tea. Sleep without drooling. Watch movies which I would enjoy more. Last but not least, appreciate liquids!"
118,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48901937-kyle-dinges,4,"Liquid Rules by Mark Miodownik is a book that looks at some of the most important liquids that society depends on and gives a bit of a brief background on their chemical makeup and how they were created or discovered. It is easily accessible, which is something I usually look for in non-fiction about science. Like his first book, Stuff Matters, Miodownik has a knack for writing about complex scientific ideas in a way that are easy for the lay person to understand. He sprinkles in plenty of humor to keep things lively and never drones on for too long about one subject. The idea to use an airplane ride to introduce each liquid, and demonstrate their abundance in life, was a good way to present each liquid in a logical order and talk about real life applications. All of this just serves to make the book more entertaining and interesting. There's a delicate balance to making a book like this informative and entertaining, and Miodownik does a good job in that regard.Someone looking for a more expansive an in depth text might be a bit let down, but for someone just looking for an entertaining ""pop-science"" read, I think this book more than fits the bill."
119,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12527649-kristin,4,"Generally speaking, this was a good overview of various properties of liquids, how we interact with them, and how they affect us. It took an extremely broad area of knowledge and made it understandable (and enjoyable!) for the semi-layperson. I especially enjoyed the chapter on saliva (weird, I know, but it was of professional interest haha). I also enjoyed the chapter on tea, coffee, and other beverages. The reason I knocked a star off of my review is because the author often says “double blind studies have shown...” or “studies have shown...” but does not cite these studies or sources. There is a “further reading” section at the end of the book, but none of the resources are linked to the specific claims presented in the main body. I know this is supposed to be a general overview, but if sources are claimed, they should be cited. This normally wouldn’t bug me so much, but I would actually like to read some of those studies.... (including the one mentioned in the cooling chapter, where the author talks about perfluorocarbons as a substitute for blood and the subsequent clinical trials). IT’S BREATHABLE LIQUID. Doesn’t that sound like some worthwhile further reading?"

132,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,4,"I'd really enjoyed Miodownik's Stuff Matters, on the science of different solid materials like glass, metal, concrete and graphite, and was excited that he had a book on liquids. Whereas Stuff Matters covered the materials that Miodownik presumably found the most fascinating and significant in terms of daily life, the conceit for Liquid is the different kinds of liquids Miodownik encounters on a flight - oils, alcohol, water, glue, liquid crystals, saliva, tea and coffee, soap, refrigerants, ink, clouds, magma and tar (the latter two signifying the end of his journey when the plane lands). In Liquid, Miodownik weaves a fascinating narrative that draws from chemistry, physics, science history, earth science, to name a few. It's full of fascinating nuggets. Like why it is dangerous to consume home brews or alcohol-based liquids for a cheap high because the methanol in them hasn't been removed; methanol is metabolised into formic acid and formaldehyde in the body, where the formic acid attacks your nerve cells, especially the optic nerve, leaving you blind (hence the expression 'blind drunk'). Like how it is rubber that gives Post-It Notes their stickiness; the notes have an adhesive layer of rubber on them where the microscopic spheres of rubber bond tightly to the note but create only a small adhesive force when pressed onto a surface. Or that sticky tape has three layers, a bottom layer of adhesive, a middle layer of cellophane for strength and transparency and a top layer of non-stick material like Teflon. And the fascinating universe of two-part adhesives. Or how he unpacks the complexities involved in brewing the perfect cup of tea, as it involves striking the right balance of temperature (too low and the flavour molecules in the tea won't dissolve; too high and many of the tannins and polyphenols that give a bitter taste and astringency will also dissolve), timing (to ensure the perfect balance of the different kinds of volatiles), compared to the (relative) ease of making a decent cup of coffee.And the marvels of how soap works - that when you mix fat with an alkali (like ash water), the alkali transforms the fat molecules into hybrid molecules with a charged head that dissolves in water and a carbon tail that dissolves in fats. The carbon tails of hybrid soap molecules embed themselves in fat blobs, creating a charged surface with their heads that can dissolve in water. Thus allowing the fat blob to be washed away. [Fascinating factoids: Egg is the surfactant in mayonnaise, allowing the oil and water in mayo to bind. It's like soap in that respect and you can use egg yolk to clean your hair. P&G invented Ivory Soap and part of its marketing strategy was to sponsor serial dramas targeting housewives at home during the day. Hence the name 'soap opera'.]Like Stuff Matters, Liquid is very accessibly written, even for the science phobe. But unlike Stuff Matters, the conceit of Liquid - to wrap the material science within the larger narrative arc of Miodownik's flight, and his interactions with his fellow passenger, Susan - is distracting. Miodownik's attempts at humour - the disgust he evokes when he falls asleep and drools on Susan, when he sneezes on another passenger, when he obsesses about why the inflight safety video remains silent on the largest hazard of all, the fact that they will be in the air with thousands of gallons of combustible fuel - are pedestrian and awkward. For Stuff Matters, I'd felt that the sections where Miodownik tried to jazz things up a bit, to perhaps take a more creative treatment of the topic fell flat. Like when he discussed porcelain in the context of his parents' wedding tea set. The main thing here is really the fascinating science of liquids but Miodownik sometimes seems to forget this. Still, this is a fairly minor complaint in what is overall, a fun and fascinating read. "
133,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66635467-keen,4,"“Liquids have a duality: they are neither a gas nor solid, but something in-between. They are exciting and powerful, on the one hand, while being anarchic and slightly terrifying on the other.” Travelling on a trans-Atlantic flight from London to San Francisco, Miodownik uses a number of observations and thoughts as creative jumping off points to get into some whimsical and fascinating territory throughout the journey.This is a largely, but not always accessible investigation of sorts into some of the many liquids that most of us will encounter in our daily lives. A quirky odyssey loaded with lots of colourful facts and trivia to pull out down the pub or indeed any social occasion. I had no idea that the de Havilland Mosquito bomber used during WWII was made of plywood, which made it the fastest aircraft in the sky or that we use around 16 billion litres of oil every day throughout the world.Apparently there is 150’000 litres of kerosene stored in a jumbo jet (50’000 in the fuel tank below your feet and another 50’000 stored in each wing). And yet you could throw a lit match at it and it wouldn’t ignite. But mix it with the right amount of oxygen and it suddenly becomes an oil ten times as powerful as nitroglycerine.He talks about the crucial difference between ethanol and methanol, pure methanol can cause permanent blindness. Your body metabolises it into formic acid and formaldehyde. Formic acid attacks nerve cells, especially the optic nerve, hence the saying ‘blind drunk’. It also goes after your liver and kidneys and can cause permanent damage. Three glasses of it will kill you.Miodownik explains why drinking wine is a multi-sensory experience, and how more often than not many people enjoy paying for the brand more than the experience, “Some people love having the most expensive cars, they get real enjoyment out of what that says about them as a person. It’s the same with wines. But this doesn’t mean that these are better wines or better cars, or even that the owners are more sophisticated people.” He cites the experiments that managed to fool so called ‘wine experts’ that convinced them that they were drinking white wine, but thanks to a flavourless red dye they got suckered into describing it in detail as a red wine.He also covers many more interesting topics from 3-D printing, the humble yet fascinating biro pen and even the wonderful properties of tar and asphalt, he talks of the pitch drop experiment set up in 1927 by Prof Thomas Parnell at the University of Queensland, the first drop fell in 1938, the second in 1947, the third in 1954 and the ninth and most recent drop fell in 2014.One of the minor pitfalls in this book is that occasionally some of the topics get a little tedious and there are too many complex and bewildering diagrams of molecular structures for my taste, but that is sure to appeal to science and chemistry buffs alike, but you don’t have to study or understand them to enjoy the book.This reminded me of Paul Vanhoenacker’s “Skyfaring” (the book is mentioned in the further reading section). This book relies on a format used repeatedly by the likes of Gavin Francis, Alain de Botton and many others, which takes everyday subjects, and makes them relatively accessible, whilst allowing us to view seemingly mundane objects with a renewed sense of wonder. It’s a style that peppers the book with helpful and occasionally light-hearted images and the books are never too long. It’s a format that I happen to enjoy and it’s clearly a popular one too."
134,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20280886-sarah-smith,3,"More often than I care to admit my wee brain gets a bit overwhelmed and when this happens I tend to look for things that are objective as opposed to subjective. And it sort of gives me a break. Today’s break came in the form of a popular science book (Side note, I LOVE books classed as popular science) called Liquids by Mark Miodownik. Oddly enough it is a book about Liquids, from tea to superliquid Helium, kerosene and ink, the sea to lava. A whole plethora of them each with their own weird, dangerous and fascinating properties. And were it has the potential to be an excellent book it falls a little short. The major issue I had is how Miodownik frames the narrative. He is on a flight from London to San Francisco and he introduces the different liquids in an increasingly strained and conceited way related to this flight. This quickly starts to grate, the tone of these bits is sort of akin to an over enthusiastic kids TV presenter who has forgotten they are on Newsnight and are talking to Kirsty Wark as opposed to a group of pubescent children. But although I’ve started with the bad, it almost redeems itself as there is much to interest. I was born in 1986 and all I remember from primary school (we shall not read in to why I remember so little) concerns the Gulf War, an oil spill, and the ozone layer having a massive whole in it. And it was only in reading this I realised why in primary school we where told all about the whole in the ozone, as it was around this time the world realised the damage CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons) had done to the ozone, CFCs where used in refrigerators as a coolant, as they were seemingly harmless and inert, and then everyone realised this was not the case. It was actually the same fella responsible for this that said lead in petrol was safe too, so he’s not so much the greatest really. Apart from learning about coolants used in refrigerators, you also get to learn about so many things you would never stop to consider. How the ink in biros work, can you tell the difference between red and white wine if you cant see them (I to be fair would struggle to distinguish either from vinegar), why Eastenders is a soap, how ships float, and planes fly, that roads to a certain extent are self healing on account of the viscosity of tar(tar is actually a liquid, just a million times as viscous as peanut butter) man made clouds (Russia uses them every May to make sure May Day celebrations are rain free, the little rascals) also just you know clouds in general. It’s almost a history of the world told via the scientific progress concerning liquids that are often vital to our existence without us really ever thinking too much about them. Despite all of this I was left feeling a little short changed. It is possible I expect too much, I’ve been spoiled by books such as those written by Simon Singh (Fermats last theorem, Big Bang) or Sam Kean’s The Disappearing Spoon which have a more consistent tone, and I found to captivate me more, but just because these are better doesn’t make Liquids bad, just not as good as I had hoped. Mostly it suffers from how he introduces the liquids in each instance, and I know I’ve written about how it is interesting but like an under seasoned soup there wasn’t quite enough of the interesting. It felt a little padded in parts and too much time was spent on irrelevant personal anecdotes. Sadly not nearly as good as it could have been."
135,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4137725-phoebe,5,"Right now I'm experiencing that 4pm listlessness. It's either coffee or nap. Resistance is futile. No one is productive at 4pm. So here I am, writing about a book about liquids instead of...never you mind.Liquid Rules: The Delightful and Dangerous Substances That Flowed Through Our Lives (2020) is Mark Miodownik's follow-up to Stuff Matters: The Strange Stories of the Marvellous Materials that Shape Our Man-made World (2014), which won the 2014 Royal Society Winton Prize for Science books and the 2015 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Communication Award. I didn’t know either awards existed but they seem relevant and most likely well-deserved because it is so, so easy to commend the quality of his writing.I wouldn’t say Liquid Rules bears epistemological significance. But you don’t read a book about liquids because you think there’s some quintessential knowledge you’re missing. You read it because you passed year 12 chemistry and now you can have that moment of vainglory realising you didn’t memorise chemical compounds and equations for nothing because you actually understand what an actual scientist gasp is saying. HA. Just kidding. I liked the title and thought it sounded unusual and entertaining. More importantly, I knew it wasn’t gonna be emotionally taxing. The kind of tension I’ve been experiencing has been unreal and I can’t explain why I’m so tense. I blame it on animal crossing which is meant to be a relaxing game but my perfectionism is ruining it for me. (Why can’t I place THIS bush next to THIS rock?!) In any case, I need something breezy but not fluffy.What makes Liquid Rules entertaining is how casual Miodownik sounds. The entire book is structured around Miodownik’s flight to San Francisco where he is to attend a scientific conference. As he is going through customs and security, he muses on what makes peanut butter a liquid and not a solid according to airline regulations. As the plane is taking off, he considers the discovery of kerosene in the premodern era and the incredible fact that no one knew its awesome power. Then mid-flight, he provides an endless stream of anecdotes about the terrifying power of storm clouds (when the plane experiences turbulence), why he prefers soap bars over liquid soap (when he goes to the bathroom), why we find snot disgusting (when curry dribbles down his chin), why the invention of biro was a complex problem with a surprisingly simple solution (when he signs the arrival card), and finally, the future when we can store man-made data like digital photographs inside droplets of liquid (as he arrives at the scientific conference). It feels like you’re flying and you’re listening in to all the amusing did-you-knows as the person next to you chatters on about the marvellous things we’re seeing. All in all, it’s like being offered a gaze into a secret network of things, where whaling in the nineteenth century is somehow related to the rise of the soap industry which is also related to the creation of soap opera during morning hours. The connective ‘thingness’ of life is suddenly made apparent and it is a wondrous sight. The world is a connected place. It’s connected by the seeping, oozing, dripping and molten liquids that flow in and out of us, around us, beneath us, and above us. Humans are 60% water and our planet is 70% water. We are living in an aqueous state on an aqueous planet, so it’s almost self-deceiving to think the world around us is solid and concrete when our body is formed in amniotic fluids and ends with being decomposed into minerals, water and gas. And isn’t it just the strangest thing to think one day, instead of relying on computers that speak in 0s and 1s, we will have biochemical computation that takes place on a molecular level? Yep. Mind blown. "
136,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109535466-mike-parkes,4,"Entertaining but scattered book describing the chemistry and applications of assorted liquids. I think this goes by different names in North America and Europe – the version I have is just titled “Liquid”. Lots of interesting details, and Miodownik is an entertaining and informative writer. However, the choice of liquids and their properties is random, with the organizing principle of the book being liquids one comes across on a flight (or is otherwise impacted by, e.g. clouds). The connecting interludes between chapters become annoying quite early on in the book (e.g. a trip to the lavatory provides the opportunity to discuss soaps and cleaning products). By the end, you’re left with a pastiche of chapters on different topics, some enlightening, some less so, but not a good grasp on liquids as a whole. A strong introductory chapter on the properties of liquids would really have helped. Not quite as good as Miodownik’s “Stuff Matters” which was similar in format but dealt with common solid materials (primarily structural).A few chapters I enjoyed in “Liquid” were:•	How the volatility and flash point of hydrocarbon liquids such as kerosene (jet fuel) and oils affected their use in lighting and energy products (ch 1)•	Glues, liquids that change to solids and form permanent bonds (ch 4). •	Refrigeration and air conditioning, from liquids that boil near room temperature, enabling them to transfer a large amount of heat through phase changes (ch 9).•	Pen inks, and the engineering and chemistry of designing a pen with ink that will flow on the page and turn into a solid without making a mess (ch 10).Other chapters deal with the intoxicating properties of alcohols (ch 2), the properties of the ocean (ch 3), liquid crystal displays (ch 5), bodily fluids (ch 6), the chemistry of tea and coffee (ch 7), soaps and detergents (ch 8), clouds (ch 11), the slow flow of ice and rocks on the earrh’s surface (ch 12), and sustainable materials such as self-healing asphalt (ch 13)."
137,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90301926-kaj,2,"You might think that “Liquid Rules” is about the science of liquids. Don’t be fooled. It’s actually one long kinda cringy story about Mark Miodownik’s flying experience, with some chemistry asides.I loved Miodownik’s previous book, “Stuff Matters,” where he explains how the big properties of everyday materials come from their chemical structure. Why are alloys sometimes stronger than the metals they’re made from? What does it mean to be conductive? Miodownik keeps his explanations simple and mechanistic, aided by small hand-drawn doodles. Unlike many other pop sci books, “Stuff Matters” never falls into the trap of focusing too much on what is important to know, rather than what’s interesting and informative. The info:tainment ratio is good- accessible enough for high school level students while still interesting for scientists. Sure, he sprinkles in some occasionally boring personal anecdotes, but every materials chem book would benefit from a few breathers.“Liquid Rules” doubles down on the bad parts of “Stuff Matters” while forgetting what made it great. Each chapter focuses on a different liquid. A major part of the book is trying to relate each liquid to something that happens on a single trans-Atlantic flight. This plot device seems to be an attempt to make the liquid chemistry seem useful by relating it to real-world phenomena, but the cumulative effect is the opposite. Too much time spent on why these chemicals are important, and not enough on why they’re interesting, mixed with long personal anecdotes and scientist biographies that are neither important nor interesting. For a book about fluids, “Liquid Rules” is just a little bit too dry."
138,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4261166-marshall,5,"I love the way Mark Miodownik writes. He addresses subjects that are seemingly boring (if you say it out loud like when I told my girlfriend I was reading about glue, and tape, and tvs) and opens up the mystery entirely, sparking a fascinating world of chemical wonder. His rhetoric and storytelling can deliver the scientific details in an easily digestible manner without using any scientific tools such as graphs, charts, and data sheets, only rudimentary drawings (which helped a whole lot and were very welcome enterprises). I was tremendously inspired by this book and every single chapter tapped into a childlike awe of the materials of the world around me. I learned and relearned many aspects of earth science and things I've only imagined. Honestly, I wish someone like a teacher or mentor would have been able to put this book in my hands when I was in early high school because I believe it may have changed the trajectory of my life. I might have sought out a career in material science. So, since that obviously didn't happen seeing how he wrote this book in the recent decade, I will be sure to pass it along to a young friend or a deer friend's young adult. In any case, this book just goes to show that there is ALWAYS something to marvel at, even if you find yourself experiencing a bit of ennui. Just walk outside and check out a flower or if you're stuck inside pick up a pen and peer a little bit closer into all that makes it possible. Absolutely LOVED both of Miodownik's books. I will be buying these two and looking forward to the next one (please write another!)!"
139,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92179113-patrick-green,4,"I typically associate scientists with tall guys in lab coats. Careful, fastidious, and, when in the lab, organized. I know this is a crude generalization, but there is certainly a nugget of truth to this statement. The scientist of this book, Mark Miodownik, should have kept this nugget of truth in mind when he was writing this book. ""Liquid Rules"" is messy and disjointed, primarily because of the framework that Miodownik uses to explain the properties and everyday uses of certain liquids. This made the reading experience for myself at times boring. I cared more for his explanations on the properties of tea, coffee, and ink for example than I did for kerosene or soap. I also did not care for his tangents. I was mostly looking for information on how certain liquids, or liquids in general, function. I did not care much to hear about his trip from England to San Francisco. It was a very plain framework. The details surrounding this framework, the scientific extrapolations on liquids, propelled my interest.I enjoyed the information on the liquids that Miodownik provided. I also relished some of the historical background of these liquids. They taught some valuable conclusions that I should make on certain liquids. For example, I can definitively say that I am a coffee drinker, not a tea drinker. And now I have scientific evidence to support my subjective opinion. Thank you, Miodownik.The last pleasant note that I found on the book was the laid back pace. I felt as though I could read it on a nice Sunday afternoon while also getting some mental exercise. Despite how messy and boring the framework was, it's a very enjoyable book to read, and I would recommend it."
140,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1109379-colette,3,"“Liquids are the alter ego of dependable solid stuff. Whereas solid materials are humanity’s faithful friend, taking on the permanent shapes of clothes, shoes, phones, cars, and indeed airports, liquids are fluid; they will take on any shape, but only while contained. When they’re not contained, they are always on the move, seeping, corroding, dripping, and escaping our control. If you put a solid material somewhere, it stays there—barring forcible removal—often doing something very useful, like holding up a building or supplying electricity for a whole community. Liquids, on the other hand, are anarchic: they have a knack for destroying things. In a bathroom, for instance, it is a constant battle to keep water from seeping into cracks and pooling under the floor, where it gets up to no good, rotting and undermining the wooden joists; on a smooth tile floor, water is the perfect slip hazard, causing an enormous number of injuries; and when it gathers in the corners of the bathroom, it can harbor black slimy fungus and bacteria, which threaten to infiltrate our bodies and make us sick. And yet, despite all this treachery, we love the stuff; we love bathing in water, and showering in it, drenching the whole body. And what bathroom is complete without a cornucopia of bottled liquid soaps, shampoos, and conditioners, jars of cream, and tubes of toothpaste? We delight in these miraculous liquids and yet we worry about them too: Are they bad for us? Do they cause cancer? Do they ruin the environment? With liquids, delight and suspicion go hand in hand. They are duplicitous by nature, neither a gas nor a solid but something in between, something inscrutable and mysterious.”"
141,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83179136-catherine-puma,4,"I was delighted when I saw Miodownik was coming out with another book. Having enjoyed his ""Stuff Matters"", I acquired ""Liquid Rules"" and was not disappointed. Framed by the narrative device of observing liquids around him while flying from Britain to California, Miodownik describes oceans, glaciers, clouds, wine, saliva, droplets in the pressurized cabin, tea, coffee, blood... to name a few. I learned so much! As a result, I found myself not just noticing all the liquids I encounter in my life, but also contemplating what properties they have in relation to one another. This included pondering the process of converting my bar of solid soap into a liquid substance by interacting it with water, another liquid. Miodownik's section on hand soap vs. liquid soap (and his preference for the former) was thus especially interesting. My only quibble with this work was its lack of acknowledging its own limitations. The subtitle implies that ""dangerous"" liquids would also be discussed, but--with the exception of mercury--the diversity of naturally occurring toxins and poisons are not mentioned. Of course it is unrealistic to expect such a short work to touch upon everything, but I wish there was more of a ""there's so much more to learn and discuss"" preface and/or conclusion. That being said, this was extremely eye opening, as ""Stuff Matters"" was, and I will be recommending it to many. This is a great way to inspire a natural curiosity for the natural observation of fluid dynamics. I can even see myself re-reading it again! "
142,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/964960-george,4,"As with his earlier Stuff Matters: Exploring the Marvelous Materials That Shape Our Man-Made World, Miodownik selects a convenient frame in which to hang his description of various types of liquids and the ways in which they affect our lives. In this case, it's a transatlantic flight from London to San Francisco, giving him the opportunity to reflect on, among other things, the hot beverages served by the flight attendants, refrigeration systems, the glue that holds the plane's wings to the fuselage, and of course the large body of water over which he flies. Like most popular books about science, there are parts that are going to be overly simplistic for experts, or even knowledgeable non-experts, but Miodownik is among the group of writers who, I think, manages to strike the right balance. The framework is contrived, yes, but it has also helped me to retain a fair amount of what was discussed, and I found myself thinking about it on my own flight to California (especially the part about the glue...). My only real criticism is that his observations of his seatmate, Susan, while in the name of setting us up for a reveal later on, came off as a bit creepy at times. "

The fact that he was on board a flight was cute but seemed contrived a bit at parts. But I didn't really care because the science and stories were super interesting to me. This book has 12 chapters, each chapter focusing on a different substance like glue, ink, etc. I loved the bits about how candles work and how the wick pulls water up against the force of gravity. I learned about how the World Trade Centers buckled due to the strength of the steel decreasing under such high heat and then putting pressure on the lower floors, etc. And how flavor is a multi-sensory experience (and how we assume and 'can taste' flavors related to the color.) I also loved reading how icarus story wouldn't be possible because it gets colder when you fly higher :) I loved learning about ballpoint pens and how they work (and how amazing they are!!) and about tar and all the interesting new innovations they are making to help the roads last longer.There is just so much fascinating science in this book.

His profession is in materials. The security line examining for liquids and then the pre-flight safety lecture triggers in him what liquids are we talking about? For one, the jet you are flying in is really a bomb, full of kerosene. After getting you all panicked about ever flying again, there is talk of alcohol, tea, coffee, soaps, ketchup, and many other items. His explanations are very readable and when he traces inventions, it makes the subject matter come alive.The book is told in sections, divided by the type of liquids he encounters along the way. He leads an interesting discussion about why the liquids are different and how various liquids you would not associate are similar. I found that after about the fifth chapter of this, I was getting a bit overwhelmed with the detail of explanation-I usually find details like he presents as interesting. So I am not sure why this bugs me. I would chalk it up to the reader more than the writer.I would recommend this book. But if you do read the book, try taking the book in smaller chunks rather than as a book to read straight through.For more of my thoughts, please see my book blog."

Liquid Rules explores the different aspects of liquids as they relate to making our lives easier. Take Kerosene as an example. Kerosene was first discovered back in 900 CE or around that century by an Arabic Alchemist and Scholar. The only problem was that Olive Oil was preferred for lamps since the government could tax it.Miodownik goes over a great many subjects and ideas. He writes about distillation, flashpoints, chemical structures, and so much more. The book reminds me a bit of Gravity’s Rainbow with all of the different information that the author stuffs into the pages, but this book is far more accessible.There are a lot of different things that Miodownik brings to your attention. Think of the humble candle as a great example. It might seem easy to understand, but there is a lot of physics going on to make sure that a candle works properly. Another thing to think about is as simple as a ballpoint pen. Even the ink had to be engineered for the proper viscosity and binding properties.I will probably search for Miodownik’s other books like Stuff Matters, assuming I haven’t read them already. "

Traveling between London, San Francisco, and on the plane ride between, Mark Miodownik teaches us the surprising truth of how reliant we are as a people on liquids. While diving into the mechanical sciences of things, often discussing liquids in regards to thermal properties, the 2nd law of thermodynamics, and quantum relationships, he doesn't become completely absorbed in this writing remembering to include more colloquial evaluations. These reviews, often revolve around a specific liquids contribution to society, the history of how it was created (or found, and how it may be revolutionized in the future, and provides a sense balance and completion to his writing. Unlike many scientists who often thrive and exploit the mysticism (or more correctly lack of education) around their work to make themselves more interesting Mark Miodownik takes pride in his humanity, often talking about how his work around liquids stems from the want to learn. Overall, Liquid Rules is a unique book, that relays with humor and wit how the science, history, and properties of many liquids bear a pivotal role in the development of our modern industrialized society."
147,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40472466-dan,5,"Once again, after Stuff Matters, Mark Miodownik brings about the joy of acknowledging the material matters around us. It is an excellent book if you want to follow the meandering thoughts of the author.""Liquids have a duality: they are neither a gas nor a solid, but something in between. They are exciting and powerful, on the one hand, while anarchic and slightly terrifying on the other. That is their nature.""The liquid is a core part of what makes us living beings, how we interact with the world. Earth's molten-metal liquid core creates a magnetic field that protects water from being dried up due to the solar wind. We wouldn't have a vast amount of water in the sea without the core.Our energy source is often in a liquid form, e.g., whale oil, gasoline, kerosene, diesel. Some explosives are in liquid form like nitroglycerin, which is the reason why a certain amount of liquid is not allowed to carry on planes.Of course, we drink water, alcohol (ethanol, not methanol), wine, coffee, and tea. Our body is also mostly liquid. Our saliva helps us digest, kills pain, and protects us from bacterias (and bad breath). We cry and drop tears. We put on perfumes (methanol). We clean using soap.We watch (LCD: liquid crystal displays).Look up and see clouds? They are liquid too.The author tells these stories while he takes a flight to his conference. His perspectives are refreshing especially since flying is one of the worst experiences that I have to endure. It is cramped. There is an invisible tension over the armrest. The middle seat gets the two, does anyone disagree? The air is too dry. Food is usually horrible if served. A trip to the bathroom is bothersome. Now I know what to do. Order coffee instead of tea. Sleep without drooling. Watch movies which I would enjoy more. Last but not least, appreciate liquids!"
148,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48901937-kyle-dinges,4,"Liquid Rules by Mark Miodownik is a book that looks at some of the most important liquids that society depends on and gives a bit of a brief background on their chemical makeup and how they were created or discovered. It is easily accessible, which is something I usually look for in non-fiction about science. Like his first book, Stuff Matters, Miodownik has a knack for writing about complex scientific ideas in a way that are easy for the lay person to understand. He sprinkles in plenty of humor to keep things lively and never drones on for too long about one subject. The idea to use an airplane ride to introduce each liquid, and demonstrate their abundance in life, was a good way to present each liquid in a logical order and talk about real life applications. All of this just serves to make the book more entertaining and interesting. There's a delicate balance to making a book like this informative and entertaining, and Miodownik does a good job in that regard.Someone looking for a more expansive an in depth text might be a bit let down, but for someone just looking for an entertaining ""pop-science"" read, I think this book more than fits the bill."
149,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12527649-kristin,4,"Generally speaking, this was a good overview of various properties of liquids, how we interact with them, and how they affect us. It took an extremely broad area of knowledge and made it understandable (and enjoyable!) for the semi-layperson. I especially enjoyed the chapter on saliva (weird, I know, but it was of professional interest haha). I also enjoyed the chapter on tea, coffee, and other beverages. The reason I knocked a star off of my review is because the author often says “double blind studies have shown...” or “studies have shown...” but does not cite these studies or sources. There is a “further reading” section at the end of the book, but none of the resources are linked to the specific claims presented in the main body. I know this is supposed to be a general overview, but if sources are claimed, they should be cited. This normally wouldn’t bug me so much, but I would actually like to read some of those studies.... (including the one mentioned in the cooling chapter, where the author talks about perfluorocarbons as a substitute for blood and the subsequent clinical trials). IT’S BREATHABLE LIQUID. Doesn’t that sound like some worthwhile further reading?"

162,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,4,"I'd really enjoyed Miodownik's Stuff Matters, on the science of different solid materials like glass, metal, concrete and graphite, and was excited that he had a book on liquids. Whereas Stuff Matters covered the materials that Miodownik presumably found the most fascinating and significant in terms of daily life, the conceit for Liquid is the different kinds of liquids Miodownik encounters on a flight - oils, alcohol, water, glue, liquid crystals, saliva, tea and coffee, soap, refrigerants, ink, clouds, magma and tar (the latter two signifying the end of his journey when the plane lands). In Liquid, Miodownik weaves a fascinating narrative that draws from chemistry, physics, science history, earth science, to name a few. It's full of fascinating nuggets. Like why it is dangerous to consume home brews or alcohol-based liquids for a cheap high because the methanol in them hasn't been removed; methanol is metabolised into formic acid and formaldehyde in the body, where the formic acid attacks your nerve cells, especially the optic nerve, leaving you blind (hence the expression 'blind drunk'). Like how it is rubber that gives Post-It Notes their stickiness; the notes have an adhesive layer of rubber on them where the microscopic spheres of rubber bond tightly to the note but create only a small adhesive force when pressed onto a surface. Or that sticky tape has three layers, a bottom layer of adhesive, a middle layer of cellophane for strength and transparency and a top layer of non-stick material like Teflon. And the fascinating universe of two-part adhesives. Or how he unpacks the complexities involved in brewing the perfect cup of tea, as it involves striking the right balance of temperature (too low and the flavour molecules in the tea won't dissolve; too high and many of the tannins and polyphenols that give a bitter taste and astringency will also dissolve), timing (to ensure the perfect balance of the different kinds of volatiles), compared to the (relative) ease of making a decent cup of coffee.And the marvels of how soap works - that when you mix fat with an alkali (like ash water), the alkali transforms the fat molecules into hybrid molecules with a charged head that dissolves in water and a carbon tail that dissolves in fats. The carbon tails of hybrid soap molecules embed themselves in fat blobs, creating a charged surface with their heads that can dissolve in water. Thus allowing the fat blob to be washed away. [Fascinating factoids: Egg is the surfactant in mayonnaise, allowing the oil and water in mayo to bind. It's like soap in that respect and you can use egg yolk to clean your hair. P&G invented Ivory Soap and part of its marketing strategy was to sponsor serial dramas targeting housewives at home during the day. Hence the name 'soap opera'.]Like Stuff Matters, Liquid is very accessibly written, even for the science phobe. But unlike Stuff Matters, the conceit of Liquid - to wrap the material science within the larger narrative arc of Miodownik's flight, and his interactions with his fellow passenger, Susan - is distracting. Miodownik's attempts at humour - the disgust he evokes when he falls asleep and drools on Susan, when he sneezes on another passenger, when he obsesses about why the inflight safety video remains silent on the largest hazard of all, the fact that they will be in the air with thousands of gallons of combustible fuel - are pedestrian and awkward. For Stuff Matters, I'd felt that the sections where Miodownik tried to jazz things up a bit, to perhaps take a more creative treatment of the topic fell flat. Like when he discussed porcelain in the context of his parents' wedding tea set. The main thing here is really the fascinating science of liquids but Miodownik sometimes seems to forget this. Still, this is a fairly minor complaint in what is overall, a fun and fascinating read. "
163,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66635467-keen,4,"“Liquids have a duality: they are neither a gas nor solid, but something in-between. They are exciting and powerful, on the one hand, while being anarchic and slightly terrifying on the other.” Travelling on a trans-Atlantic flight from London to San Francisco, Miodownik uses a number of observations and thoughts as creative jumping off points to get into some whimsical and fascinating territory throughout the journey.This is a largely, but not always accessible investigation of sorts into some of the many liquids that most of us will encounter in our daily lives. A quirky odyssey loaded with lots of colourful facts and trivia to pull out down the pub or indeed any social occasion. I had no idea that the de Havilland Mosquito bomber used during WWII was made of plywood, which made it the fastest aircraft in the sky or that we use around 16 billion litres of oil every day throughout the world.Apparently there is 150’000 litres of kerosene stored in a jumbo jet (50’000 in the fuel tank below your feet and another 50’000 stored in each wing). And yet you could throw a lit match at it and it wouldn’t ignite. But mix it with the right amount of oxygen and it suddenly becomes an oil ten times as powerful as nitroglycerine.He talks about the crucial difference between ethanol and methanol, pure methanol can cause permanent blindness. Your body metabolises it into formic acid and formaldehyde. Formic acid attacks nerve cells, especially the optic nerve, hence the saying ‘blind drunk’. It also goes after your liver and kidneys and can cause permanent damage. Three glasses of it will kill you.Miodownik explains why drinking wine is a multi-sensory experience, and how more often than not many people enjoy paying for the brand more than the experience, “Some people love having the most expensive cars, they get real enjoyment out of what that says about them as a person. It’s the same with wines. But this doesn’t mean that these are better wines or better cars, or even that the owners are more sophisticated people.” He cites the experiments that managed to fool so called ‘wine experts’ that convinced them that they were drinking white wine, but thanks to a flavourless red dye they got suckered into describing it in detail as a red wine.He also covers many more interesting topics from 3-D printing, the humble yet fascinating biro pen and even the wonderful properties of tar and asphalt, he talks of the pitch drop experiment set up in 1927 by Prof Thomas Parnell at the University of Queensland, the first drop fell in 1938, the second in 1947, the third in 1954 and the ninth and most recent drop fell in 2014.One of the minor pitfalls in this book is that occasionally some of the topics get a little tedious and there are too many complex and bewildering diagrams of molecular structures for my taste, but that is sure to appeal to science and chemistry buffs alike, but you don’t have to study or understand them to enjoy the book.This reminded me of Paul Vanhoenacker’s “Skyfaring” (the book is mentioned in the further reading section). This book relies on a format used repeatedly by the likes of Gavin Francis, Alain de Botton and many others, which takes everyday subjects, and makes them relatively accessible, whilst allowing us to view seemingly mundane objects with a renewed sense of wonder. It’s a style that peppers the book with helpful and occasionally light-hearted images and the books are never too long. It’s a format that I happen to enjoy and it’s clearly a popular one too."
164,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20280886-sarah-smith,3,"More often than I care to admit my wee brain gets a bit overwhelmed and when this happens I tend to look for things that are objective as opposed to subjective. And it sort of gives me a break. Today’s break came in the form of a popular science book (Side note, I LOVE books classed as popular science) called Liquids by Mark Miodownik. Oddly enough it is a book about Liquids, from tea to superliquid Helium, kerosene and ink, the sea to lava. A whole plethora of them each with their own weird, dangerous and fascinating properties. And were it has the potential to be an excellent book it falls a little short. The major issue I had is how Miodownik frames the narrative. He is on a flight from London to San Francisco and he introduces the different liquids in an increasingly strained and conceited way related to this flight. This quickly starts to grate, the tone of these bits is sort of akin to an over enthusiastic kids TV presenter who has forgotten they are on Newsnight and are talking to Kirsty Wark as opposed to a group of pubescent children. But although I’ve started with the bad, it almost redeems itself as there is much to interest. I was born in 1986 and all I remember from primary school (we shall not read in to why I remember so little) concerns the Gulf War, an oil spill, and the ozone layer having a massive whole in it. And it was only in reading this I realised why in primary school we where told all about the whole in the ozone, as it was around this time the world realised the damage CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons) had done to the ozone, CFCs where used in refrigerators as a coolant, as they were seemingly harmless and inert, and then everyone realised this was not the case. It was actually the same fella responsible for this that said lead in petrol was safe too, so he’s not so much the greatest really. Apart from learning about coolants used in refrigerators, you also get to learn about so many things you would never stop to consider. How the ink in biros work, can you tell the difference between red and white wine if you cant see them (I to be fair would struggle to distinguish either from vinegar), why Eastenders is a soap, how ships float, and planes fly, that roads to a certain extent are self healing on account of the viscosity of tar(tar is actually a liquid, just a million times as viscous as peanut butter) man made clouds (Russia uses them every May to make sure May Day celebrations are rain free, the little rascals) also just you know clouds in general. It’s almost a history of the world told via the scientific progress concerning liquids that are often vital to our existence without us really ever thinking too much about them. Despite all of this I was left feeling a little short changed. It is possible I expect too much, I’ve been spoiled by books such as those written by Simon Singh (Fermats last theorem, Big Bang) or Sam Kean’s The Disappearing Spoon which have a more consistent tone, and I found to captivate me more, but just because these are better doesn’t make Liquids bad, just not as good as I had hoped. Mostly it suffers from how he introduces the liquids in each instance, and I know I’ve written about how it is interesting but like an under seasoned soup there wasn’t quite enough of the interesting. It felt a little padded in parts and too much time was spent on irrelevant personal anecdotes. Sadly not nearly as good as it could have been."
165,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4137725-phoebe,5,"Right now I'm experiencing that 4pm listlessness. It's either coffee or nap. Resistance is futile. No one is productive at 4pm. So here I am, writing about a book about liquids instead of...never you mind.Liquid Rules: The Delightful and Dangerous Substances That Flowed Through Our Lives (2020) is Mark Miodownik's follow-up to Stuff Matters: The Strange Stories of the Marvellous Materials that Shape Our Man-made World (2014), which won the 2014 Royal Society Winton Prize for Science books and the 2015 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Communication Award. I didn’t know either awards existed but they seem relevant and most likely well-deserved because it is so, so easy to commend the quality of his writing.I wouldn’t say Liquid Rules bears epistemological significance. But you don’t read a book about liquids because you think there’s some quintessential knowledge you’re missing. You read it because you passed year 12 chemistry and now you can have that moment of vainglory realising you didn’t memorise chemical compounds and equations for nothing because you actually understand what an actual scientist gasp is saying. HA. Just kidding. I liked the title and thought it sounded unusual and entertaining. More importantly, I knew it wasn’t gonna be emotionally taxing. The kind of tension I’ve been experiencing has been unreal and I can’t explain why I’m so tense. I blame it on animal crossing which is meant to be a relaxing game but my perfectionism is ruining it for me. (Why can’t I place THIS bush next to THIS rock?!) In any case, I need something breezy but not fluffy.What makes Liquid Rules entertaining is how casual Miodownik sounds. The entire book is structured around Miodownik’s flight to San Francisco where he is to attend a scientific conference. As he is going through customs and security, he muses on what makes peanut butter a liquid and not a solid according to airline regulations. As the plane is taking off, he considers the discovery of kerosene in the premodern era and the incredible fact that no one knew its awesome power. Then mid-flight, he provides an endless stream of anecdotes about the terrifying power of storm clouds (when the plane experiences turbulence), why he prefers soap bars over liquid soap (when he goes to the bathroom), why we find snot disgusting (when curry dribbles down his chin), why the invention of biro was a complex problem with a surprisingly simple solution (when he signs the arrival card), and finally, the future when we can store man-made data like digital photographs inside droplets of liquid (as he arrives at the scientific conference). It feels like you’re flying and you’re listening in to all the amusing did-you-knows as the person next to you chatters on about the marvellous things we’re seeing. All in all, it’s like being offered a gaze into a secret network of things, where whaling in the nineteenth century is somehow related to the rise of the soap industry which is also related to the creation of soap opera during morning hours. The connective ‘thingness’ of life is suddenly made apparent and it is a wondrous sight. The world is a connected place. It’s connected by the seeping, oozing, dripping and molten liquids that flow in and out of us, around us, beneath us, and above us. Humans are 60% water and our planet is 70% water. We are living in an aqueous state on an aqueous planet, so it’s almost self-deceiving to think the world around us is solid and concrete when our body is formed in amniotic fluids and ends with being decomposed into minerals, water and gas. And isn’t it just the strangest thing to think one day, instead of relying on computers that speak in 0s and 1s, we will have biochemical computation that takes place on a molecular level? Yep. Mind blown. "
166,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109535466-mike-parkes,4,"Entertaining but scattered book describing the chemistry and applications of assorted liquids. I think this goes by different names in North America and Europe – the version I have is just titled “Liquid”. Lots of interesting details, and Miodownik is an entertaining and informative writer. However, the choice of liquids and their properties is random, with the organizing principle of the book being liquids one comes across on a flight (or is otherwise impacted by, e.g. clouds). The connecting interludes between chapters become annoying quite early on in the book (e.g. a trip to the lavatory provides the opportunity to discuss soaps and cleaning products). By the end, you’re left with a pastiche of chapters on different topics, some enlightening, some less so, but not a good grasp on liquids as a whole. A strong introductory chapter on the properties of liquids would really have helped. Not quite as good as Miodownik’s “Stuff Matters” which was similar in format but dealt with common solid materials (primarily structural).A few chapters I enjoyed in “Liquid” were:•	How the volatility and flash point of hydrocarbon liquids such as kerosene (jet fuel) and oils affected their use in lighting and energy products (ch 1)•	Glues, liquids that change to solids and form permanent bonds (ch 4). •	Refrigeration and air conditioning, from liquids that boil near room temperature, enabling them to transfer a large amount of heat through phase changes (ch 9).•	Pen inks, and the engineering and chemistry of designing a pen with ink that will flow on the page and turn into a solid without making a mess (ch 10).Other chapters deal with the intoxicating properties of alcohols (ch 2), the properties of the ocean (ch 3), liquid crystal displays (ch 5), bodily fluids (ch 6), the chemistry of tea and coffee (ch 7), soaps and detergents (ch 8), clouds (ch 11), the slow flow of ice and rocks on the earrh’s surface (ch 12), and sustainable materials such as self-healing asphalt (ch 13)."
167,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90301926-kaj,2,"You might think that “Liquid Rules” is about the science of liquids. Don’t be fooled. It’s actually one long kinda cringy story about Mark Miodownik’s flying experience, with some chemistry asides.I loved Miodownik’s previous book, “Stuff Matters,” where he explains how the big properties of everyday materials come from their chemical structure. Why are alloys sometimes stronger than the metals they’re made from? What does it mean to be conductive? Miodownik keeps his explanations simple and mechanistic, aided by small hand-drawn doodles. Unlike many other pop sci books, “Stuff Matters” never falls into the trap of focusing too much on what is important to know, rather than what’s interesting and informative. The info:tainment ratio is good- accessible enough for high school level students while still interesting for scientists. Sure, he sprinkles in some occasionally boring personal anecdotes, but every materials chem book would benefit from a few breathers.“Liquid Rules” doubles down on the bad parts of “Stuff Matters” while forgetting what made it great. Each chapter focuses on a different liquid. A major part of the book is trying to relate each liquid to something that happens on a single trans-Atlantic flight. This plot device seems to be an attempt to make the liquid chemistry seem useful by relating it to real-world phenomena, but the cumulative effect is the opposite. Too much time spent on why these chemicals are important, and not enough on why they’re interesting, mixed with long personal anecdotes and scientist biographies that are neither important nor interesting. For a book about fluids, “Liquid Rules” is just a little bit too dry."
168,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4261166-marshall,5,"I love the way Mark Miodownik writes. He addresses subjects that are seemingly boring (if you say it out loud like when I told my girlfriend I was reading about glue, and tape, and tvs) and opens up the mystery entirely, sparking a fascinating world of chemical wonder. His rhetoric and storytelling can deliver the scientific details in an easily digestible manner without using any scientific tools such as graphs, charts, and data sheets, only rudimentary drawings (which helped a whole lot and were very welcome enterprises). I was tremendously inspired by this book and every single chapter tapped into a childlike awe of the materials of the world around me. I learned and relearned many aspects of earth science and things I've only imagined. Honestly, I wish someone like a teacher or mentor would have been able to put this book in my hands when I was in early high school because I believe it may have changed the trajectory of my life. I might have sought out a career in material science. So, since that obviously didn't happen seeing how he wrote this book in the recent decade, I will be sure to pass it along to a young friend or a deer friend's young adult. In any case, this book just goes to show that there is ALWAYS something to marvel at, even if you find yourself experiencing a bit of ennui. Just walk outside and check out a flower or if you're stuck inside pick up a pen and peer a little bit closer into all that makes it possible. Absolutely LOVED both of Miodownik's books. I will be buying these two and looking forward to the next one (please write another!)!"
169,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92179113-patrick-green,4,"I typically associate scientists with tall guys in lab coats. Careful, fastidious, and, when in the lab, organized. I know this is a crude generalization, but there is certainly a nugget of truth to this statement. The scientist of this book, Mark Miodownik, should have kept this nugget of truth in mind when he was writing this book. ""Liquid Rules"" is messy and disjointed, primarily because of the framework that Miodownik uses to explain the properties and everyday uses of certain liquids. This made the reading experience for myself at times boring. I cared more for his explanations on the properties of tea, coffee, and ink for example than I did for kerosene or soap. I also did not care for his tangents. I was mostly looking for information on how certain liquids, or liquids in general, function. I did not care much to hear about his trip from England to San Francisco. It was a very plain framework. The details surrounding this framework, the scientific extrapolations on liquids, propelled my interest.I enjoyed the information on the liquids that Miodownik provided. I also relished some of the historical background of these liquids. They taught some valuable conclusions that I should make on certain liquids. For example, I can definitively say that I am a coffee drinker, not a tea drinker. And now I have scientific evidence to support my subjective opinion. Thank you, Miodownik.The last pleasant note that I found on the book was the laid back pace. I felt as though I could read it on a nice Sunday afternoon while also getting some mental exercise. Despite how messy and boring the framework was, it's a very enjoyable book to read, and I would recommend it."
170,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1109379-colette,3,"“Liquids are the alter ego of dependable solid stuff. Whereas solid materials are humanity’s faithful friend, taking on the permanent shapes of clothes, shoes, phones, cars, and indeed airports, liquids are fluid; they will take on any shape, but only while contained. When they’re not contained, they are always on the move, seeping, corroding, dripping, and escaping our control. If you put a solid material somewhere, it stays there—barring forcible removal—often doing something very useful, like holding up a building or supplying electricity for a whole community. Liquids, on the other hand, are anarchic: they have a knack for destroying things. In a bathroom, for instance, it is a constant battle to keep water from seeping into cracks and pooling under the floor, where it gets up to no good, rotting and undermining the wooden joists; on a smooth tile floor, water is the perfect slip hazard, causing an enormous number of injuries; and when it gathers in the corners of the bathroom, it can harbor black slimy fungus and bacteria, which threaten to infiltrate our bodies and make us sick. And yet, despite all this treachery, we love the stuff; we love bathing in water, and showering in it, drenching the whole body. And what bathroom is complete without a cornucopia of bottled liquid soaps, shampoos, and conditioners, jars of cream, and tubes of toothpaste? We delight in these miraculous liquids and yet we worry about them too: Are they bad for us? Do they cause cancer? Do they ruin the environment? With liquids, delight and suspicion go hand in hand. They are duplicitous by nature, neither a gas nor a solid but something in between, something inscrutable and mysterious.”"
171,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83179136-catherine-puma,4,"I was delighted when I saw Miodownik was coming out with another book. Having enjoyed his ""Stuff Matters"", I acquired ""Liquid Rules"" and was not disappointed. Framed by the narrative device of observing liquids around him while flying from Britain to California, Miodownik describes oceans, glaciers, clouds, wine, saliva, droplets in the pressurized cabin, tea, coffee, blood... to name a few. I learned so much! As a result, I found myself not just noticing all the liquids I encounter in my life, but also contemplating what properties they have in relation to one another. This included pondering the process of converting my bar of solid soap into a liquid substance by interacting it with water, another liquid. Miodownik's section on hand soap vs. liquid soap (and his preference for the former) was thus especially interesting. My only quibble with this work was its lack of acknowledging its own limitations. The subtitle implies that ""dangerous"" liquids would also be discussed, but--with the exception of mercury--the diversity of naturally occurring toxins and poisons are not mentioned. Of course it is unrealistic to expect such a short work to touch upon everything, but I wish there was more of a ""there's so much more to learn and discuss"" preface and/or conclusion. That being said, this was extremely eye opening, as ""Stuff Matters"" was, and I will be recommending it to many. This is a great way to inspire a natural curiosity for the natural observation of fluid dynamics. I can even see myself re-reading it again! "
172,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/964960-george,4,"As with his earlier Stuff Matters: Exploring the Marvelous Materials That Shape Our Man-Made World, Miodownik selects a convenient frame in which to hang his description of various types of liquids and the ways in which they affect our lives. In this case, it's a transatlantic flight from London to San Francisco, giving him the opportunity to reflect on, among other things, the hot beverages served by the flight attendants, refrigeration systems, the glue that holds the plane's wings to the fuselage, and of course the large body of water over which he flies. Like most popular books about science, there are parts that are going to be overly simplistic for experts, or even knowledgeable non-experts, but Miodownik is among the group of writers who, I think, manages to strike the right balance. The framework is contrived, yes, but it has also helped me to retain a fair amount of what was discussed, and I found myself thinking about it on my own flight to California (especially the part about the glue...). My only real criticism is that his observations of his seatmate, Susan, while in the name of setting us up for a reveal later on, came off as a bit creepy at times. "
173,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/190448-karen,4,"If you're into science, this book is a gem.It's written by a material scientist and the story is told on a flight from London to San Francisco, ostensibly focusing on all the liquids on board but it's really just a premise to tell the stories he wants to tell. The fact that he was on board a flight was cute but seemed contrived a bit at parts. But I didn't really care because the science and stories were super interesting to me. This book has 12 chapters, each chapter focusing on a different substance like glue, ink, etc. I loved the bits about how candles work and how the wick pulls water up against the force of gravity. I learned about how the World Trade Centers buckled due to the strength of the steel decreasing under such high heat and then putting pressure on the lower floors, etc. And how flavor is a multi-sensory experience (and how we assume and 'can taste' flavors related to the color.) I also loved reading how icarus story wouldn't be possible because it gets colder when you fly higher :) I loved learning about ballpoint pens and how they work (and how amazing they are!!) and about tar and all the interesting new innovations they are making to help the roads last longer.There is just so much fascinating science in this book. Highly enjoyable. thanks to netgalley for an advanced copy in exchange for an honest review."
174,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7273557-gary,3," Mark Miodownik book Liquid Rules takes the reader on a transatlantic flight from London to San Francisco. His profession is in materials. The security line examining for liquids and then the pre-flight safety lecture triggers in him what liquids are we talking about? For one, the jet you are flying in is really a bomb, full of kerosene. After getting you all panicked about ever flying again, there is talk of alcohol, tea, coffee, soaps, ketchup, and many other items. His explanations are very readable and when he traces inventions, it makes the subject matter come alive.The book is told in sections, divided by the type of liquids he encounters along the way. He leads an interesting discussion about why the liquids are different and how various liquids you would not associate are similar. I found that after about the fifth chapter of this, I was getting a bit overwhelmed with the detail of explanation-I usually find details like he presents as interesting. So I am not sure why this bugs me. I would chalk it up to the reader more than the writer.I would recommend this book. But if you do read the book, try taking the book in smaller chunks rather than as a book to read straight through.For more of my thoughts, please see my book blog."
175,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"Mark Miodownik explores the mundanely marvelous liquids that make up our lives in the framework of a transatlantic flight from London to San Francisco with Liquid Rules. Liquid Rules explores the different aspects of liquids as they relate to making our lives easier. Take Kerosene as an example. Kerosene was first discovered back in 900 CE or around that century by an Arabic Alchemist and Scholar. The only problem was that Olive Oil was preferred for lamps since the government could tax it.Miodownik goes over a great many subjects and ideas. He writes about distillation, flashpoints, chemical structures, and so much more. The book reminds me a bit of Gravity’s Rainbow with all of the different information that the author stuffs into the pages, but this book is far more accessible.There are a lot of different things that Miodownik brings to your attention. Think of the humble candle as a great example. It might seem easy to understand, but there is a lot of physics going on to make sure that a candle works properly. Another thing to think about is as simple as a ballpoint pen. Even the ink had to be engineered for the proper viscosity and binding properties.I will probably search for Miodownik’s other books like Stuff Matters, assuming I haven’t read them already. "
176,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102314750-sam,0,"Liquid Rules is a book that examines in the depth the relationships between various liquids and how they affect our world. Traveling between London, San Francisco, and on the plane ride between, Mark Miodownik teaches us the surprising truth of how reliant we are as a people on liquids. While diving into the mechanical sciences of things, often discussing liquids in regards to thermal properties, the 2nd law of thermodynamics, and quantum relationships, he doesn't become completely absorbed in this writing remembering to include more colloquial evaluations. These reviews, often revolve around a specific liquids contribution to society, the history of how it was created (or found, and how it may be revolutionized in the future, and provides a sense balance and completion to his writing. Unlike many scientists who often thrive and exploit the mysticism (or more correctly lack of education) around their work to make themselves more interesting Mark Miodownik takes pride in his humanity, often talking about how his work around liquids stems from the want to learn. Overall, Liquid Rules is a unique book, that relays with humor and wit how the science, history, and properties of many liquids bear a pivotal role in the development of our modern industrialized society."
177,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40472466-dan,5,"Once again, after Stuff Matters, Mark Miodownik brings about the joy of acknowledging the material matters around us. It is an excellent book if you want to follow the meandering thoughts of the author.""Liquids have a duality: they are neither a gas nor a solid, but something in between. They are exciting and powerful, on the one hand, while anarchic and slightly terrifying on the other. That is their nature.""The liquid is a core part of what makes us living beings, how we interact with the world. Earth's molten-metal liquid core creates a magnetic field that protects water from being dried up due to the solar wind. We wouldn't have a vast amount of water in the sea without the core.Our energy source is often in a liquid form, e.g., whale oil, gasoline, kerosene, diesel. Some explosives are in liquid form like nitroglycerin, which is the reason why a certain amount of liquid is not allowed to carry on planes.Of course, we drink water, alcohol (ethanol, not methanol), wine, coffee, and tea. Our body is also mostly liquid. Our saliva helps us digest, kills pain, and protects us from bacterias (and bad breath). We cry and drop tears. We put on perfumes (methanol). We clean using soap.We watch (LCD: liquid crystal displays).Look up and see clouds? They are liquid too.The author tells these stories while he takes a flight to his conference. His perspectives are refreshing especially since flying is one of the worst experiences that I have to endure. It is cramped. There is an invisible tension over the armrest. The middle seat gets the two, does anyone disagree? The air is too dry. Food is usually horrible if served. A trip to the bathroom is bothersome. Now I know what to do. Order coffee instead of tea. Sleep without drooling. Watch movies which I would enjoy more. Last but not least, appreciate liquids!"
178,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48901937-kyle-dinges,4,"Liquid Rules by Mark Miodownik is a book that looks at some of the most important liquids that society depends on and gives a bit of a brief background on their chemical makeup and how they were created or discovered. It is easily accessible, which is something I usually look for in non-fiction about science. Like his first book, Stuff Matters, Miodownik has a knack for writing about complex scientific ideas in a way that are easy for the lay person to understand. He sprinkles in plenty of humor to keep things lively and never drones on for too long about one subject. The idea to use an airplane ride to introduce each liquid, and demonstrate their abundance in life, was a good way to present each liquid in a logical order and talk about real life applications. All of this just serves to make the book more entertaining and interesting. There's a delicate balance to making a book like this informative and entertaining, and Miodownik does a good job in that regard.Someone looking for a more expansive an in depth text might be a bit let down, but for someone just looking for an entertaining ""pop-science"" read, I think this book more than fits the bill."
179,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12527649-kristin,4,"Generally speaking, this was a good overview of various properties of liquids, how we interact with them, and how they affect us. It took an extremely broad area of knowledge and made it understandable (and enjoyable!) for the semi-layperson. I especially enjoyed the chapter on saliva (weird, I know, but it was of professional interest haha). I also enjoyed the chapter on tea, coffee, and other beverages. The reason I knocked a star off of my review is because the author often says “double blind studies have shown...” or “studies have shown...” but does not cite these studies or sources. There is a “further reading” section at the end of the book, but none of the resources are linked to the specific claims presented in the main body. I know this is supposed to be a general overview, but if sources are claimed, they should be cited. This normally wouldn’t bug me so much, but I would actually like to read some of those studies.... (including the one mentioned in the cooling chapter, where the author talks about perfluorocarbons as a substitute for blood and the subsequent clinical trials). IT’S BREATHABLE LIQUID. Doesn’t that sound like some worthwhile further reading?"

192,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,4,"I'd really enjoyed Miodownik's Stuff Matters, on the science of different solid materials like glass, metal, concrete and graphite, and was excited that he had a book on liquids. Whereas Stuff Matters covered the materials that Miodownik presumably found the most fascinating and significant in terms of daily life, the conceit for Liquid is the different kinds of liquids Miodownik encounters on a flight - oils, alcohol, water, glue, liquid crystals, saliva, tea and coffee, soap, refrigerants, ink, clouds, magma and tar (the latter two signifying the end of his journey when the plane lands). In Liquid, Miodownik weaves a fascinating narrative that draws from chemistry, physics, science history, earth science, to name a few. It's full of fascinating nuggets. Like why it is dangerous to consume home brews or alcohol-based liquids for a cheap high because the methanol in them hasn't been removed; methanol is metabolised into formic acid and formaldehyde in the body, where the formic acid attacks your nerve cells, especially the optic nerve, leaving you blind (hence the expression 'blind drunk'). Like how it is rubber that gives Post-It Notes their stickiness; the notes have an adhesive layer of rubber on them where the microscopic spheres of rubber bond tightly to the note but create only a small adhesive force when pressed onto a surface. Or that sticky tape has three layers, a bottom layer of adhesive, a middle layer of cellophane for strength and transparency and a top layer of non-stick material like Teflon. And the fascinating universe of two-part adhesives. Or how he unpacks the complexities involved in brewing the perfect cup of tea, as it involves striking the right balance of temperature (too low and the flavour molecules in the tea won't dissolve; too high and many of the tannins and polyphenols that give a bitter taste and astringency will also dissolve), timing (to ensure the perfect balance of the different kinds of volatiles), compared to the (relative) ease of making a decent cup of coffee.And the marvels of how soap works - that when you mix fat with an alkali (like ash water), the alkali transforms the fat molecules into hybrid molecules with a charged head that dissolves in water and a carbon tail that dissolves in fats. The carbon tails of hybrid soap molecules embed themselves in fat blobs, creating a charged surface with their heads that can dissolve in water. Thus allowing the fat blob to be washed away. [Fascinating factoids: Egg is the surfactant in mayonnaise, allowing the oil and water in mayo to bind. It's like soap in that respect and you can use egg yolk to clean your hair. P&G invented Ivory Soap and part of its marketing strategy was to sponsor serial dramas targeting housewives at home during the day. Hence the name 'soap opera'.]Like Stuff Matters, Liquid is very accessibly written, even for the science phobe. But unlike Stuff Matters, the conceit of Liquid - to wrap the material science within the larger narrative arc of Miodownik's flight, and his interactions with his fellow passenger, Susan - is distracting. Miodownik's attempts at humour - the disgust he evokes when he falls asleep and drools on Susan, when he sneezes on another passenger, when he obsesses about why the inflight safety video remains silent on the largest hazard of all, the fact that they will be in the air with thousands of gallons of combustible fuel - are pedestrian and awkward. For Stuff Matters, I'd felt that the sections where Miodownik tried to jazz things up a bit, to perhaps take a more creative treatment of the topic fell flat. Like when he discussed porcelain in the context of his parents' wedding tea set. The main thing here is really the fascinating science of liquids but Miodownik sometimes seems to forget this. Still, this is a fairly minor complaint in what is overall, a fun and fascinating read. "
193,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66635467-keen,4,"“Liquids have a duality: they are neither a gas nor solid, but something in-between. They are exciting and powerful, on the one hand, while being anarchic and slightly terrifying on the other.” Travelling on a trans-Atlantic flight from London to San Francisco, Miodownik uses a number of observations and thoughts as creative jumping off points to get into some whimsical and fascinating territory throughout the journey.This is a largely, but not always accessible investigation of sorts into some of the many liquids that most of us will encounter in our daily lives. A quirky odyssey loaded with lots of colourful facts and trivia to pull out down the pub or indeed any social occasion. I had no idea that the de Havilland Mosquito bomber used during WWII was made of plywood, which made it the fastest aircraft in the sky or that we use around 16 billion litres of oil every day throughout the world.Apparently there is 150’000 litres of kerosene stored in a jumbo jet (50’000 in the fuel tank below your feet and another 50’000 stored in each wing). And yet you could throw a lit match at it and it wouldn’t ignite. But mix it with the right amount of oxygen and it suddenly becomes an oil ten times as powerful as nitroglycerine.He talks about the crucial difference between ethanol and methanol, pure methanol can cause permanent blindness. Your body metabolises it into formic acid and formaldehyde. Formic acid attacks nerve cells, especially the optic nerve, hence the saying ‘blind drunk’. It also goes after your liver and kidneys and can cause permanent damage. Three glasses of it will kill you.Miodownik explains why drinking wine is a multi-sensory experience, and how more often than not many people enjoy paying for the brand more than the experience, “Some people love having the most expensive cars, they get real enjoyment out of what that says about them as a person. It’s the same with wines. But this doesn’t mean that these are better wines or better cars, or even that the owners are more sophisticated people.” He cites the experiments that managed to fool so called ‘wine experts’ that convinced them that they were drinking white wine, but thanks to a flavourless red dye they got suckered into describing it in detail as a red wine.He also covers many more interesting topics from 3-D printing, the humble yet fascinating biro pen and even the wonderful properties of tar and asphalt, he talks of the pitch drop experiment set up in 1927 by Prof Thomas Parnell at the University of Queensland, the first drop fell in 1938, the second in 1947, the third in 1954 and the ninth and most recent drop fell in 2014.One of the minor pitfalls in this book is that occasionally some of the topics get a little tedious and there are too many complex and bewildering diagrams of molecular structures for my taste, but that is sure to appeal to science and chemistry buffs alike, but you don’t have to study or understand them to enjoy the book.This reminded me of Paul Vanhoenacker’s “Skyfaring” (the book is mentioned in the further reading section). This book relies on a format used repeatedly by the likes of Gavin Francis, Alain de Botton and many others, which takes everyday subjects, and makes them relatively accessible, whilst allowing us to view seemingly mundane objects with a renewed sense of wonder. It’s a style that peppers the book with helpful and occasionally light-hearted images and the books are never too long. It’s a format that I happen to enjoy and it’s clearly a popular one too."
194,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20280886-sarah-smith,3,"More often than I care to admit my wee brain gets a bit overwhelmed and when this happens I tend to look for things that are objective as opposed to subjective. And it sort of gives me a break. Today’s break came in the form of a popular science book (Side note, I LOVE books classed as popular science) called Liquids by Mark Miodownik. Oddly enough it is a book about Liquids, from tea to superliquid Helium, kerosene and ink, the sea to lava. A whole plethora of them each with their own weird, dangerous and fascinating properties. And were it has the potential to be an excellent book it falls a little short. The major issue I had is how Miodownik frames the narrative. He is on a flight from London to San Francisco and he introduces the different liquids in an increasingly strained and conceited way related to this flight. This quickly starts to grate, the tone of these bits is sort of akin to an over enthusiastic kids TV presenter who has forgotten they are on Newsnight and are talking to Kirsty Wark as opposed to a group of pubescent children. But although I’ve started with the bad, it almost redeems itself as there is much to interest. I was born in 1986 and all I remember from primary school (we shall not read in to why I remember so little) concerns the Gulf War, an oil spill, and the ozone layer having a massive whole in it. And it was only in reading this I realised why in primary school we where told all about the whole in the ozone, as it was around this time the world realised the damage CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons) had done to the ozone, CFCs where used in refrigerators as a coolant, as they were seemingly harmless and inert, and then everyone realised this was not the case. It was actually the same fella responsible for this that said lead in petrol was safe too, so he’s not so much the greatest really. Apart from learning about coolants used in refrigerators, you also get to learn about so many things you would never stop to consider. How the ink in biros work, can you tell the difference between red and white wine if you cant see them (I to be fair would struggle to distinguish either from vinegar), why Eastenders is a soap, how ships float, and planes fly, that roads to a certain extent are self healing on account of the viscosity of tar(tar is actually a liquid, just a million times as viscous as peanut butter) man made clouds (Russia uses them every May to make sure May Day celebrations are rain free, the little rascals) also just you know clouds in general. It’s almost a history of the world told via the scientific progress concerning liquids that are often vital to our existence without us really ever thinking too much about them. Despite all of this I was left feeling a little short changed. It is possible I expect too much, I’ve been spoiled by books such as those written by Simon Singh (Fermats last theorem, Big Bang) or Sam Kean’s The Disappearing Spoon which have a more consistent tone, and I found to captivate me more, but just because these are better doesn’t make Liquids bad, just not as good as I had hoped. Mostly it suffers from how he introduces the liquids in each instance, and I know I’ve written about how it is interesting but like an under seasoned soup there wasn’t quite enough of the interesting. It felt a little padded in parts and too much time was spent on irrelevant personal anecdotes. Sadly not nearly as good as it could have been."
195,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4137725-phoebe,5,"Right now I'm experiencing that 4pm listlessness. It's either coffee or nap. Resistance is futile. No one is productive at 4pm. So here I am, writing about a book about liquids instead of...never you mind.Liquid Rules: The Delightful and Dangerous Substances That Flowed Through Our Lives (2020) is Mark Miodownik's follow-up to Stuff Matters: The Strange Stories of the Marvellous Materials that Shape Our Man-made World (2014), which won the 2014 Royal Society Winton Prize for Science books and the 2015 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Communication Award. I didn’t know either awards existed but they seem relevant and most likely well-deserved because it is so, so easy to commend the quality of his writing.I wouldn’t say Liquid Rules bears epistemological significance. But you don’t read a book about liquids because you think there’s some quintessential knowledge you’re missing. You read it because you passed year 12 chemistry and now you can have that moment of vainglory realising you didn’t memorise chemical compounds and equations for nothing because you actually understand what an actual scientist gasp is saying. HA. Just kidding. I liked the title and thought it sounded unusual and entertaining. More importantly, I knew it wasn’t gonna be emotionally taxing. The kind of tension I’ve been experiencing has been unreal and I can’t explain why I’m so tense. I blame it on animal crossing which is meant to be a relaxing game but my perfectionism is ruining it for me. (Why can’t I place THIS bush next to THIS rock?!) In any case, I need something breezy but not fluffy.What makes Liquid Rules entertaining is how casual Miodownik sounds. The entire book is structured around Miodownik’s flight to San Francisco where he is to attend a scientific conference. As he is going through customs and security, he muses on what makes peanut butter a liquid and not a solid according to airline regulations. As the plane is taking off, he considers the discovery of kerosene in the premodern era and the incredible fact that no one knew its awesome power. Then mid-flight, he provides an endless stream of anecdotes about the terrifying power of storm clouds (when the plane experiences turbulence), why he prefers soap bars over liquid soap (when he goes to the bathroom), why we find snot disgusting (when curry dribbles down his chin), why the invention of biro was a complex problem with a surprisingly simple solution (when he signs the arrival card), and finally, the future when we can store man-made data like digital photographs inside droplets of liquid (as he arrives at the scientific conference). It feels like you’re flying and you’re listening in to all the amusing did-you-knows as the person next to you chatters on about the marvellous things we’re seeing. All in all, it’s like being offered a gaze into a secret network of things, where whaling in the nineteenth century is somehow related to the rise of the soap industry which is also related to the creation of soap opera during morning hours. The connective ‘thingness’ of life is suddenly made apparent and it is a wondrous sight. The world is a connected place. It’s connected by the seeping, oozing, dripping and molten liquids that flow in and out of us, around us, beneath us, and above us. Humans are 60% water and our planet is 70% water. We are living in an aqueous state on an aqueous planet, so it’s almost self-deceiving to think the world around us is solid and concrete when our body is formed in amniotic fluids and ends with being decomposed into minerals, water and gas. And isn’t it just the strangest thing to think one day, instead of relying on computers that speak in 0s and 1s, we will have biochemical computation that takes place on a molecular level? Yep. Mind blown. "
196,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109535466-mike-parkes,4,"Entertaining but scattered book describing the chemistry and applications of assorted liquids. I think this goes by different names in North America and Europe – the version I have is just titled “Liquid”. Lots of interesting details, and Miodownik is an entertaining and informative writer. However, the choice of liquids and their properties is random, with the organizing principle of the book being liquids one comes across on a flight (or is otherwise impacted by, e.g. clouds). The connecting interludes between chapters become annoying quite early on in the book (e.g. a trip to the lavatory provides the opportunity to discuss soaps and cleaning products). By the end, you’re left with a pastiche of chapters on different topics, some enlightening, some less so, but not a good grasp on liquids as a whole. A strong introductory chapter on the properties of liquids would really have helped. Not quite as good as Miodownik’s “Stuff Matters” which was similar in format but dealt with common solid materials (primarily structural).A few chapters I enjoyed in “Liquid” were:•	How the volatility and flash point of hydrocarbon liquids such as kerosene (jet fuel) and oils affected their use in lighting and energy products (ch 1)•	Glues, liquids that change to solids and form permanent bonds (ch 4). •	Refrigeration and air conditioning, from liquids that boil near room temperature, enabling them to transfer a large amount of heat through phase changes (ch 9).•	Pen inks, and the engineering and chemistry of designing a pen with ink that will flow on the page and turn into a solid without making a mess (ch 10).Other chapters deal with the intoxicating properties of alcohols (ch 2), the properties of the ocean (ch 3), liquid crystal displays (ch 5), bodily fluids (ch 6), the chemistry of tea and coffee (ch 7), soaps and detergents (ch 8), clouds (ch 11), the slow flow of ice and rocks on the earrh’s surface (ch 12), and sustainable materials such as self-healing asphalt (ch 13)."
197,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90301926-kaj,2,"You might think that “Liquid Rules” is about the science of liquids. Don’t be fooled. It’s actually one long kinda cringy story about Mark Miodownik’s flying experience, with some chemistry asides.I loved Miodownik’s previous book, “Stuff Matters,” where he explains how the big properties of everyday materials come from their chemical structure. Why are alloys sometimes stronger than the metals they’re made from? What does it mean to be conductive? Miodownik keeps his explanations simple and mechanistic, aided by small hand-drawn doodles. Unlike many other pop sci books, “Stuff Matters” never falls into the trap of focusing too much on what is important to know, rather than what’s interesting and informative. The info:tainment ratio is good- accessible enough for high school level students while still interesting for scientists. Sure, he sprinkles in some occasionally boring personal anecdotes, but every materials chem book would benefit from a few breathers.“Liquid Rules” doubles down on the bad parts of “Stuff Matters” while forgetting what made it great. Each chapter focuses on a different liquid. A major part of the book is trying to relate each liquid to something that happens on a single trans-Atlantic flight. This plot device seems to be an attempt to make the liquid chemistry seem useful by relating it to real-world phenomena, but the cumulative effect is the opposite. Too much time spent on why these chemicals are important, and not enough on why they’re interesting, mixed with long personal anecdotes and scientist biographies that are neither important nor interesting. For a book about fluids, “Liquid Rules” is just a little bit too dry."
198,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4261166-marshall,5,"I love the way Mark Miodownik writes. He addresses subjects that are seemingly boring (if you say it out loud like when I told my girlfriend I was reading about glue, and tape, and tvs) and opens up the mystery entirely, sparking a fascinating world of chemical wonder. His rhetoric and storytelling can deliver the scientific details in an easily digestible manner without using any scientific tools such as graphs, charts, and data sheets, only rudimentary drawings (which helped a whole lot and were very welcome enterprises). I was tremendously inspired by this book and every single chapter tapped into a childlike awe of the materials of the world around me. I learned and relearned many aspects of earth science and things I've only imagined. Honestly, I wish someone like a teacher or mentor would have been able to put this book in my hands when I was in early high school because I believe it may have changed the trajectory of my life. I might have sought out a career in material science. So, since that obviously didn't happen seeing how he wrote this book in the recent decade, I will be sure to pass it along to a young friend or a deer friend's young adult. In any case, this book just goes to show that there is ALWAYS something to marvel at, even if you find yourself experiencing a bit of ennui. Just walk outside and check out a flower or if you're stuck inside pick up a pen and peer a little bit closer into all that makes it possible. Absolutely LOVED both of Miodownik's books. I will be buying these two and looking forward to the next one (please write another!)!"
199,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92179113-patrick-green,4,"I typically associate scientists with tall guys in lab coats. Careful, fastidious, and, when in the lab, organized. I know this is a crude generalization, but there is certainly a nugget of truth to this statement. The scientist of this book, Mark Miodownik, should have kept this nugget of truth in mind when he was writing this book. ""Liquid Rules"" is messy and disjointed, primarily because of the framework that Miodownik uses to explain the properties and everyday uses of certain liquids. This made the reading experience for myself at times boring. I cared more for his explanations on the properties of tea, coffee, and ink for example than I did for kerosene or soap. I also did not care for his tangents. I was mostly looking for information on how certain liquids, or liquids in general, function. I did not care much to hear about his trip from England to San Francisco. It was a very plain framework. The details surrounding this framework, the scientific extrapolations on liquids, propelled my interest.I enjoyed the information on the liquids that Miodownik provided. I also relished some of the historical background of these liquids. They taught some valuable conclusions that I should make on certain liquids. For example, I can definitively say that I am a coffee drinker, not a tea drinker. And now I have scientific evidence to support my subjective opinion. Thank you, Miodownik.The last pleasant note that I found on the book was the laid back pace. I felt as though I could read it on a nice Sunday afternoon while also getting some mental exercise. Despite how messy and boring the framework was, it's a very enjoyable book to read, and I would recommend it."
200,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1109379-colette,3,"“Liquids are the alter ego of dependable solid stuff. Whereas solid materials are humanity’s faithful friend, taking on the permanent shapes of clothes, shoes, phones, cars, and indeed airports, liquids are fluid; they will take on any shape, but only while contained. When they’re not contained, they are always on the move, seeping, corroding, dripping, and escaping our control. If you put a solid material somewhere, it stays there—barring forcible removal—often doing something very useful, like holding up a building or supplying electricity for a whole community. Liquids, on the other hand, are anarchic: they have a knack for destroying things. In a bathroom, for instance, it is a constant battle to keep water from seeping into cracks and pooling under the floor, where it gets up to no good, rotting and undermining the wooden joists; on a smooth tile floor, water is the perfect slip hazard, causing an enormous number of injuries; and when it gathers in the corners of the bathroom, it can harbor black slimy fungus and bacteria, which threaten to infiltrate our bodies and make us sick. And yet, despite all this treachery, we love the stuff; we love bathing in water, and showering in it, drenching the whole body. And what bathroom is complete without a cornucopia of bottled liquid soaps, shampoos, and conditioners, jars of cream, and tubes of toothpaste? We delight in these miraculous liquids and yet we worry about them too: Are they bad for us? Do they cause cancer? Do they ruin the environment? With liquids, delight and suspicion go hand in hand. They are duplicitous by nature, neither a gas nor a solid but something in between, something inscrutable and mysterious.”"
201,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83179136-catherine-puma,4,"I was delighted when I saw Miodownik was coming out with another book. Having enjoyed his ""Stuff Matters"", I acquired ""Liquid Rules"" and was not disappointed. Framed by the narrative device of observing liquids around him while flying from Britain to California, Miodownik describes oceans, glaciers, clouds, wine, saliva, droplets in the pressurized cabin, tea, coffee, blood... to name a few. I learned so much! As a result, I found myself not just noticing all the liquids I encounter in my life, but also contemplating what properties they have in relation to one another. This included pondering the process of converting my bar of solid soap into a liquid substance by interacting it with water, another liquid. Miodownik's section on hand soap vs. liquid soap (and his preference for the former) was thus especially interesting. My only quibble with this work was its lack of acknowledging its own limitations. The subtitle implies that ""dangerous"" liquids would also be discussed, but--with the exception of mercury--the diversity of naturally occurring toxins and poisons are not mentioned. Of course it is unrealistic to expect such a short work to touch upon everything, but I wish there was more of a ""there's so much more to learn and discuss"" preface and/or conclusion. That being said, this was extremely eye opening, as ""Stuff Matters"" was, and I will be recommending it to many. This is a great way to inspire a natural curiosity for the natural observation of fluid dynamics. I can even see myself re-reading it again! "
202,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/964960-george,4,"As with his earlier Stuff Matters: Exploring the Marvelous Materials That Shape Our Man-Made World, Miodownik selects a convenient frame in which to hang his description of various types of liquids and the ways in which they affect our lives. In this case, it's a transatlantic flight from London to San Francisco, giving him the opportunity to reflect on, among other things, the hot beverages served by the flight attendants, refrigeration systems, the glue that holds the plane's wings to the fuselage, and of course the large body of water over which he flies. Like most popular books about science, there are parts that are going to be overly simplistic for experts, or even knowledgeable non-experts, but Miodownik is among the group of writers who, I think, manages to strike the right balance. The framework is contrived, yes, but it has also helped me to retain a fair amount of what was discussed, and I found myself thinking about it on my own flight to California (especially the part about the glue...). My only real criticism is that his observations of his seatmate, Susan, while in the name of setting us up for a reveal later on, came off as a bit creepy at times. "
203,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/190448-karen,4,"If you're into science, this book is a gem.It's written by a material scientist and the story is told on a flight from London to San Francisco, ostensibly focusing on all the liquids on board but it's really just a premise to tell the stories he wants to tell. The fact that he was on board a flight was cute but seemed contrived a bit at parts. But I didn't really care because the science and stories were super interesting to me. This book has 12 chapters, each chapter focusing on a different substance like glue, ink, etc. I loved the bits about how candles work and how the wick pulls water up against the force of gravity. I learned about how the World Trade Centers buckled due to the strength of the steel decreasing under such high heat and then putting pressure on the lower floors, etc. And how flavor is a multi-sensory experience (and how we assume and 'can taste' flavors related to the color.) I also loved reading how icarus story wouldn't be possible because it gets colder when you fly higher :) I loved learning about ballpoint pens and how they work (and how amazing they are!!) and about tar and all the interesting new innovations they are making to help the roads last longer.There is just so much fascinating science in this book. Highly enjoyable. thanks to netgalley for an advanced copy in exchange for an honest review."
204,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7273557-gary,3," Mark Miodownik book Liquid Rules takes the reader on a transatlantic flight from London to San Francisco. His profession is in materials. The security line examining for liquids and then the pre-flight safety lecture triggers in him what liquids are we talking about? For one, the jet you are flying in is really a bomb, full of kerosene. After getting you all panicked about ever flying again, there is talk of alcohol, tea, coffee, soaps, ketchup, and many other items. His explanations are very readable and when he traces inventions, it makes the subject matter come alive.The book is told in sections, divided by the type of liquids he encounters along the way. He leads an interesting discussion about why the liquids are different and how various liquids you would not associate are similar. I found that after about the fifth chapter of this, I was getting a bit overwhelmed with the detail of explanation-I usually find details like he presents as interesting. So I am not sure why this bugs me. I would chalk it up to the reader more than the writer.I would recommend this book. But if you do read the book, try taking the book in smaller chunks rather than as a book to read straight through.For more of my thoughts, please see my book blog."
205,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"Mark Miodownik explores the mundanely marvelous liquids that make up our lives in the framework of a transatlantic flight from London to San Francisco with Liquid Rules. Liquid Rules explores the different aspects of liquids as they relate to making our lives easier. Take Kerosene as an example. Kerosene was first discovered back in 900 CE or around that century by an Arabic Alchemist and Scholar. The only problem was that Olive Oil was preferred for lamps since the government could tax it.Miodownik goes over a great many subjects and ideas. He writes about distillation, flashpoints, chemical structures, and so much more. The book reminds me a bit of Gravity’s Rainbow with all of the different information that the author stuffs into the pages, but this book is far more accessible.There are a lot of different things that Miodownik brings to your attention. Think of the humble candle as a great example. It might seem easy to understand, but there is a lot of physics going on to make sure that a candle works properly. Another thing to think about is as simple as a ballpoint pen. Even the ink had to be engineered for the proper viscosity and binding properties.I will probably search for Miodownik’s other books like Stuff Matters, assuming I haven’t read them already. "
206,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102314750-sam,0,"Liquid Rules is a book that examines in the depth the relationships between various liquids and how they affect our world. Traveling between London, San Francisco, and on the plane ride between, Mark Miodownik teaches us the surprising truth of how reliant we are as a people on liquids. While diving into the mechanical sciences of things, often discussing liquids in regards to thermal properties, the 2nd law of thermodynamics, and quantum relationships, he doesn't become completely absorbed in this writing remembering to include more colloquial evaluations. These reviews, often revolve around a specific liquids contribution to society, the history of how it was created (or found, and how it may be revolutionized in the future, and provides a sense balance and completion to his writing. Unlike many scientists who often thrive and exploit the mysticism (or more correctly lack of education) around their work to make themselves more interesting Mark Miodownik takes pride in his humanity, often talking about how his work around liquids stems from the want to learn. Overall, Liquid Rules is a unique book, that relays with humor and wit how the science, history, and properties of many liquids bear a pivotal role in the development of our modern industrialized society."
207,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40472466-dan,5,"Once again, after Stuff Matters, Mark Miodownik brings about the joy of acknowledging the material matters around us. It is an excellent book if you want to follow the meandering thoughts of the author.""Liquids have a duality: they are neither a gas nor a solid, but something in between. They are exciting and powerful, on the one hand, while anarchic and slightly terrifying on the other. That is their nature.""The liquid is a core part of what makes us living beings, how we interact with the world. Earth's molten-metal liquid core creates a magnetic field that protects water from being dried up due to the solar wind. We wouldn't have a vast amount of water in the sea without the core.Our energy source is often in a liquid form, e.g., whale oil, gasoline, kerosene, diesel. Some explosives are in liquid form like nitroglycerin, which is the reason why a certain amount of liquid is not allowed to carry on planes.Of course, we drink water, alcohol (ethanol, not methanol), wine, coffee, and tea. Our body is also mostly liquid. Our saliva helps us digest, kills pain, and protects us from bacterias (and bad breath). We cry and drop tears. We put on perfumes (methanol). We clean using soap.We watch (LCD: liquid crystal displays).Look up and see clouds? They are liquid too.The author tells these stories while he takes a flight to his conference. His perspectives are refreshing especially since flying is one of the worst experiences that I have to endure. It is cramped. There is an invisible tension over the armrest. The middle seat gets the two, does anyone disagree? The air is too dry. Food is usually horrible if served. A trip to the bathroom is bothersome. Now I know what to do. Order coffee instead of tea. Sleep without drooling. Watch movies which I would enjoy more. Last but not least, appreciate liquids!"
208,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48901937-kyle-dinges,4,"Liquid Rules by Mark Miodownik is a book that looks at some of the most important liquids that society depends on and gives a bit of a brief background on their chemical makeup and how they were created or discovered. It is easily accessible, which is something I usually look for in non-fiction about science. Like his first book, Stuff Matters, Miodownik has a knack for writing about complex scientific ideas in a way that are easy for the lay person to understand. He sprinkles in plenty of humor to keep things lively and never drones on for too long about one subject. The idea to use an airplane ride to introduce each liquid, and demonstrate their abundance in life, was a good way to present each liquid in a logical order and talk about real life applications. All of this just serves to make the book more entertaining and interesting. There's a delicate balance to making a book like this informative and entertaining, and Miodownik does a good job in that regard.Someone looking for a more expansive an in depth text might be a bit let down, but for someone just looking for an entertaining ""pop-science"" read, I think this book more than fits the bill."
209,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12527649-kristin,4,"Generally speaking, this was a good overview of various properties of liquids, how we interact with them, and how they affect us. It took an extremely broad area of knowledge and made it understandable (and enjoyable!) for the semi-layperson. I especially enjoyed the chapter on saliva (weird, I know, but it was of professional interest haha). I also enjoyed the chapter on tea, coffee, and other beverages. The reason I knocked a star off of my review is because the author often says “double blind studies have shown...” or “studies have shown...” but does not cite these studies or sources. There is a “further reading” section at the end of the book, but none of the resources are linked to the specific claims presented in the main body. I know this is supposed to be a general overview, but if sources are claimed, they should be cited. This normally wouldn’t bug me so much, but I would actually like to read some of those studies.... (including the one mentioned in the cooling chapter, where the author talks about perfluorocarbons as a substitute for blood and the subsequent clinical trials). IT’S BREATHABLE LIQUID. Doesn’t that sound like some worthwhile further reading?"
210,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56863096-jeremy,3,"I preferred his previous book Stuff Matters better, but there was still enough of interest in this book to make it interesting. But there were parts that are either mainstream knowledge or just not very interesting to many people.

222,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,4,"I'd really enjoyed Miodownik's Stuff Matters, on the science of different solid materials like glass, metal, concrete and graphite, and was excited that he had a book on liquids. Whereas Stuff Matters covered the materials that Miodownik presumably found the most fascinating and significant in terms of daily life, the conceit for Liquid is the different kinds of liquids Miodownik encounters on a flight - oils, alcohol, water, glue, liquid crystals, saliva, tea and coffee, soap, refrigerants, ink, clouds, magma and tar (the latter two signifying the end of his journey when the plane lands). In Liquid, Miodownik weaves a fascinating narrative that draws from chemistry, physics, science history, earth science, to name a few. It's full of fascinating nuggets. Like why it is dangerous to consume home brews or alcohol-based liquids for a cheap high because the methanol in them hasn't been removed; methanol is metabolised into formic acid and formaldehyde in the body, where the formic acid attacks your nerve cells, especially the optic nerve, leaving you blind (hence the expression 'blind drunk'). Like how it is rubber that gives Post-It Notes their stickiness; the notes have an adhesive layer of rubber on them where the microscopic spheres of rubber bond tightly to the note but create only a small adhesive force when pressed onto a surface. Or that sticky tape has three layers, a bottom layer of adhesive, a middle layer of cellophane for strength and transparency and a top layer of non-stick material like Teflon. And the fascinating universe of two-part adhesives. Or how he unpacks the complexities involved in brewing the perfect cup of tea, as it involves striking the right balance of temperature (too low and the flavour molecules in the tea won't dissolve; too high and many of the tannins and polyphenols that give a bitter taste and astringency will also dissolve), timing (to ensure the perfect balance of the different kinds of volatiles), compared to the (relative) ease of making a decent cup of coffee.And the marvels of how soap works - that when you mix fat with an alkali (like ash water), the alkali transforms the fat molecules into hybrid molecules with a charged head that dissolves in water and a carbon tail that dissolves in fats. The carbon tails of hybrid soap molecules embed themselves in fat blobs, creating a charged surface with their heads that can dissolve in water. Thus allowing the fat blob to be washed away. [Fascinating factoids: Egg is the surfactant in mayonnaise, allowing the oil and water in mayo to bind. It's like soap in that respect and you can use egg yolk to clean your hair. P&G invented Ivory Soap and part of its marketing strategy was to sponsor serial dramas targeting housewives at home during the day. Hence the name 'soap opera'.]Like Stuff Matters, Liquid is very accessibly written, even for the science phobe. But unlike Stuff Matters, the conceit of Liquid - to wrap the material science within the larger narrative arc of Miodownik's flight, and his interactions with his fellow passenger, Susan - is distracting. Miodownik's attempts at humour - the disgust he evokes when he falls asleep and drools on Susan, when he sneezes on another passenger, when he obsesses about why the inflight safety video remains silent on the largest hazard of all, the fact that they will be in the air with thousands of gallons of combustible fuel - are pedestrian and awkward. For Stuff Matters, I'd felt that the sections where Miodownik tried to jazz things up a bit, to perhaps take a more creative treatment of the topic fell flat. Like when he discussed porcelain in the context of his parents' wedding tea set. The main thing here is really the fascinating science of liquids but Miodownik sometimes seems to forget this. Still, this is a fairly minor complaint in what is overall, a fun and fascinating read. "
223,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66635467-keen,4,"“Liquids have a duality: they are neither a gas nor solid, but something in-between. They are exciting and powerful, on the one hand, while being anarchic and slightly terrifying on the other.” Travelling on a trans-Atlantic flight from London to San Francisco, Miodownik uses a number of observations and thoughts as creative jumping off points to get into some whimsical and fascinating territory throughout the journey.This is a largely, but not always accessible investigation of sorts into some of the many liquids that most of us will encounter in our daily lives. A quirky odyssey loaded with lots of colourful facts and trivia to pull out down the pub or indeed any social occasion. I had no idea that the de Havilland Mosquito bomber used during WWII was made of plywood, which made it the fastest aircraft in the sky or that we use around 16 billion litres of oil every day throughout the world.Apparently there is 150’000 litres of kerosene stored in a jumbo jet (50’000 in the fuel tank below your feet and another 50’000 stored in each wing). And yet you could throw a lit match at it and it wouldn’t ignite. But mix it with the right amount of oxygen and it suddenly becomes an oil ten times as powerful as nitroglycerine.He talks about the crucial difference between ethanol and methanol, pure methanol can cause permanent blindness. Your body metabolises it into formic acid and formaldehyde. Formic acid attacks nerve cells, especially the optic nerve, hence the saying ‘blind drunk’. It also goes after your liver and kidneys and can cause permanent damage. Three glasses of it will kill you.Miodownik explains why drinking wine is a multi-sensory experience, and how more often than not many people enjoy paying for the brand more than the experience, “Some people love having the most expensive cars, they get real enjoyment out of what that says about them as a person. It’s the same with wines. But this doesn’t mean that these are better wines or better cars, or even that the owners are more sophisticated people.” He cites the experiments that managed to fool so called ‘wine experts’ that convinced them that they were drinking white wine, but thanks to a flavourless red dye they got suckered into describing it in detail as a red wine.He also covers many more interesting topics from 3-D printing, the humble yet fascinating biro pen and even the wonderful properties of tar and asphalt, he talks of the pitch drop experiment set up in 1927 by Prof Thomas Parnell at the University of Queensland, the first drop fell in 1938, the second in 1947, the third in 1954 and the ninth and most recent drop fell in 2014.One of the minor pitfalls in this book is that occasionally some of the topics get a little tedious and there are too many complex and bewildering diagrams of molecular structures for my taste, but that is sure to appeal to science and chemistry buffs alike, but you don’t have to study or understand them to enjoy the book.This reminded me of Paul Vanhoenacker’s “Skyfaring” (the book is mentioned in the further reading section). This book relies on a format used repeatedly by the likes of Gavin Francis, Alain de Botton and many others, which takes everyday subjects, and makes them relatively accessible, whilst allowing us to view seemingly mundane objects with a renewed sense of wonder. It’s a style that peppers the book with helpful and occasionally light-hearted images and the books are never too long. It’s a format that I happen to enjoy and it’s clearly a popular one too."
224,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20280886-sarah-smith,3,"More often than I care to admit my wee brain gets a bit overwhelmed and when this happens I tend to look for things that are objective as opposed to subjective. And it sort of gives me a break. Today’s break came in the form of a popular science book (Side note, I LOVE books classed as popular science) called Liquids by Mark Miodownik. Oddly enough it is a book about Liquids, from tea to superliquid Helium, kerosene and ink, the sea to lava. A whole plethora of them each with their own weird, dangerous and fascinating properties. And were it has the potential to be an excellent book it falls a little short. The major issue I had is how Miodownik frames the narrative. He is on a flight from London to San Francisco and he introduces the different liquids in an increasingly strained and conceited way related to this flight. This quickly starts to grate, the tone of these bits is sort of akin to an over enthusiastic kids TV presenter who has forgotten they are on Newsnight and are talking to Kirsty Wark as opposed to a group of pubescent children. But although I’ve started with the bad, it almost redeems itself as there is much to interest. I was born in 1986 and all I remember from primary school (we shall not read in to why I remember so little) concerns the Gulf War, an oil spill, and the ozone layer having a massive whole in it. And it was only in reading this I realised why in primary school we where told all about the whole in the ozone, as it was around this time the world realised the damage CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons) had done to the ozone, CFCs where used in refrigerators as a coolant, as they were seemingly harmless and inert, and then everyone realised this was not the case. It was actually the same fella responsible for this that said lead in petrol was safe too, so he’s not so much the greatest really. Apart from learning about coolants used in refrigerators, you also get to learn about so many things you would never stop to consider. How the ink in biros work, can you tell the difference between red and white wine if you cant see them (I to be fair would struggle to distinguish either from vinegar), why Eastenders is a soap, how ships float, and planes fly, that roads to a certain extent are self healing on account of the viscosity of tar(tar is actually a liquid, just a million times as viscous as peanut butter) man made clouds (Russia uses them every May to make sure May Day celebrations are rain free, the little rascals) also just you know clouds in general. It’s almost a history of the world told via the scientific progress concerning liquids that are often vital to our existence without us really ever thinking too much about them. Despite all of this I was left feeling a little short changed. It is possible I expect too much, I’ve been spoiled by books such as those written by Simon Singh (Fermats last theorem, Big Bang) or Sam Kean’s The Disappearing Spoon which have a more consistent tone, and I found to captivate me more, but just because these are better doesn’t make Liquids bad, just not as good as I had hoped. Mostly it suffers from how he introduces the liquids in each instance, and I know I’ve written about how it is interesting but like an under seasoned soup there wasn’t quite enough of the interesting. It felt a little padded in parts and too much time was spent on irrelevant personal anecdotes. Sadly not nearly as good as it could have been."
225,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4137725-phoebe,5,"Right now I'm experiencing that 4pm listlessness. It's either coffee or nap. Resistance is futile. No one is productive at 4pm. So here I am, writing about a book about liquids instead of...never you mind.Liquid Rules: The Delightful and Dangerous Substances That Flowed Through Our Lives (2020) is Mark Miodownik's follow-up to Stuff Matters: The Strange Stories of the Marvellous Materials that Shape Our Man-made World (2014), which won the 2014 Royal Society Winton Prize for Science books and the 2015 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Communication Award. I didn’t know either awards existed but they seem relevant and most likely well-deserved because it is so, so easy to commend the quality of his writing.I wouldn’t say Liquid Rules bears epistemological significance. But you don’t read a book about liquids because you think there’s some quintessential knowledge you’re missing. You read it because you passed year 12 chemistry and now you can have that moment of vainglory realising you didn’t memorise chemical compounds and equations for nothing because you actually understand what an actual scientist gasp is saying. HA. Just kidding. I liked the title and thought it sounded unusual and entertaining. More importantly, I knew it wasn’t gonna be emotionally taxing. The kind of tension I’ve been experiencing has been unreal and I can’t explain why I’m so tense. I blame it on animal crossing which is meant to be a relaxing game but my perfectionism is ruining it for me. (Why can’t I place THIS bush next to THIS rock?!) In any case, I need something breezy but not fluffy.What makes Liquid Rules entertaining is how casual Miodownik sounds. The entire book is structured around Miodownik’s flight to San Francisco where he is to attend a scientific conference. As he is going through customs and security, he muses on what makes peanut butter a liquid and not a solid according to airline regulations. As the plane is taking off, he considers the discovery of kerosene in the premodern era and the incredible fact that no one knew its awesome power. Then mid-flight, he provides an endless stream of anecdotes about the terrifying power of storm clouds (when the plane experiences turbulence), why he prefers soap bars over liquid soap (when he goes to the bathroom), why we find snot disgusting (when curry dribbles down his chin), why the invention of biro was a complex problem with a surprisingly simple solution (when he signs the arrival card), and finally, the future when we can store man-made data like digital photographs inside droplets of liquid (as he arrives at the scientific conference). It feels like you’re flying and you’re listening in to all the amusing did-you-knows as the person next to you chatters on about the marvellous things we’re seeing. All in all, it’s like being offered a gaze into a secret network of things, where whaling in the nineteenth century is somehow related to the rise of the soap industry which is also related to the creation of soap opera during morning hours. The connective ‘thingness’ of life is suddenly made apparent and it is a wondrous sight. The world is a connected place. It’s connected by the seeping, oozing, dripping and molten liquids that flow in and out of us, around us, beneath us, and above us. Humans are 60% water and our planet is 70% water. We are living in an aqueous state on an aqueous planet, so it’s almost self-deceiving to think the world around us is solid and concrete when our body is formed in amniotic fluids and ends with being decomposed into minerals, water and gas. And isn’t it just the strangest thing to think one day, instead of relying on computers that speak in 0s and 1s, we will have biochemical computation that takes place on a molecular level? Yep. Mind blown. "
226,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109535466-mike-parkes,4,"Entertaining but scattered book describing the chemistry and applications of assorted liquids. I think this goes by different names in North America and Europe – the version I have is just titled “Liquid”. Lots of interesting details, and Miodownik is an entertaining and informative writer. However, the choice of liquids and their properties is random, with the organizing principle of the book being liquids one comes across on a flight (or is otherwise impacted by, e.g. clouds). The connecting interludes between chapters become annoying quite early on in the book (e.g. a trip to the lavatory provides the opportunity to discuss soaps and cleaning products). By the end, you’re left with a pastiche of chapters on different topics, some enlightening, some less so, but not a good grasp on liquids as a whole. A strong introductory chapter on the properties of liquids would really have helped. Not quite as good as Miodownik’s “Stuff Matters” which was similar in format but dealt with common solid materials (primarily structural).A few chapters I enjoyed in “Liquid” were:•	How the volatility and flash point of hydrocarbon liquids such as kerosene (jet fuel) and oils affected their use in lighting and energy products (ch 1)•	Glues, liquids that change to solids and form permanent bonds (ch 4). •	Refrigeration and air conditioning, from liquids that boil near room temperature, enabling them to transfer a large amount of heat through phase changes (ch 9).•	Pen inks, and the engineering and chemistry of designing a pen with ink that will flow on the page and turn into a solid without making a mess (ch 10).Other chapters deal with the intoxicating properties of alcohols (ch 2), the properties of the ocean (ch 3), liquid crystal displays (ch 5), bodily fluids (ch 6), the chemistry of tea and coffee (ch 7), soaps and detergents (ch 8), clouds (ch 11), the slow flow of ice and rocks on the earrh’s surface (ch 12), and sustainable materials such as self-healing asphalt (ch 13)."
227,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90301926-kaj,2,"You might think that “Liquid Rules” is about the science of liquids. Don’t be fooled. It’s actually one long kinda cringy story about Mark Miodownik’s flying experience, with some chemistry asides.I loved Miodownik’s previous book, “Stuff Matters,” where he explains how the big properties of everyday materials come from their chemical structure. Why are alloys sometimes stronger than the metals they’re made from? What does it mean to be conductive? Miodownik keeps his explanations simple and mechanistic, aided by small hand-drawn doodles. Unlike many other pop sci books, “Stuff Matters” never falls into the trap of focusing too much on what is important to know, rather than what’s interesting and informative. The info:tainment ratio is good- accessible enough for high school level students while still interesting for scientists. Sure, he sprinkles in some occasionally boring personal anecdotes, but every materials chem book would benefit from a few breathers.“Liquid Rules” doubles down on the bad parts of “Stuff Matters” while forgetting what made it great. Each chapter focuses on a different liquid. A major part of the book is trying to relate each liquid to something that happens on a single trans-Atlantic flight. This plot device seems to be an attempt to make the liquid chemistry seem useful by relating it to real-world phenomena, but the cumulative effect is the opposite. Too much time spent on why these chemicals are important, and not enough on why they’re interesting, mixed with long personal anecdotes and scientist biographies that are neither important nor interesting. For a book about fluids, “Liquid Rules” is just a little bit too dry."
228,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4261166-marshall,5,"I love the way Mark Miodownik writes. He addresses subjects that are seemingly boring (if you say it out loud like when I told my girlfriend I was reading about glue, and tape, and tvs) and opens up the mystery entirely, sparking a fascinating world of chemical wonder. His rhetoric and storytelling can deliver the scientific details in an easily digestible manner without using any scientific tools such as graphs, charts, and data sheets, only rudimentary drawings (which helped a whole lot and were very welcome enterprises). I was tremendously inspired by this book and every single chapter tapped into a childlike awe of the materials of the world around me. I learned and relearned many aspects of earth science and things I've only imagined. Honestly, I wish someone like a teacher or mentor would have been able to put this book in my hands when I was in early high school because I believe it may have changed the trajectory of my life. I might have sought out a career in material science. So, since that obviously didn't happen seeing how he wrote this book in the recent decade, I will be sure to pass it along to a young friend or a deer friend's young adult. In any case, this book just goes to show that there is ALWAYS something to marvel at, even if you find yourself experiencing a bit of ennui. Just walk outside and check out a flower or if you're stuck inside pick up a pen and peer a little bit closer into all that makes it possible. Absolutely LOVED both of Miodownik's books. I will be buying these two and looking forward to the next one (please write another!)!"
229,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92179113-patrick-green,4,"I typically associate scientists with tall guys in lab coats. Careful, fastidious, and, when in the lab, organized. I know this is a crude generalization, but there is certainly a nugget of truth to this statement. The scientist of this book, Mark Miodownik, should have kept this nugget of truth in mind when he was writing this book. ""Liquid Rules"" is messy and disjointed, primarily because of the framework that Miodownik uses to explain the properties and everyday uses of certain liquids. This made the reading experience for myself at times boring. I cared more for his explanations on the properties of tea, coffee, and ink for example than I did for kerosene or soap. I also did not care for his tangents. I was mostly looking for information on how certain liquids, or liquids in general, function. I did not care much to hear about his trip from England to San Francisco. It was a very plain framework. The details surrounding this framework, the scientific extrapolations on liquids, propelled my interest.I enjoyed the information on the liquids that Miodownik provided. I also relished some of the historical background of these liquids. They taught some valuable conclusions that I should make on certain liquids. For example, I can definitively say that I am a coffee drinker, not a tea drinker. And now I have scientific evidence to support my subjective opinion. Thank you, Miodownik.The last pleasant note that I found on the book was the laid back pace. I felt as though I could read it on a nice Sunday afternoon while also getting some mental exercise. Despite how messy and boring the framework was, it's a very enjoyable book to read, and I would recommend it."
230,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1109379-colette,3,"“Liquids are the alter ego of dependable solid stuff. Whereas solid materials are humanity’s faithful friend, taking on the permanent shapes of clothes, shoes, phones, cars, and indeed airports, liquids are fluid; they will take on any shape, but only while contained. When they’re not contained, they are always on the move, seeping, corroding, dripping, and escaping our control. If you put a solid material somewhere, it stays there—barring forcible removal—often doing something very useful, like holding up a building or supplying electricity for a whole community. Liquids, on the other hand, are anarchic: they have a knack for destroying things. In a bathroom, for instance, it is a constant battle to keep water from seeping into cracks and pooling under the floor, where it gets up to no good, rotting and undermining the wooden joists; on a smooth tile floor, water is the perfect slip hazard, causing an enormous number of injuries; and when it gathers in the corners of the bathroom, it can harbor black slimy fungus and bacteria, which threaten to infiltrate our bodies and make us sick. And yet, despite all this treachery, we love the stuff; we love bathing in water, and showering in it, drenching the whole body. And what bathroom is complete without a cornucopia of bottled liquid soaps, shampoos, and conditioners, jars of cream, and tubes of toothpaste? We delight in these miraculous liquids and yet we worry about them too: Are they bad for us? Do they cause cancer? Do they ruin the environment? With liquids, delight and suspicion go hand in hand. They are duplicitous by nature, neither a gas nor a solid but something in between, something inscrutable and mysterious.”"
231,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83179136-catherine-puma,4,"I was delighted when I saw Miodownik was coming out with another book. Having enjoyed his ""Stuff Matters"", I acquired ""Liquid Rules"" and was not disappointed. Framed by the narrative device of observing liquids around him while flying from Britain to California, Miodownik describes oceans, glaciers, clouds, wine, saliva, droplets in the pressurized cabin, tea, coffee, blood... to name a few. I learned so much! As a result, I found myself not just noticing all the liquids I encounter in my life, but also contemplating what properties they have in relation to one another. This included pondering the process of converting my bar of solid soap into a liquid substance by interacting it with water, another liquid. Miodownik's section on hand soap vs. liquid soap (and his preference for the former) was thus especially interesting. My only quibble with this work was its lack of acknowledging its own limitations. The subtitle implies that ""dangerous"" liquids would also be discussed, but--with the exception of mercury--the diversity of naturally occurring toxins and poisons are not mentioned. Of course it is unrealistic to expect such a short work to touch upon everything, but I wish there was more of a ""there's so much more to learn and discuss"" preface and/or conclusion. That being said, this was extremely eye opening, as ""Stuff Matters"" was, and I will be recommending it to many. This is a great way to inspire a natural curiosity for the natural observation of fluid dynamics. I can even see myself re-reading it again! "
232,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/964960-george,4,"As with his earlier Stuff Matters: Exploring the Marvelous Materials That Shape Our Man-Made World, Miodownik selects a convenient frame in which to hang his description of various types of liquids and the ways in which they affect our lives. In this case, it's a transatlantic flight from London to San Francisco, giving him the opportunity to reflect on, among other things, the hot beverages served by the flight attendants, refrigeration systems, the glue that holds the plane's wings to the fuselage, and of course the large body of water over which he flies. Like most popular books about science, there are parts that are going to be overly simplistic for experts, or even knowledgeable non-experts, but Miodownik is among the group of writers who, I think, manages to strike the right balance. The framework is contrived, yes, but it has also helped me to retain a fair amount of what was discussed, and I found myself thinking about it on my own flight to California (especially the part about the glue...). My only real criticism is that his observations of his seatmate, Susan, while in the name of setting us up for a reveal later on, came off as a bit creepy at times. "
233,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/190448-karen,4,"If you're into science, this book is a gem.It's written by a material scientist and the story is told on a flight from London to San Francisco, ostensibly focusing on all the liquids on board but it's really just a premise to tell the stories he wants to tell. The fact that he was on board a flight was cute but seemed contrived a bit at parts. But I didn't really care because the science and stories were super interesting to me. This book has 12 chapters, each chapter focusing on a different substance like glue, ink, etc. I loved the bits about how candles work and how the wick pulls water up against the force of gravity. I learned about how the World Trade Centers buckled due to the strength of the steel decreasing under such high heat and then putting pressure on the lower floors, etc. And how flavor is a multi-sensory experience (and how we assume and 'can taste' flavors related to the color.) I also loved reading how icarus story wouldn't be possible because it gets colder when you fly higher :) I loved learning about ballpoint pens and how they work (and how amazing they are!!) and about tar and all the interesting new innovations they are making to help the roads last longer.There is just so much fascinating science in this book. Highly enjoyable. thanks to netgalley for an advanced copy in exchange for an honest review."
234,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7273557-gary,3," Mark Miodownik book Liquid Rules takes the reader on a transatlantic flight from London to San Francisco. His profession is in materials. The security line examining for liquids and then the pre-flight safety lecture triggers in him what liquids are we talking about? For one, the jet you are flying in is really a bomb, full of kerosene. After getting you all panicked about ever flying again, there is talk of alcohol, tea, coffee, soaps, ketchup, and many other items. His explanations are very readable and when he traces inventions, it makes the subject matter come alive.The book is told in sections, divided by the type of liquids he encounters along the way. He leads an interesting discussion about why the liquids are different and how various liquids you would not associate are similar. I found that after about the fifth chapter of this, I was getting a bit overwhelmed with the detail of explanation-I usually find details like he presents as interesting. So I am not sure why this bugs me. I would chalk it up to the reader more than the writer.I would recommend this book. But if you do read the book, try taking the book in smaller chunks rather than as a book to read straight through.For more of my thoughts, please see my book blog."
235,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"Mark Miodownik explores the mundanely marvelous liquids that make up our lives in the framework of a transatlantic flight from London to San Francisco with Liquid Rules. Liquid Rules explores the different aspects of liquids as they relate to making our lives easier. Take Kerosene as an example. Kerosene was first discovered back in 900 CE or around that century by an Arabic Alchemist and Scholar. The only problem was that Olive Oil was preferred for lamps since the government could tax it.Miodownik goes over a great many subjects and ideas. He writes about distillation, flashpoints, chemical structures, and so much more. The book reminds me a bit of Gravity’s Rainbow with all of the different information that the author stuffs into the pages, but this book is far more accessible.There are a lot of different things that Miodownik brings to your attention. Think of the humble candle as a great example. It might seem easy to understand, but there is a lot of physics going on to make sure that a candle works properly. Another thing to think about is as simple as a ballpoint pen. Even the ink had to be engineered for the proper viscosity and binding properties.I will probably search for Miodownik’s other books like Stuff Matters, assuming I haven’t read them already. "
236,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102314750-sam,0,"Liquid Rules is a book that examines in the depth the relationships between various liquids and how they affect our world. Traveling between London, San Francisco, and on the plane ride between, Mark Miodownik teaches us the surprising truth of how reliant we are as a people on liquids. While diving into the mechanical sciences of things, often discussing liquids in regards to thermal properties, the 2nd law of thermodynamics, and quantum relationships, he doesn't become completely absorbed in this writing remembering to include more colloquial evaluations. These reviews, often revolve around a specific liquids contribution to society, the history of how it was created (or found, and how it may be revolutionized in the future, and provides a sense balance and completion to his writing. Unlike many scientists who often thrive and exploit the mysticism (or more correctly lack of education) around their work to make themselves more interesting Mark Miodownik takes pride in his humanity, often talking about how his work around liquids stems from the want to learn. Overall, Liquid Rules is a unique book, that relays with humor and wit how the science, history, and properties of many liquids bear a pivotal role in the development of our modern industrialized society."
237,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40472466-dan,5,"Once again, after Stuff Matters, Mark Miodownik brings about the joy of acknowledging the material matters around us. It is an excellent book if you want to follow the meandering thoughts of the author.""Liquids have a duality: they are neither a gas nor a solid, but something in between. They are exciting and powerful, on the one hand, while anarchic and slightly terrifying on the other. That is their nature.""The liquid is a core part of what makes us living beings, how we interact with the world. Earth's molten-metal liquid core creates a magnetic field that protects water from being dried up due to the solar wind. We wouldn't have a vast amount of water in the sea without the core.Our energy source is often in a liquid form, e.g., whale oil, gasoline, kerosene, diesel. Some explosives are in liquid form like nitroglycerin, which is the reason why a certain amount of liquid is not allowed to carry on planes.Of course, we drink water, alcohol (ethanol, not methanol), wine, coffee, and tea. Our body is also mostly liquid. Our saliva helps us digest, kills pain, and protects us from bacterias (and bad breath). We cry and drop tears. We put on perfumes (methanol). We clean using soap.We watch (LCD: liquid crystal displays).Look up and see clouds? They are liquid too.The author tells these stories while he takes a flight to his conference. His perspectives are refreshing especially since flying is one of the worst experiences that I have to endure. It is cramped. There is an invisible tension over the armrest. The middle seat gets the two, does anyone disagree? The air is too dry. Food is usually horrible if served. A trip to the bathroom is bothersome. Now I know what to do. Order coffee instead of tea. Sleep without drooling. Watch movies which I would enjoy more. Last but not least, appreciate liquids!"
238,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48901937-kyle-dinges,4,"Liquid Rules by Mark Miodownik is a book that looks at some of the most important liquids that society depends on and gives a bit of a brief background on their chemical makeup and how they were created or discovered. It is easily accessible, which is something I usually look for in non-fiction about science. Like his first book, Stuff Matters, Miodownik has a knack for writing about complex scientific ideas in a way that are easy for the lay person to understand. He sprinkles in plenty of humor to keep things lively and never drones on for too long about one subject. The idea to use an airplane ride to introduce each liquid, and demonstrate their abundance in life, was a good way to present each liquid in a logical order and talk about real life applications. All of this just serves to make the book more entertaining and interesting. There's a delicate balance to making a book like this informative and entertaining, and Miodownik does a good job in that regard.Someone looking for a more expansive an in depth text might be a bit let down, but for someone just looking for an entertaining ""pop-science"" read, I think this book more than fits the bill."
239,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12527649-kristin,4,"Generally speaking, this was a good overview of various properties of liquids, how we interact with them, and how they affect us. It took an extremely broad area of knowledge and made it understandable (and enjoyable!) for the semi-layperson. I especially enjoyed the chapter on saliva (weird, I know, but it was of professional interest haha). I also enjoyed the chapter on tea, coffee, and other beverages. The reason I knocked a star off of my review is because the author often says “double blind studies have shown...” or “studies have shown...” but does not cite these studies or sources. There is a “further reading” section at the end of the book, but none of the resources are linked to the specific claims presented in the main body. I know this is supposed to be a general overview, but if sources are claimed, they should be cited. This normally wouldn’t bug me so much, but I would actually like to read some of those studies.... (including the one mentioned in the cooling chapter, where the author talks about perfluorocarbons as a substitute for blood and the subsequent clinical trials). IT’S BREATHABLE LIQUID. Doesn’t that sound like some worthwhile further reading?"

252,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,4,"I'd really enjoyed Miodownik's Stuff Matters, on the science of different solid materials like glass, metal, concrete and graphite, and was excited that he had a book on liquids. Whereas Stuff Matters covered the materials that Miodownik presumably found the most fascinating and significant in terms of daily life, the conceit for Liquid is the different kinds of liquids Miodownik encounters on a flight - oils, alcohol, water, glue, liquid crystals, saliva, tea and coffee, soap, refrigerants, ink, clouds, magma and tar (the latter two signifying the end of his journey when the plane lands). In Liquid, Miodownik weaves a fascinating narrative that draws from chemistry, physics, science history, earth science, to name a few. It's full of fascinating nuggets. Like why it is dangerous to consume home brews or alcohol-based liquids for a cheap high because the methanol in them hasn't been removed; methanol is metabolised into formic acid and formaldehyde in the body, where the formic acid attacks your nerve cells, especially the optic nerve, leaving you blind (hence the expression 'blind drunk'). Like how it is rubber that gives Post-It Notes their stickiness; the notes have an adhesive layer of rubber on them where the microscopic spheres of rubber bond tightly to the note but create only a small adhesive force when pressed onto a surface. Or that sticky tape has three layers, a bottom layer of adhesive, a middle layer of cellophane for strength and transparency and a top layer of non-stick material like Teflon. And the fascinating universe of two-part adhesives. Or how he unpacks the complexities involved in brewing the perfect cup of tea, as it involves striking the right balance of temperature (too low and the flavour molecules in the tea won't dissolve; too high and many of the tannins and polyphenols that give a bitter taste and astringency will also dissolve), timing (to ensure the perfect balance of the different kinds of volatiles), compared to the (relative) ease of making a decent cup of coffee.And the marvels of how soap works - that when you mix fat with an alkali (like ash water), the alkali transforms the fat molecules into hybrid molecules with a charged head that dissolves in water and a carbon tail that dissolves in fats. The carbon tails of hybrid soap molecules embed themselves in fat blobs, creating a charged surface with their heads that can dissolve in water. Thus allowing the fat blob to be washed away. [Fascinating factoids: Egg is the surfactant in mayonnaise, allowing the oil and water in mayo to bind. It's like soap in that respect and you can use egg yolk to clean your hair. P&G invented Ivory Soap and part of its marketing strategy was to sponsor serial dramas targeting housewives at home during the day. Hence the name 'soap opera'.]Like Stuff Matters, Liquid is very accessibly written, even for the science phobe. But unlike Stuff Matters, the conceit of Liquid - to wrap the material science within the larger narrative arc of Miodownik's flight, and his interactions with his fellow passenger, Susan - is distracting. Miodownik's attempts at humour - the disgust he evokes when he falls asleep and drools on Susan, when he sneezes on another passenger, when he obsesses about why the inflight safety video remains silent on the largest hazard of all, the fact that they will be in the air with thousands of gallons of combustible fuel - are pedestrian and awkward. For Stuff Matters, I'd felt that the sections where Miodownik tried to jazz things up a bit, to perhaps take a more creative treatment of the topic fell flat. Like when he discussed porcelain in the context of his parents' wedding tea set. The main thing here is really the fascinating science of liquids but Miodownik sometimes seems to forget this. Still, this is a fairly minor complaint in what is overall, a fun and fascinating read. "
253,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66635467-keen,4,"“Liquids have a duality: they are neither a gas nor solid, but something in-between. They are exciting and powerful, on the one hand, while being anarchic and slightly terrifying on the other.” Travelling on a trans-Atlantic flight from London to San Francisco, Miodownik uses a number of observations and thoughts as creative jumping off points to get into some whimsical and fascinating territory throughout the journey.This is a largely, but not always accessible investigation of sorts into some of the many liquids that most of us will encounter in our daily lives. A quirky odyssey loaded with lots of colourful facts and trivia to pull out down the pub or indeed any social occasion. I had no idea that the de Havilland Mosquito bomber used during WWII was made of plywood, which made it the fastest aircraft in the sky or that we use around 16 billion litres of oil every day throughout the world.Apparently there is 150’000 litres of kerosene stored in a jumbo jet (50’000 in the fuel tank below your feet and another 50’000 stored in each wing). And yet you could throw a lit match at it and it wouldn’t ignite. But mix it with the right amount of oxygen and it suddenly becomes an oil ten times as powerful as nitroglycerine.He talks about the crucial difference between ethanol and methanol, pure methanol can cause permanent blindness. Your body metabolises it into formic acid and formaldehyde. Formic acid attacks nerve cells, especially the optic nerve, hence the saying ‘blind drunk’. It also goes after your liver and kidneys and can cause permanent damage. Three glasses of it will kill you.Miodownik explains why drinking wine is a multi-sensory experience, and how more often than not many people enjoy paying for the brand more than the experience, “Some people love having the most expensive cars, they get real enjoyment out of what that says about them as a person. It’s the same with wines. But this doesn’t mean that these are better wines or better cars, or even that the owners are more sophisticated people.” He cites the experiments that managed to fool so called ‘wine experts’ that convinced them that they were drinking white wine, but thanks to a flavourless red dye they got suckered into describing it in detail as a red wine.He also covers many more interesting topics from 3-D printing, the humble yet fascinating biro pen and even the wonderful properties of tar and asphalt, he talks of the pitch drop experiment set up in 1927 by Prof Thomas Parnell at the University of Queensland, the first drop fell in 1938, the second in 1947, the third in 1954 and the ninth and most recent drop fell in 2014.One of the minor pitfalls in this book is that occasionally some of the topics get a little tedious and there are too many complex and bewildering diagrams of molecular structures for my taste, but that is sure to appeal to science and chemistry buffs alike, but you don’t have to study or understand them to enjoy the book.This reminded me of Paul Vanhoenacker’s “Skyfaring” (the book is mentioned in the further reading section). This book relies on a format used repeatedly by the likes of Gavin Francis, Alain de Botton and many others, which takes everyday subjects, and makes them relatively accessible, whilst allowing us to view seemingly mundane objects with a renewed sense of wonder. It’s a style that peppers the book with helpful and occasionally light-hearted images and the books are never too long. It’s a format that I happen to enjoy and it’s clearly a popular one too."
254,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20280886-sarah-smith,3,"More often than I care to admit my wee brain gets a bit overwhelmed and when this happens I tend to look for things that are objective as opposed to subjective. And it sort of gives me a break. Today’s break came in the form of a popular science book (Side note, I LOVE books classed as popular science) called Liquids by Mark Miodownik. Oddly enough it is a book about Liquids, from tea to superliquid Helium, kerosene and ink, the sea to lava. A whole plethora of them each with their own weird, dangerous and fascinating properties. And were it has the potential to be an excellent book it falls a little short. The major issue I had is how Miodownik frames the narrative. He is on a flight from London to San Francisco and he introduces the different liquids in an increasingly strained and conceited way related to this flight. This quickly starts to grate, the tone of these bits is sort of akin to an over enthusiastic kids TV presenter who has forgotten they are on Newsnight and are talking to Kirsty Wark as opposed to a group of pubescent children. But although I’ve started with the bad, it almost redeems itself as there is much to interest. I was born in 1986 and all I remember from primary school (we shall not read in to why I remember so little) concerns the Gulf War, an oil spill, and the ozone layer having a massive whole in it. And it was only in reading this I realised why in primary school we where told all about the whole in the ozone, as it was around this time the world realised the damage CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons) had done to the ozone, CFCs where used in refrigerators as a coolant, as they were seemingly harmless and inert, and then everyone realised this was not the case. It was actually the same fella responsible for this that said lead in petrol was safe too, so he’s not so much the greatest really. Apart from learning about coolants used in refrigerators, you also get to learn about so many things you would never stop to consider. How the ink in biros work, can you tell the difference between red and white wine if you cant see them (I to be fair would struggle to distinguish either from vinegar), why Eastenders is a soap, how ships float, and planes fly, that roads to a certain extent are self healing on account of the viscosity of tar(tar is actually a liquid, just a million times as viscous as peanut butter) man made clouds (Russia uses them every May to make sure May Day celebrations are rain free, the little rascals) also just you know clouds in general. It’s almost a history of the world told via the scientific progress concerning liquids that are often vital to our existence without us really ever thinking too much about them. Despite all of this I was left feeling a little short changed. It is possible I expect too much, I’ve been spoiled by books such as those written by Simon Singh (Fermats last theorem, Big Bang) or Sam Kean’s The Disappearing Spoon which have a more consistent tone, and I found to captivate me more, but just because these are better doesn’t make Liquids bad, just not as good as I had hoped. Mostly it suffers from how he introduces the liquids in each instance, and I know I’ve written about how it is interesting but like an under seasoned soup there wasn’t quite enough of the interesting. It felt a little padded in parts and too much time was spent on irrelevant personal anecdotes. Sadly not nearly as good as it could have been."
255,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4137725-phoebe,5,"Right now I'm experiencing that 4pm listlessness. It's either coffee or nap. Resistance is futile. No one is productive at 4pm. So here I am, writing about a book about liquids instead of...never you mind.Liquid Rules: The Delightful and Dangerous Substances That Flowed Through Our Lives (2020) is Mark Miodownik's follow-up to Stuff Matters: The Strange Stories of the Marvellous Materials that Shape Our Man-made World (2014), which won the 2014 Royal Society Winton Prize for Science books and the 2015 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Communication Award. I didn’t know either awards existed but they seem relevant and most likely well-deserved because it is so, so easy to commend the quality of his writing.I wouldn’t say Liquid Rules bears epistemological significance. But you don’t read a book about liquids because you think there’s some quintessential knowledge you’re missing. You read it because you passed year 12 chemistry and now you can have that moment of vainglory realising you didn’t memorise chemical compounds and equations for nothing because you actually understand what an actual scientist gasp is saying. HA. Just kidding. I liked the title and thought it sounded unusual and entertaining. More importantly, I knew it wasn’t gonna be emotionally taxing. The kind of tension I’ve been experiencing has been unreal and I can’t explain why I’m so tense. I blame it on animal crossing which is meant to be a relaxing game but my perfectionism is ruining it for me. (Why can’t I place THIS bush next to THIS rock?!) In any case, I need something breezy but not fluffy.What makes Liquid Rules entertaining is how casual Miodownik sounds. The entire book is structured around Miodownik’s flight to San Francisco where he is to attend a scientific conference. As he is going through customs and security, he muses on what makes peanut butter a liquid and not a solid according to airline regulations. As the plane is taking off, he considers the discovery of kerosene in the premodern era and the incredible fact that no one knew its awesome power. Then mid-flight, he provides an endless stream of anecdotes about the terrifying power of storm clouds (when the plane experiences turbulence), why he prefers soap bars over liquid soap (when he goes to the bathroom), why we find snot disgusting (when curry dribbles down his chin), why the invention of biro was a complex problem with a surprisingly simple solution (when he signs the arrival card), and finally, the future when we can store man-made data like digital photographs inside droplets of liquid (as he arrives at the scientific conference). It feels like you’re flying and you’re listening in to all the amusing did-you-knows as the person next to you chatters on about the marvellous things we’re seeing. All in all, it’s like being offered a gaze into a secret network of things, where whaling in the nineteenth century is somehow related to the rise of the soap industry which is also related to the creation of soap opera during morning hours. The connective ‘thingness’ of life is suddenly made apparent and it is a wondrous sight. The world is a connected place. It’s connected by the seeping, oozing, dripping and molten liquids that flow in and out of us, around us, beneath us, and above us. Humans are 60% water and our planet is 70% water. We are living in an aqueous state on an aqueous planet, so it’s almost self-deceiving to think the world around us is solid and concrete when our body is formed in amniotic fluids and ends with being decomposed into minerals, water and gas. And isn’t it just the strangest thing to think one day, instead of relying on computers that speak in 0s and 1s, we will have biochemical computation that takes place on a molecular level? Yep. Mind blown. "
256,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109535466-mike-parkes,4,"Entertaining but scattered book describing the chemistry and applications of assorted liquids. I think this goes by different names in North America and Europe – the version I have is just titled “Liquid”. Lots of interesting details, and Miodownik is an entertaining and informative writer. However, the choice of liquids and their properties is random, with the organizing principle of the book being liquids one comes across on a flight (or is otherwise impacted by, e.g. clouds). The connecting interludes between chapters become annoying quite early on in the book (e.g. a trip to the lavatory provides the opportunity to discuss soaps and cleaning products). By the end, you’re left with a pastiche of chapters on different topics, some enlightening, some less so, but not a good grasp on liquids as a whole. A strong introductory chapter on the properties of liquids would really have helped. Not quite as good as Miodownik’s “Stuff Matters” which was similar in format but dealt with common solid materials (primarily structural).A few chapters I enjoyed in “Liquid” were:•	How the volatility and flash point of hydrocarbon liquids such as kerosene (jet fuel) and oils affected their use in lighting and energy products (ch 1)•	Glues, liquids that change to solids and form permanent bonds (ch 4). •	Refrigeration and air conditioning, from liquids that boil near room temperature, enabling them to transfer a large amount of heat through phase changes (ch 9).•	Pen inks, and the engineering and chemistry of designing a pen with ink that will flow on the page and turn into a solid without making a mess (ch 10).Other chapters deal with the intoxicating properties of alcohols (ch 2), the properties of the ocean (ch 3), liquid crystal displays (ch 5), bodily fluids (ch 6), the chemistry of tea and coffee (ch 7), soaps and detergents (ch 8), clouds (ch 11), the slow flow of ice and rocks on the earrh’s surface (ch 12), and sustainable materials such as self-healing asphalt (ch 13)."
257,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90301926-kaj,2,"You might think that “Liquid Rules” is about the science of liquids. Don’t be fooled. It’s actually one long kinda cringy story about Mark Miodownik’s flying experience, with some chemistry asides.I loved Miodownik’s previous book, “Stuff Matters,” where he explains how the big properties of everyday materials come from their chemical structure. Why are alloys sometimes stronger than the metals they’re made from? What does it mean to be conductive? Miodownik keeps his explanations simple and mechanistic, aided by small hand-drawn doodles. Unlike many other pop sci books, “Stuff Matters” never falls into the trap of focusing too much on what is important to know, rather than what’s interesting and informative. The info:tainment ratio is good- accessible enough for high school level students while still interesting for scientists. Sure, he sprinkles in some occasionally boring personal anecdotes, but every materials chem book would benefit from a few breathers.“Liquid Rules” doubles down on the bad parts of “Stuff Matters” while forgetting what made it great. Each chapter focuses on a different liquid. A major part of the book is trying to relate each liquid to something that happens on a single trans-Atlantic flight. This plot device seems to be an attempt to make the liquid chemistry seem useful by relating it to real-world phenomena, but the cumulative effect is the opposite. Too much time spent on why these chemicals are important, and not enough on why they’re interesting, mixed with long personal anecdotes and scientist biographies that are neither important nor interesting. For a book about fluids, “Liquid Rules” is just a little bit too dry."
258,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4261166-marshall,5,"I love the way Mark Miodownik writes. He addresses subjects that are seemingly boring (if you say it out loud like when I told my girlfriend I was reading about glue, and tape, and tvs) and opens up the mystery entirely, sparking a fascinating world of chemical wonder. His rhetoric and storytelling can deliver the scientific details in an easily digestible manner without using any scientific tools such as graphs, charts, and data sheets, only rudimentary drawings (which helped a whole lot and were very welcome enterprises). I was tremendously inspired by this book and every single chapter tapped into a childlike awe of the materials of the world around me. I learned and relearned many aspects of earth science and things I've only imagined. Honestly, I wish someone like a teacher or mentor would have been able to put this book in my hands when I was in early high school because I believe it may have changed the trajectory of my life. I might have sought out a career in material science. So, since that obviously didn't happen seeing how he wrote this book in the recent decade, I will be sure to pass it along to a young friend or a deer friend's young adult. In any case, this book just goes to show that there is ALWAYS something to marvel at, even if you find yourself experiencing a bit of ennui. Just walk outside and check out a flower or if you're stuck inside pick up a pen and peer a little bit closer into all that makes it possible. Absolutely LOVED both of Miodownik's books. I will be buying these two and looking forward to the next one (please write another!)!"
259,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92179113-patrick-green,4,"I typically associate scientists with tall guys in lab coats. Careful, fastidious, and, when in the lab, organized. I know this is a crude generalization, but there is certainly a nugget of truth to this statement. The scientist of this book, Mark Miodownik, should have kept this nugget of truth in mind when he was writing this book. ""Liquid Rules"" is messy and disjointed, primarily because of the framework that Miodownik uses to explain the properties and everyday uses of certain liquids. This made the reading experience for myself at times boring. I cared more for his explanations on the properties of tea, coffee, and ink for example than I did for kerosene or soap. I also did not care for his tangents. I was mostly looking for information on how certain liquids, or liquids in general, function. I did not care much to hear about his trip from England to San Francisco. It was a very plain framework. The details surrounding this framework, the scientific extrapolations on liquids, propelled my interest.I enjoyed the information on the liquids that Miodownik provided. I also relished some of the historical background of these liquids. They taught some valuable conclusions that I should make on certain liquids. For example, I can definitively say that I am a coffee drinker, not a tea drinker. And now I have scientific evidence to support my subjective opinion. Thank you, Miodownik.The last pleasant note that I found on the book was the laid back pace. I felt as though I could read it on a nice Sunday afternoon while also getting some mental exercise. Despite how messy and boring the framework was, it's a very enjoyable book to read, and I would recommend it."
260,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1109379-colette,3,"“Liquids are the alter ego of dependable solid stuff. Whereas solid materials are humanity’s faithful friend, taking on the permanent shapes of clothes, shoes, phones, cars, and indeed airports, liquids are fluid; they will take on any shape, but only while contained. When they’re not contained, they are always on the move, seeping, corroding, dripping, and escaping our control. If you put a solid material somewhere, it stays there—barring forcible removal—often doing something very useful, like holding up a building or supplying electricity for a whole community. Liquids, on the other hand, are anarchic: they have a knack for destroying things. In a bathroom, for instance, it is a constant battle to keep water from seeping into cracks and pooling under the floor, where it gets up to no good, rotting and undermining the wooden joists; on a smooth tile floor, water is the perfect slip hazard, causing an enormous number of injuries; and when it gathers in the corners of the bathroom, it can harbor black slimy fungus and bacteria, which threaten to infiltrate our bodies and make us sick. And yet, despite all this treachery, we love the stuff; we love bathing in water, and showering in it, drenching the whole body. And what bathroom is complete without a cornucopia of bottled liquid soaps, shampoos, and conditioners, jars of cream, and tubes of toothpaste? We delight in these miraculous liquids and yet we worry about them too: Are they bad for us? Do they cause cancer? Do they ruin the environment? With liquids, delight and suspicion go hand in hand. They are duplicitous by nature, neither a gas nor a solid but something in between, something inscrutable and mysterious.”"
261,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83179136-catherine-puma,4,"I was delighted when I saw Miodownik was coming out with another book. Having enjoyed his ""Stuff Matters"", I acquired ""Liquid Rules"" and was not disappointed. Framed by the narrative device of observing liquids around him while flying from Britain to California, Miodownik describes oceans, glaciers, clouds, wine, saliva, droplets in the pressurized cabin, tea, coffee, blood... to name a few. I learned so much! As a result, I found myself not just noticing all the liquids I encounter in my life, but also contemplating what properties they have in relation to one another. This included pondering the process of converting my bar of solid soap into a liquid substance by interacting it with water, another liquid. Miodownik's section on hand soap vs. liquid soap (and his preference for the former) was thus especially interesting. My only quibble with this work was its lack of acknowledging its own limitations. The subtitle implies that ""dangerous"" liquids would also be discussed, but--with the exception of mercury--the diversity of naturally occurring toxins and poisons are not mentioned. Of course it is unrealistic to expect such a short work to touch upon everything, but I wish there was more of a ""there's so much more to learn and discuss"" preface and/or conclusion. That being said, this was extremely eye opening, as ""Stuff Matters"" was, and I will be recommending it to many. This is a great way to inspire a natural curiosity for the natural observation of fluid dynamics. I can even see myself re-reading it again! "
262,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/964960-george,4,"As with his earlier Stuff Matters: Exploring the Marvelous Materials That Shape Our Man-Made World, Miodownik selects a convenient frame in which to hang his description of various types of liquids and the ways in which they affect our lives. In this case, it's a transatlantic flight from London to San Francisco, giving him the opportunity to reflect on, among other things, the hot beverages served by the flight attendants, refrigeration systems, the glue that holds the plane's wings to the fuselage, and of course the large body of water over which he flies. Like most popular books about science, there are parts that are going to be overly simplistic for experts, or even knowledgeable non-experts, but Miodownik is among the group of writers who, I think, manages to strike the right balance. The framework is contrived, yes, but it has also helped me to retain a fair amount of what was discussed, and I found myself thinking about it on my own flight to California (especially the part about the glue...). My only real criticism is that his observations of his seatmate, Susan, while in the name of setting us up for a reveal later on, came off as a bit creepy at times. "
263,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/190448-karen,4,"If you're into science, this book is a gem.It's written by a material scientist and the story is told on a flight from London to San Francisco, ostensibly focusing on all the liquids on board but it's really just a premise to tell the stories he wants to tell. The fact that he was on board a flight was cute but seemed contrived a bit at parts. But I didn't really care because the science and stories were super interesting to me. This book has 12 chapters, each chapter focusing on a different substance like glue, ink, etc. I loved the bits about how candles work and how the wick pulls water up against the force of gravity. I learned about how the World Trade Centers buckled due to the strength of the steel decreasing under such high heat and then putting pressure on the lower floors, etc. And how flavor is a multi-sensory experience (and how we assume and 'can taste' flavors related to the color.) I also loved reading how icarus story wouldn't be possible because it gets colder when you fly higher :) I loved learning about ballpoint pens and how they work (and how amazing they are!!) and about tar and all the interesting new innovations they are making to help the roads last longer.There is just so much fascinating science in this book. Highly enjoyable. thanks to netgalley for an advanced copy in exchange for an honest review."
264,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7273557-gary,3," Mark Miodownik book Liquid Rules takes the reader on a transatlantic flight from London to San Francisco. His profession is in materials. The security line examining for liquids and then the pre-flight safety lecture triggers in him what liquids are we talking about? For one, the jet you are flying in is really a bomb, full of kerosene. After getting you all panicked about ever flying again, there is talk of alcohol, tea, coffee, soaps, ketchup, and many other items. His explanations are very readable and when he traces inventions, it makes the subject matter come alive.The book is told in sections, divided by the type of liquids he encounters along the way. He leads an interesting discussion about why the liquids are different and how various liquids you would not associate are similar. I found that after about the fifth chapter of this, I was getting a bit overwhelmed with the detail of explanation-I usually find details like he presents as interesting. So I am not sure why this bugs me. I would chalk it up to the reader more than the writer.I would recommend this book. But if you do read the book, try taking the book in smaller chunks rather than as a book to read straight through.For more of my thoughts, please see my book blog."
265,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"Mark Miodownik explores the mundanely marvelous liquids that make up our lives in the framework of a transatlantic flight from London to San Francisco with Liquid Rules. Liquid Rules explores the different aspects of liquids as they relate to making our lives easier. Take Kerosene as an example. Kerosene was first discovered back in 900 CE or around that century by an Arabic Alchemist and Scholar. The only problem was that Olive Oil was preferred for lamps since the government could tax it.Miodownik goes over a great many subjects and ideas. He writes about distillation, flashpoints, chemical structures, and so much more. The book reminds me a bit of Gravity’s Rainbow with all of the different information that the author stuffs into the pages, but this book is far more accessible.There are a lot of different things that Miodownik brings to your attention. Think of the humble candle as a great example. It might seem easy to understand, but there is a lot of physics going on to make sure that a candle works properly. Another thing to think about is as simple as a ballpoint pen. Even the ink had to be engineered for the proper viscosity and binding properties.I will probably search for Miodownik’s other books like Stuff Matters, assuming I haven’t read them already. "
266,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102314750-sam,0,"Liquid Rules is a book that examines in the depth the relationships between various liquids and how they affect our world. Traveling between London, San Francisco, and on the plane ride between, Mark Miodownik teaches us the surprising truth of how reliant we are as a people on liquids. While diving into the mechanical sciences of things, often discussing liquids in regards to thermal properties, the 2nd law of thermodynamics, and quantum relationships, he doesn't become completely absorbed in this writing remembering to include more colloquial evaluations. These reviews, often revolve around a specific liquids contribution to society, the history of how it was created (or found, and how it may be revolutionized in the future, and provides a sense balance and completion to his writing. Unlike many scientists who often thrive and exploit the mysticism (or more correctly lack of education) around their work to make themselves more interesting Mark Miodownik takes pride in his humanity, often talking about how his work around liquids stems from the want to learn. Overall, Liquid Rules is a unique book, that relays with humor and wit how the science, history, and properties of many liquids bear a pivotal role in the development of our modern industrialized society."
267,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40472466-dan,5,"Once again, after Stuff Matters, Mark Miodownik brings about the joy of acknowledging the material matters around us. It is an excellent book if you want to follow the meandering thoughts of the author.""Liquids have a duality: they are neither a gas nor a solid, but something in between. They are exciting and powerful, on the one hand, while anarchic and slightly terrifying on the other. That is their nature.""The liquid is a core part of what makes us living beings, how we interact with the world. Earth's molten-metal liquid core creates a magnetic field that protects water from being dried up due to the solar wind. We wouldn't have a vast amount of water in the sea without the core.Our energy source is often in a liquid form, e.g., whale oil, gasoline, kerosene, diesel. Some explosives are in liquid form like nitroglycerin, which is the reason why a certain amount of liquid is not allowed to carry on planes.Of course, we drink water, alcohol (ethanol, not methanol), wine, coffee, and tea. Our body is also mostly liquid. Our saliva helps us digest, kills pain, and protects us from bacterias (and bad breath). We cry and drop tears. We put on perfumes (methanol). We clean using soap.We watch (LCD: liquid crystal displays).Look up and see clouds? They are liquid too.The author tells these stories while he takes a flight to his conference. His perspectives are refreshing especially since flying is one of the worst experiences that I have to endure. It is cramped. There is an invisible tension over the armrest. The middle seat gets the two, does anyone disagree? The air is too dry. Food is usually horrible if served. A trip to the bathroom is bothersome. Now I know what to do. Order coffee instead of tea. Sleep without drooling. Watch movies which I would enjoy more. Last but not least, appreciate liquids!"
268,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48901937-kyle-dinges,4,"Liquid Rules by Mark Miodownik is a book that looks at some of the most important liquids that society depends on and gives a bit of a brief background on their chemical makeup and how they were created or discovered. It is easily accessible, which is something I usually look for in non-fiction about science. Like his first book, Stuff Matters, Miodownik has a knack for writing about complex scientific ideas in a way that are easy for the lay person to understand. He sprinkles in plenty of humor to keep things lively and never drones on for too long about one subject. The idea to use an airplane ride to introduce each liquid, and demonstrate their abundance in life, was a good way to present each liquid in a logical order and talk about real life applications. All of this just serves to make the book more entertaining and interesting. There's a delicate balance to making a book like this informative and entertaining, and Miodownik does a good job in that regard.Someone looking for a more expansive an in depth text might be a bit let down, but for someone just looking for an entertaining ""pop-science"" read, I think this book more than fits the bill."

It took an extremely broad area of knowledge and made it understandable (and enjoyable!) for the semi-layperson. I especially enjoyed the chapter on saliva (weird, I know, but it was of professional interest haha). I also enjoyed the chapter on tea, coffee, and other beverages. The reason I knocked a star off of my review is because the author often says “double blind studies have shown...” or “studies have shown...” but does not cite these studies or sources. There is a “further reading” section at the end of the book, but none of the resources are linked to the specific claims presented in the main body. I know this is supposed to be a general overview, but if sources are claimed, they should be cited. This normally wouldn’t bug me so much, but I would actually like to read some of those studies.... (including the one mentioned in the cooling chapter, where the author talks about perfluorocarbons as a substitute for blood and the subsequent clinical trials). IT’S BREATHABLE LIQUID. Doesn’t that sound like some worthwhile further reading?"

282,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill,4,"I'd really enjoyed Miodownik's Stuff Matters, on the science of different solid materials like glass, metal, concrete and graphite, and was excited that he had a book on liquids. Whereas Stuff Matters covered the materials that Miodownik presumably found the most fascinating and significant in terms of daily life, the conceit for Liquid is the different kinds of liquids Miodownik encounters on a flight - oils, alcohol, water, glue, liquid crystals, saliva, tea and coffee, soap, refrigerants, ink, clouds, magma and tar (the latter two signifying the end of his journey when the plane lands). In Liquid, Miodownik weaves a fascinating narrative that draws from chemistry, physics, science history, earth science, to name a few. It's full of fascinating nuggets. Like why it is dangerous to consume home brews or alcohol-based liquids for a cheap high because the methanol in them hasn't been removed; methanol is metabolised into formic acid and formaldehyde in the body, where the formic acid attacks your nerve cells, especially the optic nerve, leaving you blind (hence the expression 'blind drunk'). Like how it is rubber that gives Post-It Notes their stickiness; the notes have an adhesive layer of rubber on them where the microscopic spheres of rubber bond tightly to the note but create only a small adhesive force when pressed onto a surface. Or that sticky tape has three layers, a bottom layer of adhesive, a middle layer of cellophane for strength and transparency and a top layer of non-stick material like Teflon. And the fascinating universe of two-part adhesives. Or how he unpacks the complexities involved in brewing the perfect cup of tea, as it involves striking the right balance of temperature (too low and the flavour molecules in the tea won't dissolve; too high and many of the tannins and polyphenols that give a bitter taste and astringency will also dissolve), timing (to ensure the perfect balance of the different kinds of volatiles), compared to the (relative) ease of making a decent cup of coffee.And the marvels of how soap works - that when you mix fat with an alkali (like ash water), the alkali transforms the fat molecules into hybrid molecules with a charged head that dissolves in water and a carbon tail that dissolves in fats. The carbon tails of hybrid soap molecules embed themselves in fat blobs, creating a charged surface with their heads that can dissolve in water. Thus allowing the fat blob to be washed away. [Fascinating factoids: Egg is the surfactant in mayonnaise, allowing the oil and water in mayo to bind. It's like soap in that respect and you can use egg yolk to clean your hair. P&G invented Ivory Soap and part of its marketing strategy was to sponsor serial dramas targeting housewives at home during the day. Hence the name 'soap opera'.]Like Stuff Matters, Liquid is very accessibly written, even for the science phobe. But unlike Stuff Matters, the conceit of Liquid - to wrap the material science within the larger narrative arc of Miodownik's flight, and his interactions with his fellow passenger, Susan - is distracting. Miodownik's attempts at humour - the disgust he evokes when he falls asleep and drools on Susan, when he sneezes on another passenger, when he obsesses about why the inflight safety video remains silent on the largest hazard of all, the fact that they will be in the air with thousands of gallons of combustible fuel - are pedestrian and awkward. For Stuff Matters, I'd felt that the sections where Miodownik tried to jazz things up a bit, to perhaps take a more creative treatment of the topic fell flat. Like when he discussed porcelain in the context of his parents' wedding tea set. The main thing here is really the fascinating science of liquids but Miodownik sometimes seems to forget this. Still, this is a fairly minor complaint in what is overall, a fun and fascinating read. "
283,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66635467-keen,4,"“Liquids have a duality: they are neither a gas nor solid, but something in-between. They are exciting and powerful, on the one hand, while being anarchic and slightly terrifying on the other.” Travelling on a trans-Atlantic flight from London to San Francisco, Miodownik uses a number of observations and thoughts as creative jumping off points to get into some whimsical and fascinating territory throughout the journey.This is a largely, but not always accessible investigation of sorts into some of the many liquids that most of us will encounter in our daily lives. A quirky odyssey loaded with lots of colourful facts and trivia to pull out down the pub or indeed any social occasion. I had no idea that the de Havilland Mosquito bomber used during WWII was made of plywood, which made it the fastest aircraft in the sky or that we use around 16 billion litres of oil every day throughout the world.Apparently there is 150’000 litres of kerosene stored in a jumbo jet (50’000 in the fuel tank below your feet and another 50’000 stored in each wing). And yet you could throw a lit match at it and it wouldn’t ignite. But mix it with the right amount of oxygen and it suddenly becomes an oil ten times as powerful as nitroglycerine.He talks about the crucial difference between ethanol and methanol, pure methanol can cause permanent blindness. Your body metabolises it into formic acid and formaldehyde. Formic acid attacks nerve cells, especially the optic nerve, hence the saying ‘blind drunk’. It also goes after your liver and kidneys and can cause permanent damage. Three glasses of it will kill you.Miodownik explains why drinking wine is a multi-sensory experience, and how more often than not many people enjoy paying for the brand more than the experience, “Some people love having the most expensive cars, they get real enjoyment out of what that says about them as a person. It’s the same with wines. But this doesn’t mean that these are better wines or better cars, or even that the owners are more sophisticated people.” He cites the experiments that managed to fool so called ‘wine experts’ that convinced them that they were drinking white wine, but thanks to a flavourless red dye they got suckered into describing it in detail as a red wine.He also covers many more interesting topics from 3-D printing, the humble yet fascinating biro pen and even the wonderful properties of tar and asphalt, he talks of the pitch drop experiment set up in 1927 by Prof Thomas Parnell at the University of Queensland, the first drop fell in 1938, the second in 1947, the third in 1954 and the ninth and most recent drop fell in 2014.One of the minor pitfalls in this book is that occasionally some of the topics get a little tedious and there are too many complex and bewildering diagrams of molecular structures for my taste, but that is sure to appeal to science and chemistry buffs alike, but you don’t have to study or understand them to enjoy the book.This reminded me of Paul Vanhoenacker’s “Skyfaring” (the book is mentioned in the further reading section). This book relies on a format used repeatedly by the likes of Gavin Francis, Alain de Botton and many others, which takes everyday subjects, and makes them relatively accessible, whilst allowing us to view seemingly mundane objects with a renewed sense of wonder. It’s a style that peppers the book with helpful and occasionally light-hearted images and the books are never too long. It’s a format that I happen to enjoy and it’s clearly a popular one too."
284,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20280886-sarah-smith,3,"More often than I care to admit my wee brain gets a bit overwhelmed and when this happens I tend to look for things that are objective as opposed to subjective. And it sort of gives me a break. Today’s break came in the form of a popular science book (Side note, I LOVE books classed as popular science) called Liquids by Mark Miodownik. Oddly enough it is a book about Liquids, from tea to superliquid Helium, kerosene and ink, the sea to lava. A whole plethora of them each with their own weird, dangerous and fascinating properties. And were it has the potential to be an excellent book it falls a little short. The major issue I had is how Miodownik frames the narrative. He is on a flight from London to San Francisco and he introduces the different liquids in an increasingly strained and conceited way related to this flight. This quickly starts to grate, the tone of these bits is sort of akin to an over enthusiastic kids TV presenter who has forgotten they are on Newsnight and are talking to Kirsty Wark as opposed to a group of pubescent children. But although I’ve started with the bad, it almost redeems itself as there is much to interest. I was born in 1986 and all I remember from primary school (we shall not read in to why I remember so little) concerns the Gulf War, an oil spill, and the ozone layer having a massive whole in it. And it was only in reading this I realised why in primary school we where told all about the whole in the ozone, as it was around this time the world realised the damage CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons) had done to the ozone, CFCs where used in refrigerators as a coolant, as they were seemingly harmless and inert, and then everyone realised this was not the case. It was actually the same fella responsible for this that said lead in petrol was safe too, so he’s not so much the greatest really. Apart from learning about coolants used in refrigerators, you also get to learn about so many things you would never stop to consider. How the ink in biros work, can you tell the difference between red and white wine if you cant see them (I to be fair would struggle to distinguish either from vinegar), why Eastenders is a soap, how ships float, and planes fly, that roads to a certain extent are self healing on account of the viscosity of tar(tar is actually a liquid, just a million times as viscous as peanut butter) man made clouds (Russia uses them every May to make sure May Day celebrations are rain free, the little rascals) also just you know clouds in general. It’s almost a history of the world told via the scientific progress concerning liquids that are often vital to our existence without us really ever thinking too much about them. Despite all of this I was left feeling a little short changed. It is possible I expect too much, I’ve been spoiled by books such as those written by Simon Singh (Fermats last theorem, Big Bang) or Sam Kean’s The Disappearing Spoon which have a more consistent tone, and I found to captivate me more, but just because these are better doesn’t make Liquids bad, just not as good as I had hoped. Mostly it suffers from how he introduces the liquids in each instance, and I know I’ve written about how it is interesting but like an under seasoned soup there wasn’t quite enough of the interesting. It felt a little padded in parts and too much time was spent on irrelevant personal anecdotes. Sadly not nearly as good as it could have been."
285,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4137725-phoebe,5,"Right now I'm experiencing that 4pm listlessness. It's either coffee or nap. Resistance is futile. No one is productive at 4pm. So here I am, writing about a book about liquids instead of...never you mind.Liquid Rules: The Delightful and Dangerous Substances That Flowed Through Our Lives (2020) is Mark Miodownik's follow-up to Stuff Matters: The Strange Stories of the Marvellous Materials that Shape Our Man-made World (2014), which won the 2014 Royal Society Winton Prize for Science books and the 2015 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Communication Award. I didn’t know either awards existed but they seem relevant and most likely well-deserved because it is so, so easy to commend the quality of his writing.I wouldn’t say Liquid Rules bears epistemological significance. But you don’t read a book about liquids because you think there’s some quintessential knowledge you’re missing. You read it because you passed year 12 chemistry and now you can have that moment of vainglory realising you didn’t memorise chemical compounds and equations for nothing because you actually understand what an actual scientist gasp is saying. HA. Just kidding. I liked the title and thought it sounded unusual and entertaining. More importantly, I knew it wasn’t gonna be emotionally taxing. The kind of tension I’ve been experiencing has been unreal and I can’t explain why I’m so tense. I blame it on animal crossing which is meant to be a relaxing game but my perfectionism is ruining it for me. (Why can’t I place THIS bush next to THIS rock?!) In any case, I need something breezy but not fluffy.What makes Liquid Rules entertaining is how casual Miodownik sounds. The entire book is structured around Miodownik’s flight to San Francisco where he is to attend a scientific conference. As he is going through customs and security, he muses on what makes peanut butter a liquid and not a solid according to airline regulations. As the plane is taking off, he considers the discovery of kerosene in the premodern era and the incredible fact that no one knew its awesome power. Then mid-flight, he provides an endless stream of anecdotes about the terrifying power of storm clouds (when the plane experiences turbulence), why he prefers soap bars over liquid soap (when he goes to the bathroom), why we find snot disgusting (when curry dribbles down his chin), why the invention of biro was a complex problem with a surprisingly simple solution (when he signs the arrival card), and finally, the future when we can store man-made data like digital photographs inside droplets of liquid (as he arrives at the scientific conference). It feels like you’re flying and you’re listening in to all the amusing did-you-knows as the person next to you chatters on about the marvellous things we’re seeing. All in all, it’s like being offered a gaze into a secret network of things, where whaling in the nineteenth century is somehow related to the rise of the soap industry which is also related to the creation of soap opera during morning hours. The connective ‘thingness’ of life is suddenly made apparent and it is a wondrous sight. The world is a connected place. It’s connected by the seeping, oozing, dripping and molten liquids that flow in and out of us, around us, beneath us, and above us. Humans are 60% water and our planet is 70% water. We are living in an aqueous state on an aqueous planet, so it’s almost self-deceiving to think the world around us is solid and concrete when our body is formed in amniotic fluids and ends with being decomposed into minerals, water and gas. And isn’t it just the strangest thing to think one day, instead of relying on computers that speak in 0s and 1s, we will have biochemical computation that takes place on a molecular level? Yep. Mind blown. "
286,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/109535466-mike-parkes,4,"Entertaining but scattered book describing the chemistry and applications of assorted liquids. I think this goes by different names in North America and Europe – the version I have is just titled “Liquid”. Lots of interesting details, and Miodownik is an entertaining and informative writer. However, the choice of liquids and their properties is random, with the organizing principle of the book being liquids one comes across on a flight (or is otherwise impacted by, e.g. clouds). The connecting interludes between chapters become annoying quite early on in the book (e.g. a trip to the lavatory provides the opportunity to discuss soaps and cleaning products). By the end, you’re left with a pastiche of chapters on different topics, some enlightening, some less so, but not a good grasp on liquids as a whole. A strong introductory chapter on the properties of liquids would really have helped. Not quite as good as Miodownik’s “Stuff Matters” which was similar in format but dealt with common solid materials (primarily structural).A few chapters I enjoyed in “Liquid” were:•	How the volatility and flash point of hydrocarbon liquids such as kerosene (jet fuel) and oils affected their use in lighting and energy products (ch 1)•	Glues, liquids that change to solids and form permanent bonds (ch 4). •	Refrigeration and air conditioning, from liquids that boil near room temperature, enabling them to transfer a large amount of heat through phase changes (ch 9).•	Pen inks, and the engineering and chemistry of designing a pen with ink that will flow on the page and turn into a solid without making a mess (ch 10).Other chapters deal with the intoxicating properties of alcohols (ch 2), the properties of the ocean (ch 3), liquid crystal displays (ch 5), bodily fluids (ch 6), the chemistry of tea and coffee (ch 7), soaps and detergents (ch 8), clouds (ch 11), the slow flow of ice and rocks on the earrh’s surface (ch 12), and sustainable materials such as self-healing asphalt (ch 13)."
287,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90301926-kaj,2,"You might think that “Liquid Rules” is about the science of liquids. Don’t be fooled. It’s actually one long kinda cringy story about Mark Miodownik’s flying experience, with some chemistry asides.I loved Miodownik’s previous book, “Stuff Matters,” where he explains how the big properties of everyday materials come from their chemical structure. Why are alloys sometimes stronger than the metals they’re made from? What does it mean to be conductive? Miodownik keeps his explanations simple and mechanistic, aided by small hand-drawn doodles. Unlike many other pop sci books, “Stuff Matters” never falls into the trap of focusing too much on what is important to know, rather than what’s interesting and informative. The info:tainment ratio is good- accessible enough for high school level students while still interesting for scientists. Sure, he sprinkles in some occasionally boring personal anecdotes, but every materials chem book would benefit from a few breathers.“Liquid Rules” doubles down on the bad parts of “Stuff Matters” while forgetting what made it great. Each chapter focuses on a different liquid. A major part of the book is trying to relate each liquid to something that happens on a single trans-Atlantic flight. This plot device seems to be an attempt to make the liquid chemistry seem useful by relating it to real-world phenomena, but the cumulative effect is the opposite. Too much time spent on why these chemicals are important, and not enough on why they’re interesting, mixed with long personal anecdotes and scientist biographies that are neither important nor interesting. For a book about fluids, “Liquid Rules” is just a little bit too dry."
288,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4261166-marshall,5,"I love the way Mark Miodownik writes. He addresses subjects that are seemingly boring (if you say it out loud like when I told my girlfriend I was reading about glue, and tape, and tvs) and opens up the mystery entirely, sparking a fascinating world of chemical wonder. His rhetoric and storytelling can deliver the scientific details in an easily digestible manner without using any scientific tools such as graphs, charts, and data sheets, only rudimentary drawings (which helped a whole lot and were very welcome enterprises). I was tremendously inspired by this book and every single chapter tapped into a childlike awe of the materials of the world around me. I learned and relearned many aspects of earth science and things I've only imagined. Honestly, I wish someone like a teacher or mentor would have been able to put this book in my hands when I was in early high school because I believe it may have changed the trajectory of my life. I might have sought out a career in material science. So, since that obviously didn't happen seeing how he wrote this book in the recent decade, I will be sure to pass it along to a young friend or a deer friend's young adult. In any case, this book just goes to show that there is ALWAYS something to marvel at, even if you find yourself experiencing a bit of ennui. Just walk outside and check out a flower or if you're stuck inside pick up a pen and peer a little bit closer into all that makes it possible. Absolutely LOVED both of Miodownik's books. I will be buying these two and looking forward to the next one (please write another!)!"
289,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92179113-patrick-green,4,"I typically associate scientists with tall guys in lab coats. Careful, fastidious, and, when in the lab, organized. I know this is a crude generalization, but there is certainly a nugget of truth to this statement. The scientist of this book, Mark Miodownik, should have kept this nugget of truth in mind when he was writing this book. ""Liquid Rules"" is messy and disjointed, primarily because of the framework that Miodownik uses to explain the properties and everyday uses of certain liquids. This made the reading experience for myself at times boring. I cared more for his explanations on the properties of tea, coffee, and ink for example than I did for kerosene or soap. I also did not care for his tangents. I was mostly looking for information on how certain liquids, or liquids in general, function. I did not care much to hear about his trip from England to San Francisco. It was a very plain framework. The details surrounding this framework, the scientific extrapolations on liquids, propelled my interest.I enjoyed the information on the liquids that Miodownik provided. I also relished some of the historical background of these liquids. They taught some valuable conclusions that I should make on certain liquids. For example, I can definitively say that I am a coffee drinker, not a tea drinker. And now I have scientific evidence to support my subjective opinion. Thank you, Miodownik.The last pleasant note that I found on the book was the laid back pace. I felt as though I could read it on a nice Sunday afternoon while also getting some mental exercise. Despite how messy and boring the framework was, it's a very enjoyable book to read, and I would recommend it."
290,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1109379-colette,3,"“Liquids are the alter ego of dependable solid stuff. Whereas solid materials are humanity’s faithful friend, taking on the permanent shapes of clothes, shoes, phones, cars, and indeed airports, liquids are fluid; they will take on any shape, but only while contained. When they’re not contained, they are always on the move, seeping, corroding, dripping, and escaping our control. If you put a solid material somewhere, it stays there—barring forcible removal—often doing something very useful, like holding up a building or supplying electricity for a whole community. Liquids, on the other hand, are anarchic: they have a knack for destroying things. In a bathroom, for instance, it is a constant battle to keep water from seeping into cracks and pooling under the floor, where it gets up to no good, rotting and undermining the wooden joists; on a smooth tile floor, water is the perfect slip hazard, causing an enormous number of injuries; and when it gathers in the corners of the bathroom, it can harbor black slimy fungus and bacteria, which threaten to infiltrate our bodies and make us sick. And yet, despite all this treachery, we love the stuff; we love bathing in water, and showering in it, drenching the whole body. And what bathroom is complete without a cornucopia of bottled liquid soaps, shampoos, and conditioners, jars of cream, and tubes of toothpaste? We delight in these miraculous liquids and yet we worry about them too: Are they bad for us? Do they cause cancer? Do they ruin the environment? With liquids, delight and suspicion go hand in hand. They are duplicitous by nature, neither a gas nor a solid but something in between, something inscrutable and mysterious.”"

Having enjoyed his ""Stuff Matters"", I acquired ""Liquid Rules"" and was not disappointed. Framed by the narrative device of observing liquids around him while flying from Britain to California, Miodownik describes oceans, glaciers, clouds, wine, saliva, droplets in the pressurized cabin, tea, coffee, blood... to name a few. I learned so much! As a result, I found myself not just noticing all the liquids I encounter in my life, but also contemplating what properties they have in relation to one another. This included pondering the process of converting my bar of solid soap into a liquid substance by interacting it with water, another liquid. Miodownik's section on hand soap vs. liquid soap (and his preference for the former) was thus especially interesting. My only quibble with this work was its lack of acknowledging its own limitations. The subtitle implies that ""dangerous"" liquids would also be discussed, but--with the exception of mercury--the diversity of naturally occurring toxins and poisons are not mentioned. Of course it is unrealistic to expect such a short work to touch upon everything, but I wish there was more of a ""there's so much more to learn and discuss"" preface and/or conclusion. That being said, this was extremely eye opening, as ""Stuff Matters"" was, and I will be recommending it to many. This is a great way to inspire a natural curiosity for the natural observation of fluid dynamics. I can even see myself re-reading it again! "
292,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/964960-george,4,"As with his earlier Stuff Matters: Exploring the Marvelous Materials That Shape Our Man-Made World, Miodownik selects a convenient frame in which to hang his description of various types of liquids and the ways in which they affect our lives. In this case, it's a transatlantic flight from London to San Francisco, giving him the opportunity to reflect on, among other things, the hot beverages served by the flight attendants, refrigeration systems, the glue that holds the plane's wings to the fuselage, and of course the large body of water over which he flies. Like most popular books about science, there are parts that are going to be overly simplistic for experts, or even knowledgeable non-experts, but Miodownik is among the group of writers who, I think, manages to strike the right balance. The framework is contrived, yes, but it has also helped me to retain a fair amount of what was discussed, and I found myself thinking about it on my own flight to California (especially the part about the glue...). My only real criticism is that his observations of his seatmate, Susan, while in the name of setting us up for a reveal later on, came off as a bit creepy at times. "

The fact that he was on board a flight was cute but seemed contrived a bit at parts. But I didn't really care because the science and stories were super interesting to me. This book has 12 chapters, each chapter focusing on a different substance like glue, ink, etc. I loved the bits about how candles work and how the wick pulls water up against the force of gravity. I learned about how the World Trade Centers buckled due to the strength of the steel decreasing under such high heat and then putting pressure on the lower floors, etc. And how flavor is a multi-sensory experience (and how we assume and 'can taste' flavors related to the color.) I also loved reading how icarus story wouldn't be possible because it gets colder when you fly higher :) I loved learning about ballpoint pens and how they work (and how amazing they are!!) and about tar and all the interesting new innovations they are making to help the roads last longer.There is just so much fascinating science in this book.

His profession is in materials. The security line examining for liquids and then the pre-flight safety lecture triggers in him what liquids are we talking about? For one, the jet you are flying in is really a bomb, full of kerosene. After getting you all panicked about ever flying again, there is talk of alcohol, tea, coffee, soaps, ketchup, and many other items. His explanations are very readable and when he traces inventions, it makes the subject matter come alive.The book is told in sections, divided by the type of liquids he encounters along the way. He leads an interesting discussion about why the liquids are different and how various liquids you would not associate are similar. I found that after about the fifth chapter of this, I was getting a bit overwhelmed with the detail of explanation-I usually find details like he presents as interesting. So I am not sure why this bugs me. I would chalk it up to the reader more than the writer.I would recommend this book. But if you do read the book, try taking the book in smaller chunks rather than as a book to read straight through.For more of my thoughts, please see my book blog."

Liquid Rules explores the different aspects of liquids as they relate to making our lives easier. Take Kerosene as an example. Kerosene was first discovered back in 900 CE or around that century by an Arabic Alchemist and Scholar. The only problem was that Olive Oil was preferred for lamps since the government could tax it.Miodownik goes over a great many subjects and ideas. He writes about distillation, flashpoints, chemical structures, and so much more. The book reminds me a bit of Gravity’s Rainbow with all of the different information that the author stuffs into the pages, but this book is far more accessible.There are a lot of different things that Miodownik brings to your attention. Think of the humble candle as a great example. It might seem easy to understand, but there is a lot of physics going on to make sure that a candle works properly. Another thing to think about is as simple as a ballpoint pen. Even the ink had to be engineered for the proper viscosity and binding properties.I will probably search for Miodownik’s other books like Stuff Matters, assuming I haven’t read them already. "
296,054485019X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/102314750-sam,0,"Liquid Rules is a book that examines in the depth the relationships between various liquids and how they affect our world. Traveling between London, San Francisco, and on the plane ride between, Mark Miodownik teaches us the surprising truth of how reliant we are as a people on liquids. While diving into the mechanical sciences of things, often discussing liquids in regards to thermal properties, the 2nd law of thermodynamics, and quantum relationships, he doesn't become completely absorbed in this writing remembering to include more colloquial evaluations. These reviews, often revolve around a specific liquids contribution to society, the history of how it was created (or found, and how it may be revolutionized in the future, and provides a sense balance and completion to his writing. Unlike many scientists who often thrive and exploit the mysticism (or more correctly lack of education) around their work to make themselves more interesting Mark Miodownik takes pride in his humanity, often talking about how his work around liquids stems from the want to learn. Overall, Liquid Rules is a unique book, that relays with humor and wit how the science, history, and properties of many liquids bear a pivotal role in the development of our modern industrialized society."

It is an excellent book if you want to follow the meandering thoughts of the author.""Liquids have a duality: they are neither a gas nor a solid, but something in between. They are exciting and powerful, on the one hand, while anarchic and slightly terrifying on the other. That is their nature.""The liquid is a core part of what makes us living beings, how we interact with the world. Earth's molten-metal liquid core creates a magnetic field that protects water from being dried up due to the solar wind. We wouldn't have a vast amount of water in the sea without the core.Our energy source is often in a liquid form, e.g., whale oil, gasoline, kerosene, diesel. Some explosives are in liquid form like nitroglycerin, which is the reason why a certain amount of liquid is not allowed to carry on planes.Of course, we drink water, alcohol (ethanol, not methanol), wine, coffee, and tea. Our body is also mostly liquid. Our saliva helps us digest, kills pain, and protects us from bacterias (and bad breath). We cry and drop tears. We put on perfumes (methanol). We clean using soap.We watch (LCD: liquid crystal displays).Look up and see clouds? They are liquid too.The author tells these stories while he takes a flight to his conference. His perspectives are refreshing especially since flying is one of the worst experiences that I have to endure. It is cramped. There is an invisible tension over the armrest. The middle seat gets the two, does anyone disagree? The air is too dry. Food is usually horrible if served. A trip to the bathroom is bothersome. Now I know what to do. Order coffee instead of tea. Sleep without drooling. Watch movies which I would enjoy more. Last but not least, appreciate liquids!"

It is easily accessible, which is something I usually look for in non-fiction about science. Like his first book, Stuff Matters, Miodownik has a knack for writing about complex scientific ideas in a way that are easy for the lay person to understand. He sprinkles in plenty of humor to keep things lively and never drones on for too long about one subject. The idea to use an airplane ride to introduce each liquid, and demonstrate their abundance in life, was a good way to present each liquid in a logical order and talk about real life applications. All of this just serves to make the book more entertaining and interesting. There's a delicate balance to making a book like this informative and entertaining, and Miodownik does a good job in that regard.Someone looking for a more expansive an in depth text might be a bit let down, but for someone just looking for an entertaining ""pop-science"" read, I think this book more than fits the bill."

It took an extremely broad area of knowledge and made it understandable (and enjoyable!) for the semi-layperson. I especially enjoyed the chapter on saliva (weird, I know, but it was of professional interest haha). I also enjoyed the chapter on tea, coffee, and other beverages. The reason I knocked a star off of my review is because the author often says “double blind studies have shown...” or “studies have shown...” but does not cite these studies or sources. There is a “further reading” section at the end of the book, but none of the resources are linked to the specific claims presented in the main body. I know this is supposed to be a general overview, but if sources are claimed, they should be cited. This normally wouldn’t bug me so much, but I would actually like to read some of those studies.... (including the one mentioned in the cooling chapter, where the author talks about perfluorocarbons as a substitute for blood and the subsequent clinical trials). IT’S BREATHABLE LIQUID. Doesn’t that sound like some worthwhile further reading?"
