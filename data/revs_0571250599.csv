Marcus Chown writes up the scientific journey from the steady state universe of Albert Einstein and Sir Fred Hoyle all the way to the cosmic fireball of the 'big bang', a journey that takes in, and superbly explains, the scientific steps and discoveries of most of the twentieth century. Of course, Hubble's optical observations, in the 1920's through the Mt.Wilson telescope, and the use of spectroscopy, showed galaxies to be receding at 42,000 kilometers per second. This discovery hurled a brick through Albert's 'steady state' window. It's the author's detailed account of the 'new astronomy' after WWII of radio/radar technology being aimed at the cosmos, that this book explains so well. It took almost 40 years before the COBE satelite confirmed the earth bound readings for the cosmic microwave radiation background and the temperature of the universe of around 3 degrees Kelvin.What I learned from this book:- Rather than being the logical step by step advancement by scientists, it is clearly apparent that the left hand doesn't really know what the right hand is doing, and it is often that steps of advancement are made by tripping over the books of Heath-Robinson. All this is rather frustrating. I haven't long to live, and I would very much like to know why/how that singularity went bang, and where we are expanding to, and is there carbon based befuddled bean creatures sat on spinning rocks at other parts of this explosion wondering the same thing? Answers on a postcard please to......  "

This one is more specifically about some of the most influential scientists who have spent their entire working lives discovering all that stuff that blew my mind. I've often wondered *how* we know what we do, because understanding the universe feels to me like asking one of my gut bacteria to explain what I look like. If you're interested in the lengths astrophysicists go to in order to prove theories, and the politics of prizes and the nature of science reporting then this is a book for you. "
2,0571250599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101417080-martijn,3,"Marcus Chown describes in the Afterglow of Creation how the discovery of the cosmic microwave background was made. It's existence had been predicted before. Detecting it however, turned out be very hard. A lot of people were involved, therefore a lot of people are mentioned in this book.The book goes on and on about failed experiment methods. I found this a little hard to get trough. This could definitely have been shorter.Years after the discovery of the cosmic microwave background, a 'baby photo of the universe' was created with the help of another satellite launch. This proces is also described in a lot of detail.I feel like this book would have really benefitted from some images of the detected spectra (and mentioned space probes for that matter).Overall an alright book with a lot of information to take in, surrounding the discoveries and people involved in the detection of the afterglow of the big bang."

5,0571250599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5976331-neil-denham,4,"An easy to read telling of the story of how scientists searched for evidence of the microwave radiation from the big bang. It may sound complex (and some of the science is) but the story is one of peoples persistence and ingenuity. A really good tale spanning most of a century of science, and many characters, setbacks and breakthroughs. Will be seeking out more of Chown's books as soon as possible!"
6,0571250599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/381867-helen-callaghan,5,"Fascinating dicussion on the history of background microwave radiation research, and what it tells us about the early universe.If you're anything like me, something threatening to talk about radiation microwaves probably sounds hopelessly dry, but the subject matter is delivered in such a way that the issues are clear, and yet the reader is not patronised, and can enjoy the potential mind-blowingness of the discoveries without a degree in astrophysics. Really recommended. "
7,0571250599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9795929-liz,4,Loads of sciencey loveliness in a way that a doofus like me can understand. It’s his first book (updated) and it follows the experiments and discoveries surrounding the CMB. It very easy to follow cause you work from the basics up to the holy hell what is happening in little teeny steps interspersed with anecdotes from the scientists themselves to keep you happy.
8,0571250599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53483800-alyson-walton,5,"fantastic read, very well explained. As a rule, the subject of science/physics is only approached by people with a higher than average IQ. This is a shame as a book such as this can make the subject accessible to all. On the back of this book i have purchased another three of marcus chown books and look forward to reading them"
9,0571250599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11620003-niall,4,"I really enjoyed this book, and I agree with most of the reviewers of it. The main thing I would like to add would be that this is a good example of science being done, and how it is done, with a nice mix of theorising, luck and hard graft, with a bit of the glory thrown in as well. I would be interested now in seeing what changes have come in since the early 90s when my copy was written."
10,0571250599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7693836-finn,4,"An interesting read on a topic that isn't commonly covered in detail in popular science books. Had a good mix of science, history and humour. Suitable for anyone with an interest in the Cosmic microwave background."
11,0571250599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5152233-roddy,3,Reading this after one of Chown's latest books I was disappointed. I think this was his first and perhaps he was still finding his voice. I found it a bit dry and unstimulating - practicing scientists would probably get more from it as it deals with the excitement of experimental science.

14,0571250599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16864650-gideon-cross,5,This book is a bit dated in terms of the science now.I simply enjoyed it a little more than his later book: The Magic Furnace.
15,0571250599,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12752654-david-ray,3,Interesting but very drawn out. Could have been reduced in length by a third.
