0,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1477685-ted,1,"Update: I ended up publishing a longer version of this - with a discussion of the trend towards more addictive technology in the tech industry more broadly - on the Huffington Post. It covers a lot of the same stuff in this review, but is likely a bit more polished: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ted-mcc...----------------I’ve heard a great deal about this book in the past month - first, I saw Eyal give a talk here in San Francisco (I hadn't heard of him, but someone recommended I go - the talk was sold out and a spot opened up), then someone at a meeting mentioned the book/talk and said it was 'amazing', then the other day I heard him featured on an episode of Planet Money. At least within the tech scene, it seems this book is very well-known, and that, to some extent, scares me. (And to put that into context, I'm a technology designer/researcher - i.e., I'm the kind of person who should be absolutely frothing at the mouth (happily) about this thing.)Most of the reviews I've been seeing have been addressing Eyal's execution of the 'Hooked' concept, which I'd give something like a 2.5 - the ideas are clearly expressed, but the writing is fairly dumbed down, and the book's ideas could (and given his writing style, should) have been expressed in about a quarter of the length.My biggest problem with the book is its basic premise, that 'hooking' people - that is, making them compulsive users of your technology product - is something worth doing. Eyal makes a number of assumptions about the benefits of technology here - he commonly alludes to Facebook, Instagram, et al as 'solving' our feelings of loneliness, for instance. Among many other occurrences, a line in the book says Instagram ""helps users dispel boredom by connecting them with others."" Everything about technology use is placed in a positive light - 'solving' problems, 'connecting' users. It's the standard litany of Silicon Valley Tech Speak, but bumped up a great many RPMs and set on continuous repeat.The idea of 'hooking' a user to your product is strikingly similar to that of causing a user 'to be addicted' to your product, including use of the same mechanisms to do it. The third piece of the 'hook' cycle is the use of variable rewards to help make users habitual users of your product, for example - this is the exact mechanism that makes gambling so potentially addictive. Even the book's cover art shows a mouse pointer clicking somewhere near the nucleus accumbens of a brain, the dopamine center manipulated by variable rewards that help fuel behavioral addictions. Eyal discusses how, in the 1950's, Olds and Milner would stimulate mice in this region, and see them forgo food and water in exchange for more stimulation. (Think 'Infinite Jest', with mice in cages.) If his book espouses manipulation, at least he's (relatively) honest about it.Eyal discusses - very briefly, at the very end of his talk/book - the morality of manipulating people in this way, and of causing, if you successfully carry out his formula and do everything else right, your users to develop behavioral addictions to your product. But his discussion of morality is too little, too late - during his talk, he spends forty minutes discussing how his model will allow audience members to build the next Facebook, and then five minutes pleading with them to use this information only to improve the world. ""Basically, I want you all to use this for good,"" he begs, and then quotes Gandhi (yes, really), ""Be the change you wish to see in the world."" (The Mahatma, by the way, apparently never actually said this.) That's about it. When I saw the talk, I suspected he added this bit at the end to appease sane-minded audience members and prevent heckling.In the book, at least, Eyal includes a short chapter near the end discussing the morality of this approach, and, perhaps as a way of showing how his 'hooked' formula can be used for good, a case study illustrating how a Bible app - YouVersion - carries out (more or less) the four steps of the hooked model. (The chapter also employs a nauseating number of religious puns: ""Switching to a different digital Bible - God forbid...""; ""Gruenewald's app is a Godsend"", etc.) But it's unconvincing; and it's perhaps telling that the best positive example Eyal can find of a technology product achieving good with his model is 'getting people to read the Bible more', which is dubious at best. I understand that this kind of thing happens all the time - you'd better believe that Facebook, Google, and many other technology companies are many steps ahead of even Eyal in this game. But it bothers me to see it filtered down and formulatized in a set of followable steps. It might bother me less if Eyal emphasized the ways in which this could be used for good throughout the book - for health behavior change, for instance, an area of technology design that's quickly growing and has shown potential for doing actual good. Eyal references Sunstein and Thaler's 'Nudge', another book I just finished (and one that I highly recommend). Those authors also present methods that could be seen as manipulative, but are careful to include frank and lengthy discussions on how to morally employ these techniques - not a hollow plea to 'only do good' with the methods followed by a flippant reading of a Gandhi quote. The authors of 'Nudge', moreover, fill the book with case studies in which their concept has - or at least, can - produce real, substantial benefit for great numbers of people. That book deserves attention and praise - people should be paying attention to *that* one.Paul Graham has somewhat famously said (Eyal even references it) that ""The world is more addictive than it was 40 years ago.... and the world will get more addictive in the next 40 years than it did in the last 40. We'll increasingly be defined by what we say no to."" It bothers me greatly to see a book outlining *how* to make the world more addictive - and weakly excusing itself for doing so - seeing such success, especially here in Silicon Valley, where people designing products that 'touch people's lives' are only learning how to do so more effectively, more thoroughly, more persistently, more addictively."
1,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,4,"Extremely valuable book for anyone building products designed to engage people frequently. Given that I think daily about how to make Goodreads better and more engaging for people, this was a useful book. I think I knew a lot of it already, but often being forced to think about things again can be useful - and there are a few useful new ways of thinking about things that I learned. One of the main useful ideas the book talks about in engaging users is having triggers to bring the user back to the product. This can be an external trigger - like an email or notification or ad that brings the user back - but the best products also form internal triggers. Ever get bored or lonely and find yourself on Facebook? Or wondering what is happening in the world and end up on Twitter? Or see something beautiful or inspiring and then pull out Instagram? Or feel the need to escape and relax and open a book or turn on a movie or a sports game? Our emotions often drive our behavior, and each emotion is mapped to a set of products we could use to ""scratch the itch"" of whatever we are feeling. These mappings become habits. ""Once a technology has created an association in users’ minds that the product is the solution of choice, they return on their own, no longer needing prompts from external triggers.""I think my favorite external triggers mentioned in the book were from the bible app example, where it sent a push notification to people if they walked into a strip club! And it sent another one on xmas day that did well. Timely matters!Nir then talks about how to get users to take actions. The framework is obvious, but very true, and useful to remember when evaluating products. It's fairly well summed up in the below quote. There was a lot of good discussion about point #2 in terms of having simple design, being mobile, etc.there are three ingredients required to initiate any and all behaviors: (1) the user must have sufficient motivation; (2) the user must have the ability to complete the desired action; and (3) a trigger must be present to activate the behavior.""Another point Nir makes around actions - which is also an obvious one but worth really paying attention to when designing a product - is around getting frequent engagement with a product when a user is new to it.""For new behaviors to really take hold, they must occur often.""""frequent engagement with a product—especially over a short period of time—increases the likelihood of forming new routines.""The author then talks about variable rewards. I've known that variability - or serendipitousness as I like to think of it - is a very important driver of any engaging product. It's why we love sports, gambling, games, Facebook newsfeed, and good stories - not knowing what we'll find is exciting. Nir breaks down variable rewards into three types - the tribe, the hunt, and the self. The tribe is social validation - think of Facebook likes on content you posted. The hunt is something intrinsic in our brains that dates back to prehistoric times when we literally lived for the hunt - think of hunting for interesting content on your Twitter feed, or gambling looking for payoffs. The self is more for personal gratification - wanting to complete a puzzle you started or beat a video game you started."
2,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1501068-anca,1,"This book was a huge disappointment. It is full of speculation and misleading 'information'. It has a very big fluff to substance ratio and the little substance it does present is deprived of all nuance. Arguably, that isn't reason enough to give it one star. The determining factor is the authors tendency of quoting studies and then misrepresenting the findings. For example: a study of the internet usage of 216 students. The study, conducted over the course of a month, found correlation between increased internet usage and indicators of depression. The author of the book presents this correlation with a much greater degree of certainty, he exaggerates the duration of the study, cites methodology that isn't found in the study, selects one possible hypothesis: depressed people use the internet more because it makes them feel better and runs with it, expanding this theory with lush examples of solace seeking Instagram users. The study itself only mentions that it notices an increased number of ""chat octets"" in the traffic analysis and one of the possible explanations is that depressive people are joining depression chat rooms in order to find relief (but they have no way of knowing). I find this kind of mistreatment of research and scientific certainty repulsive."
3,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26821377-annemarie,5,"There is buzz about this book in the SF tech scene. After reading it, I know why!It's well researched. It's interesting. And it's thought-provoking. Nir Eyar masterfully weaves his insights of technology, business and psychology into his four-fold model, which explains how to create habit-forming products.Whether you are an entrepreneur just getting started, a psychologist seeking depth or an avid reader wanting to know more about the world around us, you'll love this book!"
4,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/121770047-alex,5,"I suffered a lot when developing new Internet products for my company. I wondered why some product can make the users addicted while some product cannot. I was faced with many problems and felt really anxious at that time.One day, I drove to work listening to the audio introducing the book “Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products.” It is from an APP named Bookey.https://share.bookey.app/goodreads The main idea of this book summarized by Bookey was very impressive; that is, how to make users “get hooked” on your products.It attracted me a lot, and that was absolutely what I needed! I even stopped in the nearest parking lot to listen to it absorbedly.Then it introduced a totally new idea to me-“Hook Model.” It was said that there are four steps to form users’ reliance on the products, namely triggering users’ desire to act, making users act, providing rewards and making users invest time and efforts. Most importantly, it also introduced some tips on how to use the “Hook Model” when developing new Internet products.I felt that this book was exactly what I need for my work. So I just turned to this book for help. I found that this book was very useful. It includes several cases like Facebook, Twitter, and even a case study focusing on how to build habit-forming products. It inspired me a lot when deciding several functions for the products. Sometimes, I felt the book was a little bit difficult to follow. However, with the outlines provided by the APP Bookey, I could understand the idea of the book much more easily, and also apply it for my Internet products. For example, when I tried to use the “Hook Model” when developing our products, I began with two important questions mentioned both in this book and the APP Bookey: “Will I use this product myself” and “Can this product greatly improve user’s life quality.” Actually, I never thought of the second question when I began to develop my products. I only thought them as my tasks and tried to make my products include all kinds of functions other products used. After that, I just followed the lead of the book and did the “user habit testing” to identify users of our products, to codify users’ behavior, and to modify our products. After doing that, I found myself become a user of our products and was dying for our products. Sometimes, I cannot remember some tips on how to use the “Hook Model,” the APP Bookey helped me a lot since it provided the mind map of the key ideas of the book. Moreover, I could check the APP Bookey whenever I forgot taking the book with me.The product has been in public. Thanks to this book and APP Bookey, the product has gained some attention, and the numbers of active users remain at a satisfactory level. I hope people who are developing new products can turn to “Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products” for help.That’s my understanding of this book, and hope to share thinking about this book with you."

It's pretty short, easy to read, but provides a comprehensive view on the topic.What I loved the most was the fact that author backed up all his statements with evidence. At the end of the book he provides citations, lists scientific studies and articles he mentions. Little personal opinion, a lot of useful info. It's curious how the tech-related psychological research lines up neatly with what I've recently read about psychology of relationships. Pretty cool parallels.I didn't pick up much new info from it because I'm not new to the topic, but I don't see any reasons to give it less than 5 stars. P.S. Also, it explains why I'm HOOKED ON GOODREADS"
6,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44279821-joe-soltzberg,3,"Hooked is an excellent (short) book on the use of psychology in product design. As technology becomes increasingly available to entrepreneurs of all backgrounds, design has become just as important as engineering. Correspondingly, all entrepreneurs should have a good understanding of the principals behind building habit-forming products. In that respect, this book does a great job. This book may not provide any grand revelations or have particularly unique/fascinating case studies, but it is still very valuable (thus the 3 stars, perhaps closer to 3.5). Below I've provided an outline of my notes on the book so that those of us less inclined to read this can still learn the basics. I do still recommend reading the book for the useful examples and exercises at the end of the chapters (which you most definitely should do). I highly recommend reading the book with a specific product in mind that you would like to apply the lessons of Hooked to. The basic idea behind Hooked is the Hook Model. The model consists of four parts:-Trigger-Action-Variable Reward-InvestmentQuite simply, using a trigger should prompt a user to take an action that results in a variable reward, followed by further investment. This cycle should continue to repeat itself until the user becomes 'hooked'. TriggerThe trigger is what makes a user turn to your product. If there isn't a trigger, then what will prompt the user to engage with your product? Nir Eyal explains that there are two types of triggers: external and internal triggers. While external triggers such as an app icon or an advertisement can be useful in getting a user to use your product, truly addictive products use internal triggers. An internal triggers is usually a feeling or emotion that prompts an action to resolve that feeling or emotion. It is easy to see the power of internal triggers. They are omnipresent and a constant part of our lives. Further, it is internal triggers that are the basis of true habit formation on a biological level. Nir Eyal explains:In the case of internal triggers, the information about what to do next is encoded as a learned association in the user's memory.There are numerous examples of this. People use snapchat and instagram to resolve their fear of missing out. People use reddit or facebook to resolve their boredom. Have you ever wondered how you just magically seemed to end up using one of these products? It's because it forms a subconscious habit linked with an emotion. So, when building your product make sure to find the internal trigger that you should have your product be associated with it. That is the first step.ActionNow that you have the trigger, as soon as a user feels that 'itch' your product will pop into their head. But that alone is not enough. It is just as important to make sure that it is easy enough to 'scratch' that itch. The action to do that needs to be a simplistic as possible. After all, if habits are subconscious then it will have to be relatively simple. The book describes the following factors that should be taken into account:There are three ingredients required to initiate any and all behaviors: (1) the user must have sufficient motivation; (2) the user must have the ability to completed the desired action; and (3) a trigger must be present to activate the actionIt is important to focus on motivation and ability. Motivation is often in the form of resolving the emotion associated with the trigger. Ability is where there is much room for innovation. Consider companies like Blogger and Twitter. They made the action of writing significantly easier by reducing the steps necessary to resolve the trigger. This led to massive success. It is important that your action is as simple as possible. Variable RewardNow that the user has engaged with your product, it is important to reward them. All habits end with a reward. When you post a picture on instagram, the reward is likes from other people. When you complete your diary for the day on MyFitnessPal, the reward is a nice message telling you about how successful you've been. Even bad habits have 'rewards'. Cigarettes give you a nicotine high and alcohol can make it feel like your problems are solved (but of course not really). Thus, your product not only has to make it easy to scratch that itch... it must also relieve that itch, but that alone is not enough. The rewards need to be variable. Nir Eyal gives many examples and explanations, but the best is Skinner's Pigeon Experiment. In the experiment there are two groups. One is a group of pigeons that are in a cage where if they press a button they will be given some food pellets, but the amount of food dispensed is the same every time. The second group has the same setup, but is given a variable reward every time; sometimes there is more food and sometimes there is less. Skinner found that adding variability significantly increased the frequency of the pigeons pressing the button. Nir Eyal writes:Skinner's pigeons tell us a great deal about what helps drive our own behaviors. More recent experiments reveal that variability increases activity in the nucleus accumbens and spikes levels of neurotransmitter dopamine, driving our hungry search for rewards.There are many products that inherently do this. For example, on facebook you never know if you'll find good content in the feed or how many likes your status will get. The same phenomenon happened with the early version of Zynga games. So for even stronger habits, a variable reward is necessary.InvestmentThe final step of the Hooked Model is what differentiates it from the traditional Habit Loop (see  The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business). In order to ensure that users come back to your product, it is important to ask the users to make an investment. By making an investment, users will yet another reason to come back to your product, instead of someone else's. There are many products out there that are better than facebook. But, by having users store their data on there and make friends and comment on other people's data it makes it difficult for users to leave. Nir Eyal explains that in studies user's value their own work 4x more than work of higher quality:Those who invested labor associated greater value with their creations simply because they had worked on them. Ariely calls this the IKEA effect. By having your user invest in your product, it makes repeat usage more likely."
7,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3835210-ryan-hoover,5,"I've been an avid read of Nir Eyal's blog (nirandfar.com) for over a year. When he asked if I wanted to work on the book with him, I immediately jumped on the opportunity. I have learned an incredible amount since then that have and will continue to guide my product decisions and perspective on technology.Although I'm clearly biased toward the book, I would not have spent several dozen hours writing and working with Nir if I didn't believe it would be valuable for others."
8,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5246491-suzanne,5,"Excellent, well-written book. I've been reading Nir's blog for a while now so was already a fan. Nir and Ryan do a great job of bringing everything together in the Hooked process and laying it out in a logical and motivating way. The book takes you through the theory, giving examples to bring the theory alive and then provides exercises at the end of each chapter to help you take what you've learned and immediately apply it to your own product or service. It was refreshing to see a lot of new stories/examples in between some of the familiar ones. I particularly loved all of the psychology behind habits. Hooked introduced me to the concept of reactance (in the psychology sense). Pretty powerful stuff. Overall, this was fascinating content which is making me think about each of the apps on my iPhone/iPad and how they've either hooked me … or haven't. "
9,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145381-brian,4,"(4.5) Really good stuff, actually actionableIn particular, I like the directives at the end of each chapter driving you to think about your own product, how you can use the Hooked principles to improve its stickiness. Also liked the Bible case study he added, though I think he should've made the analysis more rigorously follow the principles, if only in a data sheet format saying how each of the principles are applied. Then dive into the cooler narrative.But this is really well organized and written. Coherent, presented clearly and actionable. Also makes me want to read some more Ariely, Dan, books. :)"
10,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7195895-elisa,5,"I decided to read this book, because I am a long-time follower of the author's blog. Being a psychologist that works in user experience design, I at first was not sure how much I'd gain from a book written on a subject I consider myself to have deep knowledge of. However, I found it to be a great book and I did learn a lot. I'd recommend this book for anyone that's interested in learning how psychological mechanisms can be used to form habits, and therefore keep people ""hooked"" on their products. "
11,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13680195-arjun,3,"I highly recommend this book for anyone building a technology company or anyone who has interest in products.As someone who's spend the last couple of years reading extensively about product and user psychology, I didn't find the book extremely insightful, but the book is very good for anyone who wants to get a baseline understanding of how to build and reinforce habits in products.Books like this are worth their value because they give you a new lens to see the world. The success state would be reading this book and then seeing patterns emerge every day in the products you use (and applying that knowledge in products you build). At a minimum, the introduction and first few chapters do a fantastic job introducing the ""framework"" for how to think about products. Knowledge isn't very useful without application though -- after reading this book, I recommend trying some habit-forming products to see technique in practice. Some apps that do this particularly well are Lift, codecademy and fitocracy (I find that health/fitness/edtech/behavior change applications make a very conscious effort to put use these techniques for Good). "
12,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1252572-sarah,2,"Would've given it 1 star, but since it got me to actually download the Bible App to see why Goodreads is constantly #8 to its #7, I threw it an extra star."

14,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18409907-kartik-santhanakrishnan,4,"I'll start with a complaint because I want to get my grumpiness out of the way before I take it out on someone at work. This book should have been 50% as long as it is. Perhaps even shorter. Do authors seriously think that more words is the same as getting your point across? In all fairness, there were synopses at appropriate places in the book, so you could skip any nonsense and go through just salient points. Despite that, the book should have been way shorter. Take a star off. There. I feel better already.Having gotten that out of the way, the Hook model described in the book is very useful. Hooking a user has four elements: 1. Trigger: What is the itch that the user needs to scratch2. Action: What is she going to do next?3. Variable reward: What is she going to get for it? Is she satisfied yet wanting more?4. Investment: The more work and time the user invests, the more she will keep coming back to it.There is a lot more in this book about different types of triggers, variable rewards and investments. The book also has some useful nuggets about product testing or habit testing. Above all, the most important part of the book is the sections that ask you to evaluate the products you are building now. That somehow drove home the message far more effectively than anything else in the book. Perhaps that's just my learning style - learn by doing.There are a number of jobs/roles in which I could have used the lessons from this book. Overall, 4 stars for how much this book is going to help me hone products and technology over time. "

It’s written in a humble and inquisitive tone. The objective literary style spoke to my research-based soul. I'm constantly seeking to follow the works (and words) of those who are solving real problems in the world. Nir Eyal is one of them. I definitely recommend the book. It’s a quick read, with the feel of an extended blog post (my only criticism, really). After completing Hooked, I emailed Nir to thank him for his wise words. He was gracious enough to respond and invite me to his conference this upcoming April. How cool is that? Props to authors who don’t sit on untouchable thrones above their readers. "

The general idea is that to engage and keep users to use your product you should better develop a habit you should understand users' true underlying motivators (pleasure/pain, safety/fear, social acceptability/loneliness) , then understand and provide triggers , make users to invest time/money/data into your product, understand users behavior/lifestyle/story to know when user has resources to execute habit. The best understanding comes from your own experience- monitor yourself, your friends/relatives, try to replace habits which are already formed by offline/old school things (""job to be done"" as Clayton Christensen writes).

Hooked explains the utopia of product designers - building something that your users can get addicted to, something that if your users don't use, it hurts them.

However, this book has now made me see the wisdom in that offhand comment.Hooked is roundly recommended by every product person and builder of any repute in tech. Either these simple haven't read the book or they are just plain stupid. Nir Eyal's seductively titled book offers to pull the veil behind the success of companies like Facebook, Paypal, Airbnb, and other billion-dollar behemoths that has anyone who has ever successfully gotten ""Hello World"" to be executed in C++, frothing at the mouth. The book is a post-facto look at these companies and how they ""created"" virality. It offers the promise that you too can use these frameworks to create the next viral product. This is the problem. When Zuck designed Facebook or Facemash, he wasn't thinking about how to use the Endowment Effect to increase value or studying Behavioral Econ to codify how he could incorporate variable rewards in the form of likes and comments to keep people coming back to the platform. Simply, people who build viral products were not using a framework. So, this reduction of virality and stickiness to a few factors is absurd at best and asinine at worst.Here is my attempt at using the ""Hooked"" framework to analyze a habit-forming product - toothpaste. If you keenly observe, the internal trigger for someone to use a toothpaste is not to have bad breath so that they can signal to potential mates of their preferred genders of their genetic robustness. On understanding, this crucial insight, toothpaste companies can create a product. They should be careful that it isn't a product that you use once and it solves your problem. You must keep the user coming back to it at a determined frequency, say once every morning after they wake up. This variable reward compared with the internal trigger will cause virality and make your toothpaste viral (and also your competition which reduces your product to becoming a commodity but let's not think about that for now). Now, use this framework in the productivity app you are building to get everyone in the world ""hooked"" to your product. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk! *If you work in product, you should be furiously applauding right now*I want to revisit the early maxim I was introduced to - Don't read any business book that is less than 10 years old. This book simply packages what was old into new with jargon. Clay Christensen's Job-To-Be-Done and Ted Levitt's - ""People want quarter-inch holes, not drills maxim"" is timeless for a reason. Those ideas were developed through unbiased common sense and articulated through simple language and far more importantly, have been successfully reproduced over and over again. The same cannot be said for ideas expressed in Hooked. This book is a fine example of a misguided blog post that became a book because snake-oil sells well during a gold rush. When no one knows what they are doing, the arcane becomes interesting. If you are considering reading this, look for an article on Clay Christen's JBTD and read Ted Levitt's Marketing Myopia essay. Once you finish them, try to summarize what they are saying. Yes, I am saying, read a little to educate yourself and maybe, just maybe, think for yourself. If you are going to be building a billion-dollar product, you may seek all the advice you want but you are going to have to think for yourself and make decisions based on your convictions and be able to explain them so that others can understand. Be wary of anyone who tries to sell you a secret. Listen with an open mind and evaluate the ""secret"" on its merits. As Naval Ravikanth said on Joe Rogan - There are no new ideas. All new ideas are old ideas and someone has probably already said it better. I hate that this book has made me agree with Naval Ravikanth who I find to be insufferable. But I assume that is perhaps growth, you don't have to like the person to think their idea has merit. I don't like Hooked, perhaps Nir Eyal is a good product person."

It's often not about solving a problem or satisfying the user but actually about removing pain that might have been created by the product itself in the first place and how to keep the consumer ""in the loop"".Habit-forming products:*Attract long-term customers.*Do the advertising for you.*Have a strong competitive position.*Companies can be more flexible when pricing habit-forming products.The 4 states of the Hook model:*The trigger: an external event that gets us to try a product for the first time, for example a TV commercial.*The action: what we need to do in order to user the product, for example registering on an online community.*The reward: the fulfillment of the need that originally motivated us to take action, for example being entertained if the motivation was boredom.*The investment: something of value that we have invested in the product, such as time, money or information.The last step leads back to the start of the cycle and these steps are repeated over and over again, the user starts to develop internal triggers instead of external ones.Normally we use products to solve problems that we have. Most typically those problems have to do with avoiding pain or feeling pleasure. Often the most powerful internal triggers are negative emotions (boredom of fear of social disconnection, FOMO..).It takes action if preconditions are filled: a trigger is needed, person must be sufficiently motivated to take action and be capable of doing so. Companies should prioritize increasing the user's ability to use the product (it's far easier and cheaper to make the product easier to use than to increase user's motivation). Human motivation usually consists of simple goals like seeking pleasure and avoiding pain, seeking hope and avoiding fear, and seeking social acceptance and avoiding rejection. Our craving for rewards actually causes a stronger emotional reaction than receiving the reward itself (variability, unpredictable award i.e. in Casino). Ultimately reward must always relate to the user's initial motivation to use the product. Investment:*We see things more valuable if we have invested something in them.*We try to be consistent in our own behavior.*We have the tendency to adjust our world view to suit our behavior. Responsible product design:*Does the product enhance the user's lives?*Would the entrepreneur himself use the product?“79 percent of smartphone owners check their device within 15 minutes of waking up every morning.” “Gourville claims that for new entrants to stand a chance, they can’t just be better, they must be nine times better. Why such a high bar? Because old habits die hard and new products or services need to offer dramatic improvements to shake users out of old routines. Gourville writes that products that require a high degree of behavior change are doomed to fail even if the benefits of using the new product are clear and substantial.” “Many innovations fail because consumers irrationally overvalue the old while companies irrationally overvalue the new.” “Instead of relying on expensive marketing, habit-forming companies link their services to the users’ daily routines and emotions.” “To change behavior, products must ensure the user feels in control. People must want to use the service, not feel they have to.”"

People just don't think in these terms. You'll often find that people's declared preferences - what they say they want - are far different from their revealed preferences-what they actually do. The more effort we put into something, the more likely we are to value it....the first place for the entrepreneur or designer to look for new opportunities is in the mirror. ...ask ""what problem do I wish someone else would solve for me?""The Scarcity Effect - The appearance of scarcity affects people's perception of value.The cookie example - there are two jars of filled with the same cookies, the first one has 12 cookies, the other one just 2. People will value the second jar cookies higher because of the scarcity effect.The Framing Effect - The mind takes shortcuts informed by our surroundings to make quick and sometimes erroneous judgments.The Bell example. World-class violinist Joshua Bell played a free impromptu concert in Washington D.C. subway station, but only few people stopped to listen, whereas his concerts in Carnegie Hall for hundreds of dollars tickets are sell-outs.The Anchoring Effect - People often anchor to one piece of information when making a decision. The Endowed Progress Effect - ... a phenomenon that increases motivation as people believe they are nearing a goal.The car wash example - 2 groups of customers were given punch cards awarding a free car wash once the cards fully punched. One group got a blank punch card with 8 squares, the other was given card with 10 squares with 2 already punched. The group 2 had 82% higher completion rate. Rewards of the Tribe - Our brains are adapted to seek rewards that make us feel accepted, attractive, important, and included.Rewards of the Hunt - The need to acquire objects, such as food and other supplies that aid our survival, is part of our brain's operating system.The five fundamental questions:1. What do users really want? What pain is your product relieving? (Internal trigger)2. What brings users to your service? (External trigger)3. What is the simplest action users take in anticipation of reward, and how you simplify your product to make this action easier? (Action)4. Are users fulfilled by the reward yet left wanting more? (Variable reward)5. What ""bit of work"" do users invest in your product? Does it load the next trigger and store value to improve the product with use (Investment)"

(The point is you never know, even the apps / tasks designed to be used / performed occasionally might change customers' routines and make them addicted or ""hooked"" without them acknowledging that.)We have been using online applications or playing games for a significant stage of our life, that's why we already have vague or well-formed (for some) idea about majority of the concepts detailed in the book. That's why, now if we are creating this applications ourselves, these techniques such as variable rewards seem so obvious to us and we implement it without giving it a thought. That's the beauty of creating products that you love. Why read this book :1) Despite the fact that a significant share of the content is obvious to us, it makes you pause, think & reflect. ""Why do you want to use this feature in your app? Because you have used similar products before and you have an ikling that some of your actions were affected by which features."" If you want to build new habits, it's vital to understand the basic pyschology behind users' actions.2) It gives you quite a few moments to recall your own actions of past and present when you were(are) ""hooked"". If you need to get rid of any such habits, this book might help. Well, I personally doubt that but my dataset is too small to be taken seriously.3) There are exercises that you should definitely do if they are applicable to your product.4) I happen to find some or most of the facts in other design books as well, probably they are common knowlegde in design field, but none of them are written in the engaging way ""Hooked"" is, that is, with relevant examples and explanations. However, I've read very few books on design but ""Hooked"" stands out.Negatives :1) A bit repetitive.But in that case, you can simply skip that repetitive content. I think readers impose too many rules on themselves for reading. In my opinion, reading output should be weighed in terms of how much you gain out of a book that you can apply in real lives and not the number of books you read 100%.Recommended to :1) Must read for anyone creating any online product or apps.2) Might be useful for users who believe that they are addicted to some application and that it's interfering with their lives."
30,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1477685-ted,1,"Update: I ended up publishing a longer version of this - with a discussion of the trend towards more addictive technology in the tech industry more broadly - on the Huffington Post. It covers a lot of the same stuff in this review, but is likely a bit more polished: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ted-mcc...----------------I’ve heard a great deal about this book in the past month - first, I saw Eyal give a talk here in San Francisco (I hadn't heard of him, but someone recommended I go - the talk was sold out and a spot opened up), then someone at a meeting mentioned the book/talk and said it was 'amazing', then the other day I heard him featured on an episode of Planet Money. At least within the tech scene, it seems this book is very well-known, and that, to some extent, scares me. (And to put that into context, I'm a technology designer/researcher - i.e., I'm the kind of person who should be absolutely frothing at the mouth (happily) about this thing.)Most of the reviews I've been seeing have been addressing Eyal's execution of the 'Hooked' concept, which I'd give something like a 2.5 - the ideas are clearly expressed, but the writing is fairly dumbed down, and the book's ideas could (and given his writing style, should) have been expressed in about a quarter of the length.My biggest problem with the book is its basic premise, that 'hooking' people - that is, making them compulsive users of your technology product - is something worth doing. Eyal makes a number of assumptions about the benefits of technology here - he commonly alludes to Facebook, Instagram, et al as 'solving' our feelings of loneliness, for instance. Among many other occurrences, a line in the book says Instagram ""helps users dispel boredom by connecting them with others."" Everything about technology use is placed in a positive light - 'solving' problems, 'connecting' users. It's the standard litany of Silicon Valley Tech Speak, but bumped up a great many RPMs and set on continuous repeat.The idea of 'hooking' a user to your product is strikingly similar to that of causing a user 'to be addicted' to your product, including use of the same mechanisms to do it. The third piece of the 'hook' cycle is the use of variable rewards to help make users habitual users of your product, for example - this is the exact mechanism that makes gambling so potentially addictive. Even the book's cover art shows a mouse pointer clicking somewhere near the nucleus accumbens of a brain, the dopamine center manipulated by variable rewards that help fuel behavioral addictions. Eyal discusses how, in the 1950's, Olds and Milner would stimulate mice in this region, and see them forgo food and water in exchange for more stimulation. (Think 'Infinite Jest', with mice in cages.) If his book espouses manipulation, at least he's (relatively) honest about it.Eyal discusses - very briefly, at the very end of his talk/book - the morality of manipulating people in this way, and of causing, if you successfully carry out his formula and do everything else right, your users to develop behavioral addictions to your product. But his discussion of morality is too little, too late - during his talk, he spends forty minutes discussing how his model will allow audience members to build the next Facebook, and then five minutes pleading with them to use this information only to improve the world. ""Basically, I want you all to use this for good,"" he begs, and then quotes Gandhi (yes, really), ""Be the change you wish to see in the world."" (The Mahatma, by the way, apparently never actually said this.) That's about it. When I saw the talk, I suspected he added this bit at the end to appease sane-minded audience members and prevent heckling.In the book, at least, Eyal includes a short chapter near the end discussing the morality of this approach, and, perhaps as a way of showing how his 'hooked' formula can be used for good, a case study illustrating how a Bible app - YouVersion - carries out (more or less) the four steps of the hooked model. (The chapter also employs a nauseating number of religious puns: ""Switching to a different digital Bible - God forbid...""; ""Gruenewald's app is a Godsend"", etc.) But it's unconvincing; and it's perhaps telling that the best positive example Eyal can find of a technology product achieving good with his model is 'getting people to read the Bible more', which is dubious at best. I understand that this kind of thing happens all the time - you'd better believe that Facebook, Google, and many other technology companies are many steps ahead of even Eyal in this game. But it bothers me to see it filtered down and formulatized in a set of followable steps. It might bother me less if Eyal emphasized the ways in which this could be used for good throughout the book - for health behavior change, for instance, an area of technology design that's quickly growing and has shown potential for doing actual good. Eyal references Sunstein and Thaler's 'Nudge', another book I just finished (and one that I highly recommend). Those authors also present methods that could be seen as manipulative, but are careful to include frank and lengthy discussions on how to morally employ these techniques - not a hollow plea to 'only do good' with the methods followed by a flippant reading of a Gandhi quote. The authors of 'Nudge', moreover, fill the book with case studies in which their concept has - or at least, can - produce real, substantial benefit for great numbers of people. That book deserves attention and praise - people should be paying attention to *that* one.Paul Graham has somewhat famously said (Eyal even references it) that ""The world is more addictive than it was 40 years ago.... and the world will get more addictive in the next 40 years than it did in the last 40. We'll increasingly be defined by what we say no to."" It bothers me greatly to see a book outlining *how* to make the world more addictive - and weakly excusing itself for doing so - seeing such success, especially here in Silicon Valley, where people designing products that 'touch people's lives' are only learning how to do so more effectively, more thoroughly, more persistently, more addictively."
31,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,4,"Extremely valuable book for anyone building products designed to engage people frequently. Given that I think daily about how to make Goodreads better and more engaging for people, this was a useful book. I think I knew a lot of it already, but often being forced to think about things again can be useful - and there are a few useful new ways of thinking about things that I learned. One of the main useful ideas the book talks about in engaging users is having triggers to bring the user back to the product. This can be an external trigger - like an email or notification or ad that brings the user back - but the best products also form internal triggers. Ever get bored or lonely and find yourself on Facebook? Or wondering what is happening in the world and end up on Twitter? Or see something beautiful or inspiring and then pull out Instagram? Or feel the need to escape and relax and open a book or turn on a movie or a sports game? Our emotions often drive our behavior, and each emotion is mapped to a set of products we could use to ""scratch the itch"" of whatever we are feeling. These mappings become habits. ""Once a technology has created an association in users’ minds that the product is the solution of choice, they return on their own, no longer needing prompts from external triggers.""I think my favorite external triggers mentioned in the book were from the bible app example, where it sent a push notification to people if they walked into a strip club! And it sent another one on xmas day that did well. Timely matters!Nir then talks about how to get users to take actions. The framework is obvious, but very true, and useful to remember when evaluating products. It's fairly well summed up in the below quote. There was a lot of good discussion about point #2 in terms of having simple design, being mobile, etc.there are three ingredients required to initiate any and all behaviors: (1) the user must have sufficient motivation; (2) the user must have the ability to complete the desired action; and (3) a trigger must be present to activate the behavior.""Another point Nir makes around actions - which is also an obvious one but worth really paying attention to when designing a product - is around getting frequent engagement with a product when a user is new to it.""For new behaviors to really take hold, they must occur often.""""frequent engagement with a product—especially over a short period of time—increases the likelihood of forming new routines.""The author then talks about variable rewards. I've known that variability - or serendipitousness as I like to think of it - is a very important driver of any engaging product. It's why we love sports, gambling, games, Facebook newsfeed, and good stories - not knowing what we'll find is exciting. Nir breaks down variable rewards into three types - the tribe, the hunt, and the self. The tribe is social validation - think of Facebook likes on content you posted. The hunt is something intrinsic in our brains that dates back to prehistoric times when we literally lived for the hunt - think of hunting for interesting content on your Twitter feed, or gambling looking for payoffs. The self is more for personal gratification - wanting to complete a puzzle you started or beat a video game you started."
32,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1501068-anca,1,"This book was a huge disappointment. It is full of speculation and misleading 'information'. It has a very big fluff to substance ratio and the little substance it does present is deprived of all nuance. Arguably, that isn't reason enough to give it one star. The determining factor is the authors tendency of quoting studies and then misrepresenting the findings. For example: a study of the internet usage of 216 students. The study, conducted over the course of a month, found correlation between increased internet usage and indicators of depression. The author of the book presents this correlation with a much greater degree of certainty, he exaggerates the duration of the study, cites methodology that isn't found in the study, selects one possible hypothesis: depressed people use the internet more because it makes them feel better and runs with it, expanding this theory with lush examples of solace seeking Instagram users. The study itself only mentions that it notices an increased number of ""chat octets"" in the traffic analysis and one of the possible explanations is that depressive people are joining depression chat rooms in order to find relief (but they have no way of knowing). I find this kind of mistreatment of research and scientific certainty repulsive."

I wondered why some product can make the users addicted while some product cannot. I was faced with many problems and felt really anxious at that time.One day, I drove to work listening to the audio introducing the book “Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products.” It is from an APP named Bookey.https://share.bookey.app/goodreads The main idea of this book summarized by Bookey was very impressive; that is, how to make users “get hooked” on your products.It attracted me a lot, and that was absolutely what I needed! I even stopped in the nearest parking lot to listen to it absorbedly.Then it introduced a totally new idea to me-“Hook Model.” It was said that there are four steps to form users’ reliance on the products, namely triggering users’ desire to act, making users act, providing rewards and making users invest time and efforts. Most importantly, it also introduced some tips on how to use the “Hook Model” when developing new Internet products.I felt that this book was exactly what I need for my work. So I just turned to this book for help. I found that this book was very useful. It includes several cases like Facebook, Twitter, and even a case study focusing on how to build habit-forming products. It inspired me a lot when deciding several functions for the products. Sometimes, I felt the book was a little bit difficult to follow. However, with the outlines provided by the APP Bookey, I could understand the idea of the book much more easily, and also apply it for my Internet products. For example, when I tried to use the “Hook Model” when developing our products, I began with two important questions mentioned both in this book and the APP Bookey: “Will I use this product myself” and “Can this product greatly improve user’s life quality.” Actually, I never thought of the second question when I began to develop my products. I only thought them as my tasks and tried to make my products include all kinds of functions other products used. After that, I just followed the lead of the book and did the “user habit testing” to identify users of our products, to codify users’ behavior, and to modify our products. After doing that, I found myself become a user of our products and was dying for our products. Sometimes, I cannot remember some tips on how to use the “Hook Model,” the APP Bookey helped me a lot since it provided the mind map of the key ideas of the book. Moreover, I could check the APP Bookey whenever I forgot taking the book with me.The product has been in public. Thanks to this book and APP Bookey, the product has gained some attention, and the numbers of active users remain at a satisfactory level. I hope people who are developing new products can turn to “Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products” for help.That’s my understanding of this book, and hope to share thinking about this book with you."

36,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44279821-joe-soltzberg,3,"Hooked is an excellent (short) book on the use of psychology in product design. As technology becomes increasingly available to entrepreneurs of all backgrounds, design has become just as important as engineering. Correspondingly, all entrepreneurs should have a good understanding of the principals behind building habit-forming products. In that respect, this book does a great job. This book may not provide any grand revelations or have particularly unique/fascinating case studies, but it is still very valuable (thus the 3 stars, perhaps closer to 3.5). Below I've provided an outline of my notes on the book so that those of us less inclined to read this can still learn the basics. I do still recommend reading the book for the useful examples and exercises at the end of the chapters (which you most definitely should do). I highly recommend reading the book with a specific product in mind that you would like to apply the lessons of Hooked to. The basic idea behind Hooked is the Hook Model. The model consists of four parts:-Trigger-Action-Variable Reward-InvestmentQuite simply, using a trigger should prompt a user to take an action that results in a variable reward, followed by further investment. This cycle should continue to repeat itself until the user becomes 'hooked'. TriggerThe trigger is what makes a user turn to your product. If there isn't a trigger, then what will prompt the user to engage with your product? Nir Eyal explains that there are two types of triggers: external and internal triggers. While external triggers such as an app icon or an advertisement can be useful in getting a user to use your product, truly addictive products use internal triggers. An internal triggers is usually a feeling or emotion that prompts an action to resolve that feeling or emotion. It is easy to see the power of internal triggers. They are omnipresent and a constant part of our lives. Further, it is internal triggers that are the basis of true habit formation on a biological level. Nir Eyal explains:In the case of internal triggers, the information about what to do next is encoded as a learned association in the user's memory.There are numerous examples of this. People use snapchat and instagram to resolve their fear of missing out. People use reddit or facebook to resolve their boredom. Have you ever wondered how you just magically seemed to end up using one of these products? It's because it forms a subconscious habit linked with an emotion. So, when building your product make sure to find the internal trigger that you should have your product be associated with it. That is the first step.ActionNow that you have the trigger, as soon as a user feels that 'itch' your product will pop into their head. But that alone is not enough. It is just as important to make sure that it is easy enough to 'scratch' that itch. The action to do that needs to be a simplistic as possible. After all, if habits are subconscious then it will have to be relatively simple. The book describes the following factors that should be taken into account:There are three ingredients required to initiate any and all behaviors: (1) the user must have sufficient motivation; (2) the user must have the ability to completed the desired action; and (3) a trigger must be present to activate the actionIt is important to focus on motivation and ability. Motivation is often in the form of resolving the emotion associated with the trigger. Ability is where there is much room for innovation. Consider companies like Blogger and Twitter. They made the action of writing significantly easier by reducing the steps necessary to resolve the trigger. This led to massive success. It is important that your action is as simple as possible. Variable RewardNow that the user has engaged with your product, it is important to reward them. All habits end with a reward. When you post a picture on instagram, the reward is likes from other people. When you complete your diary for the day on MyFitnessPal, the reward is a nice message telling you about how successful you've been. Even bad habits have 'rewards'. Cigarettes give you a nicotine high and alcohol can make it feel like your problems are solved (but of course not really). Thus, your product not only has to make it easy to scratch that itch... it must also relieve that itch, but that alone is not enough. The rewards need to be variable. Nir Eyal gives many examples and explanations, but the best is Skinner's Pigeon Experiment. In the experiment there are two groups. One is a group of pigeons that are in a cage where if they press a button they will be given some food pellets, but the amount of food dispensed is the same every time. The second group has the same setup, but is given a variable reward every time; sometimes there is more food and sometimes there is less. Skinner found that adding variability significantly increased the frequency of the pigeons pressing the button. Nir Eyal writes:Skinner's pigeons tell us a great deal about what helps drive our own behaviors. More recent experiments reveal that variability increases activity in the nucleus accumbens and spikes levels of neurotransmitter dopamine, driving our hungry search for rewards.There are many products that inherently do this. For example, on facebook you never know if you'll find good content in the feed or how many likes your status will get. The same phenomenon happened with the early version of Zynga games. So for even stronger habits, a variable reward is necessary.InvestmentThe final step of the Hooked Model is what differentiates it from the traditional Habit Loop (see  The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business). In order to ensure that users come back to your product, it is important to ask the users to make an investment. By making an investment, users will yet another reason to come back to your product, instead of someone else's. There are many products out there that are better than facebook. But, by having users store their data on there and make friends and comment on other people's data it makes it difficult for users to leave. Nir Eyal explains that in studies user's value their own work 4x more than work of higher quality:Those who invested labor associated greater value with their creations simply because they had worked on them. Ariely calls this the IKEA effect. By having your user invest in your product, it makes repeat usage more likely."

Nir and Ryan do a great job of bringing everything together in the Hooked process and laying it out in a logical and motivating way. The book takes you through the theory, giving examples to bring the theory alive and then provides exercises at the end of each chapter to help you take what you've learned and immediately apply it to your own product or service. It was refreshing to see a lot of new stories/examples in between some of the familiar ones. I particularly loved all of the psychology behind habits. Hooked introduced me to the concept of reactance (in the psychology sense). Pretty powerful stuff. Overall, this was fascinating content which is making me think about each of the apps on my iPhone/iPad and how they've either hooked me … or haven't. "

Also liked the Bible case study he added, though I think he should've made the analysis more rigorously follow the principles, if only in a data sheet format saying how each of the principles are applied. Then dive into the cooler narrative.But this is really well organized and written. Coherent, presented clearly and actionable. Also makes me want to read some more Ariely, Dan, books. :)"
40,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7195895-elisa,5,"I decided to read this book, because I am a long-time follower of the author's blog. Being a psychologist that works in user experience design, I at first was not sure how much I'd gain from a book written on a subject I consider myself to have deep knowledge of. However, I found it to be a great book and I did learn a lot. I'd recommend this book for anyone that's interested in learning how psychological mechanisms can be used to form habits, and therefore keep people ""hooked"" on their products. "
41,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13680195-arjun,3,"I highly recommend this book for anyone building a technology company or anyone who has interest in products.As someone who's spend the last couple of years reading extensively about product and user psychology, I didn't find the book extremely insightful, but the book is very good for anyone who wants to get a baseline understanding of how to build and reinforce habits in products.Books like this are worth their value because they give you a new lens to see the world. The success state would be reading this book and then seeing patterns emerge every day in the products you use (and applying that knowledge in products you build). At a minimum, the introduction and first few chapters do a fantastic job introducing the ""framework"" for how to think about products. Knowledge isn't very useful without application though -- after reading this book, I recommend trying some habit-forming products to see technique in practice. Some apps that do this particularly well are Lift, codecademy and fitocracy (I find that health/fitness/edtech/behavior change applications make a very conscious effort to put use these techniques for Good).

44,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18409907-kartik-santhanakrishnan,4,"I'll start with a complaint because I want to get my grumpiness out of the way before I take it out on someone at work. This book should have been 50% as long as it is. Perhaps even shorter. Do authors seriously think that more words is the same as getting your point across? In all fairness, there were synopses at appropriate places in the book, so you could skip any nonsense and go through just salient points. Despite that, the book should have been way shorter. Take a star off. There. I feel better already.Having gotten that out of the way, the Hook model described in the book is very useful. Hooking a user has four elements: 1. Trigger: What is the itch that the user needs to scratch2. Action: What is she going to do next?3. Variable reward: What is she going to get for it? Is she satisfied yet wanting more?4. Investment: The more work and time the user invests, the more she will keep coming back to it.There is a lot more in this book about different types of triggers, variable rewards and investments. The book also has some useful nuggets about product testing or habit testing. Above all, the most important part of the book is the sections that ask you to evaluate the products you are building now. That somehow drove home the message far more effectively than anything else in the book. Perhaps that's just my learning style - learn by doing.There are a number of jobs/roles in which I could have used the lessons from this book. Overall, 4 stars for how much this book is going to help me hone products and technology over time. "

It’s a quick read, with the feel of an extended blog post (my only criticism, really). After completing Hooked, I emailed Nir to thank him for his wise words.

56,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5219990-abhishek-anbazhagan,1,"When I was furiously networking in the summer of 2017, a chance encounter lead to a conversation on books and I heard my quarry say - ""I don't read business books that are less than 10 years old"". I remember coming away from that exchange thinking - Waw! What a tool! However, this book has now made me see the wisdom in that offhand comment.Hooked is roundly recommended by every product person and builder of any repute in tech. Either these simple haven't read the book or they are just plain stupid. Nir Eyal's seductively titled book offers to pull the veil behind the success of companies like Facebook, Paypal, Airbnb, and other billion-dollar behemoths that has anyone who has ever successfully gotten ""Hello World"" to be executed in C++, frothing at the mouth. The book is a post-facto look at these companies and how they ""created"" virality. It offers the promise that you too can use these frameworks to create the next viral product. This is the problem. When Zuck designed Facebook or Facemash, he wasn't thinking about how to use the Endowment Effect to increase value or studying Behavioral Econ to codify how he could incorporate variable rewards in the form of likes and comments to keep people coming back to the platform. Simply, people who build viral products were not using a framework. So, this reduction of virality and stickiness to a few factors is absurd at best and asinine at worst.Here is my attempt at using the ""Hooked"" framework to analyze a habit-forming product - toothpaste. If you keenly observe, the internal trigger for someone to use a toothpaste is not to have bad breath so that they can signal to potential mates of their preferred genders of their genetic robustness. On understanding, this crucial insight, toothpaste companies can create a product. They should be careful that it isn't a product that you use once and it solves your problem. You must keep the user coming back to it at a determined frequency, say once every morning after they wake up. This variable reward compared with the internal trigger will cause virality and make your toothpaste viral (and also your competition which reduces your product to becoming a commodity but let's not think about that for now). Now, use this framework in the productivity app you are building to get everyone in the world ""hooked"" to your product. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk! *If you work in product, you should be furiously applauding right now*I want to revisit the early maxim I was introduced to - Don't read any business book that is less than 10 years old. This book simply packages what was old into new with jargon. Clay Christensen's Job-To-Be-Done and Ted Levitt's - ""People want quarter-inch holes, not drills maxim"" is timeless for a reason. Those ideas were developed through unbiased common sense and articulated through simple language and far more importantly, have been successfully reproduced over and over again. The same cannot be said for ideas expressed in Hooked. This book is a fine example of a misguided blog post that became a book because snake-oil sells well during a gold rush. When no one knows what they are doing, the arcane becomes interesting. If you are considering reading this, look for an article on Clay Christen's JBTD and read Ted Levitt's Marketing Myopia essay. Once you finish them, try to summarize what they are saying. Yes, I am saying, read a little to educate yourself and maybe, just maybe, think for yourself. If you are going to be building a billion-dollar product, you may seek all the advice you want but you are going to have to think for yourself and make decisions based on your convictions and be able to explain them so that others can understand. Be wary of anyone who tries to sell you a secret. Listen with an open mind and evaluate the ""secret"" on its merits. As Naval Ravikanth said on Joe Rogan - There are no new ideas. All new ideas are old ideas and someone has probably already said it better. I hate that this book has made me agree with Naval Ravikanth who I find to be insufferable. But I assume that is perhaps growth, you don't have to like the person to think their idea has merit. I don't like Hooked, perhaps Nir Eyal is a good product person."
57,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15639925-t-nu-vahtra,4,"This book does not stand out that much from new/novel information perspective (that is not what ""classics"" are supposed to do anyway) but it is a good toolbox for validating your idea or product if it meets the criteria for habit creation. It's often not about solving a problem or satisfying the user but actually about removing pain that might have been created by the product itself in the first place and how to keep the consumer ""in the loop"".Habit-forming products:*Attract long-term customers.*Do the advertising for you.*Have a strong competitive position.*Companies can be more flexible when pricing habit-forming products.The 4 states of the Hook model:*The trigger: an external event that gets us to try a product for the first time, for example a TV commercial.*The action: what we need to do in order to user the product, for example registering on an online community.*The reward: the fulfillment of the need that originally motivated us to take action, for example being entertained if the motivation was boredom.*The investment: something of value that we have invested in the product, such as time, money or information.The last step leads back to the start of the cycle and these steps are repeated over and over again, the user starts to develop internal triggers instead of external ones.Normally we use products to solve problems that we have. Most typically those problems have to do with avoiding pain or feeling pleasure. Often the most powerful internal triggers are negative emotions (boredom of fear of social disconnection, FOMO..).It takes action if preconditions are filled: a trigger is needed, person must be sufficiently motivated to take action and be capable of doing so. Companies should prioritize increasing the user's ability to use the product (it's far easier and cheaper to make the product easier to use than to increase user's motivation). Human motivation usually consists of simple goals like seeking pleasure and avoiding pain, seeking hope and avoiding fear, and seeking social acceptance and avoiding rejection. Our craving for rewards actually causes a stronger emotional reaction than receiving the reward itself (variability, unpredictable award i.e. in Casino). Ultimately reward must always relate to the user's initial motivation to use the product. Investment:*We see things more valuable if we have invested something in them.*We try to be consistent in our own behavior.*We have the tendency to adjust our world view to suit our behavior. Responsible product design:*Does the product enhance the user's lives?*Would the entrepreneur himself use the product?“79 percent of smartphone owners check their device within 15 minutes of waking up every morning.” “Gourville claims that for new entrants to stand a chance, they can’t just be better, they must be nine times better. Why such a high bar? Because old habits die hard and new products or services need to offer dramatic improvements to shake users out of old routines. Gourville writes that products that require a high degree of behavior change are doomed to fail even if the benefits of using the new product are clear and substantial.” “Many innovations fail because consumers irrationally overvalue the old while companies irrationally overvalue the new.” “Instead of relying on expensive marketing, habit-forming companies link their services to the users’ daily routines and emotions.” “To change behavior, products must ensure the user feels in control. People must want to use the service, not feel they have to.”"

People just don't think in these terms. You'll often find that people's declared preferences - what they say they want - are far different from their revealed preferences-what they actually do. The more effort we put into something, the more likely we are to value it....the first place for the entrepreneur or designer to look for new opportunities is in the mirror. ...ask ""what problem do I wish someone else would solve for me?""The Scarcity Effect - The appearance of scarcity affects people's perception of value.The cookie example - there are two jars of filled with the same cookies, the first one has 12 cookies, the other one just 2. People will value the second jar cookies higher because of the scarcity effect.The Framing Effect - The mind takes shortcuts informed by our surroundings to make quick and sometimes erroneous judgments.The Bell example. World-class violinist Joshua Bell played a free impromptu concert in Washington D.C. subway station, but only few people stopped to listen, whereas his concerts in Carnegie Hall for hundreds of dollars tickets are sell-outs.The Anchoring Effect - People often anchor to one piece of information when making a decision. The Endowed Progress Effect - ... a phenomenon that increases motivation as people believe they are nearing a goal.The car wash example - 2 groups of customers were given punch cards awarding a free car wash once the cards fully punched. One group got a blank punch card with 8 squares, the other was given card with 10 squares with 2 already punched. The group 2 had 82% higher completion rate. Rewards of the Tribe - Our brains are adapted to seek rewards that make us feel accepted, attractive, important, and included.Rewards of the Hunt - The need to acquire objects, such as food and other supplies that aid our survival, is part of our brain's operating system.The five fundamental questions:1. What do users really want? What pain is your product relieving? (Internal trigger)2. What brings users to your service? (External trigger)3. What is the simplest action users take in anticipation of reward, and how you simplify your product to make this action easier? (Action)4. Are users fulfilled by the reward yet left wanting more? (Variable reward)5. What ""bit of work"" do users invest in your product? Does it load the next trigger and store value to improve the product with use (Investment)"

(The point is you never know, even the apps / tasks designed to be used / performed occasionally might change customers' routines and make them addicted or ""hooked"" without them acknowledging that.)We have been using online applications or playing games for a significant stage of our life, that's why we already have vague or well-formed (for some) idea about majority of the concepts detailed in the book. That's why, now if we are creating this applications ourselves, these techniques such as variable rewards seem so obvious to us and we implement it without giving it a thought. That's the beauty of creating products that you love. Why read this book :1) Despite the fact that a significant share of the content is obvious to us, it makes you pause, think & reflect. ""Why do you want to use this feature in your app? Because you have used similar products before and you have an ikling that some of your actions were affected by which features."" If you want to build new habits, it's vital to understand the basic pyschology behind users' actions.2) It gives you quite a few moments to recall your own actions of past and present when you were(are) ""hooked"". If you need to get rid of any such habits, this book might help. Well, I personally doubt that but my dataset is too small to be taken seriously.3) There are exercises that you should definitely do if they are applicable to your product.4) I happen to find some or most of the facts in other design books as well, probably they are common knowlegde in design field, but none of them are written in the engaging way ""Hooked"" is, that is, with relevant examples and explanations. However, I've read very few books on design but ""Hooked"" stands out.Negatives :1) A bit repetitive.But in that case, you can simply skip that repetitive content. I think readers impose too many rules on themselves for reading. In my opinion, reading output should be weighed in terms of how much you gain out of a book that you can apply in real lives and not the number of books you read 100%.Recommended to :1) Must read for anyone creating any online product or apps.2) Might be useful for users who believe that they are addicted to some application and that it's interfering with their lives."
60,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1477685-ted,1,"Update: I ended up publishing a longer version of this - with a discussion of the trend towards more addictive technology in the tech industry more broadly - on the Huffington Post. It covers a lot of the same stuff in this review, but is likely a bit more polished: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ted-mcc...----------------I’ve heard a great deal about this book in the past month - first, I saw Eyal give a talk here in San Francisco (I hadn't heard of him, but someone recommended I go - the talk was sold out and a spot opened up), then someone at a meeting mentioned the book/talk and said it was 'amazing', then the other day I heard him featured on an episode of Planet Money. At least within the tech scene, it seems this book is very well-known, and that, to some extent, scares me. (And to put that into context, I'm a technology designer/researcher - i.e., I'm the kind of person who should be absolutely frothing at the mouth (happily) about this thing.)Most of the reviews I've been seeing have been addressing Eyal's execution of the 'Hooked' concept, which I'd give something like a 2.5 - the ideas are clearly expressed, but the writing is fairly dumbed down, and the book's ideas could (and given his writing style, should) have been expressed in about a quarter of the length.My biggest problem with the book is its basic premise, that 'hooking' people - that is, making them compulsive users of your technology product - is something worth doing. Eyal makes a number of assumptions about the benefits of technology here - he commonly alludes to Facebook, Instagram, et al as 'solving' our feelings of loneliness, for instance. Among many other occurrences, a line in the book says Instagram ""helps users dispel boredom by connecting them with others."" Everything about technology use is placed in a positive light - 'solving' problems, 'connecting' users. It's the standard litany of Silicon Valley Tech Speak, but bumped up a great many RPMs and set on continuous repeat.The idea of 'hooking' a user to your product is strikingly similar to that of causing a user 'to be addicted' to your product, including use of the same mechanisms to do it. The third piece of the 'hook' cycle is the use of variable rewards to help make users habitual users of your product, for example - this is the exact mechanism that makes gambling so potentially addictive. Even the book's cover art shows a mouse pointer clicking somewhere near the nucleus accumbens of a brain, the dopamine center manipulated by variable rewards that help fuel behavioral addictions. Eyal discusses how, in the 1950's, Olds and Milner would stimulate mice in this region, and see them forgo food and water in exchange for more stimulation. (Think 'Infinite Jest', with mice in cages.) If his book espouses manipulation, at least he's (relatively) honest about it.Eyal discusses - very briefly, at the very end of his talk/book - the morality of manipulating people in this way, and of causing, if you successfully carry out his formula and do everything else right, your users to develop behavioral addictions to your product. But his discussion of morality is too little, too late - during his talk, he spends forty minutes discussing how his model will allow audience members to build the next Facebook, and then five minutes pleading with them to use this information only to improve the world. ""Basically, I want you all to use this for good,"" he begs, and then quotes Gandhi (yes, really), ""Be the change you wish to see in the world."" (The Mahatma, by the way, apparently never actually said this.) That's about it. When I saw the talk, I suspected he added this bit at the end to appease sane-minded audience members and prevent heckling.In the book, at least, Eyal includes a short chapter near the end discussing the morality of this approach, and, perhaps as a way of showing how his 'hooked' formula can be used for good, a case study illustrating how a Bible app - YouVersion - carries out (more or less) the four steps of the hooked model. (The chapter also employs a nauseating number of religious puns: ""Switching to a different digital Bible - God forbid...""; ""Gruenewald's app is a Godsend"", etc.) But it's unconvincing; and it's perhaps telling that the best positive example Eyal can find of a technology product achieving good with his model is 'getting people to read the Bible more', which is dubious at best. I understand that this kind of thing happens all the time - you'd better believe that Facebook, Google, and many other technology companies are many steps ahead of even Eyal in this game. But it bothers me to see it filtered down and formulatized in a set of followable steps. It might bother me less if Eyal emphasized the ways in which this could be used for good throughout the book - for health behavior change, for instance, an area of technology design that's quickly growing and has shown potential for doing actual good. Eyal references Sunstein and Thaler's 'Nudge', another book I just finished (and one that I highly recommend). Those authors also present methods that could be seen as manipulative, but are careful to include frank and lengthy discussions on how to morally employ these techniques - not a hollow plea to 'only do good' with the methods followed by a flippant reading of a Gandhi quote. The authors of 'Nudge', moreover, fill the book with case studies in which their concept has - or at least, can - produce real, substantial benefit for great numbers of people. That book deserves attention and praise - people should be paying attention to *that* one.Paul Graham has somewhat famously said (Eyal even references it) that ""The world is more addictive than it was 40 years ago.... and the world will get more addictive in the next 40 years than it did in the last 40. We'll increasingly be defined by what we say no to."" It bothers me greatly to see a book outlining *how* to make the world more addictive - and weakly excusing itself for doing so - seeing such success, especially here in Silicon Valley, where people designing products that 'touch people's lives' are only learning how to do so more effectively, more thoroughly, more persistently, more addictively."
61,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,4,"Extremely valuable book for anyone building products designed to engage people frequently. Given that I think daily about how to make Goodreads better and more engaging for people, this was a useful book. I think I knew a lot of it already, but often being forced to think about things again can be useful - and there are a few useful new ways of thinking about things that I learned. One of the main useful ideas the book talks about in engaging users is having triggers to bring the user back to the product. This can be an external trigger - like an email or notification or ad that brings the user back - but the best products also form internal triggers. Ever get bored or lonely and find yourself on Facebook? Or wondering what is happening in the world and end up on Twitter? Or see something beautiful or inspiring and then pull out Instagram? Or feel the need to escape and relax and open a book or turn on a movie or a sports game? Our emotions often drive our behavior, and each emotion is mapped to a set of products we could use to ""scratch the itch"" of whatever we are feeling. These mappings become habits. ""Once a technology has created an association in users’ minds that the product is the solution of choice, they return on their own, no longer needing prompts from external triggers.""I think my favorite external triggers mentioned in the book were from the bible app example, where it sent a push notification to people if they walked into a strip club! And it sent another one on xmas day that did well. Timely matters!Nir then talks about how to get users to take actions. The framework is obvious, but very true, and useful to remember when evaluating products. It's fairly well summed up in the below quote. There was a lot of good discussion about point #2 in terms of having simple design, being mobile, etc.there are three ingredients required to initiate any and all behaviors: (1) the user must have sufficient motivation; (2) the user must have the ability to complete the desired action; and (3) a trigger must be present to activate the behavior.""Another point Nir makes around actions - which is also an obvious one but worth really paying attention to when designing a product - is around getting frequent engagement with a product when a user is new to it.""For new behaviors to really take hold, they must occur often.""""frequent engagement with a product—especially over a short period of time—increases the likelihood of forming new routines.""The author then talks about variable rewards. I've known that variability - or serendipitousness as I like to think of it - is a very important driver of any engaging product. It's why we love sports, gambling, games, Facebook newsfeed, and good stories - not knowing what we'll find is exciting. Nir breaks down variable rewards into three types - the tribe, the hunt, and the self. The tribe is social validation - think of Facebook likes on content you posted. The hunt is something intrinsic in our brains that dates back to prehistoric times when we literally lived for the hunt - think of hunting for interesting content on your Twitter feed, or gambling looking for payoffs. The self is more for personal gratification - wanting to complete a puzzle you started or beat a video game you started."
62,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1501068-anca,1,"This book was a huge disappointment. It is full of speculation and misleading 'information'. It has a very big fluff to substance ratio and the little substance it does present is deprived of all nuance. Arguably, that isn't reason enough to give it one star. The determining factor is the authors tendency of quoting studies and then misrepresenting the findings. For example: a study of the internet usage of 216 students. The study, conducted over the course of a month, found correlation between increased internet usage and indicators of depression. The author of the book presents this correlation with a much greater degree of certainty, he exaggerates the duration of the study, cites methodology that isn't found in the study, selects one possible hypothesis: depressed people use the internet more because it makes them feel better and runs with it, expanding this theory with lush examples of solace seeking Instagram users. The study itself only mentions that it notices an increased number of ""chat octets"" in the traffic analysis and one of the possible explanations is that depressive people are joining depression chat rooms in order to find relief (but they have no way of knowing). I find this kind of mistreatment of research and scientific certainty repulsive."

And it's thought-provoking. Nir Eyar masterfully weaves his insights of technology, business and psychology into his four-fold model, which explains how to create habit-forming products.Whether you are an entrepreneur just getting started, a psychologist seeking depth or an avid reader wanting to know more about the world around us, you'll love this book!"

I wondered why some product can make the users addicted while some product cannot. I was faced with many problems and felt really anxious at that time.One day, I drove to work listening to the audio introducing the book “Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products.” It is from an APP named Bookey.https://share.bookey.app/goodreads The main idea of this book summarized by Bookey was very impressive; that is, how to make users “get hooked” on your products.It attracted me a lot, and that was absolutely what I needed! I even stopped in the nearest parking lot to listen to it absorbedly.Then it introduced a totally new idea to me-“Hook Model.” It was said that there are four steps to form users’ reliance on the products, namely triggering users’ desire to act, making users act, providing rewards and making users invest time and efforts. Most importantly, it also introduced some tips on how to use the “Hook Model” when developing new Internet products.I felt that this book was exactly what I need for my work. So I just turned to this book for help. I found that this book was very useful. It includes several cases like Facebook, Twitter, and even a case study focusing on how to build habit-forming products. It inspired me a lot when deciding several functions for the products. Sometimes, I felt the book was a little bit difficult to follow. However, with the outlines provided by the APP Bookey, I could understand the idea of the book much more easily, and also apply it for my Internet products. For example, when I tried to use the “Hook Model” when developing our products, I began with two important questions mentioned both in this book and the APP Bookey: “Will I use this product myself” and “Can this product greatly improve user’s life quality.” Actually, I never thought of the second question when I began to develop my products. I only thought them as my tasks and tried to make my products include all kinds of functions other products used. After that, I just followed the lead of the book and did the “user habit testing” to identify users of our products, to codify users’ behavior, and to modify our products. After doing that, I found myself become a user of our products and was dying for our products. Sometimes, I cannot remember some tips on how to use the “Hook Model,” the APP Bookey helped me a lot since it provided the mind map of the key ideas of the book. Moreover, I could check the APP Bookey whenever I forgot taking the book with me.The product has been in public. Thanks to this book and APP Bookey, the product has gained some attention, and the numbers of active users remain at a satisfactory level. I hope people who are developing new products can turn to “Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products” for help.That’s my understanding of this book, and hope to share thinking about this book with you."

It's pretty short, easy to read, but provides a comprehensive view on the topic.What I loved the most was the fact that author backed up all his statements with evidence. At the end of the book he provides citations, lists scientific studies and articles he mentions. Little personal opinion, a lot of useful info. It's curious how the tech-related psychological research lines up neatly with what I've recently read about psychology of relationships. Pretty cool parallels.I didn't pick up much new info from it because I'm not new to the topic, but I don't see any reasons to give it less than 5 stars. P.S. Also, it explains why I'm HOOKED ON GOODREADS"
66,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44279821-joe-soltzberg,3,"Hooked is an excellent (short) book on the use of psychology in product design. As technology becomes increasingly available to entrepreneurs of all backgrounds, design has become just as important as engineering. Correspondingly, all entrepreneurs should have a good understanding of the principals behind building habit-forming products. In that respect, this book does a great job. This book may not provide any grand revelations or have particularly unique/fascinating case studies, but it is still very valuable (thus the 3 stars, perhaps closer to 3.5). Below I've provided an outline of my notes on the book so that those of us less inclined to read this can still learn the basics. I do still recommend reading the book for the useful examples and exercises at the end of the chapters (which you most definitely should do). I highly recommend reading the book with a specific product in mind that you would like to apply the lessons of Hooked to. The basic idea behind Hooked is the Hook Model. The model consists of four parts:-Trigger-Action-Variable Reward-InvestmentQuite simply, using a trigger should prompt a user to take an action that results in a variable reward, followed by further investment. This cycle should continue to repeat itself until the user becomes 'hooked'. TriggerThe trigger is what makes a user turn to your product. If there isn't a trigger, then what will prompt the user to engage with your product? Nir Eyal explains that there are two types of triggers: external and internal triggers. While external triggers such as an app icon or an advertisement can be useful in getting a user to use your product, truly addictive products use internal triggers. An internal triggers is usually a feeling or emotion that prompts an action to resolve that feeling or emotion. It is easy to see the power of internal triggers. They are omnipresent and a constant part of our lives. Further, it is internal triggers that are the basis of true habit formation on a biological level. Nir Eyal explains:In the case of internal triggers, the information about what to do next is encoded as a learned association in the user's memory.There are numerous examples of this. People use snapchat and instagram to resolve their fear of missing out. People use reddit or facebook to resolve their boredom. Have you ever wondered how you just magically seemed to end up using one of these products? It's because it forms a subconscious habit linked with an emotion. So, when building your product make sure to find the internal trigger that you should have your product be associated with it. That is the first step.ActionNow that you have the trigger, as soon as a user feels that 'itch' your product will pop into their head. But that alone is not enough. It is just as important to make sure that it is easy enough to 'scratch' that itch. The action to do that needs to be a simplistic as possible. After all, if habits are subconscious then it will have to be relatively simple. The book describes the following factors that should be taken into account:There are three ingredients required to initiate any and all behaviors: (1) the user must have sufficient motivation; (2) the user must have the ability to completed the desired action; and (3) a trigger must be present to activate the actionIt is important to focus on motivation and ability. Motivation is often in the form of resolving the emotion associated with the trigger. Ability is where there is much room for innovation. Consider companies like Blogger and Twitter. They made the action of writing significantly easier by reducing the steps necessary to resolve the trigger. This led to massive success. It is important that your action is as simple as possible. Variable RewardNow that the user has engaged with your product, it is important to reward them. All habits end with a reward. When you post a picture on instagram, the reward is likes from other people. When you complete your diary for the day on MyFitnessPal, the reward is a nice message telling you about how successful you've been. Even bad habits have 'rewards'. Cigarettes give you a nicotine high and alcohol can make it feel like your problems are solved (but of course not really). Thus, your product not only has to make it easy to scratch that itch... it must also relieve that itch, but that alone is not enough. The rewards need to be variable. Nir Eyal gives many examples and explanations, but the best is Skinner's Pigeon Experiment. In the experiment there are two groups. One is a group of pigeons that are in a cage where if they press a button they will be given some food pellets, but the amount of food dispensed is the same every time. The second group has the same setup, but is given a variable reward every time; sometimes there is more food and sometimes there is less. Skinner found that adding variability significantly increased the frequency of the pigeons pressing the button. Nir Eyal writes:Skinner's pigeons tell us a great deal about what helps drive our own behaviors. More recent experiments reveal that variability increases activity in the nucleus accumbens and spikes levels of neurotransmitter dopamine, driving our hungry search for rewards.There are many products that inherently do this. For example, on facebook you never know if you'll find good content in the feed or how many likes your status will get. The same phenomenon happened with the early version of Zynga games. So for even stronger habits, a variable reward is necessary.InvestmentThe final step of the Hooked Model is what differentiates it from the traditional Habit Loop (see  The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business). In order to ensure that users come back to your product, it is important to ask the users to make an investment. By making an investment, users will yet another reason to come back to your product, instead of someone else's. There are many products out there that are better than facebook. But, by having users store their data on there and make friends and comment on other people's data it makes it difficult for users to leave. Nir Eyal explains that in studies user's value their own work 4x more than work of higher quality:Those who invested labor associated greater value with their creations simply because they had worked on them. Ariely calls this the IKEA effect. By having your user invest in your product, it makes repeat usage more likely."

When he asked if I wanted to work on the book with him, I immediately jumped on the opportunity. I have learned an incredible amount since then that have and will continue to guide my product decisions and perspective on technology.Although I'm clearly biased toward the book, I would not have spent several dozen hours writing and working with Nir if I didn't believe it would be valuable for others."
68,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5246491-suzanne,5,"Excellent, well-written book. I've been reading Nir's blog for a while now so was already a fan. Nir and Ryan do a great job of bringing everything together in the Hooked process and laying it out in a logical and motivating way. The book takes you through the theory, giving examples to bring the theory alive and then provides exercises at the end of each chapter to help you take what you've learned and immediately apply it to your own product or service. It was refreshing to see a lot of new stories/examples in between some of the familiar ones. I particularly loved all of the psychology behind habits. Hooked introduced me to the concept of reactance (in the psychology sense). Pretty powerful stuff. Overall, this was fascinating content which is making me think about each of the apps on my iPhone/iPad and how they've either hooked me … or haven't. "
69,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/145381-brian,4,"(4.5) Really good stuff, actually actionableIn particular, I like the directives at the end of each chapter driving you to think about your own product, how you can use the Hooked principles to improve its stickiness. Also liked the Bible case study he added, though I think he should've made the analysis more rigorously follow the principles, if only in a data sheet format saying how each of the principles are applied. Then dive into the cooler narrative.But this is really well organized and written. Coherent, presented clearly and actionable. Also makes me want to read some more Ariely, Dan, books. :)"
70,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7195895-elisa,5,"I decided to read this book, because I am a long-time follower of the author's blog. Being a psychologist that works in user experience design, I at first was not sure how much I'd gain from a book written on a subject I consider myself to have deep knowledge of. However, I found it to be a great book and I did learn a lot. I'd recommend this book for anyone that's interested in learning how psychological mechanisms can be used to form habits, and therefore keep people ""hooked"" on their products. "
71,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13680195-arjun,3,"I highly recommend this book for anyone building a technology company or anyone who has interest in products.As someone who's spend the last couple of years reading extensively about product and user psychology, I didn't find the book extremely insightful, but the book is very good for anyone who wants to get a baseline understanding of how to build and reinforce habits in products.Books like this are worth their value because they give you a new lens to see the world. The success state would be reading this book and then seeing patterns emerge every day in the products you use (and applying that knowledge in products you build). At a minimum, the introduction and first few chapters do a fantastic job introducing the ""framework"" for how to think about products. Knowledge isn't very useful without application though -- after reading this book, I recommend trying some habit-forming products to see technique in practice. Some apps that do this particularly well are Lift, codecademy and fitocracy (I find that health/fitness/edtech/behavior change applications make a very conscious effort to put use these techniques for Good). "
72,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1252572-sarah,2,"Would've given it 1 star, but since it got me to actually download the Bible App to see why Goodreads is constantly #8 to its #7, I threw it an extra star."

74,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18409907-kartik-santhanakrishnan,4,"I'll start with a complaint because I want to get my grumpiness out of the way before I take it out on someone at work. This book should have been 50% as long as it is. Perhaps even shorter. Do authors seriously think that more words is the same as getting your point across? In all fairness, there were synopses at appropriate places in the book, so you could skip any nonsense and go through just salient points. Despite that, the book should have been way shorter. Take a star off. There. I feel better already.Having gotten that out of the way, the Hook model described in the book is very useful. Hooking a user has four elements: 1. Trigger: What is the itch that the user needs to scratch2. Action: What is she going to do next?3. Variable reward: What is she going to get for it? Is she satisfied yet wanting more?4. Investment: The more work and time the user invests, the more she will keep coming back to it.There is a lot more in this book about different types of triggers, variable rewards and investments. The book also has some useful nuggets about product testing or habit testing. Above all, the most important part of the book is the sections that ask you to evaluate the products you are building now. That somehow drove home the message far more effectively than anything else in the book. Perhaps that's just my learning style - learn by doing.There are a number of jobs/roles in which I could have used the lessons from this book. Overall, 4 stars for how much this book is going to help me hone products and technology over time. "
75,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7236889-scott,4,"As a product designer, this book is a perfect introduction to behavioral product psychology. It’s written in a humble and inquisitive tone. The objective literary style spoke to my research-based soul. I'm constantly seeking to follow the works (and words) of those who are solving real problems in the world. Nir Eyal is one of them. I definitely recommend the book. It’s a quick read, with the feel of an extended blog post (my only criticism, really). After completing Hooked, I emailed Nir to thank him for his wise words. He was gracious enough to respond and invite me to his conference this upcoming April. How cool is that? Props to authors who don’t sit on untouchable thrones above their readers. "

The general idea is that to engage and keep users to use your product you should better develop a habit you should understand users' true underlying motivators (pleasure/pain, safety/fear, social acceptability/loneliness) , then understand and provide triggers , make users to invest time/money/data into your product, understand users behavior/lifestyle/story to know when user has resources to execute habit. The best understanding comes from your own experience- monitor yourself, your friends/relatives, try to replace habits which are already formed by offline/old school things (""job to be done"" as Clayton Christensen writes).

86,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5219990-abhishek-anbazhagan,1,"When I was furiously networking in the summer of 2017, a chance encounter lead to a conversation on books and I heard my quarry say - ""I don't read business books that are less than 10 years old"". I remember coming away from that exchange thinking - Waw! What a tool! However, this book has now made me see the wisdom in that offhand comment.Hooked is roundly recommended by every product person and builder of any repute in tech. Either these simple haven't read the book or they are just plain stupid. Nir Eyal's seductively titled book offers to pull the veil behind the success of companies like Facebook, Paypal, Airbnb, and other billion-dollar behemoths that has anyone who has ever successfully gotten ""Hello World"" to be executed in C++, frothing at the mouth. The book is a post-facto look at these companies and how they ""created"" virality. It offers the promise that you too can use these frameworks to create the next viral product. This is the problem. When Zuck designed Facebook or Facemash, he wasn't thinking about how to use the Endowment Effect to increase value or studying Behavioral Econ to codify how he could incorporate variable rewards in the form of likes and comments to keep people coming back to the platform. Simply, people who build viral products were not using a framework. So, this reduction of virality and stickiness to a few factors is absurd at best and asinine at worst.Here is my attempt at using the ""Hooked"" framework to analyze a habit-forming product - toothpaste. If you keenly observe, the internal trigger for someone to use a toothpaste is not to have bad breath so that they can signal to potential mates of their preferred genders of their genetic robustness. On understanding, this crucial insight, toothpaste companies can create a product. They should be careful that it isn't a product that you use once and it solves your problem. You must keep the user coming back to it at a determined frequency, say once every morning after they wake up. This variable reward compared with the internal trigger will cause virality and make your toothpaste viral (and also your competition which reduces your product to becoming a commodity but let's not think about that for now). Now, use this framework in the productivity app you are building to get everyone in the world ""hooked"" to your product. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk! *If you work in product, you should be furiously applauding right now*I want to revisit the early maxim I was introduced to - Don't read any business book that is less than 10 years old. This book simply packages what was old into new with jargon. Clay Christensen's Job-To-Be-Done and Ted Levitt's - ""People want quarter-inch holes, not drills maxim"" is timeless for a reason. Those ideas were developed through unbiased common sense and articulated through simple language and far more importantly, have been successfully reproduced over and over again. The same cannot be said for ideas expressed in Hooked. This book is a fine example of a misguided blog post that became a book because snake-oil sells well during a gold rush. When no one knows what they are doing, the arcane becomes interesting. If you are considering reading this, look for an article on Clay Christen's JBTD and read Ted Levitt's Marketing Myopia essay. Once you finish them, try to summarize what they are saying. Yes, I am saying, read a little to educate yourself and maybe, just maybe, think for yourself. If you are going to be building a billion-dollar product, you may seek all the advice you want but you are going to have to think for yourself and make decisions based on your convictions and be able to explain them so that others can understand. Be wary of anyone who tries to sell you a secret. Listen with an open mind and evaluate the ""secret"" on its merits. As Naval Ravikanth said on Joe Rogan - There are no new ideas. All new ideas are old ideas and someone has probably already said it better. I hate that this book has made me agree with Naval Ravikanth who I find to be insufferable. But I assume that is perhaps growth, you don't have to like the person to think their idea has merit. I don't like Hooked, perhaps Nir Eyal is a good product person."
87,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15639925-t-nu-vahtra,4,"This book does not stand out that much from new/novel information perspective (that is not what ""classics"" are supposed to do anyway) but it is a good toolbox for validating your idea or product if it meets the criteria for habit creation. It's often not about solving a problem or satisfying the user but actually about removing pain that might have been created by the product itself in the first place and how to keep the consumer ""in the loop"".Habit-forming products:*Attract long-term customers.*Do the advertising for you.*Have a strong competitive position.*Companies can be more flexible when pricing habit-forming products.The 4 states of the Hook model:*The trigger: an external event that gets us to try a product for the first time, for example a TV commercial.*The action: what we need to do in order to user the product, for example registering on an online community.*The reward: the fulfillment of the need that originally motivated us to take action, for example being entertained if the motivation was boredom.*The investment: something of value that we have invested in the product, such as time, money or information.The last step leads back to the start of the cycle and these steps are repeated over and over again, the user starts to develop internal triggers instead of external ones.Normally we use products to solve problems that we have. Most typically those problems have to do with avoiding pain or feeling pleasure. Often the most powerful internal triggers are negative emotions (boredom of fear of social disconnection, FOMO..).It takes action if preconditions are filled: a trigger is needed, person must be sufficiently motivated to take action and be capable of doing so. Companies should prioritize increasing the user's ability to use the product (it's far easier and cheaper to make the product easier to use than to increase user's motivation). Human motivation usually consists of simple goals like seeking pleasure and avoiding pain, seeking hope and avoiding fear, and seeking social acceptance and avoiding rejection. Our craving for rewards actually causes a stronger emotional reaction than receiving the reward itself (variability, unpredictable award i.e. in Casino). Ultimately reward must always relate to the user's initial motivation to use the product. Investment:*We see things more valuable if we have invested something in them.*We try to be consistent in our own behavior.*We have the tendency to adjust our world view to suit our behavior. Responsible product design:*Does the product enhance the user's lives?*Would the entrepreneur himself use the product?“79 percent of smartphone owners check their device within 15 minutes of waking up every morning.” “Gourville claims that for new entrants to stand a chance, they can’t just be better, they must be nine times better. Why such a high bar? Because old habits die hard and new products or services need to offer dramatic improvements to shake users out of old routines. Gourville writes that products that require a high degree of behavior change are doomed to fail even if the benefits of using the new product are clear and substantial.” “Many innovations fail because consumers irrationally overvalue the old while companies irrationally overvalue the new.” “Instead of relying on expensive marketing, habit-forming companies link their services to the users’ daily routines and emotions.” “To change behavior, products must ensure the user feels in control. People must want to use the service, not feel they have to.”"

People just don't think in these terms. You'll often find that people's declared preferences - what they say they want - are far different from their revealed preferences-what they actually do. The more effort we put into something, the more likely we are to value it....the first place for the entrepreneur or designer to look for new opportunities is in the mirror. ...ask ""what problem do I wish someone else would solve for me?""The Scarcity Effect - The appearance of scarcity affects people's perception of value.The cookie example - there are two jars of filled with the same cookies, the first one has 12 cookies, the other one just 2. People will value the second jar cookies higher because of the scarcity effect.The Framing Effect - The mind takes shortcuts informed by our surroundings to make quick and sometimes erroneous judgments.The Bell example. World-class violinist Joshua Bell played a free impromptu concert in Washington D.C. subway station, but only few people stopped to listen, whereas his concerts in Carnegie Hall for hundreds of dollars tickets are sell-outs.The Anchoring Effect - People often anchor to one piece of information when making a decision. The Endowed Progress Effect - ... a phenomenon that increases motivation as people believe they are nearing a goal.The car wash example - 2 groups of customers were given punch cards awarding a free car wash once the cards fully punched. One group got a blank punch card with 8 squares, the other was given card with 10 squares with 2 already punched. The group 2 had 82% higher completion rate. Rewards of the Tribe - Our brains are adapted to seek rewards that make us feel accepted, attractive, important, and included.Rewards of the Hunt - The need to acquire objects, such as food and other supplies that aid our survival, is part of our brain's operating system.The five fundamental questions:1. What do users really want? What pain is your product relieving? (Internal trigger)2. What brings users to your service? (External trigger)3.

(The point is you never know, even the apps / tasks designed to be used / performed occasionally might change customers' routines and make them addicted or ""hooked"" without them acknowledging that.)We have been using online applications or playing games for a significant stage of our life, that's why we already have vague or well-formed (for some) idea about majority of the concepts detailed in the book. That's why, now if we are creating this applications ourselves, these techniques such as variable rewards seem so obvious to us and we implement it without giving it a thought. That's the beauty of creating products that you love. Why read this book :1) Despite the fact that a significant share of the content is obvious to us, it makes you pause, think & reflect. ""Why do you want to use this feature in your app? Because you have used similar products before and you have an ikling that some of your actions were affected by which features."" If you want to build new habits, it's vital to understand the basic pyschology behind users' actions.2) It gives you quite a few moments to recall your own actions of past and present when you were(are) ""hooked"". If you need to get rid of any such habits, this book might help. Well, I personally doubt that but my dataset is too small to be taken seriously.3) There are exercises that you should definitely do if they are applicable to your product.4) I happen to find some or most of the facts in other design books as well, probably they are common knowlegde in design field, but none of them are written in the engaging way ""Hooked"" is, that is, with relevant examples and explanations. However, I've read very few books on design but ""Hooked"" stands out.Negatives :1) A bit repetitive.But in that case, you can simply skip that repetitive content. I think readers impose too many rules on themselves for reading. In my opinion, reading output should be weighed in terms of how much you gain out of a book that you can apply in real lives and not the number of books you read 100%.Recommended to :1) Must read for anyone creating any online product or apps.2) Might be useful for users who believe that they are addicted to some application and that it's interfering with their lives."
90,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1477685-ted,1,"Update: I ended up publishing a longer version of this - with a discussion of the trend towards more addictive technology in the tech industry more broadly - on the Huffington Post. It covers a lot of the same stuff in this review, but is likely a bit more polished: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ted-mcc...----------------I’ve heard a great deal about this book in the past month - first, I saw Eyal give a talk here in San Francisco (I hadn't heard of him, but someone recommended I go - the talk was sold out and a spot opened up), then someone at a meeting mentioned the book/talk and said it was 'amazing', then the other day I heard him featured on an episode of Planet Money. At least within the tech scene, it seems this book is very well-known, and that, to some extent, scares me. (And to put that into context, I'm a technology designer/researcher - i.e., I'm the kind of person who should be absolutely frothing at the mouth (happily) about this thing.)Most of the reviews I've been seeing have been addressing Eyal's execution of the 'Hooked' concept, which I'd give something like a 2.5 - the ideas are clearly expressed, but the writing is fairly dumbed down, and the book's ideas could (and given his writing style, should) have been expressed in about a quarter of the length.My biggest problem with the book is its basic premise, that 'hooking' people - that is, making them compulsive users of your technology product - is something worth doing. Eyal makes a number of assumptions about the benefits of technology here - he commonly alludes to Facebook, Instagram, et al as 'solving' our feelings of loneliness, for instance. Among many other occurrences, a line in the book says Instagram ""helps users dispel boredom by connecting them with others."" Everything about technology use is placed in a positive light - 'solving' problems, 'connecting' users. It's the standard litany of Silicon Valley Tech Speak, but bumped up a great many RPMs and set on continuous repeat.The idea of 'hooking' a user to your product is strikingly similar to that of causing a user 'to be addicted' to your product, including use of the same mechanisms to do it. The third piece of the 'hook' cycle is the use of variable rewards to help make users habitual users of your product, for example - this is the exact mechanism that makes gambling so potentially addictive. Even the book's cover art shows a mouse pointer clicking somewhere near the nucleus accumbens of a brain, the dopamine center manipulated by variable rewards that help fuel behavioral addictions. Eyal discusses how, in the 1950's, Olds and Milner would stimulate mice in this region, and see them forgo food and water in exchange for more stimulation. (Think 'Infinite Jest', with mice in cages.) If his book espouses manipulation, at least he's (relatively) honest about it.Eyal discusses - very briefly, at the very end of his talk/book - the morality of manipulating people in this way, and of causing, if you successfully carry out his formula and do everything else right, your users to develop behavioral addictions to your product. But his discussion of morality is too little, too late - during his talk, he spends forty minutes discussing how his model will allow audience members to build the next Facebook, and then five minutes pleading with them to use this information only to improve the world. ""Basically, I want you all to use this for good,"" he begs, and then quotes Gandhi (yes, really), ""Be the change you wish to see in the world."" (The Mahatma, by the way, apparently never actually said this.) That's about it. When I saw the talk, I suspected he added this bit at the end to appease sane-minded audience members and prevent heckling.In the book, at least, Eyal includes a short chapter near the end discussing the morality of this approach, and, perhaps as a way of showing how his 'hooked' formula can be used for good, a case study illustrating how a Bible app - YouVersion - carries out (more or less) the four steps of the hooked model. (The chapter also employs a nauseating number of religious puns: ""Switching to a different digital Bible - God forbid...""; ""Gruenewald's app is a Godsend"", etc.) But it's unconvincing; and it's perhaps telling that the best positive example Eyal can find of a technology product achieving good with his model is 'getting people to read the Bible more', which is dubious at best. I understand that this kind of thing happens all the time - you'd better believe that Facebook, Google, and many other technology companies are many steps ahead of even Eyal in this game. But it bothers me to see it filtered down and formulatized in a set of followable steps. It might bother me less if Eyal emphasized the ways in which this could be used for good throughout the book - for health behavior change, for instance, an area of technology design that's quickly growing and has shown potential for doing actual good. Eyal references Sunstein and Thaler's 'Nudge', another book I just finished (and one that I highly recommend). Those authors also present methods that could be seen as manipulative, but are careful to include frank and lengthy discussions on how to morally employ these techniques - not a hollow plea to 'only do good' with the methods followed by a flippant reading of a Gandhi quote. The authors of 'Nudge', moreover, fill the book with case studies in which their concept has - or at least, can - produce real, substantial benefit for great numbers of people. That book deserves attention and praise - people should be paying attention to *that* one.Paul Graham has somewhat famously said (Eyal even references it) that ""The world is more addictive than it was 40 years ago.... and the world will get more addictive in the next 40 years than it did in the last 40. We'll increasingly be defined by what we say no to."" It bothers me greatly to see a book outlining *how* to make the world more addictive - and weakly excusing itself for doing so - seeing such success, especially here in Silicon Valley, where people designing products that 'touch people's lives' are only learning how to do so more effectively, more thoroughly, more persistently, more addictively."
91,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,4,"Extremely valuable book for anyone building products designed to engage people frequently. Given that I think daily about how to make Goodreads better and more engaging for people, this was a useful book. I think I knew a lot of it already, but often being forced to think about things again can be useful - and there are a few useful new ways of thinking about things that I learned. One of the main useful ideas the book talks about in engaging users is having triggers to bring the user back to the product. This can be an external trigger - like an email or notification or ad that brings the user back - but the best products also form internal triggers. Ever get bored or lonely and find yourself on Facebook? Or wondering what is happening in the world and end up on Twitter? Or see something beautiful or inspiring and then pull out Instagram? Or feel the need to escape and relax and open a book or turn on a movie or a sports game? Our emotions often drive our behavior, and each emotion is mapped to a set of products we could use to ""scratch the itch"" of whatever we are feeling. These mappings become habits. ""Once a technology has created an association in users’ minds that the product is the solution of choice, they return on their own, no longer needing prompts from external triggers.""I think my favorite external triggers mentioned in the book were from the bible app example, where it sent a push notification to people if they walked into a strip club! And it sent another one on xmas day that did well. Timely matters!Nir then talks about how to get users to take actions. The framework is obvious, but very true, and useful to remember when evaluating products. It's fairly well summed up in the below quote. There was a lot of good discussion about point #2 in terms of having simple design, being mobile, etc.there are three ingredients required to initiate any and all behaviors: (1) the user must have sufficient motivation; (2) the user must have the ability to complete the desired action; and (3) a trigger must be present to activate the behavior.""Another point Nir makes around actions - which is also an obvious one but worth really paying attention to when designing a product - is around getting frequent engagement with a product when a user is new to it.""For new behaviors to really take hold, they must occur often.""""frequent engagement with a product—especially over a short period of time—increases the likelihood of forming new routines.""The author then talks about variable rewards. I've known that variability - or serendipitousness as I like to think of it - is a very important driver of any engaging product. It's why we love sports, gambling, games, Facebook newsfeed, and good stories - not knowing what we'll find is exciting. Nir breaks down variable rewards into three types - the tribe, the hunt, and the self. The tribe is social validation - think of Facebook likes on content you posted. The hunt is something intrinsic in our brains that dates back to prehistoric times when we literally lived for the hunt - think of hunting for interesting content on your Twitter feed, or gambling looking for payoffs. The self is more for personal gratification - wanting to complete a puzzle you started or beat a video game you started."
92,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1501068-anca,1,"This book was a huge disappointment. It is full of speculation and misleading 'information'. It has a very big fluff to substance ratio and the little substance it does present is deprived of all nuance. Arguably, that isn't reason enough to give it one star. The determining factor is the authors tendency of quoting studies and then misrepresenting the findings. For example: a study of the internet usage of 216 students. The study, conducted over the course of a month, found correlation between increased internet usage and indicators of depression. The author of the book presents this correlation with a much greater degree of certainty, he exaggerates the duration of the study, cites methodology that isn't found in the study, selects one possible hypothesis: depressed people use the internet more because it makes them feel better and runs with it, expanding this theory with lush examples of solace seeking Instagram users. The study itself only mentions that it notices an increased number of ""chat octets"" in the traffic analysis and one of the possible explanations is that depressive people are joining depression chat rooms in order to find relief (but they have no way of knowing). I find this kind of mistreatment of research and scientific certainty repulsive."

I wondered why some product can make the users addicted while some product cannot. I was faced with many problems and felt really anxious at that time.One day, I drove to work listening to the audio introducing the book “Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products.” It is from an APP named Bookey.https://share.bookey.app/goodreads The main idea of this book summarized by Bookey was very impressive; that is, how to make users “get hooked” on your products.It attracted me a lot, and that was absolutely what I needed! I even stopped in the nearest parking lot to listen to it absorbedly.Then it introduced a totally new idea to me-“Hook Model.” It was said that there are four steps to form users’ reliance on the products, namely triggering users’ desire to act, making users act, providing rewards and making users invest time and efforts. Most importantly, it also introduced some tips on how to use the “Hook Model” when developing new Internet products.I felt that this book was exactly what I need for my work. So I just turned to this book for help. I found that this book was very useful. It includes several cases like Facebook, Twitter, and even a case study focusing on how to build habit-forming products. It inspired me a lot when deciding several functions for the products. Sometimes, I felt the book was a little bit difficult to follow. However, with the outlines provided by the APP Bookey, I could understand the idea of the book much more easily, and also apply it for my Internet products. For example, when I tried to use the “Hook Model” when developing our products, I began with two important questions mentioned both in this book and the APP Bookey: “Will I use this product myself” and “Can this product greatly improve user’s life quality.” Actually, I never thought of the second question when I began to develop my products. I only thought them as my tasks and tried to make my products include all kinds of functions other products used. After that, I just followed the lead of the book and did the “user habit testing” to identify users of our products, to codify users’ behavior, and to modify our products. After doing that, I found myself become a user of our products and was dying for our products. Sometimes, I cannot remember some tips on how to use the “Hook Model,” the APP Bookey helped me a lot since it provided the mind map of the key ideas of the book. Moreover, I could check the APP Bookey whenever I forgot taking the book with me.The product has been in public. Thanks to this book and APP Bookey, the product has gained some attention, and the numbers of active users remain at a satisfactory level. I hope people who are developing new products can turn to “Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products” for help.That’s my understanding of this book, and hope to share thinking about this book with you."

It's curious how the tech-related psychological research lines up neatly with what I've recently read about psychology of relationships.

96,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44279821-joe-soltzberg,3,"Hooked is an excellent (short) book on the use of psychology in product design. As technology becomes increasingly available to entrepreneurs of all backgrounds, design has become just as important as engineering. Correspondingly, all entrepreneurs should have a good understanding of the principals behind building habit-forming products. In that respect, this book does a great job. This book may not provide any grand revelations or have particularly unique/fascinating case studies, but it is still very valuable (thus the 3 stars, perhaps closer to 3.5). Below I've provided an outline of my notes on the book so that those of us less inclined to read this can still learn the basics. I do still recommend reading the book for the useful examples and exercises at the end of the chapters (which you most definitely should do). I highly recommend reading the book with a specific product in mind that you would like to apply the lessons of Hooked to. The basic idea behind Hooked is the Hook Model. The model consists of four parts:-Trigger-Action-Variable Reward-InvestmentQuite simply, using a trigger should prompt a user to take an action that results in a variable reward, followed by further investment. This cycle should continue to repeat itself until the user becomes 'hooked'. TriggerThe trigger is what makes a user turn to your product. If there isn't a trigger, then what will prompt the user to engage with your product? Nir Eyal explains that there are two types of triggers: external and internal triggers. While external triggers such as an app icon or an advertisement can be useful in getting a user to use your product, truly addictive products use internal triggers. An internal triggers is usually a feeling or emotion that prompts an action to resolve that feeling or emotion. It is easy to see the power of internal triggers. They are omnipresent and a constant part of our lives. Further, it is internal triggers that are the basis of true habit formation on a biological level. Nir Eyal explains:In the case of internal triggers, the information about what to do next is encoded as a learned association in the user's memory.There are numerous examples of this. People use snapchat and instagram to resolve their fear of missing out. People use reddit or facebook to resolve their boredom. Have you ever wondered how you just magically seemed to end up using one of these products? It's because it forms a subconscious habit linked with an emotion. So, when building your product make sure to find the internal trigger that you should have your product be associated with it. That is the first step.ActionNow that you have the trigger, as soon as a user feels that 'itch' your product will pop into their head. But that alone is not enough. It is just as important to make sure that it is easy enough to 'scratch' that itch. The action to do that needs to be a simplistic as possible. After all, if habits are subconscious then it will have to be relatively simple. The book describes the following factors that should be taken into account:There are three ingredients required to initiate any and all behaviors: (1) the user must have sufficient motivation; (2) the user must have the ability to completed the desired action; and (3) a trigger must be present to activate the actionIt is important to focus on motivation and ability. Motivation is often in the form of resolving the emotion associated with the trigger. Ability is where there is much room for innovation. Consider companies like Blogger and Twitter. They made the action of writing significantly easier by reducing the steps necessary to resolve the trigger. This led to massive success. It is important that your action is as simple as possible. Variable RewardNow that the user has engaged with your product, it is important to reward them. All habits end with a reward. When you post a picture on instagram, the reward is likes from other people. When you complete your diary for the day on MyFitnessPal, the reward is a nice message telling you about how successful you've been. Even bad habits have 'rewards'. Cigarettes give you a nicotine high and alcohol can make it feel like your problems are solved (but of course not really). Thus, your product not only has to make it easy to scratch that itch... it must also relieve that itch, but that alone is not enough. The rewards need to be variable. Nir Eyal gives many examples and explanations, but the best is Skinner's Pigeon Experiment. In the experiment there are two groups. One is a group of pigeons that are in a cage where if they press a button they will be given some food pellets, but the amount of food dispensed is the same every time. The second group has the same setup, but is given a variable reward every time; sometimes there is more food and sometimes there is less. Skinner found that adding variability significantly increased the frequency of the pigeons pressing the button. Nir Eyal writes:Skinner's pigeons tell us a great deal about what helps drive our own behaviors. More recent experiments reveal that variability increases activity in the nucleus accumbens and spikes levels of neurotransmitter dopamine, driving our hungry search for rewards.There are many products that inherently do this. For example, on facebook you never know if you'll find good content in the feed or how many likes your status will get. The same phenomenon happened with the early version of Zynga games. So for even stronger habits, a variable reward is necessary.InvestmentThe final step of the Hooked Model is what differentiates it from the traditional Habit Loop (see  The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business). In order to ensure that users come back to your product, it is important to ask the users to make an investment. By making an investment, users will yet another reason to come back to your product, instead of someone else's. There are many products out there that are better than facebook. But, by having users store their data on there and make friends and comment on other people's data it makes it difficult for users to leave. Nir Eyal explains that in studies user's value their own work 4x more than work of higher quality:Those who invested labor associated greater value with their creations simply because they had worked on them. Ariely calls this the IKEA effect. By having your user invest in your product, it makes repeat usage more likely."

When he asked if I wanted to work on the book with him, I immediately jumped on the opportunity. I have learned an incredible amount since then that have and will continue to guide my product decisions and perspective on technology.Although I'm clearly biased toward the book, I would not have spent several dozen hours writing and working with Nir if I didn't believe it would be valuable for others."
98,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5246491-suzanne,5,"Excellent, well-written book. I've been reading Nir's blog for a while now so was already a fan. Nir and Ryan do a great job of bringing everything together in the Hooked process and laying it out in a logical and motivating way. The book takes you through the theory, giving examples to bring the theory alive and then provides exercises at the end of each chapter to help you take what you've learned and immediately apply it to your own product or service. It was refreshing to see a lot of new stories/examples in between some of the familiar ones. I particularly loved all of the psychology behind habits. Hooked introduced me to the concept of reactance (in the psychology sense). Pretty powerful stuff. Overall, this was fascinating content which is making me think about each of the apps on my iPhone/iPad and how they've either hooked me … or haven't. "

Also liked the Bible case study he added, though I think he should've made the analysis more rigorously follow the principles, if only in a data sheet format saying how each of the principles are applied. Then dive into the cooler narrative.But this is really well organized and written. Coherent, presented clearly and actionable. Also makes me want to read some more Ariely, Dan, books. :)"

Being a psychologist that works in user experience design, I at first was not sure how much I'd gain from a book written on a subject I consider myself to have deep knowledge of. However, I found it to be a great book and I did learn a lot. I'd recommend this book for anyone that's interested in learning how psychological mechanisms can be used to form habits, and therefore keep people ""hooked"" on their products. "
101,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13680195-arjun,3,"I highly recommend this book for anyone building a technology company or anyone who has interest in products.As someone who's spend the last couple of years reading extensively about product and user psychology, I didn't find the book extremely insightful, but the book is very good for anyone who wants to get a baseline understanding of how to build and reinforce habits in products.Books like this are worth their value because they give you a new lens to see the world. The success state would be reading this book and then seeing patterns emerge every day in the products you use (and applying that knowledge in products you build). At a minimum, the introduction and first few chapters do a fantastic job introducing the ""framework"" for how to think about products. Knowledge isn't very useful without application though -- after reading this book, I recommend trying some habit-forming products to see technique in practice. Some apps that do this particularly well are Lift, codecademy and fitocracy (I find that health/fitness/edtech/behavior change applications make a very conscious effort to put use these techniques for Good).

This book should have been 50% as long as it is. Perhaps even shorter. Do authors seriously think that more words is the same as getting your point across? In all fairness, there were synopses at appropriate places in the book, so you could skip any nonsense and go through just salient points. Despite that, the book should have been way shorter. Take a star off. There. I feel better already.Having gotten that out of the way, the Hook model described in the book is very useful. Hooking a user has four elements: 1. Trigger: What is the itch that the user needs to scratch2. Action: What is she going to do next?3. Variable reward: What is she going to get for it? Is she satisfied yet wanting more?4. Investment: The more work and time the user invests, the more she will keep coming back to it.There is a lot more in this book about different types of triggers, variable rewards and investments. The book also has some useful nuggets about product testing or habit testing. Above all, the most important part of the book is the sections that ask you to evaluate the products you are building now. That somehow drove home the message far more effectively than anything else in the book. Perhaps that's just my learning style - learn by doing.There are a number of jobs/roles in which I could have used the lessons from this book. Overall, 4 stars for how much this book is going to help me hone products and technology over time. "

Hooked explains the utopia of product designers - building something that your users can get addicted to, something that if your users don't use, it hurts them. I am pretty sure people who have tried to overcome the 'Whatsapp-addiction' will get me.Definite recommendation to all stakeholders of a product as well. Having said that, 'Don't Make Me Think' still remains the closer one to strike home."

The book is amazingly structured and would definitely make you think about the technologies that have hooked you.The best way to get over social media addiction is to understand how it actually works! And this book will definitely help you in understanding that.

116,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5219990-abhishek-anbazhagan,1,"When I was furiously networking in the summer of 2017, a chance encounter lead to a conversation on books and I heard my quarry say - ""I don't read business books that are less than 10 years old"". I remember coming away from that exchange thinking - Waw! What a tool! However, this book has now made me see the wisdom in that offhand comment.Hooked is roundly recommended by every product person and builder of any repute in tech. Either these simple haven't read the book or they are just plain stupid. Nir Eyal's seductively titled book offers to pull the veil behind the success of companies like Facebook, Paypal, Airbnb, and other billion-dollar behemoths that has anyone who has ever successfully gotten ""Hello World"" to be executed in C++, frothing at the mouth. The book is a post-facto look at these companies and how they ""created"" virality. It offers the promise that you too can use these frameworks to create the next viral product. This is the problem. When Zuck designed Facebook or Facemash, he wasn't thinking about how to use the Endowment Effect to increase value or studying Behavioral Econ to codify how he could incorporate variable rewards in the form of likes and comments to keep people coming back to the platform. Simply, people who build viral products were not using a framework. So, this reduction of virality and stickiness to a few factors is absurd at best and asinine at worst.Here is my attempt at using the ""Hooked"" framework to analyze a habit-forming product - toothpaste. If you keenly observe, the internal trigger for someone to use a toothpaste is not to have bad breath so that they can signal to potential mates of their preferred genders of their genetic robustness. On understanding, this crucial insight, toothpaste companies can create a product. They should be careful that it isn't a product that you use once and it solves your problem. You must keep the user coming back to it at a determined frequency, say once every morning after they wake up. This variable reward compared with the internal trigger will cause virality and make your toothpaste viral (and also your competition which reduces your product to becoming a commodity but let's not think about that for now). Now, use this framework in the productivity app you are building to get everyone in the world ""hooked"" to your product. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk! *If you work in product, you should be furiously applauding right now*I want to revisit the early maxim I was introduced to - Don't read any business book that is less than 10 years old. This book simply packages what was old into new with jargon. Clay Christensen's Job-To-Be-Done and Ted Levitt's - ""People want quarter-inch holes, not drills maxim"" is timeless for a reason. Those ideas were developed through unbiased common sense and articulated through simple language and far more importantly, have been successfully reproduced over and over again. The same cannot be said for ideas expressed in Hooked. This book is a fine example of a misguided blog post that became a book because snake-oil sells well during a gold rush. When no one knows what they are doing, the arcane becomes interesting. If you are considering reading this, look for an article on Clay Christen's JBTD and read Ted Levitt's Marketing Myopia essay. Once you finish them, try to summarize what they are saying. Yes, I am saying, read a little to educate yourself and maybe, just maybe, think for yourself. If you are going to be building a billion-dollar product, you may seek all the advice you want but you are going to have to think for yourself and make decisions based on your convictions and be able to explain them so that others can understand. Be wary of anyone who tries to sell you a secret. Listen with an open mind and evaluate the ""secret"" on its merits. As Naval Ravikanth said on Joe Rogan - There are no new ideas. All new ideas are old ideas and someone has probably already said it better. I hate that this book has made me agree with Naval Ravikanth who I find to be insufferable. But I assume that is perhaps growth, you don't have to like the person to think their idea has merit. I don't like Hooked, perhaps Nir Eyal is a good product person."
117,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15639925-t-nu-vahtra,4,"This book does not stand out that much from new/novel information perspective (that is not what ""classics"" are supposed to do anyway) but it is a good toolbox for validating your idea or product if it meets the criteria for habit creation. It's often not about solving a problem or satisfying the user but actually about removing pain that might have been created by the product itself in the first place and how to keep the consumer ""in the loop"".Habit-forming products:*Attract long-term customers.*Do the advertising for you.*Have a strong competitive position.*Companies can be more flexible when pricing habit-forming products.The 4 states of the Hook model:*The trigger: an external event that gets us to try a product for the first time, for example a TV commercial.*The action: what we need to do in order to user the product, for example registering on an online community.*The reward: the fulfillment of the need that originally motivated us to take action, for example being entertained if the motivation was boredom.*The investment: something of value that we have invested in the product, such as time, money or information.The last step leads back to the start of the cycle and these steps are repeated over and over again, the user starts to develop internal triggers instead of external ones.Normally we use products to solve problems that we have. Most typically those problems have to do with avoiding pain or feeling pleasure. Often the most powerful internal triggers are negative emotions (boredom of fear of social disconnection, FOMO..).It takes action if preconditions are filled: a trigger is needed, person must be sufficiently motivated to take action and be capable of doing so. Companies should prioritize increasing the user's ability to use the product (it's far easier and cheaper to make the product easier to use than to increase user's motivation). Human motivation usually consists of simple goals like seeking pleasure and avoiding pain, seeking hope and avoiding fear, and seeking social acceptance and avoiding rejection. Our craving for rewards actually causes a stronger emotional reaction than receiving the reward itself (variability, unpredictable award i.e. in Casino). Ultimately reward must always relate to the user's initial motivation to use the product. Investment:*We see things more valuable if we have invested something in them.*We try to be consistent in our own behavior.*We have the tendency to adjust our world view to suit our behavior. Responsible product design:*Does the product enhance the user's lives?*Would the entrepreneur himself use the product?“79 percent of smartphone owners check their device within 15 minutes of waking up every morning.” “Gourville claims that for new entrants to stand a chance, they can’t just be better, they must be nine times better. Why such a high bar? Because old habits die hard and new products or services need to offer dramatic improvements to shake users out of old routines. Gourville writes that products that require a high degree of behavior change are doomed to fail even if the benefits of using the new product are clear and substantial.” “Many innovations fail because consumers irrationally overvalue the old while companies irrationally overvalue the new.” “Instead of relying on expensive marketing, habit-forming companies link their services to the users’ daily routines and emotions.” “To change behavior, products must ensure the user feels in control. People must want to use the service, not feel they have to.”"

People just don't think in these terms. You'll often find that people's declared preferences - what they say they want - are far different from their revealed preferences-what they actually do. The more effort we put into something, the more likely we are to value it....the first place for the entrepreneur or designer to look for new opportunities is in the mirror. ...ask ""what problem do I wish someone else would solve for me?""The Scarcity Effect - The appearance of scarcity affects people's perception of value.The cookie example - there are two jars of filled with the same cookies, the first one has 12 cookies, the other one just 2. People will value the second jar cookies higher because of the scarcity effect.The Framing Effect - The mind takes shortcuts informed by our surroundings to make quick and sometimes erroneous judgments.The Bell example. World-class violinist Joshua Bell played a free impromptu concert in Washington D.C. subway station, but only few people stopped to listen, whereas his concerts in Carnegie Hall for hundreds of dollars tickets are sell-outs.The Anchoring Effect - People often anchor to one piece of information when making a decision. The Endowed Progress Effect - ... a phenomenon that increases motivation as people believe they are nearing a goal.The car wash example - 2 groups of customers were given punch cards awarding a free car wash once the cards fully punched. One group got a blank punch card with 8 squares, the other was given card with 10 squares with 2 already punched. The group 2 had 82% higher completion rate. Rewards of the Tribe - Our brains are adapted to seek rewards that make us feel accepted, attractive, important, and included.Rewards of the Hunt - The need to acquire objects, such as food and other supplies that aid our survival, is part of our brain's operating system.The five fundamental questions:1. What do users really want? What pain is your product relieving? (Internal trigger)2. What brings users to your service? (External trigger)3. What is the simplest action users take in anticipation of reward, and how you simplify your product to make this action easier? (Action)4. Are users fulfilled by the reward yet left wanting more? (Variable reward)5. What ""bit of work"" do users invest in your product? Does it load the next trigger and store value to improve the product with use (Investment)"

(The point is you never know, even the apps / tasks designed to be used / performed occasionally might change customers' routines and make them addicted or ""hooked"" without them acknowledging that.)We have been using online applications or playing games for a significant stage of our life, that's why we already have vague or well-formed (for some) idea about majority of the concepts detailed in the book. That's why, now if we are creating this applications ourselves, these techniques such as variable rewards seem so obvious to us and we implement it without giving it a thought. That's the beauty of creating products that you love. Why read this book :1) Despite the fact that a significant share of the content is obvious to us, it makes you pause, think & reflect. ""Why do you want to use this feature in your app? Because you have used similar products before and you have an ikling that some of your actions were affected by which features."" If you want to build new habits, it's vital to understand the basic pyschology behind users' actions.2) It gives you quite a few moments to recall your own actions of past and present when you were(are) ""hooked"". If you need to get rid of any such habits, this book might help. Well, I personally doubt that but my dataset is too small to be taken seriously.3) There are exercises that you should definitely do if they are applicable to your product.4) I happen to find some or most of the facts in other design books as well, probably they are common knowlegde in design field, but none of them are written in the engaging way ""Hooked"" is, that is, with relevant examples and explanations. However, I've read very few books on design but ""Hooked"" stands out.Negatives :1) A bit repetitive.But in that case, you can simply skip that repetitive content. I think readers impose too many rules on themselves for reading. In my opinion, reading output should be weighed in terms of how much you gain out of a book that you can apply in real lives and not the number of books you read 100%.Recommended to :1) Must read for anyone creating any online product or apps.2) Might be useful for users who believe that they are addicted to some application and that it's interfering with their lives."
120,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1477685-ted,1,"Update: I ended up publishing a longer version of this - with a discussion of the trend towards more addictive technology in the tech industry more broadly - on the Huffington Post. It covers a lot of the same stuff in this review, but is likely a bit more polished: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ted-mcc...----------------I’ve heard a great deal about this book in the past month - first, I saw Eyal give a talk here in San Francisco (I hadn't heard of him, but someone recommended I go - the talk was sold out and a spot opened up), then someone at a meeting mentioned the book/talk and said it was 'amazing', then the other day I heard him featured on an episode of Planet Money. At least within the tech scene, it seems this book is very well-known, and that, to some extent, scares me. (And to put that into context, I'm a technology designer/researcher - i.e., I'm the kind of person who should be absolutely frothing at the mouth (happily) about this thing.)Most of the reviews I've been seeing have been addressing Eyal's execution of the 'Hooked' concept, which I'd give something like a 2.5 - the ideas are clearly expressed, but the writing is fairly dumbed down, and the book's ideas could (and given his writing style, should) have been expressed in about a quarter of the length.My biggest problem with the book is its basic premise, that 'hooking' people - that is, making them compulsive users of your technology product - is something worth doing. Eyal makes a number of assumptions about the benefits of technology here - he commonly alludes to Facebook, Instagram, et al as 'solving' our feelings of loneliness, for instance. Among many other occurrences, a line in the book says Instagram ""helps users dispel boredom by connecting them with others."" Everything about technology use is placed in a positive light - 'solving' problems, 'connecting' users. It's the standard litany of Silicon Valley Tech Speak, but bumped up a great many RPMs and set on continuous repeat.The idea of 'hooking' a user to your product is strikingly similar to that of causing a user 'to be addicted' to your product, including use of the same mechanisms to do it. The third piece of the 'hook' cycle is the use of variable rewards to help make users habitual users of your product, for example - this is the exact mechanism that makes gambling so potentially addictive. Even the book's cover art shows a mouse pointer clicking somewhere near the nucleus accumbens of a brain, the dopamine center manipulated by variable rewards that help fuel behavioral addictions. Eyal discusses how, in the 1950's, Olds and Milner would stimulate mice in this region, and see them forgo food and water in exchange for more stimulation. (Think 'Infinite Jest', with mice in cages.) If his book espouses manipulation, at least he's (relatively) honest about it.Eyal discusses - very briefly, at the very end of his talk/book - the morality of manipulating people in this way, and of causing, if you successfully carry out his formula and do everything else right, your users to develop behavioral addictions to your product. But his discussion of morality is too little, too late - during his talk, he spends forty minutes discussing how his model will allow audience members to build the next Facebook, and then five minutes pleading with them to use this information only to improve the world. ""Basically, I want you all to use this for good,"" he begs, and then quotes Gandhi (yes, really), ""Be the change you wish to see in the world."" (The Mahatma, by the way, apparently never actually said this.) That's about it. When I saw the talk, I suspected he added this bit at the end to appease sane-minded audience members and prevent heckling.In the book, at least, Eyal includes a short chapter near the end discussing the morality of this approach, and, perhaps as a way of showing how his 'hooked' formula can be used for good, a case study illustrating how a Bible app - YouVersion - carries out (more or less) the four steps of the hooked model. (The chapter also employs a nauseating number of religious puns: ""Switching to a different digital Bible - God forbid...""; ""Gruenewald's app is a Godsend"", etc.) But it's unconvincing; and it's perhaps telling that the best positive example Eyal can find of a technology product achieving good with his model is 'getting people to read the Bible more', which is dubious at best. I understand that this kind of thing happens all the time - you'd better believe that Facebook, Google, and many other technology companies are many steps ahead of even Eyal in this game. But it bothers me to see it filtered down and formulatized in a set of followable steps. It might bother me less if Eyal emphasized the ways in which this could be used for good throughout the book - for health behavior change, for instance, an area of technology design that's quickly growing and has shown potential for doing actual good. Eyal references Sunstein and Thaler's 'Nudge', another book I just finished (and one that I highly recommend). Those authors also present methods that could be seen as manipulative, but are careful to include frank and lengthy discussions on how to morally employ these techniques - not a hollow plea to 'only do good' with the methods followed by a flippant reading of a Gandhi quote. The authors of 'Nudge', moreover, fill the book with case studies in which their concept has - or at least, can - produce real, substantial benefit for great numbers of people. That book deserves attention and praise - people should be paying attention to *that* one.Paul Graham has somewhat famously said (Eyal even references it) that ""The world is more addictive than it was 40 years ago.... and the world will get more addictive in the next 40 years than it did in the last 40. We'll increasingly be defined by what we say no to."" It bothers me greatly to see a book outlining *how* to make the world more addictive - and weakly excusing itself for doing so - seeing such success, especially here in Silicon Valley, where people designing products that 'touch people's lives' are only learning how to do so more effectively, more thoroughly, more persistently, more addictively."
121,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,4,"Extremely valuable book for anyone building products designed to engage people frequently. Given that I think daily about how to make Goodreads better and more engaging for people, this was a useful book. I think I knew a lot of it already, but often being forced to think about things again can be useful - and there are a few useful new ways of thinking about things that I learned. One of the main useful ideas the book talks about in engaging users is having triggers to bring the user back to the product. This can be an external trigger - like an email or notification or ad that brings the user back - but the best products also form internal triggers. Ever get bored or lonely and find yourself on Facebook? Or wondering what is happening in the world and end up on Twitter? Or see something beautiful or inspiring and then pull out Instagram? Or feel the need to escape and relax and open a book or turn on a movie or a sports game? Our emotions often drive our behavior, and each emotion is mapped to a set of products we could use to ""scratch the itch"" of whatever we are feeling. These mappings become habits. ""Once a technology has created an association in users’ minds that the product is the solution of choice, they return on their own, no longer needing prompts from external triggers.""I think my favorite external triggers mentioned in the book were from the bible app example, where it sent a push notification to people if they walked into a strip club! And it sent another one on xmas day that did well. Timely matters!Nir then talks about how to get users to take actions. The framework is obvious, but very true, and useful to remember when evaluating products. It's fairly well summed up in the below quote. There was a lot of good discussion about point #2 in terms of having simple design, being mobile, etc.there are three ingredients required to initiate any and all behaviors: (1) the user must have sufficient motivation; (2) the user must have the ability to complete the desired action; and (3) a trigger must be present to activate the behavior.""Another point Nir makes around actions - which is also an obvious one but worth really paying attention to when designing a product - is around getting frequent engagement with a product when a user is new to it.""For new behaviors to really take hold, they must occur often.""""frequent engagement with a product—especially over a short period of time—increases the likelihood of forming new routines.""The author then talks about variable rewards. I've known that variability - or serendipitousness as I like to think of it - is a very important driver of any engaging product. It's why we love sports, gambling, games, Facebook newsfeed, and good stories - not knowing what we'll find is exciting. Nir breaks down variable rewards into three types - the tribe, the hunt, and the self. The tribe is social validation - think of Facebook likes on content you posted. The hunt is something intrinsic in our brains that dates back to prehistoric times when we literally lived for the hunt - think of hunting for interesting content on your Twitter feed, or gambling looking for payoffs. The self is more for personal gratification - wanting to complete a puzzle you started or beat a video game you started."
122,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1501068-anca,1,"This book was a huge disappointment. It is full of speculation and misleading 'information'. It has a very big fluff to substance ratio and the little substance it does present is deprived of all nuance. Arguably, that isn't reason enough to give it one star. The determining factor is the authors tendency of quoting studies and then misrepresenting the findings. For example: a study of the internet usage of 216 students. The study, conducted over the course of a month, found correlation between increased internet usage and indicators of depression. The author of the book presents this correlation with a much greater degree of certainty, he exaggerates the duration of the study, cites methodology that isn't found in the study, selects one possible hypothesis: depressed people use the internet more because it makes them feel better and runs with it, expanding this theory with lush examples of solace seeking Instagram users. The study itself only mentions that it notices an increased number of ""chat octets"" in the traffic analysis and one of the possible explanations is that depressive people are joining depression chat rooms in order to find relief (but they have no way of knowing). I find this kind of mistreatment of research and scientific certainty repulsive."

I wondered why some product can make the users addicted while some product cannot. I was faced with many problems and felt really anxious at that time.One day, I drove to work listening to the audio introducing the book “Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products.” It is from an APP named Bookey.https://share.bookey.app/goodreads The main idea of this book summarized by Bookey was very impressive; that is, how to make users “get hooked” on your products.It attracted me a lot, and that was absolutely what I needed! I even stopped in the nearest parking lot to listen to it absorbedly.Then it introduced a totally new idea to me-“Hook Model.” It was said that there are four steps to form users’ reliance on the products, namely triggering users’ desire to act, making users act, providing rewards and making users invest time and efforts. Most importantly, it also introduced some tips on how to use the “Hook Model” when developing new Internet products.I felt that this book was exactly what I need for my work. So I just turned to this book for help. I found that this book was very useful. It includes several cases like Facebook, Twitter, and even a case study focusing on how to build habit-forming products. It inspired me a lot when deciding several functions for the products. Sometimes, I felt the book was a little bit difficult to follow. However, with the outlines provided by the APP Bookey, I could understand the idea of the book much more easily, and also apply it for my Internet products. For example, when I tried to use the “Hook Model” when developing our products, I began with two important questions mentioned both in this book and the APP Bookey: “Will I use this product myself” and “Can this product greatly improve user’s life quality.” Actually, I never thought of the second question when I began to develop my products. I only thought them as my tasks and tried to make my products include all kinds of functions other products used. After that, I just followed the lead of the book and did the “user habit testing” to identify users of our products, to codify users’ behavior, and to modify our products. After doing that, I found myself become a user of our products and was dying for our products. Sometimes, I cannot remember some tips on how to use the “Hook Model,” the APP Bookey helped me a lot since it provided the mind map of the key ideas of the book. Moreover, I could check the APP Bookey whenever I forgot taking the book with me.The product has been in public. Thanks to this book and APP Bookey, the product has gained some attention, and the numbers of active users remain at a satisfactory level. I hope people who are developing new products can turn to “Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products” for help.That’s my understanding of this book, and hope to share thinking about this book with you."

It's curious how the tech-related psychological research lines up neatly with what I've recently read about psychology of relationships.

126,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/44279821-joe-soltzberg,3,"Hooked is an excellent (short) book on the use of psychology in product design. As technology becomes increasingly available to entrepreneurs of all backgrounds, design has become just as important as engineering. Correspondingly, all entrepreneurs should have a good understanding of the principals behind building habit-forming products. In that respect, this book does a great job. This book may not provide any grand revelations or have particularly unique/fascinating case studies, but it is still very valuable (thus the 3 stars, perhaps closer to 3.5). Below I've provided an outline of my notes on the book so that those of us less inclined to read this can still learn the basics. I do still recommend reading the book for the useful examples and exercises at the end of the chapters (which you most definitely should do). I highly recommend reading the book with a specific product in mind that you would like to apply the lessons of Hooked to. The basic idea behind Hooked is the Hook Model. The model consists of four parts:-Trigger-Action-Variable Reward-InvestmentQuite simply, using a trigger should prompt a user to take an action that results in a variable reward, followed by further investment. This cycle should continue to repeat itself until the user becomes 'hooked'. TriggerThe trigger is what makes a user turn to your product. If there isn't a trigger, then what will prompt the user to engage with your product? Nir Eyal explains that there are two types of triggers: external and internal triggers. While external triggers such as an app icon or an advertisement can be useful in getting a user to use your product, truly addictive products use internal triggers. An internal triggers is usually a feeling or emotion that prompts an action to resolve that feeling or emotion. It is easy to see the power of internal triggers. They are omnipresent and a constant part of our lives. Further, it is internal triggers that are the basis of true habit formation on a biological level. Nir Eyal explains:In the case of internal triggers, the information about what to do next is encoded as a learned association in the user's memory.There are numerous examples of this. People use snapchat and instagram to resolve their fear of missing out. People use reddit or facebook to resolve their boredom. Have you ever wondered how you just magically seemed to end up using one of these products? It's because it forms a subconscious habit linked with an emotion. So, when building your product make sure to find the internal trigger that you should have your product be associated with it. That is the first step.ActionNow that you have the trigger, as soon as a user feels that 'itch' your product will pop into their head. But that alone is not enough. It is just as important to make sure that it is easy enough to 'scratch' that itch. The action to do that needs to be a simplistic as possible. After all, if habits are subconscious then it will have to be relatively simple. The book describes the following factors that should be taken into account:There are three ingredients required to initiate any and all behaviors: (1) the user must have sufficient motivation; (2) the user must have the ability to completed the desired action; and (3) a trigger must be present to activate the actionIt is important to focus on motivation and ability. Motivation is often in the form of resolving the emotion associated with the trigger. Ability is where there is much room for innovation. Consider companies like Blogger and Twitter. They made the action of writing significantly easier by reducing the steps necessary to resolve the trigger. This led to massive success. It is important that your action is as simple as possible. Variable RewardNow that the user has engaged with your product, it is important to reward them. All habits end with a reward. When you post a picture on instagram, the reward is likes from other people. When you complete your diary for the day on MyFitnessPal, the reward is a nice message telling you about how successful you've been. Even bad habits have 'rewards'. Cigarettes give you a nicotine high and alcohol can make it feel like your problems are solved (but of course not really). Thus, your product not only has to make it easy to scratch that itch... it must also relieve that itch, but that alone is not enough. The rewards need to be variable. Nir Eyal gives many examples and explanations, but the best is Skinner's Pigeon Experiment. In the experiment there are two groups. One is a group of pigeons that are in a cage where if they press a button they will be given some food pellets, but the amount of food dispensed is the same every time. The second group has the same setup, but is given a variable reward every time; sometimes there is more food and sometimes there is less. Skinner found that adding variability significantly increased the frequency of the pigeons pressing the button. Nir Eyal writes:Skinner's pigeons tell us a great deal about what helps drive our own behaviors. More recent experiments reveal that variability increases activity in the nucleus accumbens and spikes levels of neurotransmitter dopamine, driving our hungry search for rewards.There are many products that inherently do this. For example, on facebook you never know if you'll find good content in the feed or how many likes your status will get. The same phenomenon happened with the early version of Zynga games. So for even stronger habits, a variable reward is necessary.InvestmentThe final step of the Hooked Model is what differentiates it from the traditional Habit Loop (see  The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business). In order to ensure that users come back to your product, it is important to ask the users to make an investment. By making an investment, users will yet another reason to come back to your product, instead of someone else's. There are many products out there that are better than facebook. But, by having users store their data on there and make friends and comment on other people's data it makes it difficult for users to leave. Nir Eyal explains that in studies user's value their own work 4x more than work of higher quality:Those who invested labor associated greater value with their creations simply because they had worked on them. Ariely calls this the IKEA effect. By having your user invest in your product, it makes repeat usage more likely."

When he asked if I wanted to work on the book with him, I immediately jumped on the opportunity. I have learned an incredible amount since then that have and will continue to guide my product decisions and perspective on technology.Although I'm clearly biased toward the book, I would not have spent several dozen hours writing and working with Nir if I didn't believe it would be valuable for others."

Nir and Ryan do a great job of bringing everything together in the Hooked process and laying it out in a logical and motivating way. The book takes you through the theory, giving examples to bring the theory alive and then provides exercises at the end of each chapter to help you take what you've learned and immediately apply it to your own product or service. It was refreshing to see a lot of new stories/examples in between some of the familiar ones. I particularly loved all of the psychology behind habits. Hooked introduced me to the concept of reactance (in the psychology sense). Pretty powerful stuff. Overall, this was fascinating content which is making me think about each of the apps on my iPhone/iPad and how they've either hooked me … or haven't. "

Also liked the Bible case study he added, though I think he should've made the analysis more rigorously follow the principles, if only in a data sheet format saying how each of the principles are applied. Then dive into the cooler narrative.But this is really well organized and written. Coherent, presented clearly and actionable. Also makes me want to read some more Ariely, Dan, books. :)"
130,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7195895-elisa,5,"I decided to read this book, because I am a long-time follower of the author's blog. Being a psychologist that works in user experience design, I at first was not sure how much I'd gain from a book written on a subject I consider myself to have deep knowledge of. However, I found it to be a great book and I did learn a lot. I'd recommend this book for anyone that's interested in learning how psychological mechanisms can be used to form habits, and therefore keep people ""hooked"" on their products. "
131,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13680195-arjun,3,"I highly recommend this book for anyone building a technology company or anyone who has interest in products.As someone who's spend the last couple of years reading extensively about product and user psychology, I didn't find the book extremely insightful, but the book is very good for anyone who wants to get a baseline understanding of how to build and reinforce habits in products.Books like this are worth their value because they give you a new lens to see the world. The success state would be reading this book and then seeing patterns emerge every day in the products you use (and applying that knowledge in products you build). At a minimum, the introduction and first few chapters do a fantastic job introducing the ""framework"" for how to think about products. Knowledge isn't very useful without application though -- after reading this book, I recommend trying some habit-forming products to see technique in practice. Some apps that do this particularly well are Lift, codecademy and fitocracy (I find that health/fitness/edtech/behavior change applications make a very conscious effort to put use these techniques for Good).

134,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18409907-kartik-santhanakrishnan,4,"I'll start with a complaint because I want to get my grumpiness out of the way before I take it out on someone at work. This book should have been 50% as long as it is. Perhaps even shorter. Do authors seriously think that more words is the same as getting your point across? In all fairness, there were synopses at appropriate places in the book, so you could skip any nonsense and go through just salient points. Despite that, the book should have been way shorter. Take a star off. There. I feel better already.Having gotten that out of the way, the Hook model described in the book is very useful. Hooking a user has four elements: 1. Trigger: What is the itch that the user needs to scratch2. Action: What is she going to do next?3. Variable reward: What is she going to get for it? Is she satisfied yet wanting more?4. Investment: The more work and time the user invests, the more she will keep coming back to it.There is a lot more in this book about different types of triggers, variable rewards and investments. The book also has some useful nuggets about product testing or habit testing. Above all, the most important part of the book is the sections that ask you to evaluate the products you are building now. That somehow drove home the message far more effectively than anything else in the book. Perhaps that's just my learning style - learn by doing.There are a number of jobs/roles in which I could have used the lessons from this book. Overall, 4 stars for how much this book is going to help me hone products and technology over time. "

146,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5219990-abhishek-anbazhagan,1,"When I was furiously networking in the summer of 2017, a chance encounter lead to a conversation on books and I heard my quarry say - ""I don't read business books that are less than 10 years old"". I remember coming away from that exchange thinking - Waw! What a tool! However, this book has now made me see the wisdom in that offhand comment.Hooked is roundly recommended by every product person and builder of any repute in tech. Either these simple haven't read the book or they are just plain stupid. Nir Eyal's seductively titled book offers to pull the veil behind the success of companies like Facebook, Paypal, Airbnb, and other billion-dollar behemoths that has anyone who has ever successfully gotten ""Hello World"" to be executed in C++, frothing at the mouth. The book is a post-facto look at these companies and how they ""created"" virality. It offers the promise that you too can use these frameworks to create the next viral product. This is the problem. When Zuck designed Facebook or Facemash, he wasn't thinking about how to use the Endowment Effect to increase value or studying Behavioral Econ to codify how he could incorporate variable rewards in the form of likes and comments to keep people coming back to the platform. Simply, people who build viral products were not using a framework. So, this reduction of virality and stickiness to a few factors is absurd at best and asinine at worst.Here is my attempt at using the ""Hooked"" framework to analyze a habit-forming product - toothpaste. If you keenly observe, the internal trigger for someone to use a toothpaste is not to have bad breath so that they can signal to potential mates of their preferred genders of their genetic robustness. On understanding, this crucial insight, toothpaste companies can create a product. They should be careful that it isn't a product that you use once and it solves your problem. You must keep the user coming back to it at a determined frequency, say once every morning after they wake up. This variable reward compared with the internal trigger will cause virality and make your toothpaste viral (and also your competition which reduces your product to becoming a commodity but let's not think about that for now). Now, use this framework in the productivity app you are building to get everyone in the world ""hooked"" to your product. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk! *If you work in product, you should be furiously applauding right now*I want to revisit the early maxim I was introduced to - Don't read any business book that is less than 10 years old. This book simply packages what was old into new with jargon. Clay Christensen's Job-To-Be-Done and Ted Levitt's - ""People want quarter-inch holes, not drills maxim"" is timeless for a reason. Those ideas were developed through unbiased common sense and articulated through simple language and far more importantly, have been successfully reproduced over and over again. The same cannot be said for ideas expressed in Hooked. This book is a fine example of a misguided blog post that became a book because snake-oil sells well during a gold rush. When no one knows what they are doing, the arcane becomes interesting. If you are considering reading this, look for an article on Clay Christen's JBTD and read Ted Levitt's Marketing Myopia essay. Once you finish them, try to summarize what they are saying. Yes, I am saying, read a little to educate yourself and maybe, just maybe, think for yourself. If you are going to be building a billion-dollar product, you may seek all the advice you want but you are going to have to think for yourself and make decisions based on your convictions and be able to explain them so that others can understand. Be wary of anyone who tries to sell you a secret. Listen with an open mind and evaluate the ""secret"" on its merits. As Naval Ravikanth said on Joe Rogan - There are no new ideas. All new ideas are old ideas and someone has probably already said it better. I hate that this book has made me agree with Naval Ravikanth who I find to be insufferable. But I assume that is perhaps growth, you don't have to like the person to think their idea has merit. I don't like Hooked, perhaps Nir Eyal is a good product person."
147,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15639925-t-nu-vahtra,4,"This book does not stand out that much from new/novel information perspective (that is not what ""classics"" are supposed to do anyway) but it is a good toolbox for validating your idea or product if it meets the criteria for habit creation. It's often not about solving a problem or satisfying the user but actually about removing pain that might have been created by the product itself in the first place and how to keep the consumer ""in the loop"".Habit-forming products:*Attract long-term customers.*Do the advertising for you.*Have a strong competitive position.*Companies can be more flexible when pricing habit-forming products.The 4 states of the Hook model:*The trigger: an external event that gets us to try a product for the first time, for example a TV commercial.*The action: what we need to do in order to user the product, for example registering on an online community.*The reward: the fulfillment of the need that originally motivated us to take action, for example being entertained if the motivation was boredom.*The investment: something of value that we have invested in the product, such as time, money or information.The last step leads back to the start of the cycle and these steps are repeated over and over again, the user starts to develop internal triggers instead of external ones.Normally we use products to solve problems that we have. Most typically those problems have to do with avoiding pain or feeling pleasure. Often the most powerful internal triggers are negative emotions (boredom of fear of social disconnection, FOMO..).It takes action if preconditions are filled: a trigger is needed, person must be sufficiently motivated to take action and be capable of doing so. Companies should prioritize increasing the user's ability to use the product (it's far easier and cheaper to make the product easier to use than to increase user's motivation). Human motivation usually consists of simple goals like seeking pleasure and avoiding pain, seeking hope and avoiding fear, and seeking social acceptance and avoiding rejection. Our craving for rewards actually causes a stronger emotional reaction than receiving the reward itself (variability, unpredictable award i.e. in Casino). Ultimately reward must always relate to the user's initial motivation to use the product. Investment:*We see things more valuable if we have invested something in them.*We try to be consistent in our own behavior.*We have the tendency to adjust our world view to suit our behavior. Responsible product design:*Does the product enhance the user's lives?*Would the entrepreneur himself use the product?“79 percent of smartphone owners check their device within 15 minutes of waking up every morning.” “Gourville claims that for new entrants to stand a chance, they can’t just be better, they must be nine times better. Why such a high bar? Because old habits die hard and new products or services need to offer dramatic improvements to shake users out of old routines. Gourville writes that products that require a high degree of behavior change are doomed to fail even if the benefits of using the new product are clear and substantial.” “Many innovations fail because consumers irrationally overvalue the old while companies irrationally overvalue the new.” “Instead of relying on expensive marketing, habit-forming companies link their services to the users’ daily routines and emotions.” “To change behavior, products must ensure the user feels in control. People must want to use the service, not feel they have to.”"

People just don't think in these terms. You'll often find that people's declared preferences - what they say they want - are far different from their revealed preferences-what they actually do. The more effort we put into something, the more likely we are to value it....the first place for the entrepreneur or designer to look for new opportunities is in the mirror. ...ask ""what problem do I wish someone else would solve for me?""The Scarcity Effect - The appearance of scarcity affects people's perception of value.The cookie example - there are two jars of filled with the same cookies, the first one has 12 cookies, the other one just 2. People will value the second jar cookies higher because of the scarcity effect.The Framing Effect - The mind takes shortcuts informed by our surroundings to make quick and sometimes erroneous judgments.The Bell example. World-class violinist Joshua Bell played a free impromptu concert in Washington D.C. subway station, but only few people stopped to listen, whereas his concerts in Carnegie Hall for hundreds of dollars tickets are sell-outs.The Anchoring Effect - People often anchor to one piece of information when making a decision. The Endowed Progress Effect - ... a phenomenon that increases motivation as people believe they are nearing a goal.The car wash example - 2 groups of customers were given punch cards awarding a free car wash once the cards fully punched. One group got a blank punch card with 8 squares, the other was given card with 10 squares with 2 already punched. The group 2 had 82% higher completion rate. Rewards of the Tribe - Our brains are adapted to seek rewards that make us feel accepted, attractive, important, and included.Rewards of the Hunt - The need to acquire objects, such as food and other supplies that aid our survival, is part of our brain's operating system.The five fundamental questions:1. What do users really want? What pain is your product relieving? (Internal trigger)2. What brings users to your service? (External trigger)3. What is the simplest action users take in anticipation of reward, and how you simplify your product to make this action easier? (Action)4. Are users fulfilled by the reward yet left wanting more? (Variable reward)5. What ""bit of work"" do users invest in your product? Does it load the next trigger and store value to improve the product with use (Investment)"

(The point is you never know, even the apps / tasks designed to be used / performed occasionally might change customers' routines and make them addicted or ""hooked"" without them acknowledging that.)We have been using online applications or playing games for a significant stage of our life, that's why we already have vague or well-formed (for some) idea about majority of the concepts detailed in the book. That's why, now if we are creating this applications ourselves, these techniques such as variable rewards seem so obvious to us and we implement it without giving it a thought. That's the beauty of creating products that you love. Why read this book :1) Despite the fact that a significant share of the content is obvious to us, it makes you pause, think & reflect. ""Why do you want to use this feature in your app? Because you have used similar products before and you have an ikling that some of your actions were affected by which features."" If you want to build new habits, it's vital to understand the basic pyschology behind users' actions.2) It gives you quite a few moments to recall your own actions of past and present when you were(are) ""hooked"". If you need to get rid of any such habits, this book might help. Well, I personally doubt that but my dataset is too small to be taken seriously.3) There are exercises that you should definitely do if they are applicable to your product.4) I happen to find some or most of the facts in other design books as well, probably they are common knowlegde in design field, but none of them are written in the engaging way ""Hooked"" is, that is, with relevant examples and explanations. However, I've read very few books on design but ""Hooked"" stands out.Negatives :1) A bit repetitive.But in that case, you can simply skip that repetitive content. I think readers impose too many rules on themselves for reading. In my opinion, reading output should be weighed in terms of how much you gain out of a book that you can apply in real lives and not the number of books you read 100%.Recommended to :1) Must read for anyone creating any online product or apps.2) Might be useful for users who believe that they are addicted to some application and that it's interfering with their lives."

Organized into chapters that break down basic human habits and responses in a theoretical way, it offers concrete examples of organizations that are now among the most successful at building habit-forming products. Its Hook Model is an easy-to-understand method for applying complex concepts related to human behavior and responses to business applications. Although focused largely on the technology sector, the ideas the author presents are applicable to any company or individual looking to build something better.Mr. Eyal’s book itself is a habit-forming product. He leaves the reader with a memorable model that they can use in their own businesses and encourages them to return to his website for more insights. Not many theory books take applicability to the level Mr. Eyal’s does. I appreciated his sincere caution that the Hook Model be used for positive ends and acknowledgement that it can be used to foster addictions.This relatively short book is a great road map that points the reader in the right direction to build great products but may not go far enough for some. It will also be dated in a year or two when today’s “hot” companies become passé. Nevertheless, his theories on human behavior may well prove timeless.I give the book five stars and highly recommend it to anyone looking to design better content, goods, or services."

Taking all the apps that have made a huge impact and now praising them for how the do it in hindsight.Yes there were probably some thinking involved, but this is by no means going to work for every new app you create.Also the book doesn't give you any useful advise or tips or plan of action to now do something different from what you were doing. It simply states titbits of what the big guys did. And that you should try do similar.It basically comes down to causing an addiction. This might be great for you selling a product, but is it really adding benefit to anyone, or are you milking it, and making people mindless sheep.

There was a couple half-hearted, minor mentions a long the lines of ""but ya know, use your powers for good. Make sure your product is actually helpful before you get people addicted to it"".

Basically: the best way to build an addictive product is to solve a problem for the user whom you know best—yourself. Make the product so intuitive to use that it inspires investment. We overvalue our own work, so the more we invest, the higher the barrier to switching. Create variability in the level of reward—sometimes the user gets rewarded, other times he doesn’t. And he’s hooked. Hopefully the product is designed for good (and not for evil), since you now have a bunch of addicts on your hands."

The main idea is a ""hook"" concept.There are four parts to this system. There are Trigger, Action, Reward, Investment. Trigger (inner or outer) is forcing a human being to react somehow (like some Push-notifications, SMS, or any other stuff). An inner trigger is that sucking feels when you realize you need to check Instagram third time per one hour.Action is what the user is making when responding to the trigger (usually beneficial for app creators). For example, opening the app and seeing the content. Any use of the product. Then Reward is coming.The reward is any reason why this app is mattering to you. It's what is keeping you engaged.And then an investment. It's like, comment, and any action investment. Everything that the user is leaving in an app, engaging other users. And what makes you feel that the app has enough valuable information no to leave it.I appreciated this book way harder than any other alternative theories. It's an entry-level, of course, but relevant for every digital creator."

171,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5241231-karen-mardahl,1,"Update 20 September 2020. I regret giving this a 3-Star rating in 2015. I did read it with the idea of having happy and engaged users who enjoyed and appreciated my documentation. However, discussions of this book in the intervening years has made me reevaluate what this book is about. I think it is from the company point of view, when it should be the user’s point of view. And I think that getting users hooked or even addicted to products has taken on evil overtones in the past years, which I do not condone. No stars is not really a ranking. I prefer to make the statement that applies to 1-star rankings here, and that is: I do not like this book.(I read this for my UX book club group.)I was almost put off at the very beginning of this book when it seemed that Nir Eyal would not cover my company’s situation. We have a complex piece of enterprise software. We don’t have a cool wearable or an entertaining website or app with aggressive winged creatures who dislike pigs. We have a software application that sits on your desktop and which you “must use” if you are to achieve your work goals each day. “Must use” is when it is installed. If you do not use our software, you are using some other setup, but you must use something to help you with the complicated evaluations that you do to support the decisions that your own brain and know-how must make each day as a part of your job.Where do I get these customers hooked? Where do I insert triggers? How can I, a humble technical communicator, influence these people at all?At this point, if I had picked up the book on my own, I might have put it down for good and said it is not really for me. I like the challenge of the books we choose in the book club: I tackle books that I might otherwise not read and look for nuggets of wisdom that I can use in some way. That also makes it hard for me to assign a rating. Here, I go after the text of the ratings and not the number of stars. That is, here I am not giving 3 stars out of 5 stars. I am saying I liked it. Plain and simple. I liked it means I found some value or can see value in it.After the introduction sections of the book, Eyal pulls out comments from Erika Hall and Jack Dorsey that add more fuel to the argument: ya gotta get out and get into your customers’ brains. That is, go out and observe or interview. Don’t sit on your backsides in your ivory towers.I know some people who would say that this is obvious. Why then are so many people banging on the drum about getting real user feedback through various research methods? Because not everyone has embraced this idea. I think that is why some ideas are repeated across popular books. At some point, the message should get through!This not sitting on your backsides is also something the author embraces. You get homework at the end of every chapter. I confess I have not yet done this. I wanted to read the entire book first. I like a book that gives out homework. I give the author brownie points for this. Some books seem to be just a collection of words that we can all quote and that is that. Homework - the questions he asks at the end of the chapters - is intended to help us put into practice, or at least think about the lessons we have just learned. The questions look sensible and not all that easy and obvious. You really need to think about the task at hand.There is also a summary at the end of each chapter, which is a writing style I like. I underline and take notes in books like this. Still, I really value a summary. It is easier to skim that my underlinings - it's all in one place!I am not in a position to control the design and direction of my company's product. However, as a writer of some of its documentation, I do have the potential to influence how documentation is used. My plan is to review the questions with the documentation in mind. How can I get the product's users ""hooked"" on our documentation? How can I make our documentation a habit that the users just can't kick because they want more? :) I like to think that I can have an affect on the product itself through the documentation. Perhaps through habit-forming ways of using the documentation (and I use a broad definition of documentation - not just the traditional user manual), I can help to nudge the user to use the product in ways that greatly improve their daily workflow and add even greater value to their own work than ever before.We'll see. :)PS I plan to revisit ""How to Get People to Do Stuff: Master the Art and Science of Persuasion and Motivation"" by Susan M. Weinschenk for all the ethical stuff. Just how ethical is it to manipulate others to do things? (Manipulation is what you are doing!)"

173,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3963686-james,1,"I should probably write a review to explain my contempt for this book but I lack the time, energy and inclination to do so. I found it pretty hateful to be honest. Badly written and badly researched, like a lot of self-help, filled with wild ‘turns out’ type assertions that aren’t actually backed up by the research that it cites. Add to this a central message that will appeal to every capitalist shit bag who wants to hijack people’s attention to make a quick buck. Tech-bros will love it. I read it as a precursor to reading the author’s follow-up book which is about reclaiming your attention. So I was pretty disappointed. It isn’t necessarily the author’s fault, of course, because all they’ve done is gather the research about products and strategies that already exist. But I hate the basic assumption that making your products more addictive is a good thing."
174,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9039058-darren,5,"So you want to or need to develop a product people just can’t put down.Short of developing a fiendish contraption that squirts sticky glue in their hands, you will need a good product idea, great implementation and maybe a book like this to dispense a bit of guidance.Here the author sets out to show you how to develop and create habit forming, sticky, engaging products through the so-called “Hook Model” - a four-step process that subtly encourages and shapes customer behaviour. This is a short book that cuts to the chase. Eight chapters which define the “Habit Zone”, the trigger, action, reward and investment phases along with a look at how you may implement things and a case study and watching brief. Clearly this reviewer cannot test and implement the strategies (there are reviews to write) but the author certainly appears to have hit the nail on its head. In many things we are hooked or, as psychologists call it “automatic behaviours triggered by situational cues” (stuff we do without realising it).The author notes that customers can be hooked without expensive marketing or advertising. You just need to engage, get traction and get people talking, sharing and using the product. It need not be viewed as unethical or somehow bad (after all, it is not selling heroin). Your world won’t end in a mass of pain and struggle if you really do put down your smartphone, stop taking a certain brand of coffee or change your habits or allegiances from product X to Y. Not all habits are intrinsically bad. It is a case of perspective. This is not a shortcut, instant just-add-water tool that will give you success and allow you to take over your market. You still have a lot of work to do but you will be better informed and able to take more conscious, focussed decisions. The book is written in an open, clear, humble style that does get you, err, hooked in reading it. In many ways it could still be great reading for the generalist who just loves to know stuff: allowing them to possible fight back against the corporate machine that is trying to get them to buy the latest shiny-shiny. A real clash of titans?Looking at the psychology behind the Hook Model was also interesting even though it feels, once explained, to be fairly common sense. Once you start looking at other products and services with the Hook Model in mind you can see what they are doing. Yes, I’ve been hooked by some of the services named within the book. I started with the free version of Evernote and found its use compelling and valuable and paid for an extended service. Was I hooked by a free service? Yes, of course? It was not the only draw but a combination of a good product, a useful service and an extended period of use that underlined its essentialness and bang, handing over some money was natural. Does that make me a customer for life? Absolutely not, although as a happy customer I am less likely to be looking for alternative solutions and even if I stumble across one/am shown something that could be better, it might be harder to change.The book features figures concerning Evernote and its customers who switched from a free to a paid service. In the first month only 0.5% had signed up. It might have felt a slow burn yet it acted like a rolling stone gathering moss. Within 33 months 11% of users had started paying, nine months further on this was at 26% and the figures continue to grow.Hooked again?Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products, written by Nir Eyal and published by Portfolio/Penguin Group USA.

Your level of app use is so high it takes up at least a quarter of your day and you’d be damn if you’re not using it in the bathroom either. You’re so engrained in use that it doesn’t take a notification or some external trigger to get you to use it: you think of something to research, immediately use Google. What the hell is Samantha up to? Check her Snapchat or Twitter. You do it almost innately. It becomes a facet of your subconscious. In other words, you’re hooked.Why are some products so addicting, like Subway Surfers and Tinder? What keeps us coming back? Why do we keep investing time and energy in these addicting products, and as the title of this book suggests, how can we continue to make more of them? Hooked - Stanford Professor Nir Eyal’s exposition into the world of habit forming products - help us tackle these questions, first with a simple premise: habits are behaviors with little or no conscious and businesses that can turn the use of their apps into something habitual improve their competitive advantage. Yet, this is easier said than done and not every product becomes a Play Store chart topper, so how can an entrepreneur or hustler get closer to their next addicting breakthrough? Design the product around the Hook Model – a workflow consisting of 4 specific actions that help generate habits, and in turn, hook users to the product fostering those habits. Throughout Hooked, Eyal explains in detail the four phases of the Hook Model – Trigger, Action, Variable Rewards, and Investment – and how they work with each other seamlessly enough to help users form subconscious, internal triggers that lend themselves into habitual action. He discusses how the best products quickly move from one phase to the other without losing the user’s attention, and have set the groundwork that will motivate the user to increase their investment in those products. From use cases to best practices and scoping questions for each phase of the Hook Model framework, readers get a full sense of what it takes to keep users coming back to your products. Funny, easy to read, and very practical, Hooked may just help you get over the hump and make the next Clash of Clan. "
177,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31676371-matthew,3,"A quick read. Despite the number of pages, there is a big space between lines, so it is not info-dense. I am interested in charisma, what makes someone charming beyond actual skill or meaningful attributes. This can be extended to products and activities that ""go viral"" or become sensations. What was it about Tickle Me Elmo or Trivial Pursuit that made people go nuts at Christmas so they HAD TO get that item. Beanie Babies from McDonald's inspired nationwide networks of people striving to collect them all. There's some chance and dumb luck involved, but there's also the elements that Nir Eyal addresses in Hooked. However, I was disappointed. I'd put this under the category of ""business semi-psych semi-science."" The author draws from a lot of psychology and behavioral economics, but does so in the (what I find irritating) simplification of research findings into ""truths"" that don't really represent what was discovered. It's a popular genre, and something I spend time in classes de-bunking, back from the first time I heard a co-worker expound that ""it takes 21 repetitions of a behavior to make it a habit."" He said it to clients and co-workers with such certainty and precision - not 20, not 19, don't have to go to 22, it's 21 repetitions and a habit is born. There was probably something he read that drew from something drawn from a study that actually addressed a particular type of simple stimulus-response type of behavior, but it got expanded into this Law of Human Behavior, and applied broadly. ""Hooked"" is that type of book. There is some good information, but it certainly is not a How-To for creating the next addictive app or viral video, and at least the author gives a caveat that you have to have a good idea to start with, it isn't cook book simple.

Ok, seriously, most of the book is based on well known principles - mostly BJ Fogg's.Although all these principles, (even including Gestalt) have been discussed widely before, it's nice to have it all themed on product design.We all know human needs are constant in time (what the author defines as pleasure/pain, acceptance/avoidance of rejection, seek hope/avoid fear), and almost all consumer products try to fulfil these basic desires. Nir gives it a nice spin how we could think about it in a feedback loop model.The book is mainly written around habit forming products (well, the title says it, easy), but that's what all consumer companies have been forever striving for, should they otherwise become irrelevant (remember Orkut well? Neither do I).The lesson, as Paul Graham says, ""make things people want"" and if I could append ""even if they don't know their needs yet, because digging deeper, they're always the same human desires since thousands of years"""

This book lays out in clear, easy-to-follow terms, how to design addictive products, and not in the metaphorical sense. There is a chapter that gives a nod to the ethical debate around these endeavors, but it's clear that brain hacking is the present and future of technology. The book centers around consumer apps, but we're now seeing these techniques used to devastating effect in the social and political arena too. But there's a bit of hope here, too. The book provides a clear, accessible explanation of the psychological and neural mechanisms of habit formation. Being aware of how digital persuasion operates give us a chance to recognize when it's being used on us. Maybe this awareness will allow us to stave off complete mind control for a while longer."

Organized into chapters that break down basic human habits and responses in a theoretical way, it offers concrete examples of organizations that are now among the most successful at building habit-forming products. Its Hook Model is an easy-to-understand method for applying complex concepts related to human behavior and responses to business applications. Although focused largely on the technology sector, the ideas the author presents are applicable to any company or individual looking to build something better.Mr. Eyal’s book itself is a habit-forming product. He leaves the reader with a memorable model that they can use in their own businesses and encourages them to return to his website for more insights. Not many theory books take applicability to the level Mr. Eyal’s does. I appreciated his sincere caution that the Hook Model be used for positive ends and acknowledgement that it can be used to foster addictions.This relatively short book is a great road map that points the reader in the right direction to build great products but may not go far enough for some. It will also be dated in a year or two when today’s “hot” companies become passé. Nevertheless, his theories on human behavior may well prove timeless.I give the book five stars and highly recommend it to anyone looking to design better content, goods, or services."

Taking all the apps that have made a huge impact and now praising them for how the do it in hindsight.Yes there were probably some thinking involved, but this is by no means going to work for every new app you create.Also the book doesn't give you any useful advise or tips or plan of action to now do something different from what you were doing. It simply states titbits of what the big guys did. And that you should try do similar.It basically comes down to causing an addiction. This might be great for you selling a product, but is it really adding benefit to anyone, or are you milking it, and making people mindless sheep.

Basically: the best way to build an addictive product is to solve a problem for the user whom you know best—yourself. Make the product so intuitive to use that it inspires investment. We overvalue our own work, so the more we invest, the higher the barrier to switching. Create variability in the level of reward—sometimes the user gets rewarded, other times he doesn’t. And he’s hooked. Hopefully the product is designed for good (and not for evil), since you now have a bunch of addicts on your hands."

Trigger (inner or outer) is forcing a human being to react somehow (like some Push-notifications, SMS, or any other stuff). An inner trigger is that sucking feels when you realize you need to check Instagram third time per one hour.Action is what the user is making when responding to the trigger (usually beneficial for app creators). For example, opening the app and seeing the content. Any use of the product. Then Reward is coming.The reward is any reason why this app is mattering to you. It's what is keeping you engaged.And then an investment. It's like, comment, and any action investment. Everything that the user is leaving in an app, engaging other users.

201,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5241231-karen-mardahl,1,"Update 20 September 2020. I regret giving this a 3-Star rating in 2015. I did read it with the idea of having happy and engaged users who enjoyed and appreciated my documentation. However, discussions of this book in the intervening years has made me reevaluate what this book is about. I think it is from the company point of view, when it should be the user’s point of view. And I think that getting users hooked or even addicted to products has taken on evil overtones in the past years, which I do not condone. No stars is not really a ranking. I prefer to make the statement that applies to 1-star rankings here, and that is: I do not like this book.(I read this for my UX book club group.)I was almost put off at the very beginning of this book when it seemed that Nir Eyal would not cover my company’s situation. We have a complex piece of enterprise software. We don’t have a cool wearable or an entertaining website or app with aggressive winged creatures who dislike pigs. We have a software application that sits on your desktop and which you “must use” if you are to achieve your work goals each day. “Must use” is when it is installed. If you do not use our software, you are using some other setup, but you must use something to help you with the complicated evaluations that you do to support the decisions that your own brain and know-how must make each day as a part of your job.Where do I get these customers hooked? Where do I insert triggers? How can I, a humble technical communicator, influence these people at all?At this point, if I had picked up the book on my own, I might have put it down for good and said it is not really for me. I like the challenge of the books we choose in the book club: I tackle books that I might otherwise not read and look for nuggets of wisdom that I can use in some way. That also makes it hard for me to assign a rating. Here, I go after the text of the ratings and not the number of stars. That is, here I am not giving 3 stars out of 5 stars. I am saying I liked it. Plain and simple. I liked it means I found some value or can see value in it.After the introduction sections of the book, Eyal pulls out comments from Erika Hall and Jack Dorsey that add more fuel to the argument: ya gotta get out and get into your customers’ brains. That is, go out and observe or interview. Don’t sit on your backsides in your ivory towers.I know some people who would say that this is obvious. Why then are so many people banging on the drum about getting real user feedback through various research methods? Because not everyone has embraced this idea. I think that is why some ideas are repeated across popular books. At some point, the message should get through!This not sitting on your backsides is also something the author embraces. You get homework at the end of every chapter. I confess I have not yet done this. I wanted to read the entire book first. I like a book that gives out homework. I give the author brownie points for this. Some books seem to be just a collection of words that we can all quote and that is that. Homework - the questions he asks at the end of the chapters - is intended to help us put into practice, or at least think about the lessons we have just learned. The questions look sensible and not all that easy and obvious. You really need to think about the task at hand.There is also a summary at the end of each chapter, which is a writing style I like. I underline and take notes in books like this. Still, I really value a summary. It is easier to skim that my underlinings - it's all in one place!I am not in a position to control the design and direction of my company's product. However, as a writer of some of its documentation, I do have the potential to influence how documentation is used. My plan is to review the questions with the documentation in mind. How can I get the product's users ""hooked"" on our documentation? How can I make our documentation a habit that the users just can't kick because they want more? :) I like to think that I can have an affect on the product itself through the documentation. Perhaps through habit-forming ways of using the documentation (and I use a broad definition of documentation - not just the traditional user manual), I can help to nudge the user to use the product in ways that greatly improve their daily workflow and add even greater value to their own work than ever before.We'll see. :)PS I plan to revisit ""How to Get People to Do Stuff: Master the Art and Science of Persuasion and Motivation"" by Susan M. Weinschenk for all the ethical stuff. Just how ethical is it to manipulate others to do things? (Manipulation is what you are doing!)"

I found it pretty hateful to be honest. Badly written and badly researched, like a lot of self-help, filled with wild ‘turns out’ type assertions that aren’t actually backed up by the research that it cites. Add to this a central message that will appeal to every capitalist shit bag who wants to hijack people’s attention to make a quick buck. Tech-bros will love it. I read it as a precursor to reading the author’s follow-up book which is about reclaiming your attention. So I was pretty disappointed. It isn’t necessarily the author’s fault, of course, because all they’ve done is gather the research about products and strategies that already exist. But I hate the basic assumption that making your products more addictive is a good thing."
204,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9039058-darren,5,"So you want to or need to develop a product people just can’t put down.Short of developing a fiendish contraption that squirts sticky glue in their hands, you will need a good product idea, great implementation and maybe a book like this to dispense a bit of guidance.Here the author sets out to show you how to develop and create habit forming, sticky, engaging products through the so-called “Hook Model” - a four-step process that subtly encourages and shapes customer behaviour. This is a short book that cuts to the chase. Eight chapters which define the “Habit Zone”, the trigger, action, reward and investment phases along with a look at how you may implement things and a case study and watching brief. Clearly this reviewer cannot test and implement the strategies (there are reviews to write) but the author certainly appears to have hit the nail on its head. In many things we are hooked or, as psychologists call it “automatic behaviours triggered by situational cues” (stuff we do without realising it).The author notes that customers can be hooked without expensive marketing or advertising. You just need to engage, get traction and get people talking, sharing and using the product. It need not be viewed as unethical or somehow bad (after all, it is not selling heroin). Your world won’t end in a mass of pain and struggle if you really do put down your smartphone, stop taking a certain brand of coffee or change your habits or allegiances from product X to Y. Not all habits are intrinsically bad. It is a case of perspective. This is not a shortcut, instant just-add-water tool that will give you success and allow you to take over your market. You still have a lot of work to do but you will be better informed and able to take more conscious, focussed decisions. The book is written in an open, clear, humble style that does get you, err, hooked in reading it. In many ways it could still be great reading for the generalist who just loves to know stuff: allowing them to possible fight back against the corporate machine that is trying to get them to buy the latest shiny-shiny. A real clash of titans?Looking at the psychology behind the Hook Model was also interesting even though it feels, once explained, to be fairly common sense. Once you start looking at other products and services with the Hook Model in mind you can see what they are doing. Yes, I’ve been hooked by some of the services named within the book. I started with the free version of Evernote and found its use compelling and valuable and paid for an extended service. Was I hooked by a free service? Yes, of course? It was not the only draw but a combination of a good product, a useful service and an extended period of use that underlined its essentialness and bang, handing over some money was natural. Does that make me a customer for life? Absolutely not, although as a happy customer I am less likely to be looking for alternative solutions and even if I stumble across one/am shown something that could be better, it might be harder to change.The book features figures concerning Evernote and its customers who switched from a free to a paid service. In the first month only 0.5% had signed up. It might have felt a slow burn yet it acted like a rolling stone gathering moss. Within 33 months 11% of users had started paying, nine months further on this was at 26% and the figures continue to grow.Hooked again?Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products, written by Nir Eyal and published by Portfolio/Penguin Group USA.

Your level of app use is so high it takes up at least a quarter of your day and you’d be damn if you’re not using it in the bathroom either. You’re so engrained in use that it doesn’t take a notification or some external trigger to get you to use it: you think of something to research, immediately use Google. What the hell is Samantha up to? Check her Snapchat or Twitter. You do it almost innately. It becomes a facet of your subconscious. In other words, you’re hooked.Why are some products so addicting, like Subway Surfers and Tinder? What keeps us coming back? Why do we keep investing time and energy in these addicting products, and as the title of this book suggests, how can we continue to make more of them? Hooked - Stanford Professor Nir Eyal’s exposition into the world of habit forming products - help us tackle these questions, first with a simple premise: habits are behaviors with little or no conscious and businesses that can turn the use of their apps into something habitual improve their competitive advantage. Yet, this is easier said than done and not every product becomes a Play Store chart topper, so how can an entrepreneur or hustler get closer to their next addicting breakthrough? Design the product around the Hook Model – a workflow consisting of 4 specific actions that help generate habits, and in turn, hook users to the product fostering those habits. Throughout Hooked, Eyal explains in detail the four phases of the Hook Model – Trigger, Action, Variable Rewards, and Investment – and how they work with each other seamlessly enough to help users form subconscious, internal triggers that lend themselves into habitual action. He discusses how the best products quickly move from one phase to the other without losing the user’s attention, and have set the groundwork that will motivate the user to increase their investment in those products. From use cases to best practices and scoping questions for each phase of the Hook Model framework, readers get a full sense of what it takes to keep users coming back to your products. Funny, easy to read, and very practical, Hooked may just help you get over the hump and make the next Clash of Clan. "
207,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31676371-matthew,3,"A quick read. Despite the number of pages, there is a big space between lines, so it is not info-dense. I am interested in charisma, what makes someone charming beyond actual skill or meaningful attributes. This can be extended to products and activities that ""go viral"" or become sensations. What was it about Tickle Me Elmo or Trivial Pursuit that made people go nuts at Christmas so they HAD TO get that item. Beanie Babies from McDonald's inspired nationwide networks of people striving to collect them all. There's some chance and dumb luck involved, but there's also the elements that Nir Eyal addresses in Hooked. However, I was disappointed. I'd put this under the category of ""business semi-psych semi-science."" The author draws from a lot of psychology and behavioral economics, but does so in the (what I find irritating) simplification of research findings into ""truths"" that don't really represent what was discovered. It's a popular genre, and something I spend time in classes de-bunking, back from the first time I heard a co-worker expound that ""it takes 21 repetitions of a behavior to make it a habit."" He said it to clients and co-workers with such certainty and precision - not 20, not 19, don't have to go to 22, it's 21 repetitions and a habit is born. There was probably something he read that drew from something drawn from a study that actually addressed a particular type of simple stimulus-response type of behavior, but it got expanded into this Law of Human Behavior, and applied broadly. ""Hooked"" is that type of book. There is some good information, but it certainly is not a How-To for creating the next addictive app or viral video, and at least the author gives a caveat that you have to have a good idea to start with, it isn't cook book simple.

Ok, seriously, most of the book is based on well known principles - mostly BJ Fogg's.Although all these principles, (even including Gestalt) have been discussed widely before, it's nice to have it all themed on product design.We all know human needs are constant in time (what the author defines as pleasure/pain, acceptance/avoidance of rejection, seek hope/avoid fear), and almost all consumer products try to fulfil these basic desires. Nir gives it a nice spin how we could think about it in a feedback loop model.The book is mainly written around habit forming products (well, the title says it, easy), but that's what all consumer companies have been forever striving for, should they otherwise become irrelevant (remember Orkut well? Neither do I).The lesson, as Paul Graham says, ""make things people want"" and if I could append ""even if they don't know their needs yet, because digging deeper, they're always the same human desires since thousands of years"""

This book lays out in clear, easy-to-follow terms, how to design addictive products, and not in the metaphorical sense. There is a chapter that gives a nod to the ethical debate around these endeavors, but it's clear that brain hacking is the present and future of technology. The book centers around consumer apps, but we're now seeing these techniques used to devastating effect in the social and political arena too. But there's a bit of hope here, too. The book provides a clear, accessible explanation of the psychological and neural mechanisms of habit formation. Being aware of how digital persuasion operates give us a chance to recognize when it's being used on us. Maybe this awareness will allow us to stave off complete mind control for a while longer."

Organized into chapters that break down basic human habits and responses in a theoretical way, it offers concrete examples of organizations that are now among the most successful at building habit-forming products. Its Hook Model is an easy-to-understand method for applying complex concepts related to human behavior and responses to business applications. Although focused largely on the technology sector, the ideas the author presents are applicable to any company or individual looking to build something better.Mr. Eyal’s book itself is a habit-forming product. He leaves the reader with a memorable model that they can use in their own businesses and encourages them to return to his website for more insights. Not many theory books take applicability to the level Mr. Eyal’s does. I appreciated his sincere caution that the Hook Model be used for positive ends and acknowledgement that it can be used to foster addictions.This relatively short book is a great road map that points the reader in the right direction to build great products but may not go far enough for some. It will also be dated in a year or two when today’s “hot” companies become passé. Nevertheless, his theories on human behavior may well prove timeless.I give the book five stars and highly recommend it to anyone looking to design better content, goods, or services."

Taking all the apps that have made a huge impact and now praising them for how the do it in hindsight.Yes there were probably some thinking involved, but this is by no means going to work for every new app you create.Also the book doesn't give you any useful advise or tips or plan of action to now do something different from what you were doing. It simply states titbits of what the big guys did. And that you should try do similar.It basically comes down to causing an addiction. This might be great for you selling a product, but is it really adding benefit to anyone, or are you milking it, and making people mindless sheep.

There was a couple half-hearted, minor mentions a long the lines of ""but ya know, use your powers for good. Make sure your product is actually helpful before you get people addicted to it"".

Basically: the best way to build an addictive product is to solve a problem for the user whom you know best—yourself. Make the product so intuitive to use that it inspires investment. We overvalue our own work, so the more we invest, the higher the barrier to switching. Create variability in the level of reward—sometimes the user gets rewarded, other times he doesn’t. And he’s hooked. Hopefully the product is designed for good (and not for evil), since you now have a bunch of addicts on your hands."

If you've got a brilliant idea test it on yourself before taking it out on others.

231,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5241231-karen-mardahl,1,"Update 20 September 2020. I regret giving this a 3-Star rating in 2015. I did read it with the idea of having happy and engaged users who enjoyed and appreciated my documentation. However, discussions of this book in the intervening years has made me reevaluate what this book is about. I think it is from the company point of view, when it should be the user’s point of view. And I think that getting users hooked or even addicted to products has taken on evil overtones in the past years, which I do not condone. No stars is not really a ranking. I prefer to make the statement that applies to 1-star rankings here, and that is: I do not like this book.(I read this for my UX book club group.)I was almost put off at the very beginning of this book when it seemed that Nir Eyal would not cover my company’s situation. We have a complex piece of enterprise software. We don’t have a cool wearable or an entertaining website or app with aggressive winged creatures who dislike pigs. We have a software application that sits on your desktop and which you “must use” if you are to achieve your work goals each day. “Must use” is when it is installed. If you do not use our software, you are using some other setup, but you must use something to help you with the complicated evaluations that you do to support the decisions that your own brain and know-how must make each day as a part of your job.Where do I get these customers hooked? Where do I insert triggers? How can I, a humble technical communicator, influence these people at all?At this point, if I had picked up the book on my own, I might have put it down for good and said it is not really for me. I like the challenge of the books we choose in the book club: I tackle books that I might otherwise not read and look for nuggets of wisdom that I can use in some way. That also makes it hard for me to assign a rating. Here, I go after the text of the ratings and not the number of stars. That is, here I am not giving 3 stars out of 5 stars. I am saying I liked it. Plain and simple. I liked it means I found some value or can see value in it.After the introduction sections of the book, Eyal pulls out comments from Erika Hall and Jack Dorsey that add more fuel to the argument: ya gotta get out and get into your customers’ brains. That is, go out and observe or interview. Don’t sit on your backsides in your ivory towers.I know some people who would say that this is obvious. Why then are so many people banging on the drum about getting real user feedback through various research methods? Because not everyone has embraced this idea. I think that is why some ideas are repeated across popular books. At some point, the message should get through!This not sitting on your backsides is also something the author embraces. You get homework at the end of every chapter. I confess I have not yet done this. I wanted to read the entire book first. I like a book that gives out homework. I give the author brownie points for this. Some books seem to be just a collection of words that we can all quote and that is that. Homework - the questions he asks at the end of the chapters - is intended to help us put into practice, or at least think about the lessons we have just learned. The questions look sensible and not all that easy and obvious. You really need to think about the task at hand.There is also a summary at the end of each chapter, which is a writing style I like. I underline and take notes in books like this. Still, I really value a summary. It is easier to skim that my underlinings - it's all in one place!I am not in a position to control the design and direction of my company's product. However, as a writer of some of its documentation, I do have the potential to influence how documentation is used. My plan is to review the questions with the documentation in mind. How can I get the product's users ""hooked"" on our documentation? How can I make our documentation a habit that the users just can't kick because they want more? :) I like to think that I can have an affect on the product itself through the documentation. Perhaps through habit-forming ways of using the documentation (and I use a broad definition of documentation - not just the traditional user manual), I can help to nudge the user to use the product in ways that greatly improve their daily workflow and add even greater value to their own work than ever before.We'll see. :)PS I plan to revisit ""How to Get People to Do Stuff: Master the Art and Science of Persuasion and Motivation"" by Susan M. Weinschenk for all the ethical stuff. Just how ethical is it to manipulate others to do things? (Manipulation is what you are doing!)"

233,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3963686-james,1,"I should probably write a review to explain my contempt for this book but I lack the time, energy and inclination to do so. I found it pretty hateful to be honest. Badly written and badly researched, like a lot of self-help, filled with wild ‘turns out’ type assertions that aren’t actually backed up by the research that it cites. Add to this a central message that will appeal to every capitalist shit bag who wants to hijack people’s attention to make a quick buck. Tech-bros will love it. I read it as a precursor to reading the author’s follow-up book which is about reclaiming your attention. So I was pretty disappointed. It isn’t necessarily the author’s fault, of course, because all they’ve done is gather the research about products and strategies that already exist. But I hate the basic assumption that making your products more addictive is a good thing."
234,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9039058-darren,5,"So you want to or need to develop a product people just can’t put down.Short of developing a fiendish contraption that squirts sticky glue in their hands, you will need a good product idea, great implementation and maybe a book like this to dispense a bit of guidance.Here the author sets out to show you how to develop and create habit forming, sticky, engaging products through the so-called “Hook Model” - a four-step process that subtly encourages and shapes customer behaviour. This is a short book that cuts to the chase. Eight chapters which define the “Habit Zone”, the trigger, action, reward and investment phases along with a look at how you may implement things and a case study and watching brief. Clearly this reviewer cannot test and implement the strategies (there are reviews to write) but the author certainly appears to have hit the nail on its head. In many things we are hooked or, as psychologists call it “automatic behaviours triggered by situational cues” (stuff we do without realising it).The author notes that customers can be hooked without expensive marketing or advertising. You just need to engage, get traction and get people talking, sharing and using the product. It need not be viewed as unethical or somehow bad (after all, it is not selling heroin). Your world won’t end in a mass of pain and struggle if you really do put down your smartphone, stop taking a certain brand of coffee or change your habits or allegiances from product X to Y. Not all habits are intrinsically bad. It is a case of perspective. This is not a shortcut, instant just-add-water tool that will give you success and allow you to take over your market. You still have a lot of work to do but you will be better informed and able to take more conscious, focussed decisions. The book is written in an open, clear, humble style that does get you, err, hooked in reading it. In many ways it could still be great reading for the generalist who just loves to know stuff: allowing them to possible fight back against the corporate machine that is trying to get them to buy the latest shiny-shiny. A real clash of titans?Looking at the psychology behind the Hook Model was also interesting even though it feels, once explained, to be fairly common sense. Once you start looking at other products and services with the Hook Model in mind you can see what they are doing. Yes, I’ve been hooked by some of the services named within the book. I started with the free version of Evernote and found its use compelling and valuable and paid for an extended service. Was I hooked by a free service? Yes, of course? It was not the only draw but a combination of a good product, a useful service and an extended period of use that underlined its essentialness and bang, handing over some money was natural. Does that make me a customer for life? Absolutely not, although as a happy customer I am less likely to be looking for alternative solutions and even if I stumble across one/am shown something that could be better, it might be harder to change.The book features figures concerning Evernote and its customers who switched from a free to a paid service. In the first month only 0.5% had signed up. It might have felt a slow burn yet it acted like a rolling stone gathering moss. Within 33 months 11% of users had started paying, nine months further on this was at 26% and the figures continue to grow.Hooked again?Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products, written by Nir Eyal and published by Portfolio/Penguin Group USA.

Your level of app use is so high it takes up at least a quarter of your day and you’d be damn if you’re not using it in the bathroom either. You’re so engrained in use that it doesn’t take a notification or some external trigger to get you to use it: you think of something to research, immediately use Google. What the hell is Samantha up to? Check her Snapchat or Twitter. You do it almost innately. It becomes a facet of your subconscious. In other words, you’re hooked.Why are some products so addicting, like Subway Surfers and Tinder? What keeps us coming back? Why do we keep investing time and energy in these addicting products, and as the title of this book suggests, how can we continue to make more of them? Hooked - Stanford Professor Nir Eyal’s exposition into the world of habit forming products - help us tackle these questions, first with a simple premise: habits are behaviors with little or no conscious and businesses that can turn the use of their apps into something habitual improve their competitive advantage. Yet, this is easier said than done and not every product becomes a Play Store chart topper, so how can an entrepreneur or hustler get closer to their next addicting breakthrough? Design the product around the Hook Model – a workflow consisting of 4 specific actions that help generate habits, and in turn, hook users to the product fostering those habits. Throughout Hooked, Eyal explains in detail the four phases of the Hook Model – Trigger, Action, Variable Rewards, and Investment – and how they work with each other seamlessly enough to help users form subconscious, internal triggers that lend themselves into habitual action. He discusses how the best products quickly move from one phase to the other without losing the user’s attention, and have set the groundwork that will motivate the user to increase their investment in those products. From use cases to best practices and scoping questions for each phase of the Hook Model framework, readers get a full sense of what it takes to keep users coming back to your products. Funny, easy to read, and very practical, Hooked may just help you get over the hump and make the next Clash of Clan. "
237,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31676371-matthew,3,"A quick read. Despite the number of pages, there is a big space between lines, so it is not info-dense. I am interested in charisma, what makes someone charming beyond actual skill or meaningful attributes. This can be extended to products and activities that ""go viral"" or become sensations. What was it about Tickle Me Elmo or Trivial Pursuit that made people go nuts at Christmas so they HAD TO get that item. Beanie Babies from McDonald's inspired nationwide networks of people striving to collect them all. There's some chance and dumb luck involved, but there's also the elements that Nir Eyal addresses in Hooked. However, I was disappointed. I'd put this under the category of ""business semi-psych semi-science."" The author draws from a lot of psychology and behavioral economics, but does so in the (what I find irritating) simplification of research findings into ""truths"" that don't really represent what was discovered. It's a popular genre, and something I spend time in classes de-bunking, back from the first time I heard a co-worker expound that ""it takes 21 repetitions of a behavior to make it a habit."" He said it to clients and co-workers with such certainty and precision - not 20, not 19, don't have to go to 22, it's 21 repetitions and a habit is born. There was probably something he read that drew from something drawn from a study that actually addressed a particular type of simple stimulus-response type of behavior, but it got expanded into this Law of Human Behavior, and applied broadly. ""Hooked"" is that type of book. There is some good information, but it certainly is not a How-To for creating the next addictive app or viral video, and at least the author gives a caveat that you have to have a good idea to start with, it isn't cook book simple. "
238,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10222365-ujjawal-chauhan,4,"I learnt some black magic with this book! Ok, seriously, most of the book is based on well known principles - mostly BJ Fogg's.Although all these principles, (even including Gestalt) have been discussed widely before, it's nice to have it all themed on product design.We all know human needs are constant in time (what the author defines as pleasure/pain, acceptance/avoidance of rejection, seek hope/avoid fear), and almost all consumer products try to fulfil these basic desires. Nir gives it a nice spin how we could think about it in a feedback loop model.The book is mainly written around habit forming products (well, the title says it, easy), but that's what all consumer companies have been forever striving for, should they otherwise become irrelevant (remember Orkut well? Neither do I).The lesson, as Paul Graham says, ""make things people want"" and if I could append ""even if they don't know their needs yet, because digging deeper, they're always the same human desires since thousands of years"""

This book lays out in clear, easy-to-follow terms, how to design addictive products, and not in the metaphorical sense. There is a chapter that gives a nod to the ethical debate around these endeavors, but it's clear that brain hacking is the present and future of technology. The book centers around consumer apps, but we're now seeing these techniques used to devastating effect in the social and political arena too. But there's a bit of hope here, too. The book provides a clear, accessible explanation of the psychological and neural mechanisms of habit formation. Being aware of how digital persuasion operates give us a chance to recognize when it's being used on us. Maybe this awareness will allow us to stave off complete mind control for a while longer."
240,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5625318-m-g-edwards,5,"Author Nir Eyal synthesized and dispensed some of the best work from his website into this great book on consumer behavior and building products that encourage their usage. Organized into chapters that break down basic human habits and responses in a theoretical way, it offers concrete examples of organizations that are now among the most successful at building habit-forming products. Its Hook Model is an easy-to-understand method for applying complex concepts related to human behavior and responses to business applications. Although focused largely on the technology sector, the ideas the author presents are applicable to any company or individual looking to build something better.Mr. Eyal’s book itself is a habit-forming product. He leaves the reader with a memorable model that they can use in their own businesses and encourages them to return to his website for more insights. Not many theory books take applicability to the level Mr. Eyal’s does. I appreciated his sincere caution that the Hook Model be used for positive ends and acknowledgement that it can be used to foster addictions.This relatively short book is a great road map that points the reader in the right direction to build great products but may not go far enough for some. It will also be dated in a year or two when today’s “hot” companies become passé. Nevertheless, his theories on human behavior may well prove timeless.I give the book five stars and highly recommend it to anyone looking to design better content, goods, or services."

Taking all the apps that have made a huge impact and now praising them for how the do it in hindsight.Yes there were probably some thinking involved, but this is by no means going to work for every new app you create.Also the book doesn't give you any useful advise or tips or plan of action to now do something different from what you were doing. It simply states titbits of what the big guys did. And that you should try do similar.It basically comes down to causing an addiction. This might be great for you selling a product, but is it really adding benefit to anyone, or are you milking it, and making people mindless sheep.

There was a couple half-hearted, minor mentions a long the lines of ""but ya know, use your powers for good. Make sure your product is actually helpful before you get people addicted to it"".

Basically: the best way to build an addictive product is to solve a problem for the user whom you know best—yourself. Make the product so intuitive to use that it inspires investment. We overvalue our own work, so the more we invest, the higher the barrier to switching. Create variability in the level of reward—sometimes the user gets rewarded, other times he doesn’t. And he’s hooked. Hopefully the product is designed for good (and not for evil), since you now have a bunch of addicts on your hands."

I have to say the author has researched the best brands and practices to get the exact method down of the hook process and cycles. If you've got a brilliant idea test it on yourself before taking it out on others.

The main idea is a ""hook"" concept.There are four parts to this system. There are Trigger, Action, Reward, Investment. Trigger (inner or outer) is forcing a human being to react somehow (like some Push-notifications, SMS, or any other stuff). An inner trigger is that sucking feels when you realize you need to check Instagram third time per one hour.Action is what the user is making when responding to the trigger (usually beneficial for app creators). For example, opening the app and seeing the content. Any use of the product. Then Reward is coming.The reward is any reason why this app is mattering to you. It's what is keeping you engaged.And then an investment. It's like, comment, and any action investment. Everything that the user is leaving in an app, engaging other users. And what makes you feel that the app has enough valuable information no to leave it.I appreciated this book way harder than any other alternative theories.

Why then are so many people banging on the drum about getting real user feedback through various research methods? Because not everyone has embraced this idea. I think that is why some ideas are repeated across popular books. At some point, the message should get through!This not sitting on your backsides is also something the author embraces. You get homework at the end of every chapter. I confess I have not yet done this. I wanted to read the entire book first. I like a book that gives out homework. I give the author brownie points for this. Some books seem to be just a collection of words that we can all quote and that is that. Homework - the questions he asks at the end of the chapters - is intended to help us put into practice, or at least think about the lessons we have just learned. The questions look sensible and not all that easy and obvious. You really need to think about the task at hand.There is also a summary at the end of each chapter, which is a writing style I like. I underline and take notes in books like this. Still, I really value a summary. It is easier to skim that my underlinings - it's all in one place!I am not in a position to control the design and direction of my company's product. However, as a writer of some of its documentation, I do have the potential to influence how documentation is used. My plan is to review the questions with the documentation in mind. How can I get the product's users ""hooked"" on our documentation? How can I make our documentation a habit that the users just can't kick because they want more? :) I like to think that I can have an affect on the product itself through the documentation. Perhaps through habit-forming ways of using the documentation (and I use a broad definition of documentation - not just the traditional user manual), I can help to nudge the user to use the product in ways that greatly improve their daily workflow and add even greater value to their own work than ever before.We'll see. :)PS I plan to revisit ""How to Get People to Do Stuff: Master the Art and Science of Persuasion and Motivation"" by Susan M. Weinschenk for all the ethical stuff. Just how ethical is it to manipulate others to do things? (Manipulation is what you are doing!)"

This is a short book that cuts to the chase. Eight chapters which define the “Habit Zone”, the trigger, action, reward and investment phases along with a look at how you may implement things and a case study and watching brief. Clearly this reviewer cannot test and implement the strategies (there are reviews to write) but the author certainly appears to have hit the nail on its head. In many things we are hooked or, as psychologists call it “automatic behaviours triggered by situational cues” (stuff we do without realising it).The author notes that customers can be hooked without expensive marketing or advertising. You just need to engage, get traction and get people talking, sharing and using the product. It need not be viewed as unethical or somehow bad (after all, it is not selling heroin). Your world won’t end in a mass of pain and struggle if you really do put down your smartphone, stop taking a certain brand of coffee or change your habits or allegiances from product X to Y. Not all habits are intrinsically bad. It is a case of perspective. This is not a shortcut, instant just-add-water tool that will give you success and allow you to take over your market. You still have a lot of work to do but you will be better informed and able to take more conscious, focussed decisions. The book is written in an open, clear, humble style that does get you, err, hooked in reading it. In many ways it could still be great reading for the generalist who just loves to know stuff: allowing them to possible fight back against the corporate machine that is trying to get them to buy the latest shiny-shiny. A real clash of titans?Looking at the psychology behind the Hook Model was also interesting even though it feels, once explained, to be fairly common sense. Once you start looking at other products and services with the Hook Model in mind you can see what they are doing. Yes, I’ve been hooked by some of the services named within the book. I started with the free version of Evernote and found its use compelling and valuable and paid for an extended service. Was I hooked by a free service? Yes, of course? It was not the only draw but a combination of a good product, a useful service and an extended period of use that underlined its essentialness and bang, handing over some money was natural. Does that make me a customer for life? Absolutely not, although as a happy customer I am less likely to be looking for alternative solutions and even if I stumble across one/am shown something that could be better, it might be harder to change.The book features figures concerning Evernote and its customers who switched from a free to a paid service. In the first month only 0.5% had signed up. It might have felt a slow burn yet it acted like a rolling stone gathering moss. Within 33 months 11% of users had started paying, nine months further on this was at 26% and the figures continue to grow.Hooked again?Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products, written by Nir Eyal and published by Portfolio/Penguin Group USA.

Your level of app use is so high it takes up at least a quarter of your day and you’d be damn if you’re not using it in the bathroom either. You’re so engrained in use that it doesn’t take a notification or some external trigger to get you to use it: you think of something to research, immediately use Google. What the hell is Samantha up to? Check her Snapchat or Twitter. You do it almost innately. It becomes a facet of your subconscious. In other words, you’re hooked.Why are some products so addicting, like Subway Surfers and Tinder? What keeps us coming back? Why do we keep investing time and energy in these addicting products, and as the title of this book suggests, how can we continue to make more of them? Hooked - Stanford Professor Nir Eyal’s exposition into the world of habit forming products - help us tackle these questions, first with a simple premise: habits are behaviors with little or no conscious and businesses that can turn the use of their apps into something habitual improve their competitive advantage. Yet, this is easier said than done and not every product becomes a Play Store chart topper, so how can an entrepreneur or hustler get closer to their next addicting breakthrough? Design the product around the Hook Model – a workflow consisting of 4 specific actions that help generate habits, and in turn, hook users to the product fostering those habits. Throughout Hooked, Eyal explains in detail the four phases of the Hook Model – Trigger, Action, Variable Rewards, and Investment – and how they work with each other seamlessly enough to help users form subconscious, internal triggers that lend themselves into habitual action. He discusses how the best products quickly move from one phase to the other without losing the user’s attention, and have set the groundwork that will motivate the user to increase their investment in those products. From use cases to best practices and scoping questions for each phase of the Hook Model framework, readers get a full sense of what it takes to keep users coming back to your products. Funny, easy to read, and very practical, Hooked may just help you get over the hump and make the next Clash of Clan. "
267,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31676371-matthew,3,"A quick read. Despite the number of pages, there is a big space between lines, so it is not info-dense. I am interested in charisma, what makes someone charming beyond actual skill or meaningful attributes. This can be extended to products and activities that ""go viral"" or become sensations. What was it about Tickle Me Elmo or Trivial Pursuit that made people go nuts at Christmas so they HAD TO get that item. Beanie Babies from McDonald's inspired nationwide networks of people striving to collect them all. There's some chance and dumb luck involved, but there's also the elements that Nir Eyal addresses in Hooked. However, I was disappointed. I'd put this under the category of ""business semi-psych semi-science."" The author draws from a lot of psychology and behavioral economics, but does so in the (what I find irritating) simplification of research findings into ""truths"" that don't really represent what was discovered. It's a popular genre, and something I spend time in classes de-bunking, back from the first time I heard a co-worker expound that ""it takes 21 repetitions of a behavior to make it a habit."" He said it to clients and co-workers with such certainty and precision - not 20, not 19, don't have to go to 22, it's 21 repetitions and a habit is born. There was probably something he read that drew from something drawn from a study that actually addressed a particular type of simple stimulus-response type of behavior, but it got expanded into this Law of Human Behavior, and applied broadly. ""Hooked"" is that type of book. There is some good information, but it certainly is not a How-To for creating the next addictive app or viral video, and at least the author gives a caveat that you have to have a good idea to start with, it isn't cook book simple.

Ok, seriously, most of the book is based on well known principles - mostly BJ Fogg's.Although all these principles, (even including Gestalt) have been discussed widely before, it's nice to have it all themed on product design.We all know human needs are constant in time (what the author defines as pleasure/pain, acceptance/avoidance of rejection, seek hope/avoid fear), and almost all consumer products try to fulfil these basic desires. Nir gives it a nice spin how we could think about it in a feedback loop model.The book is mainly written around habit forming products (well, the title says it, easy), but that's what all consumer companies have been forever striving for, should they otherwise become irrelevant (remember Orkut well? Neither do I).The lesson, as Paul Graham says, ""make things people want"" and if I could append ""even if they don't know their needs yet, because digging deeper, they're always the same human desires since thousands of years"""

This book lays out in clear, easy-to-follow terms, how to design addictive products, and not in the metaphorical sense. There is a chapter that gives a nod to the ethical debate around these endeavors, but it's clear that brain hacking is the present and future of technology. The book centers around consumer apps, but we're now seeing these techniques used to devastating effect in the social and political arena too. But there's a bit of hope here, too. The book provides a clear, accessible explanation of the psychological and neural mechanisms of habit formation. Being aware of how digital persuasion operates give us a chance to recognize when it's being used on us. Maybe this awareness will allow us to stave off complete mind control for a while longer."
270,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5625318-m-g-edwards,5,"Author Nir Eyal synthesized and dispensed some of the best work from his website into this great book on consumer behavior and building products that encourage their usage. Organized into chapters that break down basic human habits and responses in a theoretical way, it offers concrete examples of organizations that are now among the most successful at building habit-forming products. Its Hook Model is an easy-to-understand method for applying complex concepts related to human behavior and responses to business applications. Although focused largely on the technology sector, the ideas the author presents are applicable to any company or individual looking to build something better.Mr. Eyal’s book itself is a habit-forming product. He leaves the reader with a memorable model that they can use in their own businesses and encourages them to return to his website for more insights. Not many theory books take applicability to the level Mr. Eyal’s does. I appreciated his sincere caution that the Hook Model be used for positive ends and acknowledgement that it can be used to foster addictions.This relatively short book is a great road map that points the reader in the right direction to build great products but may not go far enough for some. It will also be dated in a year or two when today’s “hot” companies become passé. Nevertheless, his theories on human behavior may well prove timeless.I give the book five stars and highly recommend it to anyone looking to design better content, goods, or services."

Taking all the apps that have made a huge impact and now praising them for how the do it in hindsight.Yes there were probably some thinking involved, but this is by no means going to work for every new app you create.Also the book doesn't give you any useful advise or tips or plan of action to now do something different from what you were doing. It simply states titbits of what the big guys did. And that you should try do similar.It basically comes down to causing an addiction. This might be great for you selling a product, but is it really adding benefit to anyone, or are you milking it, and making people mindless sheep. Even some of the data used to analyze trends borders on invasion of privacy.Short enough to give it a try if you into this sort of thing, but don't expect something world changing."

There was a couple half-hearted, minor mentions a long the lines of ""but ya know, use your powers for good. Make sure your product is actually helpful before you get people addicted to it"".

Basically: the best way to build an addictive product is to solve a problem for the user whom you know best—yourself. Make the product so intuitive to use that it inspires investment. We overvalue our own work, so the more we invest, the higher the barrier to switching. Create variability in the level of reward—sometimes the user gets rewarded, other times he doesn’t. And he’s hooked. Hopefully the product is designed for good (and not for evil), since you now have a bunch of addicts on your hands."

I have to say the author has researched the best brands and practices to get the exact method down of the hook process and cycles. If you've got a brilliant idea test it on yourself before taking it out on others.

The main idea is a ""hook"" concept.There are four parts to this system. There are Trigger, Action, Reward, Investment. Trigger (inner or outer) is forcing a human being to react somehow (like some Push-notifications, SMS, or any other stuff). An inner trigger is that sucking feels when you realize you need to check Instagram third time per one hour.Action is what the user is making when responding to the trigger (usually beneficial for app creators). For example, opening the app and seeing the content. Any use of the product. Then Reward is coming.The reward is any reason why this app is mattering to you. It's what is keeping you engaged.And then an investment. It's like, comment, and any action investment. Everything that the user is leaving in an app, engaging other users. And what makes you feel that the app has enough valuable information no to leave it.I appreciated this book way harder than any other alternative theories.

I did read it with the idea of having happy and engaged users who enjoyed and appreciated my documentation. However, discussions of this book in the intervening years has made me reevaluate what this book is about. I think it is from the company point of view, when it should be the user’s point of view. And I think that getting users hooked or even addicted to products has taken on evil overtones in the past years, which I do not condone. No stars is not really a ranking. I prefer to make the statement that applies to 1-star rankings here, and that is: I do not like this book.(I read this for my UX book club group.)I was almost put off at the very beginning of this book when it seemed that Nir Eyal would not cover my company’s situation. We have a complex piece of enterprise software. We don’t have a cool wearable or an entertaining website or app with aggressive winged creatures who dislike pigs. We have a software application that sits on your desktop and which you “must use” if you are to achieve your work goals each day. “Must use” is when it is installed. If you do not use our software, you are using some other setup, but you must use something to help you with the complicated evaluations that you do to support the decisions that your own brain and know-how must make each day as a part of your job.Where do I get these customers hooked? Where do I insert triggers? How can I, a humble technical communicator, influence these people at all?At this point, if I had picked up the book on my own, I might have put it down for good and said it is not really for me. I like the challenge of the books we choose in the book club: I tackle books that I might otherwise not read and look for nuggets of wisdom that I can use in some way. That also makes it hard for me to assign a rating. Here, I go after the text of the ratings and not the number of stars. That is, here I am not giving 3 stars out of 5 stars. I am saying I liked it. Plain and simple. I liked it means I found some value or can see value in it.After the introduction sections of the book, Eyal pulls out comments from Erika Hall and Jack Dorsey that add more fuel to the argument: ya gotta get out and get into your customers’ brains.

I read it as a precursor to reading the author’s follow-up book which is about reclaiming your attention. So I was pretty disappointed. It isn’t necessarily the author’s fault, of course, because all they’ve done is gather the research about products and strategies that already exist. But I hate the basic assumption that making your products more addictive is a good thing."

This is a short book that cuts to the chase. Eight chapters which define the “Habit Zone”, the trigger, action, reward and investment phases along with a look at how you may implement things and a case study and watching brief. Clearly this reviewer cannot test and implement the strategies (there are reviews to write) but the author certainly appears to have hit the nail on its head. In many things we are hooked or, as psychologists call it “automatic behaviours triggered by situational cues” (stuff we do without realising it).The author notes that customers can be hooked without expensive marketing or advertising. You just need to engage, get traction and get people talking, sharing and using the product. It need not be viewed as unethical or somehow bad (after all, it is not selling heroin). Your world won’t end in a mass of pain and struggle if you really do put down your smartphone, stop taking a certain brand of coffee or change your habits or allegiances from product X to Y. Not all habits are intrinsically bad. It is a case of perspective. This is not a shortcut, instant just-add-water tool that will give you success and allow you to take over your market. You still have a lot of work to do but you will be better informed and able to take more conscious, focussed decisions. The book is written in an open, clear, humble style that does get you, err, hooked in reading it. In many ways it could still be great reading for the generalist who just loves to know stuff: allowing them to possible fight back against the corporate machine that is trying to get them to buy the latest shiny-shiny. A real clash of titans?Looking at the psychology behind the Hook Model was also interesting even though it feels, once explained, to be fairly common sense. Once you start looking at other products and services with the Hook Model in mind you can see what they are doing. Yes, I’ve been hooked by some of the services named within the book. I started with the free version of Evernote and found its use compelling and valuable and paid for an extended service. Was I hooked by a free service? Yes, of course? It was not the only draw but a combination of a good product, a useful service and an extended period of use that underlined its essentialness and bang, handing over some money was natural. Does that make me a customer for life? Absolutely not, although as a happy customer I am less likely to be looking for alternative solutions and even if I stumble across one/am shown something that could be better, it might be harder to change.The book features figures concerning Evernote and its customers who switched from a free to a paid service. In the first month only 0.5% had signed up. It might have felt a slow burn yet it acted like a rolling stone gathering moss. Within 33 months 11% of users had started paying, nine months further on this was at 26% and the figures continue to grow.Hooked again?Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products, written by Nir Eyal and published by Portfolio/Penguin Group USA.

Your level of app use is so high it takes up at least a quarter of your day and you’d be damn if you’re not using it in the bathroom either. You’re so engrained in use that it doesn’t take a notification or some external trigger to get you to use it: you think of something to research, immediately use Google. What the hell is Samantha up to? Check her Snapchat or Twitter. You do it almost innately. It becomes a facet of your subconscious. In other words, you’re hooked.Why are some products so addicting, like Subway Surfers and Tinder? What keeps us coming back? Why do we keep investing time and energy in these addicting products, and as the title of this book suggests, how can we continue to make more of them? Hooked - Stanford Professor Nir Eyal’s exposition into the world of habit forming products - help us tackle these questions, first with a simple premise: habits are behaviors with little or no conscious and businesses that can turn the use of their apps into something habitual improve their competitive advantage. Yet, this is easier said than done and not every product becomes a Play Store chart topper, so how can an entrepreneur or hustler get closer to their next addicting breakthrough? Design the product around the Hook Model – a workflow consisting of 4 specific actions that help generate habits, and in turn, hook users to the product fostering those habits. Throughout Hooked, Eyal explains in detail the four phases of the Hook Model – Trigger, Action, Variable Rewards, and Investment – and how they work with each other seamlessly enough to help users form subconscious, internal triggers that lend themselves into habitual action. He discusses how the best products quickly move from one phase to the other without losing the user’s attention, and have set the groundwork that will motivate the user to increase their investment in those products. From use cases to best practices and scoping questions for each phase of the Hook Model framework, readers get a full sense of what it takes to keep users coming back to your products. Funny, easy to read, and very practical, Hooked may just help you get over the hump and make the next Clash of Clan. "

I am interested in charisma, what makes someone charming beyond actual skill or meaningful attributes. This can be extended to products and activities that ""go viral"" or become sensations. What was it about Tickle Me Elmo or Trivial Pursuit that made people go nuts at Christmas so they HAD TO get that item. Beanie Babies from McDonald's inspired nationwide networks of people striving to collect them all. There's some chance and dumb luck involved, but there's also the elements that Nir Eyal addresses in Hooked. However, I was disappointed. I'd put this under the category of ""business semi-psych semi-science."" The author draws from a lot of psychology and behavioral economics, but does so in the (what I find irritating) simplification of research findings into ""truths"" that don't really represent what was discovered. It's a popular genre, and something I spend time in classes de-bunking, back from the first time I heard a co-worker expound that ""it takes 21 repetitions of a behavior to make it a habit."" He said it to clients and co-workers with such certainty and precision - not 20, not 19, don't have to go to 22, it's 21 repetitions and a habit is born. There was probably something he read that drew from something drawn from a study that actually addressed a particular type of simple stimulus-response type of behavior, but it got expanded into this Law of Human Behavior, and applied broadly. ""Hooked"" is that type of book. There is some good information, but it certainly is not a How-To for creating the next addictive app or viral video, and at least the author gives a caveat that you have to have a good idea to start with, it isn't cook book simple.

Ok, seriously, most of the book is based on well known principles - mostly BJ Fogg's.Although all these principles, (even including Gestalt) have been discussed widely before, it's nice to have it all themed on product design.We all know human needs are constant in time (what the author defines as pleasure/pain, acceptance/avoidance of rejection, seek hope/avoid fear), and almost all consumer products try to fulfil these basic desires. Nir gives it a nice spin how we could think about it in a feedback loop model.The book is mainly written around habit forming products (well, the title says it, easy), but that's what all consumer companies have been forever striving for, should they otherwise become irrelevant (remember Orkut well? Neither do I).The lesson, as Paul Graham says, ""make things people want"" and if I could append ""even if they don't know their needs yet, because digging deeper, they're always the same human desires since thousands of years"""
299,1591847788,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4290668-rajiv-mot,5,"Persuasion moves from art to scienceThis book confirmed my fears that our study of human behavior (abetted by Big Data analytics) and brain operation is being weaponized. This book lays out in clear, easy-to-follow terms, how to design addictive products, and not in the metaphorical sense. There is a chapter that gives a nod to the ethical debate around these endeavors, but it's clear that brain hacking is the present and future of technology. The book centers around consumer apps, but we're now seeing these techniques used to devastating effect in the social and political arena too. But there's a bit of hope here, too. The book provides a clear, accessible explanation of the psychological and neural mechanisms of habit formation. Being aware of how digital persuasion operates give us a chance to recognize when it's being used on us. Maybe this awareness will allow us to stave off complete mind control for a while longer."
