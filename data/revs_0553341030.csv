0,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/193310-brian,4,um...- i read this book- i didn't read this book- i read this book and didn't read this book- i read this book in one universe and didn't in another- this book didn't exist until i read it gribbin's great because he won't dumb down but genuinely wants you to understand this stuff. and b/c he believes in time travel. yay! 
1,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/233920-rebecca,5,"this book is f******n awesome.i read it in highschool and then again in college - because while you're reading it it's like having a really good teacher who holds your attention and makes you understand unusual ideas but as soon as you finish and put it down you're like ""wait, how does that work again?"" so for me at least, i have to be reading it to maintain that state of enlightenment. maybe after a certain number of reads it will stick - because i am not naturally good at this sort of subject. this book explains generally the perplexing, mind-boggling, paradoxical principles of quantum physics while relating the history of discoveries leading up to and through it, including the discovery of the X-Ray.I think this book is meant for laypeople, you don't need to understand any equations, but even for an expert, I think having the history laid out like this, and told in such a personable voice, must be interesting and helpful.this book also led me to read other books about heisenberg and einstein.it definitely make you think. yeah, it definitely makes you think."

""Miaow,"" someone said.I looked behind me. A tabby was sitting, contentedly washing herself. ""Hey! Where did you come from?"" I asked.""You can see me?"" She beamed. ""Whew! That's a load off my mind. I thought I might be dead.""I found this rather strange. ""How can you talk to me if you are dead?""""Well, I meant dead in this universe."" She went on with her toilet.I was a bit uneasy. Needless to say, talking cats appearing out of nowhere and speaking in riddles was not usual in my daily routine. I started eyeing my Stephen King collection uneasily. ""Who are you?"" I asked.She winked. ""Guess.""I scanned my bookshelves. Suddenly illumination lit up on me. ""Bulgakov! The Master and Margarita!"" I exclaimed.The tabby's look was contemptuous. ""Oh come on! - Do I look like a demon?""""Okay..."" I tried again. ""The Cheshire Cat?""My companion looked pained. ""I am much better than that grinning idiot from a stupid children's book, I'll have you know.""""Okay, I'm stumped."" I threw up my hands. ""You tell me.""The tabby got up, swished her tail, arched her back and generally preened herself. ""I am the one and only Schrodinger's Cat."" She bowed her head, as though expecting applause.""Schrodinger? I don't think I have met him. Does he live hereabouts?"" I knew I had made a mistake the moment the question left my lips, because the cat's face darkened like thunder.""You mean you don't know Schrodinger?"" She hissed. ""You ignoramus! He practically defined quantum theory. Oh, where do such fools like you come from?"" ""Oh... Now I remember."" I said. (I did only vaguely - but I wanted to save myself from getting scratched, which I seemed to be in imminent danger of.) ""Wasn't he the famous quantum scientist?""""Yes! He practically defined quantum reality. He left me in a box with a poison vial, a radioactive isotope, and a Geiger counter. If the counter detected any radioactivity, the poison vial would break and I would die. If it didn't, the vial would stay as it is I would live."" She beamed.""Oh! How cruel!"" I felt that this Schrodinger guy must be a bounder of the first water, famous scientist or not. ""He must be reported to the SPCA!""""Oh, you are an idiot!"" The cat laughed. ""Don't you see it was an experiment to question the Copenhagen Interpretation?""I really resented being called an idiot, but did not want to aggravate this temperamental feline with the sharp claws. ""What's that?""""Well, it was all these scientists talking about wave/ particle duality - how subatomic particles behaved both like a wave and a particle, and changed into one or the other only upon observation. Schrodinger was dead against it. So he created me in the box - and I am both dead and alive until someone observes me... at what point, either the vial breaks or it doesn't, I either die or live."" She said all this in one breath.""That's stupid! You can't be dead and alive at the same time. In fact, you are very much alive now."" I was indignant.""Precisely."" The tabby washed her paw. ""I am either dead or alive. The same way with subatomic entities - they are either waves or particles. Or they are something else altogether which our puny imaginations can comprehend."" Her vocabulary was getting richer.""Well, you are alive now."" I reiterated.""Hmm... Yes."" My feline friend did not seem too sure of herself. ""I guess so.""""You guess so?"" I was flabbergasted. ""My dear kitty, can't you feel yourself, hale and hearty?""""I can."" She looked up at the ceiling. ""But John Gribbin says that in a parallel universe, I am dead..."""
3,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2131782-bryant,4,"Okay, so to best describe this book, I need to first describe Schrodingers cat. Keep in mind that this an illustration of what Schrodinger saw as the problem with the Copenhagen idea of Quantum superposition. Imagine a box with a cat inside. A vial of a deadly chemical which will instantly kill the cat is placed inside with the cat, sealed so the feline is safe. A hammer is set up with a rig to smash the vial but only if the following occurs. A small amount of radioactive material is inside a geiger counter. If an atom inside decays, it triggers the hammer and the cat dies. If not the cat lives. The probability of the atom breaking down is equal to the probability of it remaining intact. According to the Copenhagen model, this would mean that the cat is both alive and dead inside the box until the atom is observed. It was a thought experiment, produced to ask ""when does a Quantum model cease to be a mixture and become one thing or another?"" If you were able to follow me on that, check this book out. Otherwise, this kind of thing may not be for you. I loved the information but the writing was a bit rough. That is to be expected of a science book. "
4,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/973813-sean,3,"Gribbin seems to have a sound understanding of quantum mechanics, and his writing is rather well crafted, but sometimes I think he'd rather have been a historian than a physicist. The first half of the book is mostly intricate historical accounts of the key players of the story of quantum mechanics over the last century. Gribbin reveals the concepts very slowly, which might not be a bad thing, so this may seem a bit tedious at first. However, by the end, the concepts are clear and complete. At least up to the publication date anyway. Being somewhat new to these concepts, I'm not sure if I'm meshing too well with the opinions on parallel universes that Gribbin states at the end, and the illustrations are badly placed, only moderately insightful, and actually contradict the text in places. However, I enjoyed this immensely and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a low to no math introduction to quantum mechanics."
5,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16803629-hank,4,"4 stars for science nerds, 3 stars for everyone else. An in depth discussion of the birth of quantum physics, where it is now and what it means for the future. Not much math and fairly accessible but not as easy to read as Astrophysics for People in a Hurry. I enjoyed it for the survey of physics giants in the early 20th century from Einstein to Heisenburg. The last 1/3 of the book were a series of explanations of experiments used to prove some of the theorems which were fascinating. I think a great deal of the genius was expressed in merely coming up with ways to prove ideas.A pretty dense book if you aren't a nerd. I am so, lucky me."
6,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24751255-bhavana-kilambi,4,"Physics was one subject i was never good at during High school (not that i was great at any of the other subjects though but Physics was a nightmare). There were concepts which were totally ambiguous to me and went way above my head. This book not only clarified some of them but also instilled in me a deep interest in Physics. In this book, John Gribbin gives a fabulous peek into the magical realm of quantum physics. He begins with an explanation on the very basic unit of life - ""the atom"" and the various evolving attempts by scientists to give an accurate description of the structure of an atom (Including the various experiments leading to the discovery of protons, neutrons and electrons). He then explains the Planck's black body radiation and the famous two-slit experiment whose observations threw the entire scientific community into a state of utter ambiguity and disarray about the nature of electrons. Some more experiments later they discover the ""photon"" and the dual nature (particle and wave nature) of light and particles like electrons. This is followed by discoveries by Pauli (the Pauli exclusion principle), Heisenberg, Born and Schrondinger which strengthen the theory of quantum mechanics. A very interesting part of the book is on ""time travel"" which according to the author is possible (atleast theoretically) though it might have a lot of practical hurdles. He believes that parallel worlds do exist but not the way in which we imagine (in most of the sci-fiction books) where we can hop between the alternate universes but all the alternate universes according to quantum theory branch out based on the choices that the observer encounters. He also writes about the two different theories explaining the way things work in this universe - The ""Copenhagen interpretation"" where there are numerous possibilities of something happening but there is only one reality (in one world) and the rest are just virtual ghostly worlds which all collapse into one result when the observer actually observes the system. The ""many-worlds interpretation"" contradicts the Copenhagen interpretation in the sense it assumes all the possibilities to be equally real and exist in their own worlds with their own observers (us being one of them). All in all the entire quantum mechanics lies on the observer who observes the system. What happens when the observer is not looking is something that is not explained by the quantum theory (and can only be speculated). Finally, the search for Schrodinger's cat ends by the author using the many-worlds theory to testify the fact that the cat is in reality both dead and alive (in two separate, mutually exclusive worlds) but not either dead or alive. When the observer looks into the box, he forces one outcome , which is the cat is either dead or alive and the other possibility still exists in its own world with its own observer (which is as real as our universe). A very interesting theory but this is just the author's personal views i guess.  The author in the end also touches upon the theory of supersymmetry which is the latest field under study within the quantum community and deals with unifying matter (particles like electrons,protons, quarks etc) and force (the bosons like photons etc). The entire book has been an amazing ride through the mindbogglingly unbelievable world of the sub-atomic particles and i cant say it better than Neils Bohr - ""Anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has not fully understood it""."
7,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1012180-joe,3,"I'm reading this again after a few years so that when I give it to my girlfriend to read and EXPAND HER MIND I will be able to help guide her through it. So far, it has been a great intro to quantum mechanics. It's supposed to be for the layman, and it appears fairly basic, but I have some background, so it's hard for me to judge that.EDIT:Well, it wasn't as good as I remember it. Maybe it was the passage of time and the advancement of science, maybe it was my own further studies in the field, maybe it was own growth and change in preferences, or maybe I just things didn't notice the first time. Don't get me wrong; it's still good, and I don't regret having read through it, but Gribbin is certainly not the best writer out there on these subjects. I would recommend Brian Greene, but he always wants to throw a plug in for the wonders of string theory and how it will solve EVERY SCIENTIFIC PROBLEM EVER; IT WILL EVEN CURE CANCER AND OBESITY!!!! Even so, Greene's description of the basic science is unparalleled. If you want an introduction on these matters read the opening two-thirds of either of his books (The Elegant Universe or The Fabric of the Cosmos). As for Gribbin, he has trouble pacing and keeping his writing consistent. He'll meander aimlessly and point out important subjects he'll describe later. Worst, his level of detail and required scientific background is horribly inconsistent. From a relatively simple, easy to follow, and well-suited for the layman explanation of the structure of the atom to his absurdly obtuse description of the most important experiment to confirm the predictions of quantum mechanics, he leaves the reader fighting to piece together his point. The book does show its age at parts but his amazement at PCs and LASERs does not change the fact that they are awesome and stem from the study of quantum mechanics. A larger flaw is his matter-of-fact presentation of certain controversial theories as ""yeah, that's the way it is; don't bother investigating further."" This book does have a lot of good information and does explain some aspects of quantum mechanics very well for someone with little experience, but he kind of unravels at the end."

As a 'non-science' person, I can't say I followed everything but enough to give me a solid understanding for what it is and why it's so mystifying. The 'Many Worlds' theory, however, remains deeply unconvincing. I'm grateful that Gribbin caveats this chapter by acknowledging that it is more opinion than the rest of the book, although he does then proceed to continue in the same 'this is undeniably true' tone for the rest of the chapter."
10,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56494017-shashwat-rohilla,5,"A very well explained journey of quantum science. John clearly tells us why there was even a need for these theories and how, after many weird observations, the concept of Schrodinger's Cat and other theories emerged. I am neither a mathematician nor a physicist. Still, the way he wrote, it's not much difficult for a guy like me to comprehend the book."
11,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6595232-pete,5,This must be the 10th time I have re-read this book. I met the author way back when I was a kid and have always been fascinated with solving the quantum mysteries and physics. This book and others from Gribbin were exceedingly well written in language that didn't require a PhD. It was spellbinding and quite enjoyable to re-read.
12,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2736147-riju-ganguly,5,"Amidst a plethora of books purportedly dealing with ""explaining Quantum Theory to the layman"" this book stands apart, as well as taller, by virtue of two qualities: -1. It's really really well written, even by the high standards of popular science set by the luminaries, and remains deliciously readable even after more than three decades since its publication.2. It's unapologetically forthcoming, and NEVER tries to dumb down things in an effort towards becoming more ""accommodating"" and ""plebian"", which are the more euphemistic expressions for undervaluing the readers.I literally rushed through the first two-third of the book, all along feeling a genuine regret fornthe fact that had I studied this book before embarking on my quest to become a Chemistry graduate, I could have appreciated the things a lot more, in the process picking up much more than a degree.It was, however, the final third that made me sit up, and read & re-read things, only to understand them. That part dealt with actual state of quantum theory, and needs considerable conceptual clarity, which is not so easy to muster at my stage.Nevertheless, if you want to get acquainted with the strange & beautiful world of quantum theory, this is indeed the best introduction that you can procure.Highly Recommended, and happy reading."

19,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/687278-audra,4,"I first read this book when I was a freshman in college (a business major at the time). Until then, I had never given much thought to the sciences, but this book was so fascinating for me that it eventually lead to me changing my major. I thought the book was as easy of a read as physics can be. The author did a good job of making it understandable for the layperson. The concepts in here are so mind-boggling that it's often difficult to even begin to imagine them, but that's what makes the book so amazing to me. That this kind of sci-fi fantasy stuff exists in real life is so exciting!My only real problem with the book was that I felt he didn't make proper use of his figures. I felt there could have been more (except for the Feynman diagrams... I get it already!!) and I felt he should have connected the text to them better. It seemed like the text and the figures were two separate entities, so one didn't particularly help the understanding of the other. I just finished the book for the second time, and I'm realizing now that it's much better as a group read. The first time I read it, our class used a discussion format to go over the material, and it made it much easier to absorb. While I still loved the book this time, I think if you have at least one other person to discuss these ideas with, you get much more out of the book."
20,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69159766-mekhala-pande,5,"Gribbin is lucid and witty in explaining to the largely layman audience the principles of the strange and beautiful world of quantum mechanics. Approaching the book from the perspective of philosophy, was fascinating as well. Schrodinger's cat is reminiscent of Jain philosophy and the working of quantum mechanics and buddhist thought have been compared and debated upon quite frequently.Needless to say, this book really makes you think in abstract ways."
21,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5812864-greg,4,"This was one of the best books I have read on Quantum Physics. It turns out to be a slow read, because it gives you examples, and then to fully understand the examples you find yourself working out the aspects of it. It is only about 250 pages, but it took me the better part of six months to get through. Awesome book!"

23,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8626044-waleed,4,"A really good book that provides a reasonably understandable introduction to quantum mechanics and its history.There is a focus on providing a detailed account of the development of the theory, including a “de-idealisation” of the major figures who won Nobel prizes - for example, it is quickly stated that although Planck jumped to the idea of quantisation he did not do this for any reason other than mathematical convenience so the discovery was more an accident than anything else. Even Schrodinger thought that his idea that electrons should take on distinct energy levels simply because these were the configurations that fit an integer number of wavelengths into the circumference of the orbit was a step towards validating classical physics once again - an idea we know now to be incorrect due to the inaccuracy of the Bohr model (solar system model) of the atom. In fact, many physicists were dead set on validating classical physics and restoring the old ways by finding some “trick” that explained the inexplicable.The book does a good job of demonstrating the confused way in which quantum mechanics and quantum theory (two separate things!) developed and had contributions made by the great physicists of the 20th century.More needs to be read to fully grasp the intricacies or the theory since although Gribbin tries his best, I would still say that the book is not 100% comprehensible to the layman. Maybe this is biased due to my lack of background, but I felt that the end of the book was rather rushed in the way it introduced a maelstrom of new concepts such as super symmetry and the inflationary universe. It maybe reflects the state of physics at the time and the lack of understanding of the scientists themselves of these theories.Nevertheless, this book is a brilliant starting point and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone with an interest in the subject."
24,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/33334584-peter-pinkney,5,"WOW!!!!I said that I would read difficult books this year, but I meant things like Infinite Jest, or Finnegan’s Wake. This is way more difficult, but way more important and totally fascinating.When I say difficult, I don’t mean difficult to read, I mean getting my head around the ideas, and the maths (which I don’t really understand), but who cares?? I just took it on face value that the maths is correct, and I went with the flow.I’m more of a poetry reading, literature reading head in the clouds kind of guy who doesn’t really do science, but I wanted to try. I had my mind blown more by this than anything since my heady hallucinogenic youth.A typical statement from this book “nothing is real unless we look at it, and ceases to be real as soon as we stop looking” That is jaw droppingly awe making. There are other mind melting ideas such as ghosts, things that can travel back and forwards in time, alternative realities, alternative universes, and the idea that the universe is only there because it is being observed. I am somewhat of an atheist, but some of the speculations in here make me wonder.Sometimes the blurbs of the covers of books say stranger than fiction. This book is certainly that, and I’ll never look at a cat again without a feeling of awe. Maybe cats have the answers.... "
25,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66086616-fanie-oosthuysen,5,While this book may be slightly dated (luckily physics do not move that fast) it is an amazing work with unparalleled explanatory powers laying bare one of the most difficult concepts of our time. I would give it all the stars. Whilst it started slow for me reiterating knowns I took months to get through the first quarter and only a day or two to finish it. If you are getting bombarded with new interpretations of quantum theory and misconceptions relating to that. This book allows you to travel back in time and strips the concepts back to their basics.

But sadly, the only parts I understood were about things I’m already familiar with. I hoped to finally understand what quantum physics really IS, but just as the author got close, he choked, and came out on the other side, blithely assuming he’d explained it. Of course, even Einstein couldn’t accept its principles, and the legendary Richard Feynman, probably the best physics teacher of all time, said that nobody understands it. So I’m in good company.

Honestly, this book is a great book if you’d like to spend time contemplating the aspects of life that not even scientists have quite figured out how to contemplate. If you do choose to read this book though, be prepared to not talk about it, because the normal part of the population doesn’t understand anything to do with quantum theory.

38,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17315458-djpj-oneeightseven,3,"In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat: Updated Edition by John GribbinThe mechanics of a shot-put are easy to grasp. But when you try to look, in the same way, at the mechanics of atoms, the world turns magic. Observably, measurably, inconceivably magic. I’ll admit it, this book, or rather the topic it addresses, is mind-blowing. Gribbin starts with a history of the old physics that brought us to the uneasy precipice of the magic quantum world. This historical tour is comforting and well done. But when it comes to the juicy quantum stuff, while his descriptions were fascinating, I found them frequently lacking in detail and focussed too much on the broad interpretations and too little on the actual experiments and scientific detail. Whether I could understand this stuff is of course a matter of furious debate, but I would have liked to get the chance to give it a shot. It was all too dumbed down and as a result came across like a children’s storybook telling tales of a faraway place but never really taking us there. I suppose the reason I found the explanations lacking solid grounding was because I found Gribbin’s interpretations of quantum physics ludicrous. Gribbin subscribes to the “MWI”, or many worlds interpretation of quantum conundrums, which is the belief that a (supposedly) infinite number of universes just like ours exist and every single time you do anything important, like say pick your nose, you cause the universe you live in to split into two. One where you picked your nose and the other where you didn’t. Like this one, all of the interpretations mentioned by Gribbin were so fanatically anthropocentric that I wished I would split into a universe where he didn’t exist. To think of hundreds of billions of separate universes in which Gribbin pats himself on the back for missing the point is nauseating. Instead of grandly stating as Everett did that every idiotic little action made by human beings splits the universe in two, is it not a more tenable interpretation of Schrodinger’s cat and the Aspect experiment to lay the blame not in the universe but in our faculties of perception? Maybe what is out there is simply beyond what our puny brains can begin to comprehend, and so from the teaming mass of instantaneous potentialities swarming through space, our simple mind chooses one, at random, and delivers it to our senses for construction of a sane vision of the world? Meanwhile potentialities are born and fade away without splitting universes.Anyway enough of that – but this is a good point to digress into religion, philosophy and ontology. Considering the bulk of the science of quantum physics seems to have been done in the 20s I find it almost as surprising as the science itself, that even almost a hundred years later the learnings of quantum physics have not been integrated into mainstream layman’s philosophy. People still equate the philosophy of science to the philosophy of Newtonian shot-puts. Atheism is still seen as an empty, cold, predictable worldview. Quantum mechanics is predictable, yes, but only when you assume that the world is magic beyond our comprehension. Why has some kind of “mystical atheism” not become the mainstream religion? Why hasn’t the magic world that quantum physics exposes been integrated into mainstream interpretations of reality even, maybe, a little bit? I guess it’s because (a) people are outrageously stupid, and (b) religion really has hijacked the entire debate except for a few Sci-Fi writers, who inadvertently act in support of religion by taking the quantum debate into the world of fiction. Anyway I’m glad I read Gribbin’s excellent book and I hope many others do too!"

40,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"This is a good history of quantum physics, particularly part one, ""The Quantum."" Part two and part three go into more technical detail and, progressively, become harder to follow. There are a few special gems from this book. Gribbin asks the reader to imagine a pinhead, representing the nucleus, at the center of St. Paul's cathedral, surrounded by a cloud of dust motes, representing electrons, in the cathedral's dome about a 100 meters away. This conveys empty space within the atom. At the speed of light, ""time stands still....A photon, naturally, travels at the speed of light...and this means that for a photon time has no meaning."" Then he adds, ""to the photon...the Big Bang and our present are the same time."" And he writes that all particles and all waves, not just the photon and electron, are ""mixtures of wave and particle,"" and this realization constitutes a ""complete break with classical physics."" Gribbin cites Newton's discovery that in free space ""any object keeps moving in a straight line at constant speed until it is pushed by some outside force."" A question is, in warped space where everything has an influence on everything else, does free space exist and is free motion (straight line) really therefore the natural state of motion? Gribbin states that under quantum mechanics, precision in spacetime coordinates (location) conflicts with identification of momentum ""and therefore of causality. General relativity is a classical theory, in this sense, and cannot be regarded as the equal of quantum mechanics as a fundamental description of the universe."" Does this mean that if one has the intent to get in the car and drive to the store or if this country tends to send an unmanned vehicle to Mars, that we cannot expect that such will be done? Or, more abstractly, that ""A"" cannot be said to cause ""B""?A few key points in quantum theory remain unreachable. Gribbin writes that ""the vacuum is a seething mass of virtual particles in its own right, even when there are no 'real' particles present."" Elsewhere, he writes that 99.99999 percent ""of the universe is ...seething with activity, a malestrom of virtual particles."" There's an irony in the use of the word ""seething"" in both quotes. In reference to Dirac, he says that ""what we call 'empty space' is actually a sea of negative energy electrons!"" and this moves the reader into Gribbin's difficult description of antimatter. We also learn that ""'spin'...is nothing like the behavior of a child's spinning top, or the rotation of the earth on its axis as it orbits around the sun,"" but that leaves the question of what, then, is spin? On a positive note, Gribbin does a good job describing electron jumping according to fixed quantum rules.  "
41,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49285862-saswati,5,"I read this book. I did not read this book. I am uncertain if I should read this book. I am trying to be certain about reading this book again. In a nutshell (that is, if it exists), I need to take some time off to find perspective in life. Especially the one I am observing right now. "
42,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7381993-katia-n,5,"It was the first popular book about quantum physics I've read and I think I was lucky to start with it. As after I've read two more books and they both are much less aspirational for different reasons. This book gives very good overview of the theory and the history of the subject presenting all key personalities and milestones of its development.Overall, probably not unexpectedly, it changes your perception of a huge variety of reality aspects. The most striking for me was thought about the history: ""In this delayed choice experiment something we do now has an irretrievable influence on what we can say about the past. History at least for one photon depends upon how we choose to make a measurement… Philosophers have long pondered the fact that history has no meaning - the past has no existence - except in the way it is recorded in the present."" I think it has become even more relevant in our media savvy days when wars are played and won more on screen than at the actual battles fields. It feels surreal to find the natural phenomenon facilitating such an interpretation of the social reality.Also it was interesting finally to find out what stands behind the overused metaphor of Schrodinger's cat:-)For me now it has become apparent that time travel, teleportation, antimatter and multiple realities are well established phenomena of physics, not of unhealthy imagination.My only gentle complain - I wish it would be a little bit more maths in there. I understand it might spook some audience, but I am sure it might be appreciated by the others. Heisenberg, the developer of the uncertainly principle, said: ""At first, I was deeply alarmed. I had the feeling that, through the surface of atomic phenomena, I was looking at a strangely beautiful interior, and felt almost giddy at the thought that i now had to probe this wealth of mathematical structures nature had so generally spread out before me."" I think this book has opened for me a tiny whole into the world he is talking about."
43,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12856123-sam,2,"I was a little bit disappointed by this book as it’s more a tour through history of all the developments in physics rather than a description of simply the theories which is what I was expecting. It’s a lot about the scientists and who won a Nobel Prize rather than simply this is the accepted theory of this or that. It began with the discussion of light being both waves and particles and the double slit experiment, which I was familiar with from other books I had read and documentaries I had watched and so didn’t really learn anything new. I enjoyed learning about Bohr’s atom and the inaccurate representations of it in most science textbooks and how LEDs work due to superconductors and diodes. Then it got really complicated and I found myself losing interest. I wonder who this book is aimed at as being someone who has only studied Physics to GCSE level and self-taught myself the rest of the things I know, I’ll be honest I found it too complex to fully understand in the way it was presented. It seems in order to understand what is discussed you need foundational knowledge of physics and without this everything just seemed a bit too overwhelming. Terminology was used often to describe other more complex concepts with the assumption that the reader understood it and without this the more complex concept was unattainable. The diagrams contained no keys to explain what all the notations meant and there was not really any explanation of the accompanying mathematical calculations to support the discussion. This made it difficult to understand when in actuality with the right explanation it is likely quite simple. "
44,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2648205-white,5,"This is perhaps one of the best science books I have read and I've read tons of them. The whole point of Schrodinger's cat is to put the misinterpretation of quantum physics to shame. Of course the paradox is impossible and that is the point. Still, it didn't stop the new age fanatics from their mystical thinking. They took the paradox literally and formed a cult from the impossible. I respect the author because he put perspective on the ridiculousness of quantum mechanics as experienced by our limited senses. Gribbin admits that there is another factor which we are unaware of; a factor that would take us away from the nonsense and tie the macro and micro worlds together into one connection. Still accepting the scientific experience of quantum physics, Gribbin keeps reality in sight by focusing on the inevitable; that we have not learned the entire story. Flipping in and out of realities according to consciousness and observation is a fairy tale. Schrodinger's Cat displays that truth with fervor.I love this book...immensely. "
45,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17435739-greg,5,"I have read several books on quantum physics and this one is by far the most accessible to the non-PhD audience. You still need some basic background in engineering or physical science, but Mr. Gribbin takes it from there in a very natural and logical progression from early atomic theory to QED. Critically, this book presents the best explanation of the famous ""double slit"" experiment - not only for the experimental set up and result, but also for the scientific and philosophical consequences.On the scientific side, it is persuasive and compelling. On the philosophical side it is troubling, if not terrifying as Niels Bohr insists it should be. Written in the 80's, it is amazing how well the presentations in this book have aged. Even advanced topics like Einstein's ghostly action at a distance are covered quite well. Other excellent explanations are provided for complicated topics such as gauge theory, strong and weak nuclear forces, Heisenberg uncertainty pairs, Feynman diagrams and much more. This book was very hard to put down despite the complex subject matter."

Besides, the concepts in the book are mind-blowing enough.Gribbin takes the reader on a guided tour of the history of sub-atomic physics, with a brief biography of all the major players along the way.

58,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15981563-alteredego,4,"The title of this book probably highlights its greatest weakness. Updated Edition. This is a history/explanation of quantum physics written in the mid 1980s with the subsequent 30+ years tacked on at the end. There are more recent works which form a more coherent whole, for example Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw's Quantum Universe.The other thing to say is that John Gribbin sets out to do something virtually impossible. Given that the most famous quantum physicist if the mid 20th century, Richard Feynman said ""If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics"", to write a popular science book on the subject is optimistic to say the least.Any writer seeking to make the subject accessible to the lay reader must travel along the border between explanatory and comprehensibility. To put it another way, by providing a full explanation, s/he run the risk if tunnelling through the border into the region where the reader is lost and confused. For me Gribbin is a little over conservative, not providing enough explanation. For example, while describing one of the early signs of the need for quantum mechanics, the ""black body problem"" he describes what the problem was - that classical physics predicted an infinite amount of energy - but not why classical physics made this prediction. Linked to this , the early chapters are more about the people involved than the developing theory. That it is a very valid story to tell, but Gribbin almost sits in an indeterminate state between the people and the physics. If you want to read the story through the people, could I recommend Manjit Kumar's excellent Quantum: Einstein, Bohr .....While I have some criticisms of this book, overall it remains an excellent introduction to an incomprehensible subject. While referring to Schrodinger's cat makes for an arresting title, Gribbin seems to agree with another of Feynman's assertions that the double slit experiment is the absolute heart of quantum physics.Having, in previous readings on quantum physics, been troubled by the use of classical terms (e.g. spin"" ) to label features of the quantum realm, I was rather taken by Gribbin's suggestion that use of the language of Carroll's Jabberwocky would be equally valid.This book also gives one of the clearest explanations of the differences between the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and the many worlds version. In an incredibly simplistic nutshell, the former suggests that the universe sits on a sea of probability waves which collapse to certainty when observed, while the latter postulates that the universe splits every time a quantum ""decision"" is taken.The end of the book, which contains sections referring to developments since the mid-80s, is both tantalising and returns to the main weakness. I wanted to know more about quantum computing, or about why the apparent study of the massive, cosmology, can be viewed as the forefront of the study of the subatomic quantum domain.To finish, if you read this book, you should be able to follow this marvellous joke.Schrodinger and Heisenberg are stopped by a traffic cop.Police Officer: Do you know how fast you were travelling sir?Heisenberg: No, officerPO: 90 mph, sirH: Great, now we're lostPO: and did you know you have a dead cat in the bootSchrodinger: We do now."

I wish I had Gribbin as a teacher in that room to explain that mystical, elusive subject known as “science.”Gribbin takes a historical approach, guiding us through quantum physics as it developed into a field. This approach is useful as it highlights not only the triumphs of scientific breakthrough, but also opposing schools of thought. For example, the discovery of atoms versus Aristotle’s four elements. He intends  In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat  to be a helpful guide for the layman, to make science clear and dispel myths to sort the science-fact from the science-fiction. I apologise for marking the pages with my  Doctor Who  bookmark.It’s amazing to think that such basic information we know now, like how light diffracts, had to be discovered by expert, hardworking scientists, some of whom faced ridicule for their outlandish-appearing theories.This book is readable and Gribbin explains science very well, using simple, everyday-world analogies and avoiding getting bogged down in jargon and abbreviations. I wouldn’t recommend reading it when tired or with a headache, because it does require a bit of focus for a layman like me, and it can’t be skimmed.However,  In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat  was written 35 years ago. I imagine it is now a bit out of date. For one, our TVs do not rely on cathode-ray tubes to produce a picture, as Gribbin suggests. Similarly, sodium-yellow street lamps are going out of fashion in favour of LEDs. Neutron microscopes, which Gribbin sees as a potential development in the field, have already been a reality for several years. I also believe the Many Worlds Interpretation has also gained more traction now than when  In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat  was published. Perhaps an updated version would not be amiss? More recent contributions to the field could also be covered, like Higgs-Boson.Read for: Hebban Challenge, Book #44 A Book from a Genre I Never Read "

I hoped to finally understand what quantum physics really IS, but just as the author got close, he choked, and came out on the other side, blithely assuming he’d explained it. Of course, even Einstein couldn’t accept its principles, and the legendary Richard Feynman, probably the best physics teacher of all time, said that nobody understands it. So I’m in good company.

But when you try to look, in the same way, at the mechanics of atoms, the world turns magic. Observably, measurably, inconceivably magic. I’ll admit it, this book, or rather the topic it addresses, is mind-blowing. Gribbin starts with a history of the old physics that brought us to the uneasy precipice of the magic quantum world. This historical tour is comforting and well done. But when it comes to the juicy quantum stuff, while his descriptions were fascinating, I found them frequently lacking in detail and focussed too much on the broad interpretations and too little on the actual experiments and scientific detail. Whether I could understand this stuff is of course a matter of furious debate, but I would have liked to get the chance to give it a shot. It was all too dumbed down and as a result came across like a children’s storybook telling tales of a faraway place but never really taking us there. I suppose the reason I found the explanations lacking solid grounding was because I found Gribbin’s interpretations of quantum physics ludicrous. Gribbin subscribes to the “MWI”, or many worlds interpretation of quantum conundrums, which is the belief that a (supposedly) infinite number of universes just like ours exist and every single time you do anything important, like say pick your nose, you cause the universe you live in to split into two. One where you picked your nose and the other where you didn’t. Like this one, all of the interpretations mentioned by Gribbin were so fanatically anthropocentric that I wished I would split into a universe where he didn’t exist. To think of hundreds of billions of separate universes in which Gribbin pats himself on the back for missing the point is nauseating. Instead of grandly stating as Everett did that every idiotic little action made by human beings splits the universe in two, is it not a more tenable interpretation of Schrodinger’s cat and the Aspect experiment to lay the blame not in the universe but in our faculties of perception? Maybe what is out there is simply beyond what our puny brains can begin to comprehend, and so from the teaming mass of instantaneous potentialities swarming through space, our simple mind chooses one, at random, and delivers it to our senses for construction of a sane vision of the world? Meanwhile potentialities are born and fade away without splitting universes.Anyway enough of that – but this is a good point to digress into religion, philosophy and ontology.

People still equate the philosophy of science to the philosophy of Newtonian shot-puts. Atheism is still seen as an empty, cold, predictable worldview. Quantum mechanics is predictable, yes, but only when you assume that the world is magic beyond our comprehension. Why has some kind of “mystical atheism” not become the mainstream religion? Why hasn’t the magic world that quantum physics exposes been integrated into mainstream interpretations of reality even, maybe, a little bit? I guess it’s because (a) people are outrageously stupid, and (b) religion really has hijacked the entire debate except for a few Sci-Fi writers, who inadvertently act in support of religion by taking the quantum debate into the world of fiction. Anyway I’m glad I read Gribbin’s excellent book and I hope many others do too!"

On a positive note, Gribbin does a good job describing electron jumping according to fixed quantum rules.  "

72,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7381993-katia-n,5,"It was the first popular book about quantum physics I've read and I think I was lucky to start with it. As after I've read two more books and they both are much less aspirational for different reasons. This book gives very good overview of the theory and the history of the subject presenting all key personalities and milestones of its development.Overall, probably not unexpectedly, it changes your perception of a huge variety of reality aspects. The most striking for me was thought about the history: ""In this delayed choice experiment something we do now has an irretrievable influence on what we can say about the past. History at least for one photon depends upon how we choose to make a measurement… Philosophers have long pondered the fact that history has no meaning - the past has no existence - except in the way it is recorded in the present."" I think it has become even more relevant in our media savvy days when wars are played and won more on screen than at the actual battles fields. It feels surreal to find the natural phenomenon facilitating such an interpretation of the social reality.Also it was interesting finally to find out what stands behind the overused metaphor of Schrodinger's cat:-)For me now it has become apparent that time travel, teleportation, antimatter and multiple realities are well established phenomena of physics, not of unhealthy imagination.My only gentle complain - I wish it would be a little bit more maths in there. I understand it might spook some audience, but I am sure it might be appreciated by the others. Heisenberg, the developer of the uncertainly principle, said: ""At first, I was deeply alarmed. I had the feeling that, through the surface of atomic phenomena, I was looking at a strangely beautiful interior, and felt almost giddy at the thought that i now had to probe this wealth of mathematical structures nature had so generally spread out before me."" I think this book has opened for me a tiny whole into the world he is talking about."
73,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12856123-sam,2,"I was a little bit disappointed by this book as it’s more a tour through history of all the developments in physics rather than a description of simply the theories which is what I was expecting. It’s a lot about the scientists and who won a Nobel Prize rather than simply this is the accepted theory of this or that. It began with the discussion of light being both waves and particles and the double slit experiment, which I was familiar with from other books I had read and documentaries I had watched and so didn’t really learn anything new. I enjoyed learning about Bohr’s atom and the inaccurate representations of it in most science textbooks and how LEDs work due to superconductors and diodes. Then it got really complicated and I found myself losing interest. I wonder who this book is aimed at as being someone who has only studied Physics to GCSE level and self-taught myself the rest of the things I know, I’ll be honest I found it too complex to fully understand in the way it was presented. It seems in order to understand what is discussed you need foundational knowledge of physics and without this everything just seemed a bit too overwhelming. Terminology was used often to describe other more complex concepts with the assumption that the reader understood it and without this the more complex concept was unattainable. The diagrams contained no keys to explain what all the notations meant and there was not really any explanation of the accompanying mathematical calculations to support the discussion. This made it difficult to understand when in actuality with the right explanation it is likely quite simple. "
74,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2648205-white,5,"This is perhaps one of the best science books I have read and I've read tons of them. The whole point of Schrodinger's cat is to put the misinterpretation of quantum physics to shame. Of course the paradox is impossible and that is the point. Still, it didn't stop the new age fanatics from their mystical thinking. They took the paradox literally and formed a cult from the impossible. I respect the author because he put perspective on the ridiculousness of quantum mechanics as experienced by our limited senses. Gribbin admits that there is another factor which we are unaware of; a factor that would take us away from the nonsense and tie the macro and micro worlds together into one connection. Still accepting the scientific experience of quantum physics, Gribbin keeps reality in sight by focusing on the inevitable; that we have not learned the entire story. Flipping in and out of realities according to consciousness and observation is a fairy tale. Schrodinger's Cat displays that truth with fervor.I love this book...immensely. "

You still need some basic background in engineering or physical science, but Mr. Gribbin takes it from there in a very natural and logical progression from early atomic theory to QED. Critically, this book presents the best explanation of the famous ""double slit"" experiment - not only for the experimental set up and result, but also for the scientific and philosophical consequences.On the scientific side, it is persuasive and compelling. On the philosophical side it is troubling, if not terrifying as Niels Bohr insists it should be. Written in the 80's, it is amazing how well the presentations in this book have aged. Even advanced topics like Einstein's ghostly action at a distance are covered quite well. Other excellent explanations are provided for complicated topics such as gauge theory, strong and weak nuclear forces, Heisenberg uncertainty pairs, Feynman diagrams and much more. This book was very hard to put down despite the complex subject matter."

Besides, the concepts in the book are mind-blowing enough.Gribbin takes the reader on a guided tour of the history of sub-atomic physics, with a brief biography of all the major players along the way. Then he describes the world that quantum theory helped to make, and make understandable: lasers, solid-state electronics, DNA, etc. Then he gets into the nitty gritty of the famous two-slot experiment, and quantum entanglement.This is a great book for discovering the world of quantum physics, find a copy and read it!"

88,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15981563-alteredego,4,"The title of this book probably highlights its greatest weakness. Updated Edition. This is a history/explanation of quantum physics written in the mid 1980s with the subsequent 30+ years tacked on at the end. There are more recent works which form a more coherent whole, for example Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw's Quantum Universe.The other thing to say is that John Gribbin sets out to do something virtually impossible. Given that the most famous quantum physicist if the mid 20th century, Richard Feynman said ""If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics"", to write a popular science book on the subject is optimistic to say the least.Any writer seeking to make the subject accessible to the lay reader must travel along the border between explanatory and comprehensibility. To put it another way, by providing a full explanation, s/he run the risk if tunnelling through the border into the region where the reader is lost and confused. For me Gribbin is a little over conservative, not providing enough explanation. For example, while describing one of the early signs of the need for quantum mechanics, the ""black body problem"" he describes what the problem was - that classical physics predicted an infinite amount of energy - but not why classical physics made this prediction. Linked to this , the early chapters are more about the people involved than the developing theory. That it is a very valid story to tell, but Gribbin almost sits in an indeterminate state between the people and the physics. If you want to read the story through the people, could I recommend Manjit Kumar's excellent Quantum: Einstein, Bohr .....While I have some criticisms of this book, overall it remains an excellent introduction to an incomprehensible subject. While referring to Schrodinger's cat makes for an arresting title, Gribbin seems to agree with another of Feynman's assertions that the double slit experiment is the absolute heart of quantum physics.Having, in previous readings on quantum physics, been troubled by the use of classical terms (e.g. spin"" ) to label features of the quantum realm, I was rather taken by Gribbin's suggestion that use of the language of Carroll's Jabberwocky would be equally valid.This book also gives one of the clearest explanations of the differences between the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and the many worlds version. In an incredibly simplistic nutshell, the former suggests that the universe sits on a sea of probability waves which collapse to certainty when observed, while the latter postulates that the universe splits every time a quantum ""decision"" is taken.The end of the book, which contains sections referring to developments since the mid-80s, is both tantalising and returns to the main weakness. I wanted to know more about quantum computing, or about why the apparent study of the massive, cosmology, can be viewed as the forefront of the study of the subatomic quantum domain.To finish, if you read this book, you should be able to follow this marvellous joke.Schrodinger and Heisenberg are stopped by a traffic cop.Police Officer: Do you know how fast you were travelling sir?Heisenberg: No, officerPO: 90 mph, sirH: Great, now we're lostPO: and did you know you have a dead cat in the bootSchrodinger: We do now."
89,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55755404-fleur,4,"Picking up this book gives me flashbacks to secondary school science lessons, staring at a poster describing the natural states of matter, in a harshly lit classroom called Rutherford Lab which smelled of vinegar. I wish I had Gribbin as a teacher in that room to explain that mystical, elusive subject known as “science.”Gribbin takes a historical approach, guiding us through quantum physics as it developed into a field. This approach is useful as it highlights not only the triumphs of scientific breakthrough, but also opposing schools of thought. For example, the discovery of atoms versus Aristotle’s four elements. He intends  In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat  to be a helpful guide for the layman, to make science clear and dispel myths to sort the science-fact from the science-fiction. I apologise for marking the pages with my  Doctor Who  bookmark.It’s amazing to think that such basic information we know now, like how light diffracts, had to be discovered by expert, hardworking scientists, some of whom faced ridicule for their outlandish-appearing theories.This book is readable and Gribbin explains science very well, using simple, everyday-world analogies and avoiding getting bogged down in jargon and abbreviations. I wouldn’t recommend reading it when tired or with a headache, because it does require a bit of focus for a layman like me, and it can’t be skimmed.However,  In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat  was written 35 years ago. I imagine it is now a bit out of date. For one, our TVs do not rely on cathode-ray tubes to produce a picture, as Gribbin suggests. Similarly, sodium-yellow street lamps are going out of fashion in favour of LEDs. Neutron microscopes, which Gribbin sees as a potential development in the field, have already been a reality for several years. I also believe the Many Worlds Interpretation has also gained more traction now than when  In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat  was published. Perhaps an updated version would not be amiss? More recent contributions to the field could also be covered, like Higgs-Boson.Read for: Hebban Challenge, Book #44 A Book from a Genre I Never Read "

But sadly, the only parts I understood were about things I’m already familiar with. I hoped to finally understand what quantum physics really IS, but just as the author got close, he choked, and came out on the other side, blithely assuming he’d explained it. Of course, even Einstein couldn’t accept its principles, and the legendary Richard Feynman, probably the best physics teacher of all time, said that nobody understands it. So I’m in good company.

98,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17315458-djpj-oneeightseven,3,"In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat: Updated Edition by John GribbinThe mechanics of a shot-put are easy to grasp. But when you try to look, in the same way, at the mechanics of atoms, the world turns magic. Observably, measurably, inconceivably magic. I’ll admit it, this book, or rather the topic it addresses, is mind-blowing. Gribbin starts with a history of the old physics that brought us to the uneasy precipice of the magic quantum world. This historical tour is comforting and well done. But when it comes to the juicy quantum stuff, while his descriptions were fascinating, I found them frequently lacking in detail and focussed too much on the broad interpretations and too little on the actual experiments and scientific detail. Whether I could understand this stuff is of course a matter of furious debate, but I would have liked to get the chance to give it a shot. It was all too dumbed down and as a result came across like a children’s storybook telling tales of a faraway place but never really taking us there. I suppose the reason I found the explanations lacking solid grounding was because I found Gribbin’s interpretations of quantum physics ludicrous. Gribbin subscribes to the “MWI”, or many worlds interpretation of quantum conundrums, which is the belief that a (supposedly) infinite number of universes just like ours exist and every single time you do anything important, like say pick your nose, you cause the universe you live in to split into two. One where you picked your nose and the other where you didn’t. Like this one, all of the interpretations mentioned by Gribbin were so fanatically anthropocentric that I wished I would split into a universe where he didn’t exist. To think of hundreds of billions of separate universes in which Gribbin pats himself on the back for missing the point is nauseating. Instead of grandly stating as Everett did that every idiotic little action made by human beings splits the universe in two, is it not a more tenable interpretation of Schrodinger’s cat and the Aspect experiment to lay the blame not in the universe but in our faculties of perception? Maybe what is out there is simply beyond what our puny brains can begin to comprehend, and so from the teaming mass of instantaneous potentialities swarming through space, our simple mind chooses one, at random, and delivers it to our senses for construction of a sane vision of the world? Meanwhile potentialities are born and fade away without splitting universes.Anyway enough of that – but this is a good point to digress into religion, philosophy and ontology. Considering the bulk of the science of quantum physics seems to have been done in the 20s I find it almost as surprising as the science itself, that even almost a hundred years later the learnings of quantum physics have not been integrated into mainstream layman’s philosophy. People still equate the philosophy of science to the philosophy of Newtonian shot-puts. Atheism is still seen as an empty, cold, predictable worldview. Quantum mechanics is predictable, yes, but only when you assume that the world is magic beyond our comprehension. Why has some kind of “mystical atheism” not become the mainstream religion? Why hasn’t the magic world that quantum physics exposes been integrated into mainstream interpretations of reality even, maybe, a little bit? I guess it’s because (a) people are outrageously stupid, and (b) religion really has hijacked the entire debate except for a few Sci-Fi writers, who inadvertently act in support of religion by taking the quantum debate into the world of fiction. Anyway I’m glad I read Gribbin’s excellent book and I hope many others do too!"

Part two and part three go into more technical detail and, progressively, become harder to follow. There are a few special gems from this book. Gribbin asks the reader to imagine a pinhead, representing the nucleus, at the center of St. Paul's cathedral, surrounded by a cloud of dust motes, representing electrons, in the cathedral's dome about a 100 meters away. This conveys empty space within the atom. At the speed of light, ""time stands still....A photon, naturally, travels at the speed of light...and this means that for a photon time has no meaning."" Then he adds, ""to the photon...the Big Bang and our present are the same time."" And he writes that all particles and all waves, not just the photon and electron, are ""mixtures of wave and particle,"" and this realization constitutes a ""complete break with classical physics."" Gribbin cites Newton's discovery that in free space ""any object keeps moving in a straight line at constant speed until it is pushed by some outside force."" A question is, in warped space where everything has an influence on everything else, does free space exist and is free motion (straight line) really therefore the natural state of motion? Gribbin states that under quantum mechanics, precision in spacetime coordinates (location) conflicts with identification of momentum ""and therefore of causality. General relativity is a classical theory, in this sense, and cannot be regarded as the equal of quantum mechanics as a fundamental description of the universe."" Does this mean that if one has the intent to get in the car and drive to the store or if this country tends to send an unmanned vehicle to Mars, that we cannot expect that such will be done? Or, more abstractly, that ""A"" cannot be said to cause ""B""?A few key points in quantum theory remain unreachable. Gribbin writes that ""the vacuum is a seething mass of virtual particles in its own right, even when there are no 'real' particles present."" Elsewhere, he writes that 99.99999 percent ""of the universe is ...seething with activity, a malestrom of virtual particles."" There's an irony in the use of the word ""seething"" in both quotes. In reference to Dirac, he says that ""what we call 'empty space' is actually a sea of negative energy electrons!"" and this moves the reader into Gribbin's difficult description of antimatter. We also learn that ""'spin'...is nothing like the behavior of a child's spinning top, or the rotation of the earth on its axis as it orbits around the sun,"" but that leaves the question of what, then, is spin? On a positive note, Gribbin does a good job describing electron jumping according to fixed quantum rules.  "

Still accepting the scientific experience of quantum physics, Gribbin keeps reality in sight by focusing on the inevitable; that we have not learned the entire story. Flipping in and out of realities according to consciousness and observation is a fairy tale. Schrodinger's Cat displays that truth with fervor.I love this book...immensely. "
105,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17435739-greg,5,"I have read several books on quantum physics and this one is by far the most accessible to the non-PhD audience. You still need some basic background in engineering or physical science, but Mr. Gribbin takes it from there in a very natural and logical progression from early atomic theory to QED. Critically, this book presents the best explanation of the famous ""double slit"" experiment - not only for the experimental set up and result, but also for the scientific and philosophical consequences.On the scientific side, it is persuasive and compelling. On the philosophical side it is troubling, if not terrifying as Niels Bohr insists it should be. Written in the 80's, it is amazing how well the presentations in this book have aged. Even advanced topics like Einstein's ghostly action at a distance are covered quite well. Other excellent explanations are provided for complicated topics such as gauge theory, strong and weak nuclear forces, Heisenberg uncertainty pairs, Feynman diagrams and much more. This book was very hard to put down despite the complex subject matter."

118,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15981563-alteredego,4,"The title of this book probably highlights its greatest weakness. Updated Edition. This is a history/explanation of quantum physics written in the mid 1980s with the subsequent 30+ years tacked on at the end. There are more recent works which form a more coherent whole, for example Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw's Quantum Universe.The other thing to say is that John Gribbin sets out to do something virtually impossible. Given that the most famous quantum physicist if the mid 20th century, Richard Feynman said ""If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics"", to write a popular science book on the subject is optimistic to say the least.Any writer seeking to make the subject accessible to the lay reader must travel along the border between explanatory and comprehensibility. To put it another way, by providing a full explanation, s/he run the risk if tunnelling through the border into the region where the reader is lost and confused. For me Gribbin is a little over conservative, not providing enough explanation. For example, while describing one of the early signs of the need for quantum mechanics, the ""black body problem"" he describes what the problem was - that classical physics predicted an infinite amount of energy - but not why classical physics made this prediction. Linked to this , the early chapters are more about the people involved than the developing theory. That it is a very valid story to tell, but Gribbin almost sits in an indeterminate state between the people and the physics. If you want to read the story through the people, could I recommend Manjit Kumar's excellent Quantum: Einstein, Bohr .....While I have some criticisms of this book, overall it remains an excellent introduction to an incomprehensible subject. While referring to Schrodinger's cat makes for an arresting title, Gribbin seems to agree with another of Feynman's assertions that the double slit experiment is the absolute heart of quantum physics.Having, in previous readings on quantum physics, been troubled by the use of classical terms (e.g. spin"" ) to label features of the quantum realm, I was rather taken by Gribbin's suggestion that use of the language of Carroll's Jabberwocky would be equally valid.This book also gives one of the clearest explanations of the differences between the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and the many worlds version. In an incredibly simplistic nutshell, the former suggests that the universe sits on a sea of probability waves which collapse to certainty when observed, while the latter postulates that the universe splits every time a quantum ""decision"" is taken.The end of the book, which contains sections referring to developments since the mid-80s, is both tantalising and returns to the main weakness. I wanted to know more about quantum computing, or about why the apparent study of the massive, cosmology, can be viewed as the forefront of the study of the subatomic quantum domain.To finish, if you read this book, you should be able to follow this marvellous joke.Schrodinger and Heisenberg are stopped by a traffic cop.Police Officer: Do you know how fast you were travelling sir?Heisenberg: No, officerPO: 90 mph, sirH: Great, now we're lostPO: and did you know you have a dead cat in the bootSchrodinger: We do now."
119,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55755404-fleur,4,"Picking up this book gives me flashbacks to secondary school science lessons, staring at a poster describing the natural states of matter, in a harshly lit classroom called Rutherford Lab which smelled of vinegar. I wish I had Gribbin as a teacher in that room to explain that mystical, elusive subject known as “science.”Gribbin takes a historical approach, guiding us through quantum physics as it developed into a field. This approach is useful as it highlights not only the triumphs of scientific breakthrough, but also opposing schools of thought. For example, the discovery of atoms versus Aristotle’s four elements. He intends  In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat  to be a helpful guide for the layman, to make science clear and dispel myths to sort the science-fact from the science-fiction. I apologise for marking the pages with my  Doctor Who  bookmark.It’s amazing to think that such basic information we know now, like how light diffracts, had to be discovered by expert, hardworking scientists, some of whom faced ridicule for their outlandish-appearing theories.This book is readable and Gribbin explains science very well, using simple, everyday-world analogies and avoiding getting bogged down in jargon and abbreviations. I wouldn’t recommend reading it when tired or with a headache, because it does require a bit of focus for a layman like me, and it can’t be skimmed.However,  In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat  was written 35 years ago. I imagine it is now a bit out of date. For one, our TVs do not rely on cathode-ray tubes to produce a picture, as Gribbin suggests. Similarly, sodium-yellow street lamps are going out of fashion in favour of LEDs. Neutron microscopes, which Gribbin sees as a potential development in the field, have already been a reality for several years. I also believe the Many Worlds Interpretation has also gained more traction now than when  In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat  was published. Perhaps an updated version would not be amiss? More recent contributions to the field could also be covered, like Higgs-Boson.Read for: Hebban Challenge, Book #44 A Book from a Genre I Never Read "

But sadly, the only parts I understood were about things I’m already familiar with. I hoped to finally understand what quantum physics really IS, but just as the author got close, he choked, and came out on the other side, blithely assuming he’d explained it. Of course, even Einstein couldn’t accept its principles, and the legendary Richard Feynman, probably the best physics teacher of all time, said that nobody understands it. So I’m in good company.

128,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17315458-djpj-oneeightseven,3,"In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat: Updated Edition by John GribbinThe mechanics of a shot-put are easy to grasp. But when you try to look, in the same way, at the mechanics of atoms, the world turns magic. Observably, measurably, inconceivably magic. I’ll admit it, this book, or rather the topic it addresses, is mind-blowing. Gribbin starts with a history of the old physics that brought us to the uneasy precipice of the magic quantum world. This historical tour is comforting and well done. But when it comes to the juicy quantum stuff, while his descriptions were fascinating, I found them frequently lacking in detail and focussed too much on the broad interpretations and too little on the actual experiments and scientific detail. Whether I could understand this stuff is of course a matter of furious debate, but I would have liked to get the chance to give it a shot. It was all too dumbed down and as a result came across like a children’s storybook telling tales of a faraway place but never really taking us there. I suppose the reason I found the explanations lacking solid grounding was because I found Gribbin’s interpretations of quantum physics ludicrous. Gribbin subscribes to the “MWI”, or many worlds interpretation of quantum conundrums, which is the belief that a (supposedly) infinite number of universes just like ours exist and every single time you do anything important, like say pick your nose, you cause the universe you live in to split into two. One where you picked your nose and the other where you didn’t. Like this one, all of the interpretations mentioned by Gribbin were so fanatically anthropocentric that I wished I would split into a universe where he didn’t exist. To think of hundreds of billions of separate universes in which Gribbin pats himself on the back for missing the point is nauseating. Instead of grandly stating as Everett did that every idiotic little action made by human beings splits the universe in two, is it not a more tenable interpretation of Schrodinger’s cat and the Aspect experiment to lay the blame not in the universe but in our faculties of perception? Maybe what is out there is simply beyond what our puny brains can begin to comprehend, and so from the teaming mass of instantaneous potentialities swarming through space, our simple mind chooses one, at random, and delivers it to our senses for construction of a sane vision of the world? Meanwhile potentialities are born and fade away without splitting universes.Anyway enough of that – but this is a good point to digress into religion, philosophy and ontology. Considering the bulk of the science of quantum physics seems to have been done in the 20s I find it almost as surprising as the science itself, that even almost a hundred years later the learnings of quantum physics have not been integrated into mainstream layman’s philosophy. People still equate the philosophy of science to the philosophy of Newtonian shot-puts. Atheism is still seen as an empty, cold, predictable worldview. Quantum mechanics is predictable, yes, but only when you assume that the world is magic beyond our comprehension. Why has some kind of “mystical atheism” not become the mainstream religion? Why hasn’t the magic world that quantum physics exposes been integrated into mainstream interpretations of reality even, maybe, a little bit? I guess it’s because (a) people are outrageously stupid, and (b) religion really has hijacked the entire debate except for a few Sci-Fi writers, who inadvertently act in support of religion by taking the quantum debate into the world of fiction. Anyway I’m glad I read Gribbin’s excellent book and I hope many others do too!"

130,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"This is a good history of quantum physics, particularly part one, ""The Quantum."" Part two and part three go into more technical detail and, progressively, become harder to follow. There are a few special gems from this book. Gribbin asks the reader to imagine a pinhead, representing the nucleus, at the center of St. Paul's cathedral, surrounded by a cloud of dust motes, representing electrons, in the cathedral's dome about a 100 meters away. This conveys empty space within the atom. At the speed of light, ""time stands still....A photon, naturally, travels at the speed of light...and this means that for a photon time has no meaning."" Then he adds, ""to the photon...the Big Bang and our present are the same time."" And he writes that all particles and all waves, not just the photon and electron, are ""mixtures of wave and particle,"" and this realization constitutes a ""complete break with classical physics."" Gribbin cites Newton's discovery that in free space ""any object keeps moving in a straight line at constant speed until it is pushed by some outside force."" A question is, in warped space where everything has an influence on everything else, does free space exist and is free motion (straight line) really therefore the natural state of motion? Gribbin states that under quantum mechanics, precision in spacetime coordinates (location) conflicts with identification of momentum ""and therefore of causality. General relativity is a classical theory, in this sense, and cannot be regarded as the equal of quantum mechanics as a fundamental description of the universe."" Does this mean that if one has the intent to get in the car and drive to the store or if this country tends to send an unmanned vehicle to Mars, that we cannot expect that such will be done? Or, more abstractly, that ""A"" cannot be said to cause ""B""?A few key points in quantum theory remain unreachable. Gribbin writes that ""the vacuum is a seething mass of virtual particles in its own right, even when there are no 'real' particles present."" Elsewhere, he writes that 99.99999 percent ""of the universe is ...seething with activity, a malestrom of virtual particles."" There's an irony in the use of the word ""seething"" in both quotes. In reference to Dirac, he says that ""what we call 'empty space' is actually a sea of negative energy electrons!"" and this moves the reader into Gribbin's difficult description of antimatter. We also learn that ""'spin'...is nothing like the behavior of a child's spinning top, or the rotation of the earth on its axis as it orbits around the sun,"" but that leaves the question of what, then, is spin? On a positive note, Gribbin does a good job describing electron jumping according to fixed quantum rules.  "
131,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49285862-saswati,5,"I read this book. I did not read this book. I am uncertain if I should read this book.

132,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7381993-katia-n,5,"It was the first popular book about quantum physics I've read and I think I was lucky to start with it. As after I've read two more books and they both are much less aspirational for different reasons. This book gives very good overview of the theory and the history of the subject presenting all key personalities and milestones of its development.Overall, probably not unexpectedly, it changes your perception of a huge variety of reality aspects. The most striking for me was thought about the history: ""In this delayed choice experiment something we do now has an irretrievable influence on what we can say about the past. History at least for one photon depends upon how we choose to make a measurement… Philosophers have long pondered the fact that history has no meaning - the past has no existence - except in the way it is recorded in the present."" I think it has become even more relevant in our media savvy days when wars are played and won more on screen than at the actual battles fields. It feels surreal to find the natural phenomenon facilitating such an interpretation of the social reality.Also it was interesting finally to find out what stands behind the overused metaphor of Schrodinger's cat:-)For me now it has become apparent that time travel, teleportation, antimatter and multiple realities are well established phenomena of physics, not of unhealthy imagination.My only gentle complain - I wish it would be a little bit more maths in there. I understand it might spook some audience, but I am sure it might be appreciated by the others. Heisenberg, the developer of the uncertainly principle, said: ""At first, I was deeply alarmed. I had the feeling that, through the surface of atomic phenomena, I was looking at a strangely beautiful interior, and felt almost giddy at the thought that i now had to probe this wealth of mathematical structures nature had so generally spread out before me."" I think this book has opened for me a tiny whole into the world he is talking about."
133,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12856123-sam,2,"I was a little bit disappointed by this book as it’s more a tour through history of all the developments in physics rather than a description of simply the theories which is what I was expecting. It’s a lot about the scientists and who won a Nobel Prize rather than simply this is the accepted theory of this or that. It began with the discussion of light being both waves and particles and the double slit experiment, which I was familiar with from other books I had read and documentaries I had watched and so didn’t really learn anything new. I enjoyed learning about Bohr’s atom and the inaccurate representations of it in most science textbooks and how LEDs work due to superconductors and diodes. Then it got really complicated and I found myself losing interest. I wonder who this book is aimed at as being someone who has only studied Physics to GCSE level and self-taught myself the rest of the things I know, I’ll be honest I found it too complex to fully understand in the way it was presented. It seems in order to understand what is discussed you need foundational knowledge of physics and without this everything just seemed a bit too overwhelming. Terminology was used often to describe other more complex concepts with the assumption that the reader understood it and without this the more complex concept was unattainable. The diagrams contained no keys to explain what all the notations meant and there was not really any explanation of the accompanying mathematical calculations to support the discussion. This made it difficult to understand when in actuality with the right explanation it is likely quite simple. "

I respect the author because he put perspective on the ridiculousness of quantum mechanics as experienced by our limited senses.

I am truly glad I read this book. Perhaps I'll go back and dig out the Stephen Hawking and Michio Kaku books I started but did not finish. I want to delve deeper into this subject."

148,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15981563-alteredego,4,"The title of this book probably highlights its greatest weakness. Updated Edition. This is a history/explanation of quantum physics written in the mid 1980s with the subsequent 30+ years tacked on at the end. There are more recent works which form a more coherent whole, for example Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw's Quantum Universe.The other thing to say is that John Gribbin sets out to do something virtually impossible. Given that the most famous quantum physicist if the mid 20th century, Richard Feynman said ""If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics"", to write a popular science book on the subject is optimistic to say the least.Any writer seeking to make the subject accessible to the lay reader must travel along the border between explanatory and comprehensibility. To put it another way, by providing a full explanation, s/he run the risk if tunnelling through the border into the region where the reader is lost and confused. For me Gribbin is a little over conservative, not providing enough explanation. For example, while describing one of the early signs of the need for quantum mechanics, the ""black body problem"" he describes what the problem was - that classical physics predicted an infinite amount of energy - but not why classical physics made this prediction. Linked to this , the early chapters are more about the people involved than the developing theory. That it is a very valid story to tell, but Gribbin almost sits in an indeterminate state between the people and the physics. If you want to read the story through the people, could I recommend Manjit Kumar's excellent Quantum: Einstein, Bohr .....While I have some criticisms of this book, overall it remains an excellent introduction to an incomprehensible subject. While referring to Schrodinger's cat makes for an arresting title, Gribbin seems to agree with another of Feynman's assertions that the double slit experiment is the absolute heart of quantum physics.Having, in previous readings on quantum physics, been troubled by the use of classical terms (e.g. spin"" ) to label features of the quantum realm, I was rather taken by Gribbin's suggestion that use of the language of Carroll's Jabberwocky would be equally valid.This book also gives one of the clearest explanations of the differences between the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and the many worlds version. In an incredibly simplistic nutshell, the former suggests that the universe sits on a sea of probability waves which collapse to certainty when observed, while the latter postulates that the universe splits every time a quantum ""decision"" is taken.The end of the book, which contains sections referring to developments since the mid-80s, is both tantalising and returns to the main weakness. I wanted to know more about quantum computing, or about why the apparent study of the massive, cosmology, can be viewed as the forefront of the study of the subatomic quantum domain.To finish, if you read this book, you should be able to follow this marvellous joke.Schrodinger and Heisenberg are stopped by a traffic cop.Police Officer: Do you know how fast you were travelling sir?Heisenberg: No, officerPO: 90 mph, sirH: Great, now we're lostPO: and did you know you have a dead cat in the bootSchrodinger: We do now."
149,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55755404-fleur,4,"Picking up this book gives me flashbacks to secondary school science lessons, staring at a poster describing the natural states of matter, in a harshly lit classroom called Rutherford Lab which smelled of vinegar. I wish I had Gribbin as a teacher in that room to explain that mystical, elusive subject known as “science.”Gribbin takes a historical approach, guiding us through quantum physics as it developed into a field. This approach is useful as it highlights not only the triumphs of scientific breakthrough, but also opposing schools of thought. For example, the discovery of atoms versus Aristotle’s four elements. He intends  In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat  to be a helpful guide for the layman, to make science clear and dispel myths to sort the science-fact from the science-fiction. I apologise for marking the pages with my  Doctor Who  bookmark.It’s amazing to think that such basic information we know now, like how light diffracts, had to be discovered by expert, hardworking scientists, some of whom faced ridicule for their outlandish-appearing theories.This book is readable and Gribbin explains science very well, using simple, everyday-world analogies and avoiding getting bogged down in jargon and abbreviations. I wouldn’t recommend reading it when tired or with a headache, because it does require a bit of focus for a layman like me, and it can’t be skimmed.However,  In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat  was written 35 years ago. I imagine it is now a bit out of date. For one, our TVs do not rely on cathode-ray tubes to produce a picture, as Gribbin suggests. Similarly, sodium-yellow street lamps are going out of fashion in favour of LEDs. Neutron microscopes, which Gribbin sees as a potential development in the field, have already been a reality for several years. I also believe the Many Worlds Interpretation has also gained more traction now than when  In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat  was published. Perhaps an updated version would not be amiss? More recent contributions to the field could also be covered, like Higgs-Boson.Read for: Hebban Challenge, Book #44 A Book from a Genre I Never Read "
150,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1068292-christy,3,"I thought this book would finally make quantum physics clear to me, and the author, John Gribbin, is supposed to be one of the finest science writers out there. But sadly, the only parts I understood were about things I’m already familiar with. I hoped to finally understand what quantum physics really IS, but just as the author got close, he choked, and came out on the other side, blithely assuming he’d explained it. Of course, even Einstein couldn’t accept its principles, and the legendary Richard Feynman, probably the best physics teacher of all time, said that nobody understands it. So I’m in good company.

158,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17315458-djpj-oneeightseven,3,"In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat: Updated Edition by John GribbinThe mechanics of a shot-put are easy to grasp. But when you try to look, in the same way, at the mechanics of atoms, the world turns magic. Observably, measurably, inconceivably magic. I’ll admit it, this book, or rather the topic it addresses, is mind-blowing. Gribbin starts with a history of the old physics that brought us to the uneasy precipice of the magic quantum world. This historical tour is comforting and well done. But when it comes to the juicy quantum stuff, while his descriptions were fascinating, I found them frequently lacking in detail and focussed too much on the broad interpretations and too little on the actual experiments and scientific detail. Whether I could understand this stuff is of course a matter of furious debate, but I would have liked to get the chance to give it a shot. It was all too dumbed down and as a result came across like a children’s storybook telling tales of a faraway place but never really taking us there. I suppose the reason I found the explanations lacking solid grounding was because I found Gribbin’s interpretations of quantum physics ludicrous. Gribbin subscribes to the “MWI”, or many worlds interpretation of quantum conundrums, which is the belief that a (supposedly) infinite number of universes just like ours exist and every single time you do anything important, like say pick your nose, you cause the universe you live in to split into two. One where you picked your nose and the other where you didn’t. Like this one, all of the interpretations mentioned by Gribbin were so fanatically anthropocentric that I wished I would split into a universe where he didn’t exist. To think of hundreds of billions of separate universes in which Gribbin pats himself on the back for missing the point is nauseating. Instead of grandly stating as Everett did that every idiotic little action made by human beings splits the universe in two, is it not a more tenable interpretation of Schrodinger’s cat and the Aspect experiment to lay the blame not in the universe but in our faculties of perception? Maybe what is out there is simply beyond what our puny brains can begin to comprehend, and so from the teaming mass of instantaneous potentialities swarming through space, our simple mind chooses one, at random, and delivers it to our senses for construction of a sane vision of the world? Meanwhile potentialities are born and fade away without splitting universes.Anyway enough of that – but this is a good point to digress into religion, philosophy and ontology. Considering the bulk of the science of quantum physics seems to have been done in the 20s I find it almost as surprising as the science itself, that even almost a hundred years later the learnings of quantum physics have not been integrated into mainstream layman’s philosophy. People still equate the philosophy of science to the philosophy of Newtonian shot-puts. Atheism is still seen as an empty, cold, predictable worldview. Quantum mechanics is predictable, yes, but only when you assume that the world is magic beyond our comprehension. Why has some kind of “mystical atheism” not become the mainstream religion? Why hasn’t the magic world that quantum physics exposes been integrated into mainstream interpretations of reality even, maybe, a little bit? I guess it’s because (a) people are outrageously stupid, and (b) religion really has hijacked the entire debate except for a few Sci-Fi writers, who inadvertently act in support of religion by taking the quantum debate into the world of fiction. Anyway I’m glad I read Gribbin’s excellent book and I hope many others do too!"

160,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"This is a good history of quantum physics, particularly part one, ""The Quantum."" Part two and part three go into more technical detail and, progressively, become harder to follow. There are a few special gems from this book. Gribbin asks the reader to imagine a pinhead, representing the nucleus, at the center of St. Paul's cathedral, surrounded by a cloud of dust motes, representing electrons, in the cathedral's dome about a 100 meters away. This conveys empty space within the atom. At the speed of light, ""time stands still....A photon, naturally, travels at the speed of light...and this means that for a photon time has no meaning."" Then he adds, ""to the photon...the Big Bang and our present are the same time."" And he writes that all particles and all waves, not just the photon and electron, are ""mixtures of wave and particle,"" and this realization constitutes a ""complete break with classical physics."" Gribbin cites Newton's discovery that in free space ""any object keeps moving in a straight line at constant speed until it is pushed by some outside force."" A question is, in warped space where everything has an influence on everything else, does free space exist and is free motion (straight line) really therefore the natural state of motion? Gribbin states that under quantum mechanics, precision in spacetime coordinates (location) conflicts with identification of momentum ""and therefore of causality. General relativity is a classical theory, in this sense, and cannot be regarded as the equal of quantum mechanics as a fundamental description of the universe."" Does this mean that if one has the intent to get in the car and drive to the store or if this country tends to send an unmanned vehicle to Mars, that we cannot expect that such will be done? Or, more abstractly, that ""A"" cannot be said to cause ""B""?A few key points in quantum theory remain unreachable. Gribbin writes that ""the vacuum is a seething mass of virtual particles in its own right, even when there are no 'real' particles present."" Elsewhere, he writes that 99.99999 percent ""of the universe is ...seething with activity, a malestrom of virtual particles."" There's an irony in the use of the word ""seething"" in both quotes. In reference to Dirac, he says that ""what we call 'empty space' is actually a sea of negative energy electrons!"" and this moves the reader into Gribbin's difficult description of antimatter. We also learn that ""'spin'...is nothing like the behavior of a child's spinning top, or the rotation of the earth on its axis as it orbits around the sun,"" but that leaves the question of what, then, is spin? On a positive note, Gribbin does a good job describing electron jumping according to fixed quantum rules.  "
161,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49285862-saswati,5,"I read this book. I did not read this book. I am uncertain if I should read this book. I am trying to be certain about reading this book again. In a nutshell (that is, if it exists), I need to take some time off to find perspective in life. Especially the one I am observing right now. "
162,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7381993-katia-n,5,"It was the first popular book about quantum physics I've read and I think I was lucky to start with it. As after I've read two more books and they both are much less aspirational for different reasons. This book gives very good overview of the theory and the history of the subject presenting all key personalities and milestones of its development.Overall, probably not unexpectedly, it changes your perception of a huge variety of reality aspects. The most striking for me was thought about the history: ""In this delayed choice experiment something we do now has an irretrievable influence on what we can say about the past. History at least for one photon depends upon how we choose to make a measurement… Philosophers have long pondered the fact that history has no meaning - the past has no existence - except in the way it is recorded in the present."" I think it has become even more relevant in our media savvy days when wars are played and won more on screen than at the actual battles fields. It feels surreal to find the natural phenomenon facilitating such an interpretation of the social reality.Also it was interesting finally to find out what stands behind the overused metaphor of Schrodinger's cat:-)For me now it has become apparent that time travel, teleportation, antimatter and multiple realities are well established phenomena of physics, not of unhealthy imagination.My only gentle complain - I wish it would be a little bit more maths in there. I understand it might spook some audience, but I am sure it might be appreciated by the others. Heisenberg, the developer of the uncertainly principle, said: ""At first, I was deeply alarmed. I had the feeling that, through the surface of atomic phenomena, I was looking at a strangely beautiful interior, and felt almost giddy at the thought that i now had to probe this wealth of mathematical structures nature had so generally spread out before me."" I think this book has opened for me a tiny whole into the world he is talking about."
163,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12856123-sam,2,"I was a little bit disappointed by this book as it’s more a tour through history of all the developments in physics rather than a description of simply the theories which is what I was expecting. It’s a lot about the scientists and who won a Nobel Prize rather than simply this is the accepted theory of this or that. It began with the discussion of light being both waves and particles and the double slit experiment, which I was familiar with from other books I had read and documentaries I had watched and so didn’t really learn anything new. I enjoyed learning about Bohr’s atom and the inaccurate representations of it in most science textbooks and how LEDs work due to superconductors and diodes. Then it got really complicated and I found myself losing interest. I wonder who this book is aimed at as being someone who has only studied Physics to GCSE level and self-taught myself the rest of the things I know, I’ll be honest I found it too complex to fully understand in the way it was presented. It seems in order to understand what is discussed you need foundational knowledge of physics and without this everything just seemed a bit too overwhelming. Terminology was used often to describe other more complex concepts with the assumption that the reader understood it and without this the more complex concept was unattainable. The diagrams contained no keys to explain what all the notations meant and there was not really any explanation of the accompanying mathematical calculations to support the discussion. This made it difficult to understand when in actuality with the right explanation it is likely quite simple. "
164,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2648205-white,5,"This is perhaps one of the best science books I have read and I've read tons of them. The whole point of Schrodinger's cat is to put the misinterpretation of quantum physics to shame. Of course the paradox is impossible and that is the point. Still, it didn't stop the new age fanatics from their mystical thinking. They took the paradox literally and formed a cult from the impossible. I respect the author because he put perspective on the ridiculousness of quantum mechanics as experienced by our limited senses. Gribbin admits that there is another factor which we are unaware of; a factor that would take us away from the nonsense and tie the macro and micro worlds together into one connection. Still accepting the scientific experience of quantum physics, Gribbin keeps reality in sight by focusing on the inevitable; that we have not learned the entire story. Flipping in and out of realities according to consciousness and observation is a fairy tale. Schrodinger's Cat displays that truth with fervor.I love this book...immensely. "
165,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17435739-greg,5,"I have read several books on quantum physics and this one is by far the most accessible to the non-PhD audience. You still need some basic background in engineering or physical science, but Mr. Gribbin takes it from there in a very natural and logical progression from early atomic theory to QED. Critically, this book presents the best explanation of the famous ""double slit"" experiment - not only for the experimental set up and result, but also for the scientific and philosophical consequences.On the scientific side, it is persuasive and compelling. On the philosophical side it is troubling, if not terrifying as Niels Bohr insists it should be. Written in the 80's, it is amazing how well the presentations in this book have aged. Even advanced topics like Einstein's ghostly action at a distance are covered quite well. Other excellent explanations are provided for complicated topics such as gauge theory, strong and weak nuclear forces, Heisenberg uncertainty pairs, Feynman diagrams and much more. This book was very hard to put down despite the complex subject matter."

If you want to read the story through the people, could I recommend Manjit Kumar's excellent Quantum: Einstein, Bohr .....While I have some criticisms of this book, overall it remains an excellent introduction to an incomprehensible subject. While referring to Schrodinger's cat makes for an arresting title, Gribbin seems to agree with another of Feynman's assertions that the double slit experiment is the absolute heart of quantum physics.Having, in previous readings on quantum physics, been troubled by the use of classical terms (e.g. spin"" ) to label features of the quantum realm, I was rather taken by Gribbin's suggestion that use of the language of Carroll's Jabberwocky would be equally valid.This book also gives one of the clearest explanations of the differences between the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and the many worlds version. In an incredibly simplistic nutshell, the former suggests that the universe sits on a sea of probability waves which collapse to certainty when observed, while the latter postulates that the universe splits every time a quantum ""decision"" is taken.The end of the book, which contains sections referring to developments since the mid-80s, is both tantalising and returns to the main weakness. I wanted to know more about quantum computing, or about why the apparent study of the massive, cosmology, can be viewed as the forefront of the study of the subatomic quantum domain.To finish, if you read this book, you should be able to follow this marvellous joke.Schrodinger and Heisenberg are stopped by a traffic cop.Police Officer: Do you know how fast you were travelling sir?Heisenberg: No, officerPO: 90 mph, sirH: Great, now we're lostPO: and did you know you have a dead cat in the bootSchrodinger: We do now."

I wish I had Gribbin as a teacher in that room to explain that mystical, elusive subject known as “science.”Gribbin takes a historical approach, guiding us through quantum physics as it developed into a field. This approach is useful as it highlights not only the triumphs of scientific breakthrough, but also opposing schools of thought. For example, the discovery of atoms versus Aristotle’s four elements. He intends  In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat  to be a helpful guide for the layman, to make science clear and dispel myths to sort the science-fact from the science-fiction. I apologise for marking the pages with my  Doctor Who  bookmark.It’s amazing to think that such basic information we know now, like how light diffracts, had to be discovered by expert, hardworking scientists, some of whom faced ridicule for their outlandish-appearing theories.This book is readable and Gribbin explains science very well, using simple, everyday-world analogies and avoiding getting bogged down in jargon and abbreviations. I wouldn’t recommend reading it when tired or with a headache, because it does require a bit of focus for a layman like me, and it can’t be skimmed.However,  In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat  was written 35 years ago. I imagine it is now a bit out of date. For one, our TVs do not rely on cathode-ray tubes to produce a picture, as Gribbin suggests. Similarly, sodium-yellow street lamps are going out of fashion in favour of LEDs. Neutron microscopes, which Gribbin sees as a potential development in the field, have already been a reality for several years. I also believe the Many Worlds Interpretation has also gained more traction now than when  In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat  was published. Perhaps an updated version would not be amiss? More recent contributions to the field could also be covered, like Higgs-Boson.Read for: Hebban Challenge, Book #44 A Book from a Genre I Never Read "

But sadly, the only parts I understood were about things I’m already familiar with. I hoped to finally understand what quantum physics really IS, but just as the author got close, he choked, and came out on the other side, blithely assuming he’d explained it.

188,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17315458-djpj-oneeightseven,3,"In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat: Updated Edition by John GribbinThe mechanics of a shot-put are easy to grasp. But when you try to look, in the same way, at the mechanics of atoms, the world turns magic. Observably, measurably, inconceivably magic. I’ll admit it, this book, or rather the topic it addresses, is mind-blowing. Gribbin starts with a history of the old physics that brought us to the uneasy precipice of the magic quantum world. This historical tour is comforting and well done. But when it comes to the juicy quantum stuff, while his descriptions were fascinating, I found them frequently lacking in detail and focussed too much on the broad interpretations and too little on the actual experiments and scientific detail. Whether I could understand this stuff is of course a matter of furious debate, but I would have liked to get the chance to give it a shot. It was all too dumbed down and as a result came across like a children’s storybook telling tales of a faraway place but never really taking us there. I suppose the reason I found the explanations lacking solid grounding was because I found Gribbin’s interpretations of quantum physics ludicrous. Gribbin subscribes to the “MWI”, or many worlds interpretation of quantum conundrums, which is the belief that a (supposedly) infinite number of universes just like ours exist and every single time you do anything important, like say pick your nose, you cause the universe you live in to split into two. One where you picked your nose and the other where you didn’t. Like this one, all of the interpretations mentioned by Gribbin were so fanatically anthropocentric that I wished I would split into a universe where he didn’t exist. To think of hundreds of billions of separate universes in which Gribbin pats himself on the back for missing the point is nauseating. Instead of grandly stating as Everett did that every idiotic little action made by human beings splits the universe in two, is it not a more tenable interpretation of Schrodinger’s cat and the Aspect experiment to lay the blame not in the universe but in our faculties of perception? Maybe what is out there is simply beyond what our puny brains can begin to comprehend, and so from the teaming mass of instantaneous potentialities swarming through space, our simple mind chooses one, at random, and delivers it to our senses for construction of a sane vision of the world? Meanwhile potentialities are born and fade away without splitting universes.Anyway enough of that – but this is a good point to digress into religion, philosophy and ontology. Considering the bulk of the science of quantum physics seems to have been done in the 20s I find it almost as surprising as the science itself, that even almost a hundred years later the learnings of quantum physics have not been integrated into mainstream layman’s philosophy. People still equate the philosophy of science to the philosophy of Newtonian shot-puts. Atheism is still seen as an empty, cold, predictable worldview. Quantum mechanics is predictable, yes, but only when you assume that the world is magic beyond our comprehension. Why has some kind of “mystical atheism” not become the mainstream religion? Why hasn’t the magic world that quantum physics exposes been integrated into mainstream interpretations of reality even, maybe, a little bit? I guess it’s because (a) people are outrageously stupid, and (b) religion really has hijacked the entire debate except for a few Sci-Fi writers, who inadvertently act in support of religion by taking the quantum debate into the world of fiction. Anyway I’m glad I read Gribbin’s excellent book and I hope many others do too!"
189,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49145900-jaclyn,4,"I got interested in learning more about quantum physics after reading a totally different book mentioning it. So, when I saw this eBook on sale, I bought it. And what a journey it has been. If I said I totally understood this book, I would be lying. Science can be tough and some of those concepts were just too much for me. But overall I understood what the author was saying, and what he said was extremely interesting. I thought it this book was really well written and I feel more knowledgeable now that I have read it. I recommend it highly! "
190,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"This is a good history of quantum physics, particularly part one, ""The Quantum."" Part two and part three go into more technical detail and, progressively, become harder to follow. There are a few special gems from this book. Gribbin asks the reader to imagine a pinhead, representing the nucleus, at the center of St. Paul's cathedral, surrounded by a cloud of dust motes, representing electrons, in the cathedral's dome about a 100 meters away. This conveys empty space within the atom. At the speed of light, ""time stands still....A photon, naturally, travels at the speed of light...and this means that for a photon time has no meaning."" Then he adds, ""to the photon...the Big Bang and our present are the same time."" And he writes that all particles and all waves, not just the photon and electron, are ""mixtures of wave and particle,"" and this realization constitutes a ""complete break with classical physics."" Gribbin cites Newton's discovery that in free space ""any object keeps moving in a straight line at constant speed until it is pushed by some outside force."" A question is, in warped space where everything has an influence on everything else, does free space exist and is free motion (straight line) really therefore the natural state of motion? Gribbin states that under quantum mechanics, precision in spacetime coordinates (location) conflicts with identification of momentum ""and therefore of causality. General relativity is a classical theory, in this sense, and cannot be regarded as the equal of quantum mechanics as a fundamental description of the universe."" Does this mean that if one has the intent to get in the car and drive to the store or if this country tends to send an unmanned vehicle to Mars, that we cannot expect that such will be done? Or, more abstractly, that ""A"" cannot be said to cause ""B""?A few key points in quantum theory remain unreachable. Gribbin writes that ""the vacuum is a seething mass of virtual particles in its own right, even when there are no 'real' particles present."" Elsewhere, he writes that 99.99999 percent ""of the universe is ...seething with activity, a malestrom of virtual particles."" There's an irony in the use of the word ""seething"" in both quotes. In reference to Dirac, he says that ""what we call 'empty space' is actually a sea of negative energy electrons!"" and this moves the reader into Gribbin's difficult description of antimatter. We also learn that ""'spin'...is nothing like the behavior of a child's spinning top, or the rotation of the earth on its axis as it orbits around the sun,"" but that leaves the question of what, then, is spin? On a positive note, Gribbin does a good job describing electron jumping according to fixed quantum rules.  "
191,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49285862-saswati,5,"I read this book. I did not read this book. I am uncertain if I should read this book. I am trying to be certain about reading this book again. In a nutshell (that is, if it exists), I need to take some time off to find perspective in life. Especially the one I am observing right now. "
192,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7381993-katia-n,5,"It was the first popular book about quantum physics I've read and I think I was lucky to start with it. As after I've read two more books and they both are much less aspirational for different reasons. This book gives very good overview of the theory and the history of the subject presenting all key personalities and milestones of its development.Overall, probably not unexpectedly, it changes your perception of a huge variety of reality aspects. The most striking for me was thought about the history: ""In this delayed choice experiment something we do now has an irretrievable influence on what we can say about the past. History at least for one photon depends upon how we choose to make a measurement… Philosophers have long pondered the fact that history has no meaning - the past has no existence - except in the way it is recorded in the present."" I think it has become even more relevant in our media savvy days when wars are played and won more on screen than at the actual battles fields. It feels surreal to find the natural phenomenon facilitating such an interpretation of the social reality.Also it was interesting finally to find out what stands behind the overused metaphor of Schrodinger's cat:-)For me now it has become apparent that time travel, teleportation, antimatter and multiple realities are well established phenomena of physics, not of unhealthy imagination.My only gentle complain - I wish it would be a little bit more maths in there. I understand it might spook some audience, but I am sure it might be appreciated by the others. Heisenberg, the developer of the uncertainly principle, said: ""At first, I was deeply alarmed. I had the feeling that, through the surface of atomic phenomena, I was looking at a strangely beautiful interior, and felt almost giddy at the thought that i now had to probe this wealth of mathematical structures nature had so generally spread out before me."" I think this book has opened for me a tiny whole into the world he is talking about."
193,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12856123-sam,2,"I was a little bit disappointed by this book as it’s more a tour through history of all the developments in physics rather than a description of simply the theories which is what I was expecting. It’s a lot about the scientists and who won a Nobel Prize rather than simply this is the accepted theory of this or that. It began with the discussion of light being both waves and particles and the double slit experiment, which I was familiar with from other books I had read and documentaries I had watched and so didn’t really learn anything new. I enjoyed learning about Bohr’s atom and the inaccurate representations of it in most science textbooks and how LEDs work due to superconductors and diodes. Then it got really complicated and I found myself losing interest. I wonder who this book is aimed at as being someone who has only studied Physics to GCSE level and self-taught myself the rest of the things I know, I’ll be honest I found it too complex to fully understand in the way it was presented. It seems in order to understand what is discussed you need foundational knowledge of physics and without this everything just seemed a bit too overwhelming. Terminology was used often to describe other more complex concepts with the assumption that the reader understood it and without this the more complex concept was unattainable. The diagrams contained no keys to explain what all the notations meant and there was not really any explanation of the accompanying mathematical calculations to support the discussion. This made it difficult to understand when in actuality with the right explanation it is likely quite simple. "
194,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2648205-white,5,"This is perhaps one of the best science books I have read and I've read tons of them. The whole point of Schrodinger's cat is to put the misinterpretation of quantum physics to shame. Of course the paradox is impossible and that is the point. Still, it didn't stop the new age fanatics from their mystical thinking. They took the paradox literally and formed a cult from the impossible. I respect the author because he put perspective on the ridiculousness of quantum mechanics as experienced by our limited senses. Gribbin admits that there is another factor which we are unaware of; a factor that would take us away from the nonsense and tie the macro and micro worlds together into one connection. Still accepting the scientific experience of quantum physics, Gribbin keeps reality in sight by focusing on the inevitable; that we have not learned the entire story. Flipping in and out of realities according to consciousness and observation is a fairy tale. Schrodinger's Cat displays that truth with fervor.I love this book...immensely. "

You still need some basic background in engineering or physical science, but Mr. Gribbin takes it from there in a very natural and logical progression from early atomic theory to QED. Critically, this book presents the best explanation of the famous ""double slit"" experiment - not only for the experimental set up and result, but also for the scientific and philosophical consequences.On the scientific side, it is persuasive and compelling. On the philosophical side it is troubling, if not terrifying as Niels Bohr insists it should be. Written in the 80's, it is amazing how well the presentations in this book have aged. Even advanced topics like Einstein's ghostly action at a distance are covered quite well. Other excellent explanations are provided for complicated topics such as gauge theory, strong and weak nuclear forces, Heisenberg uncertainty pairs, Feynman diagrams and much more. This book was very hard to put down despite the complex subject matter."

This is a history/explanation of quantum physics written in the mid 1980s with the subsequent 30+ years tacked on at the end. There are more recent works which form a more coherent whole, for example Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw's Quantum Universe.The other thing to say is that John Gribbin sets out to do something virtually impossible. Given that the most famous quantum physicist if the mid 20th century, Richard Feynman said ""If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics"", to write a popular science book on the subject is optimistic to say the least.Any writer seeking to make the subject accessible to the lay reader must travel along the border between explanatory and comprehensibility. To put it another way, by providing a full explanation, s/he run the risk if tunnelling through the border into the region where the reader is lost and confused. For me Gribbin is a little over conservative, not providing enough explanation. For example, while describing one of the early signs of the need for quantum mechanics, the ""black body problem"" he describes what the problem was - that classical physics predicted an infinite amount of energy - but not why classical physics made this prediction. Linked to this , the early chapters are more about the people involved than the developing theory.

218,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17315458-djpj-oneeightseven,3,"In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat: Updated Edition by John GribbinThe mechanics of a shot-put are easy to grasp. But when you try to look, in the same way, at the mechanics of atoms, the world turns magic. Observably, measurably, inconceivably magic. I’ll admit it, this book, or rather the topic it addresses, is mind-blowing. Gribbin starts with a history of the old physics that brought us to the uneasy precipice of the magic quantum world. This historical tour is comforting and well done. But when it comes to the juicy quantum stuff, while his descriptions were fascinating, I found them frequently lacking in detail and focussed too much on the broad interpretations and too little on the actual experiments and scientific detail. Whether I could understand this stuff is of course a matter of furious debate, but I would have liked to get the chance to give it a shot. It was all too dumbed down and as a result came across like a children’s storybook telling tales of a faraway place but never really taking us there. I suppose the reason I found the explanations lacking solid grounding was because I found Gribbin’s interpretations of quantum physics ludicrous. Gribbin subscribes to the “MWI”, or many worlds interpretation of quantum conundrums, which is the belief that a (supposedly) infinite number of universes just like ours exist and every single time you do anything important, like say pick your nose, you cause the universe you live in to split into two. One where you picked your nose and the other where you didn’t. Like this one, all of the interpretations mentioned by Gribbin were so fanatically anthropocentric that I wished I would split into a universe where he didn’t exist. To think of hundreds of billions of separate universes in which Gribbin pats himself on the back for missing the point is nauseating. Instead of grandly stating as Everett did that every idiotic little action made by human beings splits the universe in two, is it not a more tenable interpretation of Schrodinger’s cat and the Aspect experiment to lay the blame not in the universe but in our faculties of perception? Maybe what is out there is simply beyond what our puny brains can begin to comprehend, and so from the teaming mass of instantaneous potentialities swarming through space, our simple mind chooses one, at random, and delivers it to our senses for construction of a sane vision of the world? Meanwhile potentialities are born and fade away without splitting universes.Anyway enough of that – but this is a good point to digress into religion, philosophy and ontology. Considering the bulk of the science of quantum physics seems to have been done in the 20s I find it almost as surprising as the science itself, that even almost a hundred years later the learnings of quantum physics have not been integrated into mainstream layman’s philosophy. People still equate the philosophy of science to the philosophy of Newtonian shot-puts. Atheism is still seen as an empty, cold, predictable worldview. Quantum mechanics is predictable, yes, but only when you assume that the world is magic beyond our comprehension. Why has some kind of “mystical atheism” not become the mainstream religion? Why hasn’t the magic world that quantum physics exposes been integrated into mainstream interpretations of reality even, maybe, a little bit? I guess it’s because (a) people are outrageously stupid, and (b) religion really has hijacked the entire debate except for a few Sci-Fi writers, who inadvertently act in support of religion by taking the quantum debate into the world of fiction. Anyway I’m glad I read Gribbin’s excellent book and I hope many others do too!"

So, when I saw this eBook on sale, I bought it. And what a journey it has been. If I said I totally understood this book, I would be lying. Science can be tough and some of those concepts were just too much for me. But overall I understood what the author was saying, and what he said was extremely interesting. I thought it this book was really well written and I feel more knowledgeable now that I have read it. I recommend it highly! "
220,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"This is a good history of quantum physics, particularly part one, ""The Quantum."" Part two and part three go into more technical detail and, progressively, become harder to follow. There are a few special gems from this book. Gribbin asks the reader to imagine a pinhead, representing the nucleus, at the center of St. Paul's cathedral, surrounded by a cloud of dust motes, representing electrons, in the cathedral's dome about a 100 meters away. This conveys empty space within the atom. At the speed of light, ""time stands still....A photon, naturally, travels at the speed of light...and this means that for a photon time has no meaning."" Then he adds, ""to the photon...the Big Bang and our present are the same time."" And he writes that all particles and all waves, not just the photon and electron, are ""mixtures of wave and particle,"" and this realization constitutes a ""complete break with classical physics."" Gribbin cites Newton's discovery that in free space ""any object keeps moving in a straight line at constant speed until it is pushed by some outside force."" A question is, in warped space where everything has an influence on everything else, does free space exist and is free motion (straight line) really therefore the natural state of motion? Gribbin states that under quantum mechanics, precision in spacetime coordinates (location) conflicts with identification of momentum ""and therefore of causality. General relativity is a classical theory, in this sense, and cannot be regarded as the equal of quantum mechanics as a fundamental description of the universe."" Does this mean that if one has the intent to get in the car and drive to the store or if this country tends to send an unmanned vehicle to Mars, that we cannot expect that such will be done? Or, more abstractly, that ""A"" cannot be said to cause ""B""?A few key points in quantum theory remain unreachable. Gribbin writes that ""the vacuum is a seething mass of virtual particles in its own right, even when there are no 'real' particles present."" Elsewhere, he writes that 99.99999 percent ""of the universe is ...seething with activity, a malestrom of virtual particles."" There's an irony in the use of the word ""seething"" in both quotes. In reference to Dirac, he says that ""what we call 'empty space' is actually a sea of negative energy electrons!"" and this moves the reader into Gribbin's difficult description of antimatter. We also learn that ""'spin'...is nothing like the behavior of a child's spinning top, or the rotation of the earth on its axis as it orbits around the sun,"" but that leaves the question of what, then, is spin? On a positive note, Gribbin does a good job describing electron jumping according to fixed quantum rules.  "
221,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49285862-saswati,5,"I read this book. I did not read this book. I am uncertain if I should read this book. I am trying to be certain about reading this book again. In a nutshell (that is, if it exists), I need to take some time off to find perspective in life. Especially the one I am observing right now. "
222,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7381993-katia-n,5,"It was the first popular book about quantum physics I've read and I think I was lucky to start with it. As after I've read two more books and they both are much less aspirational for different reasons. This book gives very good overview of the theory and the history of the subject presenting all key personalities and milestones of its development.Overall, probably not unexpectedly, it changes your perception of a huge variety of reality aspects. The most striking for me was thought about the history: ""In this delayed choice experiment something we do now has an irretrievable influence on what we can say about the past. History at least for one photon depends upon how we choose to make a measurement… Philosophers have long pondered the fact that history has no meaning - the past has no existence - except in the way it is recorded in the present."" I think it has become even more relevant in our media savvy days when wars are played and won more on screen than at the actual battles fields. It feels surreal to find the natural phenomenon facilitating such an interpretation of the social reality.Also it was interesting finally to find out what stands behind the overused metaphor of Schrodinger's cat:-)For me now it has become apparent that time travel, teleportation, antimatter and multiple realities are well established phenomena of physics, not of unhealthy imagination.My only gentle complain - I wish it would be a little bit more maths in there. I understand it might spook some audience, but I am sure it might be appreciated by the others. Heisenberg, the developer of the uncertainly principle, said: ""At first, I was deeply alarmed. I had the feeling that, through the surface of atomic phenomena, I was looking at a strangely beautiful interior, and felt almost giddy at the thought that i now had to probe this wealth of mathematical structures nature had so generally spread out before me."" I think this book has opened for me a tiny whole into the world he is talking about."
223,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12856123-sam,2,"I was a little bit disappointed by this book as it’s more a tour through history of all the developments in physics rather than a description of simply the theories which is what I was expecting. It’s a lot about the scientists and who won a Nobel Prize rather than simply this is the accepted theory of this or that. It began with the discussion of light being both waves and particles and the double slit experiment, which I was familiar with from other books I had read and documentaries I had watched and so didn’t really learn anything new. I enjoyed learning about Bohr’s atom and the inaccurate representations of it in most science textbooks and how LEDs work due to superconductors and diodes. Then it got really complicated and I found myself losing interest. I wonder who this book is aimed at as being someone who has only studied Physics to GCSE level and self-taught myself the rest of the things I know, I’ll be honest I found it too complex to fully understand in the way it was presented. It seems in order to understand what is discussed you need foundational knowledge of physics and without this everything just seemed a bit too overwhelming. Terminology was used often to describe other more complex concepts with the assumption that the reader understood it and without this the more complex concept was unattainable. The diagrams contained no keys to explain what all the notations meant and there was not really any explanation of the accompanying mathematical calculations to support the discussion. This made it difficult to understand when in actuality with the right explanation it is likely quite simple. "
224,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2648205-white,5,"This is perhaps one of the best science books I have read and I've read tons of them. The whole point of Schrodinger's cat is to put the misinterpretation of quantum physics to shame. Of course the paradox is impossible and that is the point. Still, it didn't stop the new age fanatics from their mystical thinking. They took the paradox literally and formed a cult from the impossible. I respect the author because he put perspective on the ridiculousness of quantum mechanics as experienced by our limited senses. Gribbin admits that there is another factor which we are unaware of; a factor that would take us away from the nonsense and tie the macro and micro worlds together into one connection. Still accepting the scientific experience of quantum physics, Gribbin keeps reality in sight by focusing on the inevitable; that we have not learned the entire story. Flipping in and out of realities according to consciousness and observation is a fairy tale. Schrodinger's Cat displays that truth with fervor.I love this book...immensely. "
225,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17435739-greg,5,"I have read several books on quantum physics and this one is by far the most accessible to the non-PhD audience. You still need some basic background in engineering or physical science, but Mr. Gribbin takes it from there in a very natural and logical progression from early atomic theory to QED. Critically, this book presents the best explanation of the famous ""double slit"" experiment - not only for the experimental set up and result, but also for the scientific and philosophical consequences.On the scientific side, it is persuasive and compelling. On the philosophical side it is troubling, if not terrifying as Niels Bohr insists it should be. Written in the 80's, it is amazing how well the presentations in this book have aged. Even advanced topics like Einstein's ghostly action at a distance are covered quite well. Other excellent explanations are provided for complicated topics such as gauge theory, strong and weak nuclear forces, Heisenberg uncertainty pairs, Feynman diagrams and much more. This book was very hard to put down despite the complex subject matter."

238,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15981563-alteredego,4,"The title of this book probably highlights its greatest weakness. Updated Edition. This is a history/explanation of quantum physics written in the mid 1980s with the subsequent 30+ years tacked on at the end. There are more recent works which form a more coherent whole, for example Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw's Quantum Universe.The other thing to say is that John Gribbin sets out to do something virtually impossible. Given that the most famous quantum physicist if the mid 20th century, Richard Feynman said ""If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics"", to write a popular science book on the subject is optimistic to say the least.Any writer seeking to make the subject accessible to the lay reader must travel along the border between explanatory and comprehensibility. To put it another way, by providing a full explanation, s/he run the risk if tunnelling through the border into the region where the reader is lost and confused. For me Gribbin is a little over conservative, not providing enough explanation. For example, while describing one of the early signs of the need for quantum mechanics, the ""black body problem"" he describes what the problem was - that classical physics predicted an infinite amount of energy - but not why classical physics made this prediction. Linked to this , the early chapters are more about the people involved than the developing theory. That it is a very valid story to tell, but Gribbin almost sits in an indeterminate state between the people and the physics. If you want to read the story through the people, could I recommend Manjit Kumar's excellent Quantum: Einstein, Bohr .....While I have some criticisms of this book, overall it remains an excellent introduction to an incomprehensible subject. While referring to Schrodinger's cat makes for an arresting title, Gribbin seems to agree with another of Feynman's assertions that the double slit experiment is the absolute heart of quantum physics.Having, in previous readings on quantum physics, been troubled by the use of classical terms (e.g. spin"" ) to label features of the quantum realm, I was rather taken by Gribbin's suggestion that use of the language of Carroll's Jabberwocky would be equally valid.This book also gives one of the clearest explanations of the differences between the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and the many worlds version. In an incredibly simplistic nutshell, the former suggests that the universe sits on a sea of probability waves which collapse to certainty when observed, while the latter postulates that the universe splits every time a quantum ""decision"" is taken.The end of the book, which contains sections referring to developments since the mid-80s, is both tantalising and returns to the main weakness. I wanted to know more about quantum computing, or about why the apparent study of the massive, cosmology, can be viewed as the forefront of the study of the subatomic quantum domain.To finish, if you read this book, you should be able to follow this marvellous joke.Schrodinger and Heisenberg are stopped by a traffic cop.Police Officer: Do you know how fast you were travelling sir?Heisenberg: No, officerPO: 90 mph, sirH: Great, now we're lostPO: and did you know you have a dead cat in the bootSchrodinger: We do now."

I wish I had Gribbin as a teacher in that room to explain that mystical, elusive subject known as “science.”Gribbin takes a historical approach, guiding us through quantum physics as it developed into a field. This approach is useful as it highlights not only the triumphs of scientific breakthrough, but also opposing schools of thought. For example, the discovery of atoms versus Aristotle’s four elements. He intends  In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat  to be a helpful guide for the layman, to make science clear and dispel myths to sort the science-fact from the science-fiction. I apologise for marking the pages with my  Doctor Who  bookmark.It’s amazing to think that such basic information we know now, like how light diffracts, had to be discovered by expert, hardworking scientists, some of whom faced ridicule for their outlandish-appearing theories.This book is readable and Gribbin explains science very well, using simple, everyday-world analogies and avoiding getting bogged down in jargon and abbreviations. I wouldn’t recommend reading it when tired or with a headache, because it does require a bit of focus for a layman like me, and it can’t be skimmed.However,  In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat  was written 35 years ago. I imagine it is now a bit out of date. For one, our TVs do not rely on cathode-ray tubes to produce a picture, as Gribbin suggests. Similarly, sodium-yellow street lamps are going out of fashion in favour of LEDs. Neutron microscopes, which Gribbin sees as a potential development in the field, have already been a reality for several years. I also believe the Many Worlds Interpretation has also gained more traction now than when  In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat  was published. Perhaps an updated version would not be amiss? More recent contributions to the field could also be covered, like Higgs-Boson.Read for: Hebban Challenge, Book #44 A Book from a Genre I Never Read "

Instead of grandly stating as Everett did that every idiotic little action made by human beings splits the universe in two, is it not a more tenable interpretation of Schrodinger’s cat and the Aspect experiment to lay the blame not in the universe but in our faculties of perception? Maybe what is out there is simply beyond what our puny brains can begin to comprehend, and so from the teaming mass of instantaneous potentialities swarming through space, our simple mind chooses one, at random, and delivers it to our senses for construction of a sane vision of the world? Meanwhile potentialities are born and fade away without splitting universes.Anyway enough of that – but this is a good point to digress into religion, philosophy and ontology. Considering the bulk of the science of quantum physics seems to have been done in the 20s I find it almost as surprising as the science itself, that even almost a hundred years later the learnings of quantum physics have not been integrated into mainstream layman’s philosophy. People still equate the philosophy of science to the philosophy of Newtonian shot-puts. Atheism is still seen as an empty, cold, predictable worldview. Quantum mechanics is predictable, yes, but only when you assume that the world is magic beyond our comprehension. Why has some kind of “mystical atheism” not become the mainstream religion? Why hasn’t the magic world that quantum physics exposes been integrated into mainstream interpretations of reality even, maybe, a little bit? I guess it’s because (a) people are outrageously stupid, and (b) religion really has hijacked the entire debate except for a few Sci-Fi writers, who inadvertently act in support of religion by taking the quantum debate into the world of fiction. Anyway I’m glad I read Gribbin’s excellent book and I hope many others do too!"

250,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105523-bob-nichols,3,"This is a good history of quantum physics, particularly part one, ""The Quantum."" Part two and part three go into more technical detail and, progressively, become harder to follow. There are a few special gems from this book. Gribbin asks the reader to imagine a pinhead, representing the nucleus, at the center of St. Paul's cathedral, surrounded by a cloud of dust motes, representing electrons, in the cathedral's dome about a 100 meters away. This conveys empty space within the atom. At the speed of light, ""time stands still....A photon, naturally, travels at the speed of light...and this means that for a photon time has no meaning."" Then he adds, ""to the photon...the Big Bang and our present are the same time."" And he writes that all particles and all waves, not just the photon and electron, are ""mixtures of wave and particle,"" and this realization constitutes a ""complete break with classical physics."" Gribbin cites Newton's discovery that in free space ""any object keeps moving in a straight line at constant speed until it is pushed by some outside force."" A question is, in warped space where everything has an influence on everything else, does free space exist and is free motion (straight line) really therefore the natural state of motion? Gribbin states that under quantum mechanics, precision in spacetime coordinates (location) conflicts with identification of momentum ""and therefore of causality. General relativity is a classical theory, in this sense, and cannot be regarded as the equal of quantum mechanics as a fundamental description of the universe."" Does this mean that if one has the intent to get in the car and drive to the store or if this country tends to send an unmanned vehicle to Mars, that we cannot expect that such will be done? Or, more abstractly, that ""A"" cannot be said to cause ""B""?A few key points in quantum theory remain unreachable. Gribbin writes that ""the vacuum is a seething mass of virtual particles in its own right, even when there are no 'real' particles present."" Elsewhere, he writes that 99.99999 percent ""of the universe is ...seething with activity, a malestrom of virtual particles."" There's an irony in the use of the word ""seething"" in both quotes. In reference to Dirac, he says that ""what we call 'empty space' is actually a sea of negative energy electrons!"" and this moves the reader into Gribbin's difficult description of antimatter. We also learn that ""'spin'...is nothing like the behavior of a child's spinning top, or the rotation of the earth on its axis as it orbits around the sun,"" but that leaves the question of what, then, is spin? On a positive note, Gribbin does a good job describing electron jumping according to fixed quantum rules.  "
251,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49285862-saswati,5,"I read this book. I did not read this book. I am uncertain if I should read this book. I am trying to be certain about reading this book again. In a nutshell (that is, if it exists), I need to take some time off to find perspective in life. Especially the one I am observing right now. "
252,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7381993-katia-n,5,"It was the first popular book about quantum physics I've read and I think I was lucky to start with it. As after I've read two more books and they both are much less aspirational for different reasons. This book gives very good overview of the theory and the history of the subject presenting all key personalities and milestones of its development.Overall, probably not unexpectedly, it changes your perception of a huge variety of reality aspects. The most striking for me was thought about the history: ""In this delayed choice experiment something we do now has an irretrievable influence on what we can say about the past. History at least for one photon depends upon how we choose to make a measurement… Philosophers have long pondered the fact that history has no meaning - the past has no existence - except in the way it is recorded in the present."" I think it has become even more relevant in our media savvy days when wars are played and won more on screen than at the actual battles fields. It feels surreal to find the natural phenomenon facilitating such an interpretation of the social reality.Also it was interesting finally to find out what stands behind the overused metaphor of Schrodinger's cat:-)For me now it has become apparent that time travel, teleportation, antimatter and multiple realities are well established phenomena of physics, not of unhealthy imagination.My only gentle complain - I wish it would be a little bit more maths in there. I understand it might spook some audience, but I am sure it might be appreciated by the others. Heisenberg, the developer of the uncertainly principle, said: ""At first, I was deeply alarmed. I had the feeling that, through the surface of atomic phenomena, I was looking at a strangely beautiful interior, and felt almost giddy at the thought that i now had to probe this wealth of mathematical structures nature had so generally spread out before me."" I think this book has opened for me a tiny whole into the world he is talking about."
253,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12856123-sam,2,"I was a little bit disappointed by this book as it’s more a tour through history of all the developments in physics rather than a description of simply the theories which is what I was expecting. It’s a lot about the scientists and who won a Nobel Prize rather than simply this is the accepted theory of this or that. It began with the discussion of light being both waves and particles and the double slit experiment, which I was familiar with from other books I had read and documentaries I had watched and so didn’t really learn anything new. I enjoyed learning about Bohr’s atom and the inaccurate representations of it in most science textbooks and how LEDs work due to superconductors and diodes. Then it got really complicated and I found myself losing interest. I wonder who this book is aimed at as being someone who has only studied Physics to GCSE level and self-taught myself the rest of the things I know, I’ll be honest I found it too complex to fully understand in the way it was presented. It seems in order to understand what is discussed you need foundational knowledge of physics and without this everything just seemed a bit too overwhelming. Terminology was used often to describe other more complex concepts with the assumption that the reader understood it and without this the more complex concept was unattainable. The diagrams contained no keys to explain what all the notations meant and there was not really any explanation of the accompanying mathematical calculations to support the discussion. This made it difficult to understand when in actuality with the right explanation it is likely quite simple. "
254,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2648205-white,5,"This is perhaps one of the best science books I have read and I've read tons of them. The whole point of Schrodinger's cat is to put the misinterpretation of quantum physics to shame. Of course the paradox is impossible and that is the point. Still, it didn't stop the new age fanatics from their mystical thinking. They took the paradox literally and formed a cult from the impossible. I respect the author because he put perspective on the ridiculousness of quantum mechanics as experienced by our limited senses. Gribbin admits that there is another factor which we are unaware of; a factor that would take us away from the nonsense and tie the macro and micro worlds together into one connection. Still accepting the scientific experience of quantum physics, Gribbin keeps reality in sight by focusing on the inevitable; that we have not learned the entire story. Flipping in and out of realities according to consciousness and observation is a fairy tale. Schrodinger's Cat displays that truth with fervor.I love this book...immensely. "
255,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17435739-greg,5,"I have read several books on quantum physics and this one is by far the most accessible to the non-PhD audience. You still need some basic background in engineering or physical science, but Mr. Gribbin takes it from there in a very natural and logical progression from early atomic theory to QED. Critically, this book presents the best explanation of the famous ""double slit"" experiment - not only for the experimental set up and result, but also for the scientific and philosophical consequences.On the scientific side, it is persuasive and compelling. On the philosophical side it is troubling, if not terrifying as Niels Bohr insists it should be. Written in the 80's, it is amazing how well the presentations in this book have aged. Even advanced topics like Einstein's ghostly action at a distance are covered quite well. Other excellent explanations are provided for complicated topics such as gauge theory, strong and weak nuclear forces, Heisenberg uncertainty pairs, Feynman diagrams and much more. This book was very hard to put down despite the complex subject matter."

Besides, the concepts in the book are mind-blowing enough.Gribbin takes the reader on a guided tour of the history of sub-atomic physics, with a brief biography of all the major players along the way.

268,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15981563-alteredego,4,"The title of this book probably highlights its greatest weakness. Updated Edition. This is a history/explanation of quantum physics written in the mid 1980s with the subsequent 30+ years tacked on at the end. There are more recent works which form a more coherent whole, for example Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw's Quantum Universe.The other thing to say is that John Gribbin sets out to do something virtually impossible. Given that the most famous quantum physicist if the mid 20th century, Richard Feynman said ""If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics"", to write a popular science book on the subject is optimistic to say the least.Any writer seeking to make the subject accessible to the lay reader must travel along the border between explanatory and comprehensibility. To put it another way, by providing a full explanation, s/he run the risk if tunnelling through the border into the region where the reader is lost and confused. For me Gribbin is a little over conservative, not providing enough explanation. For example, while describing one of the early signs of the need for quantum mechanics, the ""black body problem"" he describes what the problem was - that classical physics predicted an infinite amount of energy - but not why classical physics made this prediction. Linked to this , the early chapters are more about the people involved than the developing theory. That it is a very valid story to tell, but Gribbin almost sits in an indeterminate state between the people and the physics. If you want to read the story through the people, could I recommend Manjit Kumar's excellent Quantum: Einstein, Bohr .....While I have some criticisms of this book, overall it remains an excellent introduction to an incomprehensible subject. While referring to Schrodinger's cat makes for an arresting title, Gribbin seems to agree with another of Feynman's assertions that the double slit experiment is the absolute heart of quantum physics.Having, in previous readings on quantum physics, been troubled by the use of classical terms (e.g. spin"" ) to label features of the quantum realm, I was rather taken by Gribbin's suggestion that use of the language of Carroll's Jabberwocky would be equally valid.This book also gives one of the clearest explanations of the differences between the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and the many worlds version. In an incredibly simplistic nutshell, the former suggests that the universe sits on a sea of probability waves which collapse to certainty when observed, while the latter postulates that the universe splits every time a quantum ""decision"" is taken.The end of the book, which contains sections referring to developments since the mid-80s, is both tantalising and returns to the main weakness. I wanted to know more about quantum computing, or about why the apparent study of the massive, cosmology, can be viewed as the forefront of the study of the subatomic quantum domain.To finish, if you read this book, you should be able to follow this marvellous joke.Schrodinger and Heisenberg are stopped by a traffic cop.Police Officer: Do you know how fast you were travelling sir?Heisenberg: No, officerPO: 90 mph, sirH: Great, now we're lostPO: and did you know you have a dead cat in the bootSchrodinger: We do now."

I wish I had Gribbin as a teacher in that room to explain that mystical, elusive subject known as “science.”Gribbin takes a historical approach, guiding us through quantum physics as it developed into a field. This approach is useful as it highlights not only the triumphs of scientific breakthrough, but also opposing schools of thought. For example, the discovery of atoms versus Aristotle’s four elements. He intends  In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat  to be a helpful guide for the layman, to make science clear and dispel myths to sort the science-fact from the science-fiction. I apologise for marking the pages with my  Doctor Who  bookmark.It’s amazing to think that such basic information we know now, like how light diffracts, had to be discovered by expert, hardworking scientists, some of whom faced ridicule for their outlandish-appearing theories.This book is readable and Gribbin explains science very well, using simple, everyday-world analogies and avoiding getting bogged down in jargon and abbreviations. I wouldn’t recommend reading it when tired or with a headache, because it does require a bit of focus for a layman like me, and it can’t be skimmed.However,  In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat  was written 35 years ago. I imagine it is now a bit out of date. For one, our TVs do not rely on cathode-ray tubes to produce a picture, as Gribbin suggests. Similarly, sodium-yellow street lamps are going out of fashion in favour of LEDs. Neutron microscopes, which Gribbin sees as a potential development in the field, have already been a reality for several years. I also believe the Many Worlds Interpretation has also gained more traction now than when  In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat  was published. Perhaps an updated version would not be amiss? More recent contributions to the field could also be covered, like Higgs-Boson.Read for: Hebban Challenge, Book #44 A Book from a Genre I Never Read "

I hoped to finally understand what quantum physics really IS, but just as the author got close, he choked, and came out on the other side, blithely assuming he’d explained it.

But when you try to look, in the same way, at the mechanics of atoms, the world turns magic. Observably, measurably, inconceivably magic. I’ll admit it, this book, or rather the topic it addresses, is mind-blowing. Gribbin starts with a history of the old physics that brought us to the uneasy precipice of the magic quantum world. This historical tour is comforting and well done. But when it comes to the juicy quantum stuff, while his descriptions were fascinating, I found them frequently lacking in detail and focussed too much on the broad interpretations and too little on the actual experiments and scientific detail. Whether I could understand this stuff is of course a matter of furious debate, but I would have liked to get the chance to give it a shot. It was all too dumbed down and as a result came across like a children’s storybook telling tales of a faraway place but never really taking us there. I suppose the reason I found the explanations lacking solid grounding was because I found Gribbin’s interpretations of quantum physics ludicrous. Gribbin subscribes to the “MWI”, or many worlds interpretation of quantum conundrums, which is the belief that a (supposedly) infinite number of universes just like ours exist and every single time you do anything important, like say pick your nose, you cause the universe you live in to split into two. One where you picked your nose and the other where you didn’t. Like this one, all of the interpretations mentioned by Gribbin were so fanatically anthropocentric that I wished I would split into a universe where he didn’t exist. To think of hundreds of billions of separate universes in which Gribbin pats himself on the back for missing the point is nauseating. Instead of grandly stating as Everett did that every idiotic little action made by human beings splits the universe in two, is it not a more tenable interpretation of Schrodinger’s cat and the Aspect experiment to lay the blame not in the universe but in our faculties of perception?

People still equate the philosophy of science to the philosophy of Newtonian shot-puts. Atheism is still seen as an empty, cold, predictable worldview. Quantum mechanics is predictable, yes, but only when you assume that the world is magic beyond our comprehension. Why has some kind of “mystical atheism” not become the mainstream religion? Why hasn’t the magic world that quantum physics exposes been integrated into mainstream interpretations of reality even, maybe, a little bit? I guess it’s because (a) people are outrageously stupid, and (b) religion really has hijacked the entire debate except for a few Sci-Fi writers, who inadvertently act in support of religion by taking the quantum debate into the world of fiction. Anyway I’m glad I read Gribbin’s excellent book and I hope many others do too!"

We also learn that ""'spin'...is nothing like the behavior of a child's spinning top, or the rotation of the earth on its axis as it orbits around the sun,"" but that leaves the question of what, then, is spin? On a positive note, Gribbin does a good job describing electron jumping according to fixed quantum rules.  "
281,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49285862-saswati,5,"I read this book. I did not read this book. I am uncertain if I should read this book. I am trying to be certain about reading this book again. In a nutshell (that is, if it exists), I need to take some time off to find perspective in life. Especially the one I am observing right now. "
282,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7381993-katia-n,5,"It was the first popular book about quantum physics I've read and I think I was lucky to start with it. As after I've read two more books and they both are much less aspirational for different reasons. This book gives very good overview of the theory and the history of the subject presenting all key personalities and milestones of its development.Overall, probably not unexpectedly, it changes your perception of a huge variety of reality aspects. The most striking for me was thought about the history: ""In this delayed choice experiment something we do now has an irretrievable influence on what we can say about the past. History at least for one photon depends upon how we choose to make a measurement… Philosophers have long pondered the fact that history has no meaning - the past has no existence - except in the way it is recorded in the present."" I think it has become even more relevant in our media savvy days when wars are played and won more on screen than at the actual battles fields. It feels surreal to find the natural phenomenon facilitating such an interpretation of the social reality.Also it was interesting finally to find out what stands behind the overused metaphor of Schrodinger's cat:-)For me now it has become apparent that time travel, teleportation, antimatter and multiple realities are well established phenomena of physics, not of unhealthy imagination.My only gentle complain - I wish it would be a little bit more maths in there. I understand it might spook some audience, but I am sure it might be appreciated by the others. Heisenberg, the developer of the uncertainly principle, said: ""At first, I was deeply alarmed. I had the feeling that, through the surface of atomic phenomena, I was looking at a strangely beautiful interior, and felt almost giddy at the thought that i now had to probe this wealth of mathematical structures nature had so generally spread out before me."" I think this book has opened for me a tiny whole into the world he is talking about."
283,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12856123-sam,2,"I was a little bit disappointed by this book as it’s more a tour through history of all the developments in physics rather than a description of simply the theories which is what I was expecting. It’s a lot about the scientists and who won a Nobel Prize rather than simply this is the accepted theory of this or that. It began with the discussion of light being both waves and particles and the double slit experiment, which I was familiar with from other books I had read and documentaries I had watched and so didn’t really learn anything new. I enjoyed learning about Bohr’s atom and the inaccurate representations of it in most science textbooks and how LEDs work due to superconductors and diodes. Then it got really complicated and I found myself losing interest. I wonder who this book is aimed at as being someone who has only studied Physics to GCSE level and self-taught myself the rest of the things I know, I’ll be honest I found it too complex to fully understand in the way it was presented. It seems in order to understand what is discussed you need foundational knowledge of physics and without this everything just seemed a bit too overwhelming. Terminology was used often to describe other more complex concepts with the assumption that the reader understood it and without this the more complex concept was unattainable. The diagrams contained no keys to explain what all the notations meant and there was not really any explanation of the accompanying mathematical calculations to support the discussion. This made it difficult to understand when in actuality with the right explanation it is likely quite simple. "
284,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2648205-white,5,"This is perhaps one of the best science books I have read and I've read tons of them. The whole point of Schrodinger's cat is to put the misinterpretation of quantum physics to shame. Of course the paradox is impossible and that is the point. Still, it didn't stop the new age fanatics from their mystical thinking. They took the paradox literally and formed a cult from the impossible. I respect the author because he put perspective on the ridiculousness of quantum mechanics as experienced by our limited senses. Gribbin admits that there is another factor which we are unaware of; a factor that would take us away from the nonsense and tie the macro and micro worlds together into one connection. Still accepting the scientific experience of quantum physics, Gribbin keeps reality in sight by focusing on the inevitable; that we have not learned the entire story. Flipping in and out of realities according to consciousness and observation is a fairy tale. Schrodinger's Cat displays that truth with fervor.I love this book...immensely. "
285,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17435739-greg,5,"I have read several books on quantum physics and this one is by far the most accessible to the non-PhD audience. You still need some basic background in engineering or physical science, but Mr. Gribbin takes it from there in a very natural and logical progression from early atomic theory to QED. Critically, this book presents the best explanation of the famous ""double slit"" experiment - not only for the experimental set up and result, but also for the scientific and philosophical consequences.On the scientific side, it is persuasive and compelling. On the philosophical side it is troubling, if not terrifying as Niels Bohr insists it should be. Written in the 80's, it is amazing how well the presentations in this book have aged. Even advanced topics like Einstein's ghostly action at a distance are covered quite well. Other excellent explanations are provided for complicated topics such as gauge theory, strong and weak nuclear forces, Heisenberg uncertainty pairs, Feynman diagrams and much more. This book was very hard to put down despite the complex subject matter."
286,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1391676-kate,4,"I was only on page 20 and had already had three put-down-the-book-in-order-to-exclaim-excitedly-if-incoherently-to-myself moments... note that the exclamations have been more along the lines of ""HOLY SHIT that is SO. EFFING. COOL."" than ""HOLY SHIT that is SO IMPENETRABLE!""Thus far, I'm enjoying the diagrammatic examination of Newtonian (a.k.a. Classical) physics... yes, you may point out now that we have yet to get to the Thermodynamics.... however.~The explanations are simplistic but not condescending, but the congenial, slightly metaphoric approach to physics is what I'm enjoying, considering that I'm very much in the ""laypeople"" category of ""Real Science For Laypeople"" genre to which Gribbin's book appears to belong. (I would put Dava Sobel's ""Longitude"" and Alan Hirschfeld's ""Parallax"" in this caregory as well.)So, in summation: always wanted to learn quantum mechanics? READ THIS BOOK -- IT'S FUN! :D"

We are talking about superposition and collapsing wave functions here, people. Anyway this is a book from the early 1980s, about quantum theory, written for the scientifically curious layperson. The author does include a little math - the sum of the squares is not the square of the sums - but nothing too complicated. Besides, the concepts in the book are mind-blowing enough.Gribbin takes the reader on a guided tour of the history of sub-atomic physics, with a brief biography of all the major players along the way. Then he describes the world that quantum theory helped to make, and make understandable: lasers, solid-state electronics, DNA, etc. Then he gets into the nitty gritty of the famous two-slot experiment, and quantum entanglement.This is a great book for discovering the world of quantum physics, find a copy and read it!"

I had to keep waking up and paging back to where I dropped off. Even so, I am fascinated by the picture he created of the world of the quantum. He espouses the many worlds theory, which for me makes the book not so much a math treatise as a philosophical study. Deep math and deep philosophy tend to intertwine. I am truly glad I read this book. Perhaps I'll go back and dig out the Stephen Hawking and Michio Kaku books I started but did not finish. I want to delve deeper into this subject."

298,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15981563-alteredego,4,"The title of this book probably highlights its greatest weakness. Updated Edition. This is a history/explanation of quantum physics written in the mid 1980s with the subsequent 30+ years tacked on at the end. There are more recent works which form a more coherent whole, for example Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw's Quantum Universe.The other thing to say is that John Gribbin sets out to do something virtually impossible. Given that the most famous quantum physicist if the mid 20th century, Richard Feynman said ""If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics"", to write a popular science book on the subject is optimistic to say the least.Any writer seeking to make the subject accessible to the lay reader must travel along the border between explanatory and comprehensibility. To put it another way, by providing a full explanation, s/he run the risk if tunnelling through the border into the region where the reader is lost and confused. For me Gribbin is a little over conservative, not providing enough explanation. For example, while describing one of the early signs of the need for quantum mechanics, the ""black body problem"" he describes what the problem was - that classical physics predicted an infinite amount of energy - but not why classical physics made this prediction. Linked to this , the early chapters are more about the people involved than the developing theory. That it is a very valid story to tell, but Gribbin almost sits in an indeterminate state between the people and the physics. If you want to read the story through the people, could I recommend Manjit Kumar's excellent Quantum: Einstein, Bohr .....While I have some criticisms of this book, overall it remains an excellent introduction to an incomprehensible subject. While referring to Schrodinger's cat makes for an arresting title, Gribbin seems to agree with another of Feynman's assertions that the double slit experiment is the absolute heart of quantum physics.Having, in previous readings on quantum physics, been troubled by the use of classical terms (e.g. spin"" ) to label features of the quantum realm, I was rather taken by Gribbin's suggestion that use of the language of Carroll's Jabberwocky would be equally valid.This book also gives one of the clearest explanations of the differences between the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and the many worlds version. In an incredibly simplistic nutshell, the former suggests that the universe sits on a sea of probability waves which collapse to certainty when observed, while the latter postulates that the universe splits every time a quantum ""decision"" is taken.The end of the book, which contains sections referring to developments since the mid-80s, is both tantalising and returns to the main weakness. I wanted to know more about quantum computing, or about why the apparent study of the massive, cosmology, can be viewed as the forefront of the study of the subatomic quantum domain.To finish, if you read this book, you should be able to follow this marvellous joke.Schrodinger and Heisenberg are stopped by a traffic cop.Police Officer: Do you know how fast you were travelling sir?Heisenberg: No, officerPO: 90 mph, sirH: Great, now we're lostPO: and did you know you have a dead cat in the bootSchrodinger: We do now."
299,0553341030,http://goodreads.com/user/show/55755404-fleur,4,"Picking up this book gives me flashbacks to secondary school science lessons, staring at a poster describing the natural states of matter, in a harshly lit classroom called Rutherford Lab which smelled of vinegar. I wish I had Gribbin as a teacher in that room to explain that mystical, elusive subject known as “science.”Gribbin takes a historical approach, guiding us through quantum physics as it developed into a field. This approach is useful as it highlights not only the triumphs of scientific breakthrough, but also opposing schools of thought. For example, the discovery of atoms versus Aristotle’s four elements. He intends  In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat  to be a helpful guide for the layman, to make science clear and dispel myths to sort the science-fact from the science-fiction. I apologise for marking the pages with my  Doctor Who  bookmark.It’s amazing to think that such basic information we know now, like how light diffracts, had to be discovered by expert, hardworking scientists, some of whom faced ridicule for their outlandish-appearing theories.This book is readable and Gribbin explains science very well, using simple, everyday-world analogies and avoiding getting bogged down in jargon and abbreviations. I wouldn’t recommend reading it when tired or with a headache, because it does require a bit of focus for a layman like me, and it can’t be skimmed.However,  In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat  was written 35 years ago. I imagine it is now a bit out of date. For one, our TVs do not rely on cathode-ray tubes to produce a picture, as Gribbin suggests. Similarly, sodium-yellow street lamps are going out of fashion in favour of LEDs. Neutron microscopes, which Gribbin sees as a potential development in the field, have already been a reality for several years. I also believe the Many Worlds Interpretation has also gained more traction now than when  In Search of Schrodinger’s Cat  was published. Perhaps an updated version would not be amiss? More recent contributions to the field could also be covered, like Higgs-Boson.Read for: Hebban Challenge, Book #44 A Book from a Genre I Never Read "
