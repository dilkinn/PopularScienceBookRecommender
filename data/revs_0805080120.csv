0,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/549698-nathan,5,"I admit it, I love language. Despite this, I've been astonishingly slow to pick up the overall history and shape of language. I've picked bits of the history of English (Celts, Germans, French, vowel shift) but never the overall picture of how languages change. I didn't even realize that, beyond ""we are lazy buggers and mangle words"", that it had been codified.Boy, was I wrong!As I read this book, I kept pausing to relate bits of what I'd learned to my kids. The author points to two great tectonic forces in language: contraction and metaphor. As we lazily pronounce words, they shrink because we favour the shorter versions. As we need new meanings (either for new concepts or simply because old meanings have lost rhetorical force) we create them from old words, using metaphor. These forces, erosion and construction, keep languages alive.Deutscher backs this up with oodles of evidence. The killer revelation for me is that erosion is PREDICTABLE. Holy shit! As languages emerged from their common indoeuropean ancestor, their consonants all decayed in similar ways. For example, 'p' becomes 'f'. So the relationship between ""Father"" and ""Pater"" is as between ""fish"" and ""pesce"", ""food"" and ""ped-"", ""first"" and ""premier"". Entire relationships between equivalent words in different languages became apparent to me within the space of one chapter.This rule is so solid that it predicted the existence of a new consonant in indoeuropean, the ""missing link"" between some equivalent words in modern languages. The story of how that was found is one of many ""holy crap!"" moments in this book. Oh, and who discovered that law of decaying consonants? One of the Brothers Grimm. Language is beautiful, it's alive, and it's fascinating. Read this book."
1,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15033381-laura,5,"I need to begin this review by stating emphatically what this book is not. Despite its somewhat misleading cover, it is not a scientific description of how language emerged in evolution, how grunting developed into speech. If that is what you are looking for, you will not find it here, as the author states there is no real evidence on which to determine that sequence of events. What this book is, however, is an utterly fascinating, well-grounded exploration of the basic principles which shape the course of language development, followed by a theoretical account of how language likely evolved from the basic ""man rock throw"" level to its current state, by applying those same principles. Using examples from various languages around the world at different stages throughout recorded history, the author presents a very logical and convincing explanation as to how languages have developed and changed through three simple principles: economy, expressiveness and analogy. Through these simple principles one can explain the emergence of case systems, word classes, and even complex grammatical structures; in fact all the elements which are present in language. I highly recommend this book to all fellow linguaphiles!"
2,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4957849-john-brown,5,"I can highly recommend it. I started (but did not finish) a PhD in Computational Linguistics, and was put off by the unnecessary complexity of Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar. Since then I have read a lot of linguistic books to try to understand the motivation for such complexity.Deutscher keeps things simple, whilst answering all sort of questions that had occurred to me concerning the evolution of languages. The level of treatment is just a bit deeper than Pinker's ""The Language Instinct"" and his ""Words and Rules"", but the book is just as enthralling.We learn why all the cases of Sanskrit and its descendent Latin arose, and why they then disappeared, and why they reappeared again in French verbs. We also learn how ""heute tag"", ""aujourd'hui"" and ""today"" all sprang from ""hodie"" which came from ""hoc die"".The book is pure Linguistics, with nothing on Neuroscience (see Dehaene) or psycholinguistics (for a Linguist who recognizes this psychological branch, see the two books by Jackendoff), or Phonetics. I had previously read 3 books on Phonetics and could think of lots of concrete explanations for processes Deutscher describes generically.The Psychologists all say ""the two-year old is a little covariance machine"". Deutscher has a terrific example regarding word morphology and ""threek"" as opposed to ""fork"".So Deutscher's book has got it all for me, with links into all these other branches of knowledge."
3,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2105211-jacqui,3,"Dr. Deutscher has done a scholarly, thorough discussion on the roots of language, but I believe he started too late in time. I'm of the persuasion that language involves more than the spoken word. I find body language (which proponents argue communicate half of what we speak), facial expressions (think FACS, FBI, microexpressions), movement to be as telling of a person's intentions as words. Sometimes more so. Yet, he argues language was born when we could prove it was born--""...for how can anyone presume to know what went on in prehistoric times without indulging in make-believe?"" ""...impressive range of theories circulating for how the first words emerged: from shouts and calls; from hand gestures and sign language; from the ability to imitate...The point is that as long as there is no evidence, all these scenarios remain 'just so' stories."" Or deductive reasoning. Something the modern brain excels at. This despite the fact that his cover includes the popular ape-man image.Still, he adds humor and a highly intelligent discussion I thoroughly enjoyed."
4,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27357295-eren-bu-lal-lar,5,"Brilliant. A strong reasoning combined with good research and a clear prose.Deutscher explains the historical development of languages based on four dynamics:i. Erosion. Every language has an innate tendency to distort the consonants, shorten the words, shed the suffixes, merge two or three words etc.ii. Creation. Then, for expressive purposes languages once again introduce new words before or after the shortened words, strengthening their meaning.iii. Metaphor. All our languages are graveyards of metaphors. Some metaphors are so dead that they can hide the fact that they were once alive and totally had different meanings. This is true even for the most seemingly irrelevant elements, the raw-materials of the language.iv. Order. A series of tendencies in the human cognition continuesly tries to bring an order to the language based on principles like Ceasar's Principle, which means that the ""order in which events are expressed in language mirrors the order in which they occur in reality.""His very good examples, interesting anecdotes and humour make the book a very good read indeed."
5,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1492258-jan,5,"By far the best tour of linguistics for the layman, as pertaining to the development of language. Many books which delve into this meaty topic provide a lot of cute examples of etymology, without a really coherent exposition of the processes that have shaped the structure of language, and how linguists uncovered them. Professor Deutscher does a lively job of bringing the general reader's attention to the tendencies that have shaped the development of language -- erosion, emphasis, and metaphor. A lesser popularizer of linguistics might again provide us with some whimsical just-so-stories of how certain words got that way (and indeed, Deutscher does it with an amiable sense of humor), but his true achievement is showing us how these forces may have made grammar the way it is (though skirting neurology and trying not to delve too unnecessarily into the story of ""generative grammar""), as well as giving a pleasant taste of the massive dose of inspiration that 19th-century European linguists required to arrive at these insights (I'm looking at you, Saussure).This brings us to the word ""evolutionary"" in the title. Having built the groundwork for understanding how sounds and sense might shift in our own sloppy present-day English, he presents an example of language structure that could only have been carefully planned out: the imposing edifice of Semitic verb structure, possessed of such elegance that it must have been handed down on stone tablets, right? Wrong. In any case, the arguments are sophisticated, but they follow along the same lines as less daunting aspects of our own familiar English. Meanwhile, the writing style ought to leave any lover of language feeling that they've just had a genial chat with a great conversationalist."
6,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2716255-andrew-breslin,3,"This started out as a strong 4-star book, possibly going up to a 5, but as I slogged through the details on fricatives and declension and glottal stops and the structure of Semitic verbs, it steadily declined and by the end I was tempted to give it a 2. Rather than any indication of inconsistent effort and presentation on behalf of its skilled author, I think this simply reflects the fact that linguistics is fascinating from a distance and dreadfully dull up close.I love etymology. I love tracing a word’s evolution over the course of centuries, and seeing how certain words are rooted in other words. Like how the word “lyrics” is actually derived from the word for that ancient stringed instrument, a “lyre.” Neat! You might think this sort of thing is what linguistics is all about, but you'd be wrong. No, linguists actually pay a lot more attention to things like the shape and position of the tongue in the mouth when forming specific sounds, and why some sounds tend to morph over time into different sounds, and how essentially arbitrary endings get attached to verbs and nouns and grammatical rules evolve and persist, adding complexity without utility. These things aren’t nearly as interesting up close, in exhaustive detail, as they are from a distance in an overview. As an analogy: I love architecture. I can appreciate the beauty of a finely crafted building and both the creative vision and structural engineering involved. But I’m not particularly interested in the specific minutiae on how to put up drywall and mix concrete. It’s still worth reading and gives some fascinating insights into how languages emerge and evolve. If you really want to learn all about how to mix that concrete, you’ll like it even more."
7,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1127870-simon-cleveland-phd,3,"A couple of days ago I finished reading 'The Unfolding of Language : An Evolutionary Tour of Mankind's Greatest Invention' by Guy Deutscher. Wow, it's exhausting just to say the name, imagine what it felt like to read the book. But, seriously the work is intellectually challenging and often provoked me to engage in thoughts on the ever changing state of human language. And yes, metaphors are the erodent of language (in case you were wondering). Many times I found myself reminiscing about the complexity of the ancestral expressions. By the way, anyone who thinks modern language is more intricate than say Latin or ancient Babylonian needs to pick up this book. Mr. Deutscher's analysis seemed logical enough to make me a believer that dead languages were a lot more eloquent than modern ones. But this is where interesting stops and tedious begins. I felt this book was geared toward students in linguistics as oppose to the average reader (my apologies to the author, but I'm a graduate in business). At times it seemed Mr. Deutscher couldn't make up his mind on what to include in the actual body of the book and what to leave in the Appendixes (and trust me, there is a lot that should've been left in the Appendixes). For example, consonances and grammatical rules of African languages did little to entice my eagerness to immerse myself in the constructs of language. Often I had to go back and reread some pages forcing myself to ascertain their usefulness and applicability in my daily life (unsuccessfully, if I may add). I expected the 'evolutionary tour' to include historical aspects of the human evolution, but...oh well. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend this book. Instead, for those readers interested in introductory material into the evolution of language (masterfully coupled with historical analysis) I recommend Genes, Peoples, and Languages by Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza. "
8,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4629416-betsy,3,"[22 Mar 2019]This is not a good book for reading on a kindle or a phone, or even a small tablet. The problem is that the text is strewn with examples that the text discusses. These examples, which are often in languages other than English, are actually graphics so they do not expand when the main text expands and they started out as really small text. Mostly they are unreadable. If you have a touch screen it helps because you can expand the graphic a little bit, but it's annoying to have to select it to move it to different window, then expand until it's readable. And scroll around to read the whole thing. That being said, I enjoyed this book for the most part. It's a short book, less than 300 pages, and is well written in an engaging, relaxed style. For the most part it is accessible to the lay reader, but probably only if you're a little knowledgeable about language and are very interested in how languages develop. The author does get into the weeds occasionally and sometimes seems to belabor a point that is obvious. However, as he explains, the reason such developments seem obvious is that we're used to our language containing those devices, but that doesn't explain how they came to be common. So, although I found myself occasionally glazing over, I faithfully read all of it (except the Appendices, which really get into the weeds). The general point is that languages have never been consciously designed by a human agency, even those that are very complex and rule based. This book explains how even the most complex language features develop naturally though usage because of a few human impulses: erosion (laziness), the needs for more expressiveness, and the need for order, all of which occur without conscious intent. It was interesting and I recommend it to languaphiles. It's not that you won't understand it if you're not especially interested in language, it's that you'd probably be rather bored."
9,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50962274-andre-correa,3,"I've learned a bunch of interesting things through this book, like how the forces of destruction and construction are continuously combined to shape language and the ubiquitous presence of metaphors all along. Another interesting aspect is the realization of mankind's inclination for doing more with less and the need for order reflected in the constant evolution of language. It's also worth noticing the highly complex framework of Semitic languages as well as how basic choices in the verb-object order can ultimately define the overall structure of an idiom (Turkish vs English).The book demonstrates very well how complex and dynamic the edifice of language is.With all that good stuff, however, I felt disengaged on the second half of the book and skipped some parts, due to the enormous amount of details devoted to certain topics and the author's desire to go to the bottom of some idea. I am pretty sure such aspects are very relevant to people closer to the realm, but it's too much information for someone simply ""touring"" through."
10,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1741894-karen,5,"This was a delightful and fascinating book. It's very readable and entertaining and I don't think that I will ever look at language quite the same way again. I wished, quite early on in the book, that I had read it(or had it to read) twenty years ago when I was teaching English in Japan. It made a lot of issues and problems that my students were facing much clearer to me, and if nothing else I wish I'd been able to explain to my students WHY English spelling is so screwy. The author doesn't try to tackle how words evolved; he starts with what he refers to as the ""Me Tarzan"" stage, and shows how simply and easily more complex grammar evolved from there. And his chapters on how and why grammar and language devolves, how case endings for nouns got lost, pronunciation slips, and words change from one syntactic category to another are also both very clear and really fascinating. "
11,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4239658-karen-chung,5,"This book in fact reflects many thoughts and ideas that I have had about language and language evolution over the years - but the author has actually developed them and presents them in a reader-friendly, even enjoyable form. I think this volume would be an excellent supplementary text for an introduction to linguistics course - and I may use it in this way next time I teach such a course. It was the most-often suggested book in the Bedtime Readings in Linguistics list that I updated for the LINGUIST list in 2015, and it receives my highest recommendation. "
12,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/90393527-orion-scattered,5,"Preface: I read this book as part of an English class assignment.It's made me seriously consider pursuing an MA Linguistics. As in before reading this book I was excitedly looking forward to graduating with my BA English next year, and now I'm literally looking at grad schools to apply to.If you've never read or learned about linguistics before (which I hadn't), this book will either bore you to tears or blow your mind. Deutscher absolutely gets into the nitty gritty of several elements, while self-admittedly totally glossing over others in order to keep the book laser focused - and he does so to tremendous effect. However, I have ended up with a list of nearly a dozen related topics that I want to find books about, so be warned, if this book does capture your attention it may suck you down a rabbit hole that you hadn't prepared yourself for! On the other hand, it's not going to hold your hand and simplify things like a Discovery Channel documentary or anything, so if you're not ready to put on your thinking cap and learn then you're going to have a bad time.Beyond the subject matter itself, Deutscher's writing style is a blast! I found myself *literally* laughing out loud *literally* every couple pages. He certainly has a way with words and maintains a wonderful tone throughout, so that it never feels like a lecture or anything like that. It's not like academic writing whatsoever. Though while it is very approachable in that regard, the subject matter is highly complicated so don't think it's a casual read. What it is is a refreshing take on the genre that doesn't compromise on information but is also somehow buckets and buckets of fun.Would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone with an interest in linguistics or the evolution of language in general. You don't need any background knowledge headed in except for an average/somewhat above average understanding of English grammar - high school or freshman English type stuff, nothing beyond that."
13,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4490121-balachander,4,"Fabulous. Though I did get tired around the 80% mark. This book is especially for those who feel that the quality of modern language (be it English or otherwise) is deteriorating and is poorer than in the past. There was never a golden period where people spoke and wrote perfectly simply because there is no ""pure"" language. Language has always morphed and mutated due to people's need for economy, expressiveness and analogy. (read the book, I don't want to get into the details here). I totally recommend this if you're curious about how something as complex as modern language can evolve, quite naturally, from some very primitive/simple beginnings."
14,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4155216-ovi-oprea,5,"The book is an overview of how language developed and how it changes through the ages. It is easy to read even for someone who has never read any linguistics books. The author is very playful with his subject. The vocabulary is very down-to-earth because all the complexities of linguistics are broken down into pieces of information that one can easily relate to because of everyday experience with language, while the reader is still informed about the major theories and the theoreticians of linguistics.The last chapter of the book is a very interesting experiment. Given a hypothetical basic vocabulary of our earliest ancestors and a proto-grammar, there is an attempt to reconstruct the paths along which language has become what it is today. It is a useful thought experiment that makes the reader become less intimidated by the huge complexity of language. "
15,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27367650-brian-cloutier,5,"The kind of 5 star book which makes me want to go back and knock down some of my past reads by a star or two.I'm a sucker for books which invoke systems and forces and tendencies, this book has all of those; it's fun to imagine the erosion of linguistics. He paints a great picture of how it's possible for a community to unconsciously build grand structures such as the latin case system or the semitic system of verb stems and, still unconsciously, grind them back down to nothing. This book is written for amateurs, I don't know much about linguistics and never felt lost. It goes out of it's way to avoid using terms like relative clauses unless it really needs to and when it does gives great definitions."
16,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30276417-nancy-mills,4,"Well worth reading. Probably the most in-depth book on linguistics that I have yet read, and occasionally challenging but always intriguing and entertaining.Gives a great answer to the question of why language seems to go from beautifully constructed to a big tangle of broken rules. Language is constantly eroding (going to becomes ""gonna"") but also constantly being added to. Nouns become verbs and verbs force themselves into nounship, words merge, people impose a template used on one word onto another (mouse-mice, louse-lice, house-hice?) and if you dig deep enough the most irritating irregularities usually wind up making sense."
17,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3771853-naomi,3,"This is a mostly excellent tour of basic ideas behind historical linguistics, introducing at its center the idea that languages simultaneously collapse phrases to be more economical and expand them to be more expresses. The book shows how even the most complex morphological and syntactic structures arise naturally from this process.The last chapter, which tied it all together to show how recursive syntax first arose, felt like it petered out after a very entertaining read. It's not fair, but the end dominated my impression of the book because for the last tenth or so I just wanted to be done already. Thus, only 3 stars."
18,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/599339-dmitry,5,"This book answers questions like how languages change over time, in particular, how do complex grammatical features come into being, how close languages diverge over time, and what are some of the laws that govern all these changes. It's an absolutely fascinating read, and a real eye opener, and what's very special about it is that it all sounds very much common sense - nothing is too complicated, the whole book almost is kind of obvious - the way Sherlock Holmes' insights are obvious to Dr. Watson in the hindsight. This is a sign of a book very well written."
19,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/867854-tresy,5,"A fantastic, funny, and insightful book drawing on a vast amount of material to answer the seemingly unanswerable question? How does language come to be and what makes it change? Not as overtly partisan as Steven Pinker (an innatist) , Deutcher opens up more avenues for exploration, and his wit is just as sparkling."
20,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69790406-cullen-mackenzie,5,"I have read and reread this book, and am constantly recommending it to anyone who had even the slightest interest in Linguistics. It is a magical journey into what makes languages. "
21,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/66538394-othman,5,"I got this book with the expectation that it would be about the evolution of language, i.e. the transformation from a no-language-equipped brain into a language-equipped brain, but it is about how languages mutate into some other languages, e.g. Indo-European => Germanic => English. I got misled by the cover. However, I find the ‘The Unfolding of Language’ really fascinating and remarkably entertaining. I was intrigued by how Deutscher was able to demystify technical concepts in a way that I don’t think a non-linguist would have trouble taking in.Presumably to captivate the attention of the reader, Deutscher starts off with some controversial, yet engaging, issues in the field of linguistics such as ‘innateness’–that we, the human species, have a biological endowment underlying our capacity to acquire language–and whether or not there was a language’s architect–what/who? Deutscher, then, takes up the notion that knowing a language is not just knowing its words; otherwise, the permutation of words in a sentence would not necessarily affect the meaning of the entire utterance. Thus, there is another significant ingredient to be added to the recipe: rules, whereby the knowledge of how to order words in a complex expression is also a determining factor in getting the meaning of the whole expression. Deutscher also points out that though languages are similar in complexity of rules, they vary in their linguistic idiosyncrasies, such as syntax, morphology … etc., and he illustrates this fact with some examples from a couple of different languages.Chapter 2 is where the author starts probing into what the book is mostly about–i.e. language change–and it seems like an introduction for the following chapters. Deutscher states “What could these motives [of transforming language] be? This is a rather more involved question, and doing justice to it will occupy us in the next few chapters” (p. 62). Typological and historical linguistic perspectives pervasively permeate chapter 2 and beyond. Deutscher discusses some gradual changes languages have undergone. For instance, ‘kerd => herd => heart’ indicates some phonological metamorphoses occurred during the process of the English’s development from Indo-European. Similarly, Chapter 4 highlights the impact of metaphors on extending the semantic component of lexicons; language users fill their lexical gaps with transmuting tangible concepts into intangible ones. For example, ‘back’ used to refer to only the body part, but its meaning has extended to include the spatial and temporal terms: ‘behind’ and ‘ago’, respectively. The discussion over the change from content to structure occupies chapter 5. The following chapter is Semitic-specific: Deutscher attempts at unraveling the patterns the conjugations of Semitic verbs follow. In the last chapter, Deutscher talks about what he considers to be the natural principles of language: collocation of words, sequentiality of events, economy of words, and hierarchy of arguments. Then, a sophisticated grammar system existed and shaped the aforementioned principles. He also touches upon some properties of language, such as grammatical categories and subordinate clauses, that transformed language to the complexly-structured language we have today."
22,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/892633-matthijs-krul,4,"Very readable popular introduction to language change. Unlike many such books, it doesn't just focus on sound change, but has at least as much discussion of grammaticalization. Unfortunately, for me the book was not as useful as I had hoped since much of it is at such a basic level that if you have any prior linguistics knowledge, you may find the first few chapters kinda frustrating (he elaborately explains what a case system is, etc). Also, presumably out of a desire to be accessible - or maybe his publisher made him do it? - Deutscher avoids using proper linguistics terminology as much as possible. If you're used to basic linguistics terms, however, this is more a hindrance than anything, as it often makes it difficult to figure out in a more precise way what he's actually talking about. Also, if one can use words like 'auxiliary verb', why not also 'derivation' or 'inflection'?One big upside is that this book contains the clearest discussion of the evolution of a (northern) Semitic triconsonantal root system I've ever seen. He makes explicit how it is not really a kind of template system but emerges through a combination of extensive derivation and extreme levelling, departing from some really very simple sound changes. He also gives some clear refresher ideas about how grammaticalization arises in the first place, at a very general level, which is also good to keep in mind. For my purposes (conlanging), these were the primary uses of the book. However, for people not already familiar with language change and the processes involved, there probably isn't a better book to be found. For all the popularization, it is actually remarkably thorough and not too shallow. "
23,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2157293-john-fredrickson,4,"This is an excellent book on the dynamics of language change. One hears forever about how language is experiencing decay in these times - this book looks into some of these symptoms of decay, and explains why this is a misreading of language change. The book uses English examples in abundance, but also delves into the sentence and word structures of wildly different languages, particular Semitic and Turkish, but also others.It is interesting to read examples of how language 'simplifies' over time - these examples are fairly easy to track and understand. What is somewhat more difficult to see and appreciate is that our (American) culture is making some verb form changes that make the language more irregular as well. The author documents cases of words and phrases that shift form and place in sentence structure in a variety of ways."
24,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39587412-enrique-ma-as,4,"If you are a linguistic aficionado, you have always been looking for the holy grail of the linguistics book. That imaginary unit whose existence is in question. That volume that formulates a unifying theory for the language development. Such a grueling task among the ocean of selection.I am not sure if The Unfolding of Language or any other book fall into this category, or is only our human impetus to categorize everything with the taxonomic persistence of a botanic. Regardless of whether this book achieves it or not, it makes a damn good job.Through the entire book, you can see how language evolves from proto variants into the versions that we can recognize today. Deutscher is able to extract some fascinating rules that apply to many language families in the world. We lazily shorten words and favor succinct terms. Our languages are all strongly based on the power of the metaphor, way more than we are able to consciously recognize. Through erosion and construction we create languages. And the direction languages are taking is predictable, and so was it for the last hundreds of years.The book is unfortunately mostly focused on Indo-European and Semitic languages, and I missed more focus on the Asian families. All-in-all, a book full of surprises for the language lover."

I'm still curious to read theories about how language first started, but this promised to be a treatise on linguistic analysis, with a chapter at the end that goes back in time only as far as the 'me Tarzan' stage."
26,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4511805-kit,0,Recommended by Heying & Weinstein 4/21/20 livestream.
27,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/197436-kenghis-khan,3,"Although it dealt, rather deftly, with a fascinating topic, Deutscher's book is too encumbered by a corny, smug sense of humor and weak writing throughout that makes this a hard book to recommend. What makes this review so frustrating to write is that Deutscher does so many things right. The idea of erosion and elaboration as the driving force of linguistic change is powerfully conveyed. His treatment of the evolution of the Semitic verb system is superb, and of all the accounts of Saussure's laryngeal hypothesis I have encountered, Deutscher's account is by far the most eloquent. The ""Me Tarzan"" metaphor of a proto-human language is brilliant. Although Deutscher's fundamentally academic style won't earn him 5 good-read stars in my estimation, his penache for effective metaphor, persistent use of colorful terminology, and obvious mastery of the topic should have rendered this book a solid 4-stars.Why won't this book meri those 4 stars? The emphasis of economy of pronunciation and an apparent ""innate urge"" to be ever more, well, poetic among human societies is unconvincing. There are examples, for instance as expounded on in Trask's ""Historical Linguistics"" of how the social and historical pressures on language change go beyond the merely essentially biological and psychological attributes Deutscher highlights. This made the presentation seem quite one-sided. And although I forgive Deutscher his decision to not include the Piraha controversy in his discussion of recursion (I tend to sympathize with the view that the evidence against recursion is quite ambiguous), I felt that given how important this controversy has become it may have warranted a mention at least in his copious appendices. The fact that it was not clearly indicates, at least for me, the author's view on the matter, but this omission raises problems for what is a supposedly popularizing account.But all these are quibbles on some level that shouldn't detract from the rather solid scholarship presented here. Instead, I found reading this book rather frustrating. Frankly, this book had so much potential, and it is my anger at its clumsy presentation that gives it a 3-star review. The ""Bakunian Linguistics"" interview/PBS/BBC documentary whatever was obnoxious, and the fact that it warranted an appendix suggests the editor probably saw a red flag in this. Moreover, Deutscher emphasizes how important variation in language is in guiding language evolution, but entirely neglects socio-linguistics. This is like saying variation is the raw material of natural selection in evolutionary biology, but does not discuss selection operating on that variation. Ultimately, I found this the biggest disappointment, and frankly I think there are better introductions to historical linguistics for the lay reader out there."
28,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32957811-malachy,4,"It's the first time I've picked up a book on linguistic history, and I have simply had my mind blown. As someone who always had a nagging feeling that languages must have somehow developed their complexity - in part - due to a few bright ones sitting down and writing up some rules, you get insights into the development of language that demonstrate that this simply isn't necessary for the development of language into the set of complex structures and rules that we observe today. The chapter devoted to the three-consonant templates that are used as a model for the wide range of cases used in Arabic is itself worth the cover price. So, the upside is that you learn something of the basics on what I suppose are the major tenets of language development and evolution. And you begin to appreciate the real detective work that went into making some of these discoveries. The downside is that the book goes into some detail (although this mainly in the appendices) that risks making the subject a bit tedious (as it did for me). But I will admit that this, along with Daniel Kahnman's Thinking Fast And Slow, has opened up a new horizon in terms of my personal perspective on human nature. Read it although, beware, it will require some effort (and it will probably be of interest more to language-leaning types). "
29,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38866331-cole-simmons,4,"Because written records don't start until a couple thousand years ago, language is notoriously hard to study. We frankly don't know how much of it evolved. To compensate for this, Deutscher looks at modern clues: if we can assume that the forces that change language today are the same as those that have done so throughout history, we can recreate the steps through which language has changed.As a child, he imaged a grand Roman counsel deciding on the wildly complex Latin declensions (nouns, pronouns, or adjectives with the endings changed to reflect grammatical case and gender). A search for the true cause of evolution initiated a lifelong study of linguistics that led to him achieving a Ph.D in Linguistics at the University of Cambridge.The obvious explanations for the change of language today are technology and culture. But that doesn't account for the massive changes that every language on Earth underwent between 1000-2000 C.E., even the ones that had no contact with the outside world. The forces of change are the corollary of a tug of war between destruction and construction.DestructionThroughout time, great thinkers and writers have lamented their language as being past its ""Golden Age."" Even Cicero decried the Latin of his day as being on the downhill slide to barbarism. We see laziness (or, as Deutscher calls it, economy) morph words and cause irregularities that tear down an orderly system.In that regard, we have a bias. He points out that we can (and do) look at present irregularities in languages and trace them back to when they were part of a consistent system which has since been butchered, but have little inclination to do the reverse. If we see a verb in Latin with a logical and consistent set of case endings, we wouldn't think that it could be borne of an irregular system in an ancestor language.“Past irregularities are like footprints on a sand dune. Once a breeze has blown over them, there is no way of telling that they had ever been there.”Effort-saving measures are the primary driving force of destruction in language. Words that end in ""ed"" in English were formerly pronounced more like ""lov-ed"" than the present ""lovd"". Vowels are often either dropped or transformed into more easily pronounced variations.These philological discoveries are relatively new. Systematic relationships between relationships weren't really discovered until the early 1800s (Deutscher describes it like going from star-gazing to detailed astronomical research). Grimm's Law was the first detailed system of how sound change occurs. Not long after, Saussure predicted that Proto-Indo-European (the ancestor of most modern languages) had just one vowel, ""e"", that morphed into many in the daughter languages. Like discovering Neptune before we could see it, Saussure wasn't proven right until the 1900s when ancient Hittite cuneiform tablets were discovered.But if destruction by way of economy is such a prominent force, why haven't we resorted to communicating in monosyllabic grunts?ConstructionThe two forces of construction in language are expressiveness and analogy.Expressiveness is self-explanatory. When one word isn't sufficiently hyperbolic, we string them together in a redundant matter. Sometimes the phrase as a whole becomes commonplace.Analogy is our craving for order and regularity, turning previously irregular plural nouns like ""boek"" into ""books"". In early English, there was even a distinction between singular/plural in past tense verbs, ex: he “herde” but they “herden”.Metaphor, as a subset of analogy, lets us use words meant for concrete objects in the context of abstract notions, like using the parts of the body for spatial relations (""ahead of it"", ""at the foot of the bed""). Sometimes the original meaning is lost and only the metaphor prevails. ""Like a reef borne of dead coral."" However, our capacity for synchronic variation allows a word to exist in many forms/meanings at once and have the context be inferred by the situation/speaker.Some of these metaphors transition from one language to another when their speakers have contact with each other. Interestingly, that is not always the case. Using the phrase ""going to"" to mean not just an action, but a marker of future tense when paired with another verb (""going to go for a run""), happened in many languages around the world all at roughly the same time, even ones that had no contact with the outside world. Our capacity for metaphor is seemingly innate.Laziness breaks down and combines words, a desire for expressiveness leads us to string them together again, and analogy/metaphor gives existing words new meanings. It's all cyclical.The Unfolding of LanguageIn the last chapter, Deutscher walks through how language could have evolved from the so-called ""Me Tarzan"" stage (likely 40-100k years ago) to the present day.The basic building blocks are thing words, property words, and action words. Thing words are a subset of nouns, but many nouns nowadays represent abstract concepts rather than physical things. Property words describe the ""things"". They exist as a description (""the sharp stone"") and an assertion of truth (""the stone is sharp""). These words often are derived from objects that bear that property strongly (""red"" often comes from the word for ""blood"", ""green"" from ""leaf"", ""small"" from ""child"", etc.).A copula is a word like ""is"". In some languages, they never developed at all. Russians, for example, basically say ""stone sharp"".Quantifiers usually develop from simpler property words, like ""all"" from ""whole"". Then come plural markers that develop from either quantifiers or intrinsically plural words like ""people."" Definite articles (""the"") come from pointing words, and indefinite articles (""a"") from the word for ""one"".Nouns become verbs (""to cage""), and verbs become nouns (""explosion""). The former is easier / more frequent. The latter is called nominalization.Possession words become markers of obligation (""I have to do it"").But finally, subordination, the ability to subsume entire clauses with another, is the crown jewel of language. An example is ""My friend, ---who was late and still tired from the night before--- (subsumed), missed the bus"". It allows us to build infinitely complex sentences.Obviously, this is a vast oversimplification and for every rule, there is a counter. But many of these rules can describe how we from from ""Me Tarzan"" to Infinite Jest.A couple of fun facts:* About half of the world's languages are Object -> Verb (English, Spanish, French, etc.) and half are Verb -> Object (Arabic, Japanese, Turkish, etc.). Because this is the very foundation on top of which the rest of sentences are built, to a speaker of an OV language, a VO sentence is totally backwards (and vice versa).* Semitic languages (Hebrew, Arabic, Aramaic) have triads of consonants as the root of verbs, which are then put into templates of vowels (ex: ""_e_a_"") to indicate case."
30,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10984529-wishkid,5,"Ok this book was simply AMAZING. I feel that anyone, ANYONE, endeavoring to learn a new language should FIRSTLY read this book! It is essentially an eagle eye's view over language itself, and the author exposes plainly and very easily (to follow) how language originated, from what and why we talk the way we do. It might sound odd to you, but halfway through this book my entire foundations of my view and understanding of life and the mind were shaken. I just never contemplated linguists or language, and was only ever fascinated with the topic. Believe me, this book took none of the fascination away but just added to it! All while giving me an entirely different perspective on language, mankind, and communications in general both past present and future. Seriously, Deutscher took a whole lot of linguistic knowledge and presented it in this very book right here beautifully, plainly, and he weaves a web of pure understanding and insight that I simply never would have without reading first this book. After having read this thing, (at the moment I am not even finished, not quite) I feel literally 100 percent more confident in picking up another language, and I have this understanding about language all across the world and how it changes that I truly hold dear. 5/5 would bang!"

His main goal in writing this book is to show how complex linguistic features could have developed from the earliest, most primitive ""me Tarzan"" stages of language. Deutscher does a great job explaining how the world's language develop all their extravagant bells and whistles, and by the end of the book this explanation adds up to an argument against nativist theories put forth by the likes of Chomsky and Pinker. Deutscher also ends up demolishing a whole lot of prescriptivist notions about grammar, by illuminating the elegant, self-perpetuating cycle of destruction and creation that drives linguistic development. One can hardly mention the evolution of language without someone lamenting the current state of linguistic decay, but Deutscher puts this persistent myth to bed. Things get a little technical towards the end, and the layperson might find it a little complicated, but it's worth the effort to gain the insight and understanding that this book provides."

Nor is it about proto-history of language—although he does refer to proto-history of language as it can occasionally be reconstructed. This is about the nuts and bolts—the mechanical processes that change language over millennia. Deutcher leads his reader through the maze of linguistics to describe the many things that will change language. For his illustrations he draws not only from the Indo-European languages (English, French, German, Greek, Latin, etc.) but also from such Semitic languages (Afro-Asiatic) as Arabic and Hebrew and occasionaly Egyptian and Akkadian. He draws also from ancient Sumerian as well as modern Turkish. He goes into Nilo-Saharan and Yoruba in Africa as well as Australian Aborigine. All of these resources provide him with the illustrations of the variations and changes that can happen in language.I would not consider this an an easy read, but I learned a great deal."

This book makes up for it in spades (and hearts and clubs). If nothing else, this may be the first time I truly understand - not by guessing and instinct but know - terms like clauses and auxiliary's and prepositions mean. I knew how to use them before, but I didn't full comprehend - so if this book taught me nothing else, I have that. This book was, perhaps, a mistake to read during my night shifts as there were especially long passages involving semitic verb cases but I found it truly interesting. I suppose what I can glean from this book and all its lessons is that language doesn't have to be logical to make sense (or have a word for 'have' either, apparently). And that books on linguistics might be my in to that boring floor of non-fiction of the 4th floor of the library."

Some of it is speculation (because it must be, language being a lot older than writing), but it is plausible, and the author states where he's speculating rather than citing evidence.Lots of fun if you like that kind of thing. I do."

Not only does he know a lot about language; he's an expert in using it, too! The first half of the book is devoted to the history of languages and linguistic research, and it depicts the familiar landscape of continuous erosion, splitting, merging, change. The second half I found much more enlightening. There, the Author argues that the erosion of language is also its building force, and he illustrates it with many examples wrapped neatly around a short story about a girl, her father, and a mammoth, presented at various stages of language development. The fascinating topic and the Author's excellent writing make this book a very pleasant read."

Their evolution is a negotiation between economy and expressiveness. For example, laziness, especially in prononciation, causes erosion and elision; the craving for order reinforces even accidental patterns; the desire to heighten expressiveness is achieved through the insertion of extra words; and the desire to extend the reach of language is achieved through the use of metapphor from concrete domains to abstract ones.Deutscher is like an archaelogist, dusting away layers of detritus from modern language, uncovering traces of earlier generations of the language. Thus he adduces evidence for his theory.Convincing and fascinating."

It is about how language evolved. I'm in agreement with most of his argument for the manner in which language evolved, but the main reason I single out this academic work is because it is readable. So many academic works are not; and, in all fairness, could not be made so because of the arcane nature of their content. Deutscher, however, makes an effort to reach out, not just to fellow linguists, but to all those interested in language. A very good read."

I found it very insightful, mostly entertaining, although some parts were quite hard to understand for a non-linguist and non-english native reader (not used to all the english grammar terms). I definitely recommend to read it on paper. I read it on Kindle and the book is full of examples which need to be magnified, which is a hassle on the kindle and sometimes the magnification failed on smaller examples.

47,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36524004-nazrul-buang,4,"Linguistics has always been a topic I'm interested in and curious to learn about, and it's been some since I last read one about it, that being Steven Pinker's 'Sense of Style'. This book has been on my to-read shelf for some time, especially after hearing about it from some online article, so I decided it's finally time to get a copy of it from the library.Author Guy Deutscher is a linguistics historian specializing in ancient Semitic languages, who sets to address the key questions: where do languages come from, and how do they end up becoming the languages that they are now. He explores the vast and winding history of languages, with special focus on the Indo-European language family, and strives to provide clarity to the concept that basically makes us human.Linguistics first piqued my interest when I learned Japanese linguistics back during my university days. Like most other first-time learners of any form of linguistics, what captured my attention is how it changes the way I see language (primarily English) altogether, addressing the question of why one can know how to speak a language without understanding why. It's one of the topics that added meaning and perspective to my daily life, and to this day I continue to read up more on linguistics just to understand why certain languages work the way they work.Deutscher takes an academic approach to the world of linguistics, starting with the debatable topic of how they were 'invented' (or more accurately, 'formed'), and then gradually working up to how the structure of languages came to be, and so forth. His writing is fairly readable and digestible for the layman, where unlike some of Pinker's works, Deutscher's writing is more simple to understand. Furthermore, he gives simple examples to demonstrate and buttress his theoretical explanations, which makes his book feel like a well thought-out lecture addressing to people who don't share his expertise background.However, despite his attempts to write for the layman, his book (and perhaps linguistics in overall) eventually caters to those in the academia. Some chapters can be dry and prolix, such as topic on the change in vowel and pronunciation over time, although this is part of the bedrock of linguistics. Plus, readers must have a very firm grasp of English and selected European and Semitic languages, as it will come in handy when appreciating Deutscher's elaborations in their linguistics.'The Unfolding of Language' is an intellectual voyage in the seas of languages, spanning through time and space as it details the subtle changes what we fail to capture along the way. Language is one of human being's methods of communication that naturally undergoes evolution, and despite the protests of purists over the gradual degradation of language, it nevertheless abides by a timeless observation, that the only thing that is constant is change. The book is not for everyone; it would generally appeal to readers with vest interest in linguistics and keen interest in how languages came about. Whilst I find some parts too academic for my liking, I enjoyed reading it as a whole and learn a bit or two about a few languages I thought I already knew, but proven to be wrong in the end."
48,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41668866-lara-liz,3,"First off, I am not recommending this book to anyone who's, at least for now, anything other than an active student of Linguistics. If you're looking for a general interest book, I'd point you towards someone like David Crystal - while Guy Deutscher is a very clever linguistic theorist and a really key voice in the field, at least in my mind, this book seem to me like he decided what he was going to say, and then figured out a more complicated way to say it. That's academia for you, I guess, but this book felt particularly bad (I found Through the Language Glass, by the same author, much better).I did really like the chapter he chose to do as if it was a transcript from a much-harried young professor's attempts to convince a room full of English purists that 'decay' (you know ""young people don't even pronounce the ends of words anymore"" kind of stuff) can actually be a good thing. I remember most of the points in that chapter really well. The rest of it, with its dense style, was more of a struggle.To be honest, as glad as I am that I read this book, maybe I didn't really need to. Turns out my English Language teacher basically constructed 90% of his change syllabus based on its salient points, and while I'm glad I got to add to these with Deutscher's more in-depth examples, some of them over-complicated it.I'm aware I'm probably judging this book for adhering to academic style expectations. But I've never really understood why we should make ideas more complicated than they need to be just in the name of making them seem more prestigiously academic, to be honest."
49,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11040524-hannah,3,"Clearly written by someone who knows their stuff and vastly superior to that dire Bill Bryson book.The trouble with non-fiction is the author can't magically know what's obvious to me and what's quite technically heavy. I'd say this is not a book for someone with zero knowledge of linguistics but it's reasonably accessible.In discussing language change he says ""Consider again the change from p to f which seems so implausible today."" Implausible? Well I have some understanding of phonetics and of Welsh so it doesn't seem strange at all. Other language may change consonants over centuries but Welsh mutates from sentence to sentence. I'm surprised he doesn't refer to a Celtic language in this section as the analogy would be very helpful. Ble mae'r Cymraeg?The author also says ""Moreover, there is no system of communication today that is in the process of developing its first articulate words, so there are no parallells from the present to go on."" My question is what about sign languages? Can watching sign languages develop help us to learn about the evolution of language?One analogy is that languages are like traffic jams. People don't intend to create a traffic jam but their cumulative actions create one.His point about ""order-craving minds"" makes sense. ""If there is any element of 'invention' in language, it is surely the mind's craving for order - the instinctive difficulty to accept that so much is just random, arbitrary and coincidental."""
50,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29089487-alex-telfar,4,"The book was quite interesting, but, it left me full of speculation and hungry for evidence. Guy tries to argue that there cannot be evidence for many of the claims due to the our partial view of history, but I think he discounts (or is unaware of) how evidence can be provided by formal proof and numerical simulation. How does language evolve? According to Guy; energy saving shortcuts, decay of meaning, abstraction, the order-craving mind each interact and push and pull or words and structure to give what we see.There is also a level more of explanation and rigor required to make his argument truly interesting. Cool, we know it did happen (as can be seen from the history books), but why did it happen? Guy puts forward some nice candidate hypotheses, but does little to prove them. The main thing I would like you know is whether the four proposed mutagens are sufficient to build the languages we see, given the resources available (number of people and time) and which mutagens are necessary.Most of all, I am interested in what our languages imply about the structure of our brains, what problems those structures are solving and how we have adapted to be (sub) optimal.See my notes here."

This is closely related to the question of whether (for example) Indo-European languages are in long-term decay and losing complexity as many 19th century linguists thought. It also raises the question of whether there were ""complexity forming"" conditions in the past that are no longer around, something Deutscher is at pains to refute. I am not a linguist, but know enough about it to have wondered about this particular question for some years. It's reassuring to hear that the whole academic discipline wrestled with it for a century or so.One good thing about this focus is that it manages to give a good balance of exotic and more familiar examples (eg. English or French historical changes) without being ""just"" a bunch of fun and novel facts and cool word stuff, which some history of English books seem to fall into. Nor does it spread itself too thin trying to speculate about really early formation of words or sounds, or try to get the reader to engage with formal grammars or too much of the phonetic alphabet.I certainly am not going to think of ""gonna"" (one of his key English examples) in the same way again. I'm not sure that I'll miss the passive-reflexive form of ""to snog"", though."

""The Unfolding of Language"" started out as a fascinating story of the origins of language and the principles that have been driving its evolution. How and why words change, become shorter or longer, change vowels and consonants, shed one meaning to assume another - the first part of the book was captivating, and I was going to give it a firm five star rating.However, somewhere in the middle Mr. Deutscher lost me. Was it that the inner workings of linguistics were too much to hold my attention for so many pages or that it's difficult to get immersed in the nuances of Hebrew grammar without actually speaking the language, I couldn't say. But I had to read diagonally or altogether skip the most challenging paragraphs in the second half of the book (unfortunately!), which left me with an impression that the presentation of the material was rather uneven. Some of it was good for a layman, but some was definitely fit for trained linguists or people with rather professional knowledge of the subject. I am also not sure I understood the exact logic behind dividing the information between the body and the appendixes of the book, which also affected my overall impression. So, I think one may still find ""The Unfolding of Language"" enjoyable, albeit slow and loaded with too much detail here and there."

On the other side there are many books on that cognitive aspect already and less on how language continuously changes in detail. And while I was sometimes annoyed by the abundance of language-specific details, I also appreciate that Deutscher tries to remain scientific while making simplifying statements to a broad audience, by giving evidence from languages for his points and not making any points when there is no evidence. For instance he makes no claim about how even rudimentary language (what he calls the ""me Tarzan"" stage of language) emerged in the first place, since this is pure speculation.Deutscher also did I fantastic job at continuously checking in with the reader that they still know what he is trying to argue for and where this argument fits into the bigger picture (in the manner: ""now of I've shown X but bear in mind that we initially tried to prove Y..."")This book has taught me more on language than my whole Bachelor's in Computational Linguistics!

The triad of economy, expressiveness and analogy is a great way for describing the cognitive machinery that is continuously altering language in certain ways. I will definitely have to re-read it, since one could a lot more out of this from a second reading. Especially the appendices. Also, the hall-mark of a good expository book is that it makes the reader see certain things with more sagacity. Prior to this, 'The Secret Language of Trees' gave me a new perspective of forests and trees and how there's so much more happening behind the curtains. Now, this book has made me keenly aware of the differences in the languages I know and how those differences could have manifested themselves through the ages via the action of order-seeking minds of human-beings.This is a solid 5-star book."

Guy Deutscher thankfully has an overarching premise where he proposes that languages are fluid for three reasons. For economy, which is why words and phrases are eroded for saving time and convenience, for expressiveness, which is why languages are laden with metaphors, and analogy, for understanding intentions using comparison. I found the p to f consonant shift in Germanic languages as opposed to Romance languages interesting, though I wish he had shed more light on linguistic families other than the Indo Aryan and Semitic ones, which he uses mostly for demonstrating grammatical similarities. de Troy's part is way too long to hold anyone's interest, though. Oh, and I found the Caesar joke funny. Reading this book requires a lot of patience on the part of the reader and more than an average interest in linguistics. If you have that, you just might find this to your liking. "
56,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,4,"I found this book particularly interesting because it continues past the point where other books are content to stop. I’ve read several books on linguistics aimed at the general reader and they are usually happy to stop when they have proven that the language mavens are overblowing the “decline” of their native tongue. While Deutscher is happy to give the same historical perspective of writers decrying the state of their language for the past thousand years, he also seeks to prove that the same forces behind the “decline” of languages are what build the complex systems that linguists love to praise. Writing in a style that is both compelling and easy to follow, Deutscher takes the reader through the latest discoveries in linguistics and how they have allowed us to peer back almost to the beginning of all languages. This was the most enlightening book on the development and evolution of language that I’ve ever read."

I ponder about and often discuss with others as crazy as me about some obscure fine point concerning languages. I have spent a lot of time thinking about and discussing the complex interplay of language, thought, culture, etc. Given all this, I read The Unfolding of Language with great interest -- I almost devoured it. In this book, he author takes on the onerous task of tracing the history of language. He picks up examples from several languages to make a fairly plausible argument about how languages acquired such complexity starting from a basic set of sounds and words. He talks in detail about the role of “shortcuts” (saving breath to reduce effort) in creating new sounds and words; how metaphors and analogies brought in expressiveness to language beyond its early rudimentary, high functional purposes. The writing can seem dry and repetitive at some places. Also, there are some fairly technical details in this book, which are primarily of interest to those who are deeply into language, but you can safely skip those. It’s a highly entertaining and insightful read even otherwise. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it."
58,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5755899-michael,5,"An incredibly fascinating Indiana Jones adventure about language through time and cultures. Deutscher takes the reader on the tour in unique ways. In chapter 5 (The Forces of Creation) for example, he makes his argument through the story of a fictional academic speaker giving a talk at a conference. I found chapters 3, 4 and 5 to be my favorites along with appendices A, D, and E. To get the most out of this book it would be best to be familiar with different parts of language like word types, tenses, etc. To that end, I wish Deutscher had provided an appendix which acted as a primer or refresher on some of those. It's not strictly necessary to know a great deal about all that to get a lot out of this book, but certain chapters will go smoother with that knowledge.This was one of my favorite non-fiction books I've read so far, go read it!"
59,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4048835-rebecca,3,"Deutscher’s tone is engaging and he sets out with a very modest enterprise: to show how a complex language may in theory unfold. However, this still leaves the question: unfold from what? Since he cannot address the beginning state, it is more about historic change than an unveiling. He makes very pretty case studies, but I wonder how generalizable his theory is. A few times towards the final chapters, he also seems to suggest that all abstract concepts arose from concrete ones, which seems like a radical (and probably incorrect) view. With popular science, I always wonder what the counterarguments are, or if you can induce these changes computationally/experimentally (Pinker does a slightly better job on this front). Still, worth a read."
60,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10984529-wishkid,5,"Ok this book was simply AMAZING. I feel that anyone, ANYONE, endeavoring to learn a new language should FIRSTLY read this book! It is essentially an eagle eye's view over language itself, and the author exposes plainly and very easily (to follow) how language originated, from what and why we talk the way we do. It might sound odd to you, but halfway through this book my entire foundations of my view and understanding of life and the mind were shaken. I just never contemplated linguists or language, and was only ever fascinated with the topic. Believe me, this book took none of the fascination away but just added to it! All while giving me an entirely different perspective on language, mankind, and communications in general both past present and future. Seriously, Deutscher took a whole lot of linguistic knowledge and presented it in this very book right here beautifully, plainly, and he weaves a web of pure understanding and insight that I simply never would have without reading first this book. After having read this thing, (at the moment I am not even finished, not quite) I feel literally 100 percent more confident in picking up another language, and I have this understanding about language all across the world and how it changes that I truly hold dear. 5/5 would bang!"
61,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7521918-jesse-markus,5,"I like Guy Deutscher. I enjoyed his book Through the Language Glass, and this one was a fun read too. His main goal in writing this book is to show how complex linguistic features could have developed from the earliest, most primitive ""me Tarzan"" stages of language. Deutscher does a great job explaining how the world's language develop all their extravagant bells and whistles, and by the end of the book this explanation adds up to an argument against nativist theories put forth by the likes of Chomsky and Pinker. Deutscher also ends up demolishing a whole lot of prescriptivist notions about grammar, by illuminating the elegant, self-perpetuating cycle of destruction and creation that drives linguistic development. One can hardly mention the evolution of language without someone lamenting the current state of linguistic decay, but Deutscher puts this persistent myth to bed. Things get a little technical towards the end, and the layperson might find it a little complicated, but it's worth the effort to gain the insight and understanding that this book provides."

Nor is it about proto-history of language—although he does refer to proto-history of language as it can occasionally be reconstructed. This is about the nuts and bolts—the mechanical processes that change language over millennia. Deutcher leads his reader through the maze of linguistics to describe the many things that will change language. For his illustrations he draws not only from the Indo-European languages (English, French, German, Greek, Latin, etc.) but also from such Semitic languages (Afro-Asiatic) as Arabic and Hebrew and occasionaly Egyptian and Akkadian. He draws also from ancient Sumerian as well as modern Turkish. He goes into Nilo-Saharan and Yoruba in Africa as well as Australian Aborigine. All of these resources provide him with the illustrations of the variations and changes that can happen in language.I would not consider this an an easy read, but I learned a great deal."
63,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19501892-heather-wickett,4,"While I very much enjoyed Through the Language Glass, at times I would have preferred a bit more grammatical explanation. This book makes up for it in spades (and hearts and clubs). If nothing else, this may be the first time I truly understand - not by guessing and instinct but know - terms like clauses and auxiliary's and prepositions mean. I knew how to use them before, but I didn't full comprehend - so if this book taught me nothing else, I have that. This book was, perhaps, a mistake to read during my night shifts as there were especially long passages involving semitic verb cases but I found it truly interesting. I suppose what I can glean from this book and all its lessons is that language doesn't have to be logical to make sense (or have a word for 'have' either, apparently). And that books on linguistics might be my in to that boring floor of non-fiction of the 4th floor of the library."

Some of it is speculation (because it must be, language being a lot older than writing), but it is plausible, and the author states where he's speculating rather than citing evidence.Lots of fun if you like that kind of thing. I do."

It took me quite a long time to finish it, but the fact that I'm not a native english speaker was partly to blame... BUT, otherwise it's a GREAT book if you're interested in the topic! It really teaches the basic and worldwide principles that 'move' languages.Of course the book is oversimplified but without downgrading the quality of information it gives. At some points, the author proceeds in a greater depth to answer questions that I haven't even thought about before!It's writing style is really pleasant and yet academic, with many examples and even some jokes here and there!I highly suggest it if you're into linguistics!

Not only does he know a lot about language; he's an expert in using it, too! The first half of the book is devoted to the history of languages and linguistic research, and it depicts the familiar landscape of continuous erosion, splitting, merging, change. The second half I found much more enlightening. There, the Author argues that the erosion of language is also its building force, and he illustrates it with many examples wrapped neatly around a short story about a girl, her father, and a mammoth, presented at various stages of language development. The fascinating topic and the Author's excellent writing make this book a very pleasant read."

Their evolution is a negotiation between economy and expressiveness. For example, laziness, especially in prononciation, causes erosion and elision; the craving for order reinforces even accidental patterns; the desire to heighten expressiveness is achieved through the insertion of extra words; and the desire to extend the reach of language is achieved through the use of metapphor from concrete domains to abstract ones.Deutscher is like an archaelogist, dusting away layers of detritus from modern language, uncovering traces of earlier generations of the language. Thus he adduces evidence for his theory.Convincing and fascinating."

It is about how language evolved. I'm in agreement with most of his argument for the manner in which language evolved, but the main reason I single out this academic work is because it is readable. So many academic works are not; and, in all fairness, could not be made so because of the arcane nature of their content. Deutscher, however, makes an effort to reach out, not just to fellow linguists, but to all those interested in language. A very good read."

Helps understand how language evolves, how it could have developed from the ""Me Tarzan"" phase into modern language, and which forces have shaped it. I found it very insightful, mostly entertaining, although some parts were quite hard to understand for a non-linguist and non-english native reader (not used to all the english grammar terms). I definitely recommend to read it on paper. I read it on Kindle and the book is full of examples which need to be magnified, which is a hassle on the kindle and sometimes the magnification failed on smaller examples. Buy it on paper, and you'll have much easier reading."

It's a light and fluffy pop-sci approach to the history of language, which panders easy realizations (of *course* language is evolving -- it doesn't take three chapters to grab this concept) and straw-mans just-so theories in an attempt to sound more convincing (I really, really hope they are straw-men). In the third of the book I read, I did not find a single takeaway. If you're looking for an interesting book on language, look elsewhere."

For those who want to know the stories behind the device (ie language) we use today to manipulate, make promises, bind two people together or send nations to war, then this is for you.

77,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36524004-nazrul-buang,4,"Linguistics has always been a topic I'm interested in and curious to learn about, and it's been some since I last read one about it, that being Steven Pinker's 'Sense of Style'. This book has been on my to-read shelf for some time, especially after hearing about it from some online article, so I decided it's finally time to get a copy of it from the library.Author Guy Deutscher is a linguistics historian specializing in ancient Semitic languages, who sets to address the key questions: where do languages come from, and how do they end up becoming the languages that they are now. He explores the vast and winding history of languages, with special focus on the Indo-European language family, and strives to provide clarity to the concept that basically makes us human.Linguistics first piqued my interest when I learned Japanese linguistics back during my university days. Like most other first-time learners of any form of linguistics, what captured my attention is how it changes the way I see language (primarily English) altogether, addressing the question of why one can know how to speak a language without understanding why. It's one of the topics that added meaning and perspective to my daily life, and to this day I continue to read up more on linguistics just to understand why certain languages work the way they work.Deutscher takes an academic approach to the world of linguistics, starting with the debatable topic of how they were 'invented' (or more accurately, 'formed'), and then gradually working up to how the structure of languages came to be, and so forth. His writing is fairly readable and digestible for the layman, where unlike some of Pinker's works, Deutscher's writing is more simple to understand. Furthermore, he gives simple examples to demonstrate and buttress his theoretical explanations, which makes his book feel like a well thought-out lecture addressing to people who don't share his expertise background.However, despite his attempts to write for the layman, his book (and perhaps linguistics in overall) eventually caters to those in the academia. Some chapters can be dry and prolix, such as topic on the change in vowel and pronunciation over time, although this is part of the bedrock of linguistics. Plus, readers must have a very firm grasp of English and selected European and Semitic languages, as it will come in handy when appreciating Deutscher's elaborations in their linguistics.'The Unfolding of Language' is an intellectual voyage in the seas of languages, spanning through time and space as it details the subtle changes what we fail to capture along the way. Language is one of human being's methods of communication that naturally undergoes evolution, and despite the protests of purists over the gradual degradation of language, it nevertheless abides by a timeless observation, that the only thing that is constant is change. The book is not for everyone; it would generally appeal to readers with vest interest in linguistics and keen interest in how languages came about. Whilst I find some parts too academic for my liking, I enjoyed reading it as a whole and learn a bit or two about a few languages I thought I already knew, but proven to be wrong in the end."
78,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41668866-lara-liz,3,"First off, I am not recommending this book to anyone who's, at least for now, anything other than an active student of Linguistics. If you're looking for a general interest book, I'd point you towards someone like David Crystal - while Guy Deutscher is a very clever linguistic theorist and a really key voice in the field, at least in my mind, this book seem to me like he decided what he was going to say, and then figured out a more complicated way to say it. That's academia for you, I guess, but this book felt particularly bad (I found Through the Language Glass, by the same author, much better).I did really like the chapter he chose to do as if it was a transcript from a much-harried young professor's attempts to convince a room full of English purists that 'decay' (you know ""young people don't even pronounce the ends of words anymore"" kind of stuff) can actually be a good thing. I remember most of the points in that chapter really well. The rest of it, with its dense style, was more of a struggle.To be honest, as glad as I am that I read this book, maybe I didn't really need to. Turns out my English Language teacher basically constructed 90% of his change syllabus based on its salient points, and while I'm glad I got to add to these with Deutscher's more in-depth examples, some of them over-complicated it.I'm aware I'm probably judging this book for adhering to academic style expectations. But I've never really understood why we should make ideas more complicated than they need to be just in the name of making them seem more prestigiously academic, to be honest."
79,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11040524-hannah,3,"Clearly written by someone who knows their stuff and vastly superior to that dire Bill Bryson book.The trouble with non-fiction is the author can't magically know what's obvious to me and what's quite technically heavy. I'd say this is not a book for someone with zero knowledge of linguistics but it's reasonably accessible.In discussing language change he says ""Consider again the change from p to f which seems so implausible today."" Implausible? Well I have some understanding of phonetics and of Welsh so it doesn't seem strange at all. Other language may change consonants over centuries but Welsh mutates from sentence to sentence. I'm surprised he doesn't refer to a Celtic language in this section as the analogy would be very helpful. Ble mae'r Cymraeg?The author also says ""Moreover, there is no system of communication today that is in the process of developing its first articulate words, so there are no parallells from the present to go on."" My question is what about sign languages? Can watching sign languages develop help us to learn about the evolution of language?One analogy is that languages are like traffic jams. People don't intend to create a traffic jam but their cumulative actions create one.His point about ""order-craving minds"" makes sense. ""If there is any element of 'invention' in language, it is surely the mind's craving for order - the instinctive difficulty to accept that so much is just random, arbitrary and coincidental."""
80,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29089487-alex-telfar,4,"The book was quite interesting, but, it left me full of speculation and hungry for evidence. Guy tries to argue that there cannot be evidence for many of the claims due to the our partial view of history, but I think he discounts (or is unaware of) how evidence can be provided by formal proof and numerical simulation. How does language evolve? According to Guy; energy saving shortcuts, decay of meaning, abstraction, the order-craving mind each interact and push and pull or words and structure to give what we see.There is also a level more of explanation and rigor required to make his argument truly interesting. Cool, we know it did happen (as can be seen from the history books), but why did it happen? Guy puts forward some nice candidate hypotheses, but does little to prove them. The main thing I would like you know is whether the four proposed mutagens are sufficient to build the languages we see, given the resources available (number of people and time) and which mutagens are necessary.Most of all, I am interested in what our languages imply about the structure of our brains, what problems those structures are solving and how we have adapted to be (sub) optimal.See my notes here."
81,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50989441-gordon,5,"A really well written popular-linguistics book with a great sense of humour and a very clear focus: how did grammatical structure and complexity come into being? This is closely related to the question of whether (for example) Indo-European languages are in long-term decay and losing complexity as many 19th century linguists thought. It also raises the question of whether there were ""complexity forming"" conditions in the past that are no longer around, something Deutscher is at pains to refute. I am not a linguist, but know enough about it to have wondered about this particular question for some years. It's reassuring to hear that the whole academic discipline wrestled with it for a century or so.One good thing about this focus is that it manages to give a good balance of exotic and more familiar examples (eg. English or French historical changes) without being ""just"" a bunch of fun and novel facts and cool word stuff, which some history of English books seem to fall into. Nor does it spread itself too thin trying to speculate about really early formation of words or sounds, or try to get the reader to engage with formal grammars or too much of the phonetic alphabet.I certainly am not going to think of ""gonna"" (one of his key English examples) in the same way again. I'm not sure that I'll miss the passive-reflexive form of ""to snog"", though."

""The Unfolding of Language"" started out as a fascinating story of the origins of language and the principles that have been driving its evolution. How and why words change, become shorter or longer, change vowels and consonants, shed one meaning to assume another - the first part of the book was captivating, and I was going to give it a firm five star rating.However, somewhere in the middle Mr. Deutscher lost me. Was it that the inner workings of linguistics were too much to hold my attention for so many pages or that it's difficult to get immersed in the nuances of Hebrew grammar without actually speaking the language, I couldn't say. But I had to read diagonally or altogether skip the most challenging paragraphs in the second half of the book (unfortunately!), which left me with an impression that the presentation of the material was rather uneven. Some of it was good for a layman, but some was definitely fit for trained linguists or people with rather professional knowledge of the subject. I am also not sure I understood the exact logic behind dividing the information between the body and the appendixes of the book, which also affected my overall impression. So, I think one may still find ""The Unfolding of Language"" enjoyable, albeit slow and loaded with too much detail here and there."
83,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83243492-benno-krojer,4,"I wish the whole book was like the last chapter: Dealing with the big picture of language and its cognitive aspects instead of too many details of specific languages. On the other side there are many books on that cognitive aspect already and less on how language continuously changes in detail. And while I was sometimes annoyed by the abundance of language-specific details, I also appreciate that Deutscher tries to remain scientific while making simplifying statements to a broad audience, by giving evidence from languages for his points and not making any points when there is no evidence. For instance he makes no claim about how even rudimentary language (what he calls the ""me Tarzan"" stage of language) emerged in the first place, since this is pure speculation.Deutscher also did I fantastic job at continuously checking in with the reader that they still know what he is trying to argue for and where this argument fits into the bigger picture (in the manner: ""now of I've shown X but bear in mind that we initially tried to prove Y..."")This book has taught me more on language than my whole Bachelor's in Computational Linguistics! First, because my courses are mostly applied Machine Learning/Computer Science but also because it is simply a very good book from someone who knows how to explain his subject!"

The triad of economy, expressiveness and analogy is a great way for describing the cognitive machinery that is continuously altering language in certain ways. I will definitely have to re-read it, since one could a lot more out of this from a second reading. Especially the appendices. Also, the hall-mark of a good expository book is that it makes the reader see certain things with more sagacity. Prior to this, 'The Secret Language of Trees' gave me a new perspective of forests and trees and how there's so much more happening behind the curtains. Now, this book has made me keenly aware of the differences in the languages I know and how those differences could have manifested themselves through the ages via the action of order-seeking minds of human-beings.This is a solid 5-star book."

For economy, which is why words and phrases are eroded for saving time and convenience, for expressiveness, which is why languages are laden with metaphors, and analogy, for understanding intentions using comparison. I found the p to f consonant shift in Germanic languages as opposed to Romance languages interesting, though I wish he had shed more light on linguistic families other than the Indo Aryan and Semitic ones, which he uses mostly for demonstrating grammatical similarities. de Troy's part is way too long to hold anyone's interest, though.

While Deutscher is happy to give the same historical perspective of writers decrying the state of their language for the past thousand years, he also seeks to prove that the same forces behind the “decline” of languages are what build the complex systems that linguists love to praise.

In this book, he author takes on the onerous task of tracing the history of language. He picks up examples from several languages to make a fairly plausible argument about how languages acquired such complexity starting from a basic set of sounds and words. He talks in detail about the role of “shortcuts” (saving breath to reduce effort) in creating new sounds and words; how metaphors and analogies brought in expressiveness to language beyond its early rudimentary, high functional purposes. The writing can seem dry and repetitive at some places. Also, there are some fairly technical details in this book, which are primarily of interest to those who are deeply into language, but you can safely skip those. It’s a highly entertaining and insightful read even otherwise. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it."

In chapter 5 (The Forces of Creation) for example, he makes his argument through the story of a fictional academic speaker giving a talk at a conference. I found chapters 3, 4 and 5 to be my favorites along with appendices A, D, and E. To get the most out of this book it would be best to be familiar with different parts of language like word types, tenses, etc. To that end, I wish Deutscher had provided an appendix which acted as a primer or refresher on some of those. It's not strictly necessary to know a great deal about all that to get a lot out of this book, but certain chapters will go smoother with that knowledge.This was one of my favorite non-fiction books I've read so far, go read it!"

However, this still leaves the question: unfold from what? Since he cannot address the beginning state, it is more about historic change than an unveiling. He makes very pretty case studies, but I wonder how generalizable his theory is. A few times towards the final chapters, he also seems to suggest that all abstract concepts arose from concrete ones, which seems like a radical (and probably incorrect) view. With popular science, I always wonder what the counterarguments are, or if you can induce these changes computationally/experimentally (Pinker does a slightly better job on this front).

It is essentially an eagle eye's view over language itself, and the author exposes plainly and very easily (to follow) how language originated, from what and why we talk the way we do. It might sound odd to you, but halfway through this book my entire foundations of my view and understanding of life and the mind were shaken. I just never contemplated linguists or language, and was only ever fascinated with the topic. Believe me, this book took none of the fascination away but just added to it! All while giving me an entirely different perspective on language, mankind, and communications in general both past present and future.

After having read this thing, (at the moment I am not even finished, not quite) I feel literally 100 percent more confident in picking up another language, and I have this understanding about language all across the world and how it changes that I truly hold dear. 5/5 would bang!"

His main goal in writing this book is to show how complex linguistic features could have developed from the earliest, most primitive ""me Tarzan"" stages of language. Deutscher does a great job explaining how the world's language develop all their extravagant bells and whistles, and by the end of the book this explanation adds up to an argument against nativist theories put forth by the likes of Chomsky and Pinker. Deutscher also ends up demolishing a whole lot of prescriptivist notions about grammar, by illuminating the elegant, self-perpetuating cycle of destruction and creation that drives linguistic development. One can hardly mention the evolution of language without someone lamenting the current state of linguistic decay, but Deutscher puts this persistent myth to bed. Things get a little technical towards the end, and the layperson might find it a little complicated, but it's worth the effort to gain the insight and understanding that this book provides."

Nor is it about proto-history of language—although he does refer to proto-history of language as it can occasionally be reconstructed. This is about the nuts and bolts—the mechanical processes that change language over millennia. Deutcher leads his reader through the maze of linguistics to describe the many things that will change language. For his illustrations he draws not only from the Indo-European languages (English, French, German, Greek, Latin, etc.) but also from such Semitic languages (Afro-Asiatic) as Arabic and Hebrew and occasionaly Egyptian and Akkadian. He draws also from ancient Sumerian as well as modern Turkish. He goes into Nilo-Saharan and Yoruba in Africa as well as Australian Aborigine. All of these resources provide him with the illustrations of the variations and changes that can happen in language.I would not consider this an an easy read, but I learned a great deal."

This book makes up for it in spades (and hearts and clubs). If nothing else, this may be the first time I truly understand - not by guessing and instinct but know - terms like clauses and auxiliary's and prepositions mean. I knew how to use them before, but I didn't full comprehend - so if this book taught me nothing else, I have that. This book was, perhaps, a mistake to read during my night shifts as there were especially long passages involving semitic verb cases but I found it truly interesting. I suppose what I can glean from this book and all its lessons is that language doesn't have to be logical to make sense (or have a word for 'have' either, apparently). And that books on linguistics might be my in to that boring floor of non-fiction of the 4th floor of the library."

Some of it is speculation (because it must be, language being a lot older than writing), but it is plausible, and the author states where he's speculating rather than citing evidence.Lots of fun if you like that kind of thing. I do."

It really teaches the basic and worldwide principles that 'move' languages.Of course the book is oversimplified but without downgrading the quality of information it gives. At some points, the author proceeds in a greater depth to answer questions that I haven't even thought about before!It's writing style is really pleasant and yet academic, with many examples and even some jokes here and there!I highly suggest it if you're into linguistics!

Not only does he know a lot about language; he's an expert in using it, too! The first half of the book is devoted to the history of languages and linguistic research, and it depicts the familiar landscape of continuous erosion, splitting, merging, change. The second half I found much more enlightening. There, the Author argues that the erosion of language is also its building force, and he illustrates it with many examples wrapped neatly around a short story about a girl, her father, and a mammoth, presented at various stages of language development. The fascinating topic and the Author's excellent writing make this book a very pleasant read."
97,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5982358-derek-bridge,5,"This brilliant book uncovers the forces that shape modern languages. Their evolution is a negotiation between economy and expressiveness. For example, laziness, especially in prononciation, causes erosion and elision; the craving for order reinforces even accidental patterns; the desire to heighten expressiveness is achieved through the insertion of extra words; and the desire to extend the reach of language is achieved through the use of metapphor from concrete domains to abstract ones.Deutscher is like an archaelogist, dusting away layers of detritus from modern language, uncovering traces of earlier generations of the language. Thus he adduces evidence for his theory.Convincing and fascinating."

It is about how language evolved. I'm in agreement with most of his argument for the manner in which language evolved, but the main reason I single out this academic work is because it is readable. So many academic works are not; and, in all fairness, could not be made so because of the arcane nature of their content. Deutscher, however, makes an effort to reach out, not just to fellow linguists, but to all those interested in language. A very good read."

Helps understand how language evolves, how it could have developed from the ""Me Tarzan"" phase into modern language, and which forces have shaped it. I found it very insightful, mostly entertaining, although some parts were quite hard to understand for a non-linguist and non-english native reader (not used to all the english grammar terms). I definitely recommend to read it on paper. I read it on Kindle and the book is full of examples which need to be magnified, which is a hassle on the kindle and sometimes the magnification failed on smaller examples. Buy it on paper, and you'll have much easier reading."

107,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36524004-nazrul-buang,4,"Linguistics has always been a topic I'm interested in and curious to learn about, and it's been some since I last read one about it, that being Steven Pinker's 'Sense of Style'. This book has been on my to-read shelf for some time, especially after hearing about it from some online article, so I decided it's finally time to get a copy of it from the library.Author Guy Deutscher is a linguistics historian specializing in ancient Semitic languages, who sets to address the key questions: where do languages come from, and how do they end up becoming the languages that they are now. He explores the vast and winding history of languages, with special focus on the Indo-European language family, and strives to provide clarity to the concept that basically makes us human.Linguistics first piqued my interest when I learned Japanese linguistics back during my university days. Like most other first-time learners of any form of linguistics, what captured my attention is how it changes the way I see language (primarily English) altogether, addressing the question of why one can know how to speak a language without understanding why. It's one of the topics that added meaning and perspective to my daily life, and to this day I continue to read up more on linguistics just to understand why certain languages work the way they work.Deutscher takes an academic approach to the world of linguistics, starting with the debatable topic of how they were 'invented' (or more accurately, 'formed'), and then gradually working up to how the structure of languages came to be, and so forth. His writing is fairly readable and digestible for the layman, where unlike some of Pinker's works, Deutscher's writing is more simple to understand. Furthermore, he gives simple examples to demonstrate and buttress his theoretical explanations, which makes his book feel like a well thought-out lecture addressing to people who don't share his expertise background.However, despite his attempts to write for the layman, his book (and perhaps linguistics in overall) eventually caters to those in the academia. Some chapters can be dry and prolix, such as topic on the change in vowel and pronunciation over time, although this is part of the bedrock of linguistics. Plus, readers must have a very firm grasp of English and selected European and Semitic languages, as it will come in handy when appreciating Deutscher's elaborations in their linguistics.'The Unfolding of Language' is an intellectual voyage in the seas of languages, spanning through time and space as it details the subtle changes what we fail to capture along the way. Language is one of human being's methods of communication that naturally undergoes evolution, and despite the protests of purists over the gradual degradation of language, it nevertheless abides by a timeless observation, that the only thing that is constant is change. The book is not for everyone; it would generally appeal to readers with vest interest in linguistics and keen interest in how languages came about. Whilst I find some parts too academic for my liking, I enjoyed reading it as a whole and learn a bit or two about a few languages I thought I already knew, but proven to be wrong in the end."
108,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41668866-lara-liz,3,"First off, I am not recommending this book to anyone who's, at least for now, anything other than an active student of Linguistics. If you're looking for a general interest book, I'd point you towards someone like David Crystal - while Guy Deutscher is a very clever linguistic theorist and a really key voice in the field, at least in my mind, this book seem to me like he decided what he was going to say, and then figured out a more complicated way to say it. That's academia for you, I guess, but this book felt particularly bad (I found Through the Language Glass, by the same author, much better).I did really like the chapter he chose to do as if it was a transcript from a much-harried young professor's attempts to convince a room full of English purists that 'decay' (you know ""young people don't even pronounce the ends of words anymore"" kind of stuff) can actually be a good thing. I remember most of the points in that chapter really well. The rest of it, with its dense style, was more of a struggle.To be honest, as glad as I am that I read this book, maybe I didn't really need to. Turns out my English Language teacher basically constructed 90% of his change syllabus based on its salient points, and while I'm glad I got to add to these with Deutscher's more in-depth examples, some of them over-complicated it.I'm aware I'm probably judging this book for adhering to academic style expectations. But I've never really understood why we should make ideas more complicated than they need to be just in the name of making them seem more prestigiously academic, to be honest."
109,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11040524-hannah,3,"Clearly written by someone who knows their stuff and vastly superior to that dire Bill Bryson book.The trouble with non-fiction is the author can't magically know what's obvious to me and what's quite technically heavy. I'd say this is not a book for someone with zero knowledge of linguistics but it's reasonably accessible.In discussing language change he says ""Consider again the change from p to f which seems so implausible today."" Implausible? Well I have some understanding of phonetics and of Welsh so it doesn't seem strange at all. Other language may change consonants over centuries but Welsh mutates from sentence to sentence. I'm surprised he doesn't refer to a Celtic language in this section as the analogy would be very helpful. Ble mae'r Cymraeg?The author also says ""Moreover, there is no system of communication today that is in the process of developing its first articulate words, so there are no parallells from the present to go on."" My question is what about sign languages? Can watching sign languages develop help us to learn about the evolution of language?One analogy is that languages are like traffic jams. People don't intend to create a traffic jam but their cumulative actions create one.His point about ""order-craving minds"" makes sense. ""If there is any element of 'invention' in language, it is surely the mind's craving for order - the instinctive difficulty to accept that so much is just random, arbitrary and coincidental."""
110,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29089487-alex-telfar,4,"The book was quite interesting, but, it left me full of speculation and hungry for evidence. Guy tries to argue that there cannot be evidence for many of the claims due to the our partial view of history, but I think he discounts (or is unaware of) how evidence can be provided by formal proof and numerical simulation. How does language evolve? According to Guy; energy saving shortcuts, decay of meaning, abstraction, the order-craving mind each interact and push and pull or words and structure to give what we see.There is also a level more of explanation and rigor required to make his argument truly interesting. Cool, we know it did happen (as can be seen from the history books), but why did it happen? Guy puts forward some nice candidate hypotheses, but does little to prove them. The main thing I would like you know is whether the four proposed mutagens are sufficient to build the languages we see, given the resources available (number of people and time) and which mutagens are necessary.Most of all, I am interested in what our languages imply about the structure of our brains, what problems those structures are solving and how we have adapted to be (sub) optimal.See my notes here."
111,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50989441-gordon,5,"A really well written popular-linguistics book with a great sense of humour and a very clear focus: how did grammatical structure and complexity come into being? This is closely related to the question of whether (for example) Indo-European languages are in long-term decay and losing complexity as many 19th century linguists thought. It also raises the question of whether there were ""complexity forming"" conditions in the past that are no longer around, something Deutscher is at pains to refute. I am not a linguist, but know enough about it to have wondered about this particular question for some years. It's reassuring to hear that the whole academic discipline wrestled with it for a century or so.One good thing about this focus is that it manages to give a good balance of exotic and more familiar examples (eg. English or French historical changes) without being ""just"" a bunch of fun and novel facts and cool word stuff, which some history of English books seem to fall into. Nor does it spread itself too thin trying to speculate about really early formation of words or sounds, or try to get the reader to engage with formal grammars or too much of the phonetic alphabet.I certainly am not going to think of ""gonna"" (one of his key English examples) in the same way again. I'm not sure that I'll miss the passive-reflexive form of ""to snog"", though."
112,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29824032-rouzanna-sarkissian,4,"It is with mixed feelings that I gave this book four stars. ""The Unfolding of Language"" started out as a fascinating story of the origins of language and the principles that have been driving its evolution. How and why words change, become shorter or longer, change vowels and consonants, shed one meaning to assume another - the first part of the book was captivating, and I was going to give it a firm five star rating.However, somewhere in the middle Mr. Deutscher lost me. Was it that the inner workings of linguistics were too much to hold my attention for so many pages or that it's difficult to get immersed in the nuances of Hebrew grammar without actually speaking the language, I couldn't say. But I had to read diagonally or altogether skip the most challenging paragraphs in the second half of the book (unfortunately!), which left me with an impression that the presentation of the material was rather uneven. Some of it was good for a layman, but some was definitely fit for trained linguists or people with rather professional knowledge of the subject. I am also not sure I understood the exact logic behind dividing the information between the body and the appendixes of the book, which also affected my overall impression. So, I think one may still find ""The Unfolding of Language"" enjoyable, albeit slow and loaded with too much detail here and there."
113,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83243492-benno-krojer,4,"I wish the whole book was like the last chapter: Dealing with the big picture of language and its cognitive aspects instead of too many details of specific languages. On the other side there are many books on that cognitive aspect already and less on how language continuously changes in detail. And while I was sometimes annoyed by the abundance of language-specific details, I also appreciate that Deutscher tries to remain scientific while making simplifying statements to a broad audience, by giving evidence from languages for his points and not making any points when there is no evidence. For instance he makes no claim about how even rudimentary language (what he calls the ""me Tarzan"" stage of language) emerged in the first place, since this is pure speculation.Deutscher also did I fantastic job at continuously checking in with the reader that they still know what he is trying to argue for and where this argument fits into the bigger picture (in the manner: ""now of I've shown X but bear in mind that we initially tried to prove Y..."")This book has taught me more on language than my whole Bachelor's in Computational Linguistics! First, because my courses are mostly applied Machine Learning/Computer Science but also because it is simply a very good book from someone who knows how to explain his subject!"

The triad of economy, expressiveness and analogy is a great way for describing the cognitive machinery that is continuously altering language in certain ways. I will definitely have to re-read it, since one could a lot more out of this from a second reading. Especially the appendices. Also, the hall-mark of a good expository book is that it makes the reader see certain things with more sagacity. Prior to this, 'The Secret Language of Trees' gave me a new perspective of forests and trees and how there's so much more happening behind the curtains. Now, this book has made me keenly aware of the differences in the languages I know and how those differences could have manifested themselves through the ages via the action of order-seeking minds of human-beings.This is a solid 5-star book."
115,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82034260-nikhil,3,"For my first foray into linguistics, I think that it's fair to say that I learnt as much as I could. Guy Deutscher thankfully has an overarching premise where he proposes that languages are fluid for three reasons. For economy, which is why words and phrases are eroded for saving time and convenience, for expressiveness, which is why languages are laden with metaphors, and analogy, for understanding intentions using comparison. I found the p to f consonant shift in Germanic languages as opposed to Romance languages interesting, though I wish he had shed more light on linguistic families other than the Indo Aryan and Semitic ones, which he uses mostly for demonstrating grammatical similarities. de Troy's part is way too long to hold anyone's interest, though. Oh, and I found the Caesar joke funny. Reading this book requires a lot of patience on the part of the reader and more than an average interest in linguistics. If you have that, you just might find this to your liking. "
116,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,4,"I found this book particularly interesting because it continues past the point where other books are content to stop. I’ve read several books on linguistics aimed at the general reader and they are usually happy to stop when they have proven that the language mavens are overblowing the “decline” of their native tongue. While Deutscher is happy to give the same historical perspective of writers decrying the state of their language for the past thousand years, he also seeks to prove that the same forces behind the “decline” of languages are what build the complex systems that linguists love to praise. Writing in a style that is both compelling and easy to follow, Deutscher takes the reader through the latest discoveries in linguistics and how they have allowed us to peer back almost to the beginning of all languages. This was the most enlightening book on the development and evolution of language that I’ve ever read."

I have spent a lot of time thinking about and discussing the complex interplay of language, thought, culture, etc. Given all this, I read The Unfolding of Language with great interest -- I almost devoured it. In this book, he author takes on the onerous task of tracing the history of language. He picks up examples from several languages to make a fairly plausible argument about how languages acquired such complexity starting from a basic set of sounds and words. He talks in detail about the role of “shortcuts” (saving breath to reduce effort) in creating new sounds and words; how metaphors and analogies brought in expressiveness to language beyond its early rudimentary, high functional purposes. The writing can seem dry and repetitive at some places. Also, there are some fairly technical details in this book, which are primarily of interest to those who are deeply into language, but you can safely skip those. It’s a highly entertaining and insightful read even otherwise. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it."

After having read this thing, (at the moment I am not even finished, not quite) I feel literally 100 percent more confident in picking up another language, and I have this understanding about language all across the world and how it changes that I truly hold dear. 5/5 would bang!"

His main goal in writing this book is to show how complex linguistic features could have developed from the earliest, most primitive ""me Tarzan"" stages of language. Deutscher does a great job explaining how the world's language develop all their extravagant bells and whistles, and by the end of the book this explanation adds up to an argument against nativist theories put forth by the likes of Chomsky and Pinker. Deutscher also ends up demolishing a whole lot of prescriptivist notions about grammar, by illuminating the elegant, self-perpetuating cycle of destruction and creation that drives linguistic development. One can hardly mention the evolution of language without someone lamenting the current state of linguistic decay, but Deutscher puts this persistent myth to bed. Things get a little technical towards the end, and the layperson might find it a little complicated, but it's worth the effort to gain the insight and understanding that this book provides."

Deutcher leads his reader through the maze of linguistics to describe the many things that will change language. For his illustrations he draws not only from the Indo-European languages (English, French, German, Greek, Latin, etc.) but also from such Semitic languages (Afro-Asiatic) as Arabic and Hebrew and occasionaly Egyptian and Akkadian. He draws also from ancient Sumerian as well as modern Turkish. He goes into Nilo-Saharan and Yoruba in Africa as well as Australian Aborigine.

This book makes up for it in spades (and hearts and clubs). If nothing else, this may be the first time I truly understand - not by guessing and instinct but know - terms like clauses and auxiliary's and prepositions mean. I knew how to use them before, but I didn't full comprehend - so if this book taught me nothing else, I have that. This book was, perhaps, a mistake to read during my night shifts as there were especially long passages involving semitic verb cases but I found it truly interesting. I suppose what I can glean from this book and all its lessons is that language doesn't have to be logical to make sense (or have a word for 'have' either, apparently). And that books on linguistics might be my in to that boring floor of non-fiction of the 4th floor of the library."

Some of it is speculation (because it must be, language being a lot older than writing), but it is plausible, and the author states where he's speculating rather than citing evidence.Lots of fun if you like that kind of thing.

It really teaches the basic and worldwide principles that 'move' languages.Of course the book is oversimplified but without downgrading the quality of information it gives.

Not only does he know a lot about language; he's an expert in using it, too! The first half of the book is devoted to the history of languages and linguistic research, and it depicts the familiar landscape of continuous erosion, splitting, merging, change. The second half I found much more enlightening. There, the Author argues that the erosion of language is also its building force, and he illustrates it with many examples wrapped neatly around a short story about a girl, her father, and a mammoth, presented at various stages of language development. The fascinating topic and the Author's excellent writing make this book a very pleasant read."

Their evolution is a negotiation between economy and expressiveness. For example, laziness, especially in prononciation, causes erosion and elision; the craving for order reinforces even accidental patterns; the desire to heighten expressiveness is achieved through the insertion of extra words; and the desire to extend the reach of language is achieved through the use of metapphor from concrete domains to abstract ones.Deutscher is like an archaelogist, dusting away layers of detritus from modern language, uncovering traces of earlier generations of the language. Thus he adduces evidence for his theory.Convincing and fascinating."

It is about how language evolved. I'm in agreement with most of his argument for the manner in which language evolved, but the main reason I single out this academic work is because it is readable. So many academic works are not; and, in all fairness, could not be made so because of the arcane nature of their content. Deutscher, however, makes an effort to reach out, not just to fellow linguists, but to all those interested in language. A very good read."

I found it very insightful, mostly entertaining, although some parts were quite hard to understand for a non-linguist and non-english native reader (not used to all the english grammar terms). I definitely recommend to read it on paper. I read it on Kindle and the book is full of examples which need to be magnified, which is a hassle on the kindle and sometimes the magnification failed on smaller examples. Buy it on paper, and you'll have much easier reading."

In the third of the book I read, I did not find a single takeaway. If you're looking for an interesting book on language, look elsewhere."

137,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36524004-nazrul-buang,4,"Linguistics has always been a topic I'm interested in and curious to learn about, and it's been some since I last read one about it, that being Steven Pinker's 'Sense of Style'. This book has been on my to-read shelf for some time, especially after hearing about it from some online article, so I decided it's finally time to get a copy of it from the library.Author Guy Deutscher is a linguistics historian specializing in ancient Semitic languages, who sets to address the key questions: where do languages come from, and how do they end up becoming the languages that they are now. He explores the vast and winding history of languages, with special focus on the Indo-European language family, and strives to provide clarity to the concept that basically makes us human.Linguistics first piqued my interest when I learned Japanese linguistics back during my university days. Like most other first-time learners of any form of linguistics, what captured my attention is how it changes the way I see language (primarily English) altogether, addressing the question of why one can know how to speak a language without understanding why. It's one of the topics that added meaning and perspective to my daily life, and to this day I continue to read up more on linguistics just to understand why certain languages work the way they work.Deutscher takes an academic approach to the world of linguistics, starting with the debatable topic of how they were 'invented' (or more accurately, 'formed'), and then gradually working up to how the structure of languages came to be, and so forth. His writing is fairly readable and digestible for the layman, where unlike some of Pinker's works, Deutscher's writing is more simple to understand. Furthermore, he gives simple examples to demonstrate and buttress his theoretical explanations, which makes his book feel like a well thought-out lecture addressing to people who don't share his expertise background.However, despite his attempts to write for the layman, his book (and perhaps linguistics in overall) eventually caters to those in the academia. Some chapters can be dry and prolix, such as topic on the change in vowel and pronunciation over time, although this is part of the bedrock of linguistics. Plus, readers must have a very firm grasp of English and selected European and Semitic languages, as it will come in handy when appreciating Deutscher's elaborations in their linguistics.'The Unfolding of Language' is an intellectual voyage in the seas of languages, spanning through time and space as it details the subtle changes what we fail to capture along the way. Language is one of human being's methods of communication that naturally undergoes evolution, and despite the protests of purists over the gradual degradation of language, it nevertheless abides by a timeless observation, that the only thing that is constant is change. The book is not for everyone; it would generally appeal to readers with vest interest in linguistics and keen interest in how languages came about. Whilst I find some parts too academic for my liking, I enjoyed reading it as a whole and learn a bit or two about a few languages I thought I already knew, but proven to be wrong in the end."
138,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41668866-lara-liz,3,"First off, I am not recommending this book to anyone who's, at least for now, anything other than an active student of Linguistics. If you're looking for a general interest book, I'd point you towards someone like David Crystal - while Guy Deutscher is a very clever linguistic theorist and a really key voice in the field, at least in my mind, this book seem to me like he decided what he was going to say, and then figured out a more complicated way to say it. That's academia for you, I guess, but this book felt particularly bad (I found Through the Language Glass, by the same author, much better).I did really like the chapter he chose to do as if it was a transcript from a much-harried young professor's attempts to convince a room full of English purists that 'decay' (you know ""young people don't even pronounce the ends of words anymore"" kind of stuff) can actually be a good thing. I remember most of the points in that chapter really well. The rest of it, with its dense style, was more of a struggle.To be honest, as glad as I am that I read this book, maybe I didn't really need to. Turns out my English Language teacher basically constructed 90% of his change syllabus based on its salient points, and while I'm glad I got to add to these with Deutscher's more in-depth examples, some of them over-complicated it.I'm aware I'm probably judging this book for adhering to academic style expectations. But I've never really understood why we should make ideas more complicated than they need to be just in the name of making them seem more prestigiously academic, to be honest."
139,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11040524-hannah,3,"Clearly written by someone who knows their stuff and vastly superior to that dire Bill Bryson book.The trouble with non-fiction is the author can't magically know what's obvious to me and what's quite technically heavy. I'd say this is not a book for someone with zero knowledge of linguistics but it's reasonably accessible.In discussing language change he says ""Consider again the change from p to f which seems so implausible today."" Implausible? Well I have some understanding of phonetics and of Welsh so it doesn't seem strange at all. Other language may change consonants over centuries but Welsh mutates from sentence to sentence. I'm surprised he doesn't refer to a Celtic language in this section as the analogy would be very helpful. Ble mae'r Cymraeg?The author also says ""Moreover, there is no system of communication today that is in the process of developing its first articulate words, so there are no parallells from the present to go on."" My question is what about sign languages? Can watching sign languages develop help us to learn about the evolution of language?One analogy is that languages are like traffic jams. People don't intend to create a traffic jam but their cumulative actions create one.His point about ""order-craving minds"" makes sense. ""If there is any element of 'invention' in language, it is surely the mind's craving for order - the instinctive difficulty to accept that so much is just random, arbitrary and coincidental."""
140,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29089487-alex-telfar,4,"The book was quite interesting, but, it left me full of speculation and hungry for evidence. Guy tries to argue that there cannot be evidence for many of the claims due to the our partial view of history, but I think he discounts (or is unaware of) how evidence can be provided by formal proof and numerical simulation. How does language evolve? According to Guy; energy saving shortcuts, decay of meaning, abstraction, the order-craving mind each interact and push and pull or words and structure to give what we see.There is also a level more of explanation and rigor required to make his argument truly interesting. Cool, we know it did happen (as can be seen from the history books), but why did it happen? Guy puts forward some nice candidate hypotheses, but does little to prove them. The main thing I would like you know is whether the four proposed mutagens are sufficient to build the languages we see, given the resources available (number of people and time) and which mutagens are necessary.Most of all, I am interested in what our languages imply about the structure of our brains, what problems those structures are solving and how we have adapted to be (sub) optimal.See my notes here."
141,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50989441-gordon,5,"A really well written popular-linguistics book with a great sense of humour and a very clear focus: how did grammatical structure and complexity come into being? This is closely related to the question of whether (for example) Indo-European languages are in long-term decay and losing complexity as many 19th century linguists thought. It also raises the question of whether there were ""complexity forming"" conditions in the past that are no longer around, something Deutscher is at pains to refute. I am not a linguist, but know enough about it to have wondered about this particular question for some years. It's reassuring to hear that the whole academic discipline wrestled with it for a century or so.One good thing about this focus is that it manages to give a good balance of exotic and more familiar examples (eg. English or French historical changes) without being ""just"" a bunch of fun and novel facts and cool word stuff, which some history of English books seem to fall into. Nor does it spread itself too thin trying to speculate about really early formation of words or sounds, or try to get the reader to engage with formal grammars or too much of the phonetic alphabet.I certainly am not going to think of ""gonna"" (one of his key English examples) in the same way again. I'm not sure that I'll miss the passive-reflexive form of ""to snog"", though."
142,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29824032-rouzanna-sarkissian,4,"It is with mixed feelings that I gave this book four stars. ""The Unfolding of Language"" started out as a fascinating story of the origins of language and the principles that have been driving its evolution. How and why words change, become shorter or longer, change vowels and consonants, shed one meaning to assume another - the first part of the book was captivating, and I was going to give it a firm five star rating.However, somewhere in the middle Mr. Deutscher lost me. Was it that the inner workings of linguistics were too much to hold my attention for so many pages or that it's difficult to get immersed in the nuances of Hebrew grammar without actually speaking the language, I couldn't say. But I had to read diagonally or altogether skip the most challenging paragraphs in the second half of the book (unfortunately!), which left me with an impression that the presentation of the material was rather uneven. Some of it was good for a layman, but some was definitely fit for trained linguists or people with rather professional knowledge of the subject. I am also not sure I understood the exact logic behind dividing the information between the body and the appendixes of the book, which also affected my overall impression. So, I think one may still find ""The Unfolding of Language"" enjoyable, albeit slow and loaded with too much detail here and there."
143,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83243492-benno-krojer,4,"I wish the whole book was like the last chapter: Dealing with the big picture of language and its cognitive aspects instead of too many details of specific languages. On the other side there are many books on that cognitive aspect already and less on how language continuously changes in detail. And while I was sometimes annoyed by the abundance of language-specific details, I also appreciate that Deutscher tries to remain scientific while making simplifying statements to a broad audience, by giving evidence from languages for his points and not making any points when there is no evidence. For instance he makes no claim about how even rudimentary language (what he calls the ""me Tarzan"" stage of language) emerged in the first place, since this is pure speculation.Deutscher also did I fantastic job at continuously checking in with the reader that they still know what he is trying to argue for and where this argument fits into the bigger picture (in the manner: ""now of I've shown X but bear in mind that we initially tried to prove Y..."")This book has taught me more on language than my whole Bachelor's in Computational Linguistics! First, because my courses are mostly applied Machine Learning/Computer Science but also because it is simply a very good book from someone who knows how to explain his subject!"

The triad of economy, expressiveness and analogy is a great way for describing the cognitive machinery that is continuously altering language in certain ways. I will definitely have to re-read it, since one could a lot more out of this from a second reading. Especially the appendices. Also, the hall-mark of a good expository book is that it makes the reader see certain things with more sagacity. Prior to this, 'The Secret Language of Trees' gave me a new perspective of forests and trees and how there's so much more happening behind the curtains. Now, this book has made me keenly aware of the differences in the languages I know and how those differences could have manifested themselves through the ages via the action of order-seeking minds of human-beings.This is a solid 5-star book."
145,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82034260-nikhil,3,"For my first foray into linguistics, I think that it's fair to say that I learnt as much as I could. Guy Deutscher thankfully has an overarching premise where he proposes that languages are fluid for three reasons. For economy, which is why words and phrases are eroded for saving time and convenience, for expressiveness, which is why languages are laden with metaphors, and analogy, for understanding intentions using comparison. I found the p to f consonant shift in Germanic languages as opposed to Romance languages interesting, though I wish he had shed more light on linguistic families other than the Indo Aryan and Semitic ones, which he uses mostly for demonstrating grammatical similarities. de Troy's part is way too long to hold anyone's interest, though. Oh, and I found the Caesar joke funny. Reading this book requires a lot of patience on the part of the reader and more than an average interest in linguistics. If you have that, you just might find this to your liking. "
146,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,4,"I found this book particularly interesting because it continues past the point where other books are content to stop. I’ve read several books on linguistics aimed at the general reader and they are usually happy to stop when they have proven that the language mavens are overblowing the “decline” of their native tongue. While Deutscher is happy to give the same historical perspective of writers decrying the state of their language for the past thousand years, he also seeks to prove that the same forces behind the “decline” of languages are what build the complex systems that linguists love to praise. Writing in a style that is both compelling and easy to follow, Deutscher takes the reader through the latest discoveries in linguistics and how they have allowed us to peer back almost to the beginning of all languages. This was the most enlightening book on the development and evolution of language that I’ve ever read."

I ponder about and often discuss with others as crazy as me about some obscure fine point concerning languages. I have spent a lot of time thinking about and discussing the complex interplay of language, thought, culture, etc. Given all this, I read The Unfolding of Language with great interest -- I almost devoured it. In this book, he author takes on the onerous task of tracing the history of language. He picks up examples from several languages to make a fairly plausible argument about how languages acquired such complexity starting from a basic set of sounds and words. He talks in detail about the role of “shortcuts” (saving breath to reduce effort) in creating new sounds and words; how metaphors and analogies brought in expressiveness to language beyond its early rudimentary, high functional purposes. The writing can seem dry and repetitive at some places. Also, there are some fairly technical details in this book, which are primarily of interest to those who are deeply into language, but you can safely skip those. It’s a highly entertaining and insightful read even otherwise. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it."
148,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5755899-michael,5,"An incredibly fascinating Indiana Jones adventure about language through time and cultures. Deutscher takes the reader on the tour in unique ways. In chapter 5 (The Forces of Creation) for example, he makes his argument through the story of a fictional academic speaker giving a talk at a conference. I found chapters 3, 4 and 5 to be my favorites along with appendices A, D, and E. To get the most out of this book it would be best to be familiar with different parts of language like word types, tenses, etc. To that end, I wish Deutscher had provided an appendix which acted as a primer or refresher on some of those. It's not strictly necessary to know a great deal about all that to get a lot out of this book, but certain chapters will go smoother with that knowledge.This was one of my favorite non-fiction books I've read so far, go read it!"
149,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4048835-rebecca,3,"Deutscher’s tone is engaging and he sets out with a very modest enterprise: to show how a complex language may in theory unfold. However, this still leaves the question: unfold from what? Since he cannot address the beginning state, it is more about historic change than an unveiling. He makes very pretty case studies, but I wonder how generalizable his theory is. A few times towards the final chapters, he also seems to suggest that all abstract concepts arose from concrete ones, which seems like a radical (and probably incorrect) view. With popular science, I always wonder what the counterarguments are, or if you can induce these changes computationally/experimentally (Pinker does a slightly better job on this front). Still, worth a read."

It is essentially an eagle eye's view over language itself, and the author exposes plainly and very easily (to follow) how language originated, from what and why we talk the way we do. It might sound odd to you, but halfway through this book my entire foundations of my view and understanding of life and the mind were shaken. I just never contemplated linguists or language, and was only ever fascinated with the topic. Believe me, this book took none of the fascination away but just added to it! All while giving me an entirely different perspective on language, mankind, and communications in general both past present and future.

I knew how to use them before, but I didn't full comprehend - so if this book taught me nothing else, I have that. This book was, perhaps, a mistake to read during my night shifts as there were especially long passages involving semitic verb cases but I found it truly interesting. I suppose what I can glean from this book and all its lessons is that language doesn't have to be logical to make sense (or have a word for 'have' either, apparently). And that books on linguistics might be my in to that boring floor of non-fiction of the 4th floor of the library."

Not only does he know a lot about language; he's an expert in using it, too! The first half of the book is devoted to the history of languages and linguistic research, and it depicts the familiar landscape of continuous erosion, splitting, merging, change. The second half I found much more enlightening. There, the Author argues that the erosion of language is also its building force, and he illustrates it with many examples wrapped neatly around a short story about a girl, her father, and a mammoth, presented at various stages of language development. The fascinating topic and the Author's excellent writing make this book a very pleasant read."

Their evolution is a negotiation between economy and expressiveness. For example, laziness, especially in prononciation, causes erosion and elision; the craving for order reinforces even accidental patterns; the desire to heighten expressiveness is achieved through the insertion of extra words; and the desire to extend the reach of language is achieved through the use of metapphor from concrete domains to abstract ones.Deutscher is like an archaelogist, dusting away layers of detritus from modern language, uncovering traces of earlier generations of the language. Thus he adduces evidence for his theory.Convincing and fascinating."

It is about how language evolved. I'm in agreement with most of his argument for the manner in which language evolved, but the main reason I single out this academic work is because it is readable. So many academic works are not; and, in all fairness, could not be made so because of the arcane nature of their content. Deutscher, however, makes an effort to reach out, not just to fellow linguists, but to all those interested in language. A very good read."

I found it very insightful, mostly entertaining, although some parts were quite hard to understand for a non-linguist and non-english native reader (not used to all the english grammar terms). I definitely recommend to read it on paper. I read it on Kindle and the book is full of examples which need to be magnified, which is a hassle on the kindle and sometimes the magnification failed on smaller examples.

167,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36524004-nazrul-buang,4,"Linguistics has always been a topic I'm interested in and curious to learn about, and it's been some since I last read one about it, that being Steven Pinker's 'Sense of Style'. This book has been on my to-read shelf for some time, especially after hearing about it from some online article, so I decided it's finally time to get a copy of it from the library.Author Guy Deutscher is a linguistics historian specializing in ancient Semitic languages, who sets to address the key questions: where do languages come from, and how do they end up becoming the languages that they are now. He explores the vast and winding history of languages, with special focus on the Indo-European language family, and strives to provide clarity to the concept that basically makes us human.Linguistics first piqued my interest when I learned Japanese linguistics back during my university days. Like most other first-time learners of any form of linguistics, what captured my attention is how it changes the way I see language (primarily English) altogether, addressing the question of why one can know how to speak a language without understanding why. It's one of the topics that added meaning and perspective to my daily life, and to this day I continue to read up more on linguistics just to understand why certain languages work the way they work.Deutscher takes an academic approach to the world of linguistics, starting with the debatable topic of how they were 'invented' (or more accurately, 'formed'), and then gradually working up to how the structure of languages came to be, and so forth. His writing is fairly readable and digestible for the layman, where unlike some of Pinker's works, Deutscher's writing is more simple to understand. Furthermore, he gives simple examples to demonstrate and buttress his theoretical explanations, which makes his book feel like a well thought-out lecture addressing to people who don't share his expertise background.However, despite his attempts to write for the layman, his book (and perhaps linguistics in overall) eventually caters to those in the academia. Some chapters can be dry and prolix, such as topic on the change in vowel and pronunciation over time, although this is part of the bedrock of linguistics. Plus, readers must have a very firm grasp of English and selected European and Semitic languages, as it will come in handy when appreciating Deutscher's elaborations in their linguistics.'The Unfolding of Language' is an intellectual voyage in the seas of languages, spanning through time and space as it details the subtle changes what we fail to capture along the way. Language is one of human being's methods of communication that naturally undergoes evolution, and despite the protests of purists over the gradual degradation of language, it nevertheless abides by a timeless observation, that the only thing that is constant is change. The book is not for everyone; it would generally appeal to readers with vest interest in linguistics and keen interest in how languages came about. Whilst I find some parts too academic for my liking, I enjoyed reading it as a whole and learn a bit or two about a few languages I thought I already knew, but proven to be wrong in the end."
168,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41668866-lara-liz,3,"First off, I am not recommending this book to anyone who's, at least for now, anything other than an active student of Linguistics. If you're looking for a general interest book, I'd point you towards someone like David Crystal - while Guy Deutscher is a very clever linguistic theorist and a really key voice in the field, at least in my mind, this book seem to me like he decided what he was going to say, and then figured out a more complicated way to say it. That's academia for you, I guess, but this book felt particularly bad (I found Through the Language Glass, by the same author, much better).I did really like the chapter he chose to do as if it was a transcript from a much-harried young professor's attempts to convince a room full of English purists that 'decay' (you know ""young people don't even pronounce the ends of words anymore"" kind of stuff) can actually be a good thing. I remember most of the points in that chapter really well. The rest of it, with its dense style, was more of a struggle.To be honest, as glad as I am that I read this book, maybe I didn't really need to. Turns out my English Language teacher basically constructed 90% of his change syllabus based on its salient points, and while I'm glad I got to add to these with Deutscher's more in-depth examples, some of them over-complicated it.I'm aware I'm probably judging this book for adhering to academic style expectations. But I've never really understood why we should make ideas more complicated than they need to be just in the name of making them seem more prestigiously academic, to be honest."
169,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11040524-hannah,3,"Clearly written by someone who knows their stuff and vastly superior to that dire Bill Bryson book.The trouble with non-fiction is the author can't magically know what's obvious to me and what's quite technically heavy. I'd say this is not a book for someone with zero knowledge of linguistics but it's reasonably accessible.In discussing language change he says ""Consider again the change from p to f which seems so implausible today."" Implausible? Well I have some understanding of phonetics and of Welsh so it doesn't seem strange at all. Other language may change consonants over centuries but Welsh mutates from sentence to sentence. I'm surprised he doesn't refer to a Celtic language in this section as the analogy would be very helpful. Ble mae'r Cymraeg?The author also says ""Moreover, there is no system of communication today that is in the process of developing its first articulate words, so there are no parallells from the present to go on."" My question is what about sign languages? Can watching sign languages develop help us to learn about the evolution of language?One analogy is that languages are like traffic jams. People don't intend to create a traffic jam but their cumulative actions create one.His point about ""order-craving minds"" makes sense. ""If there is any element of 'invention' in language, it is surely the mind's craving for order - the instinctive difficulty to accept that so much is just random, arbitrary and coincidental."""
170,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29089487-alex-telfar,4,"The book was quite interesting, but, it left me full of speculation and hungry for evidence. Guy tries to argue that there cannot be evidence for many of the claims due to the our partial view of history, but I think he discounts (or is unaware of) how evidence can be provided by formal proof and numerical simulation. How does language evolve? According to Guy; energy saving shortcuts, decay of meaning, abstraction, the order-craving mind each interact and push and pull or words and structure to give what we see.There is also a level more of explanation and rigor required to make his argument truly interesting. Cool, we know it did happen (as can be seen from the history books), but why did it happen? Guy puts forward some nice candidate hypotheses, but does little to prove them. The main thing I would like you know is whether the four proposed mutagens are sufficient to build the languages we see, given the resources available (number of people and time) and which mutagens are necessary.Most of all, I am interested in what our languages imply about the structure of our brains, what problems those structures are solving and how we have adapted to be (sub) optimal.See my notes here."
171,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50989441-gordon,5,"A really well written popular-linguistics book with a great sense of humour and a very clear focus: how did grammatical structure and complexity come into being? This is closely related to the question of whether (for example) Indo-European languages are in long-term decay and losing complexity as many 19th century linguists thought. It also raises the question of whether there were ""complexity forming"" conditions in the past that are no longer around, something Deutscher is at pains to refute. I am not a linguist, but know enough about it to have wondered about this particular question for some years. It's reassuring to hear that the whole academic discipline wrestled with it for a century or so.One good thing about this focus is that it manages to give a good balance of exotic and more familiar examples (eg. English or French historical changes) without being ""just"" a bunch of fun and novel facts and cool word stuff, which some history of English books seem to fall into. Nor does it spread itself too thin trying to speculate about really early formation of words or sounds, or try to get the reader to engage with formal grammars or too much of the phonetic alphabet.I certainly am not going to think of ""gonna"" (one of his key English examples) in the same way again. I'm not sure that I'll miss the passive-reflexive form of ""to snog"", though."
172,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29824032-rouzanna-sarkissian,4,"It is with mixed feelings that I gave this book four stars. ""The Unfolding of Language"" started out as a fascinating story of the origins of language and the principles that have been driving its evolution. How and why words change, become shorter or longer, change vowels and consonants, shed one meaning to assume another - the first part of the book was captivating, and I was going to give it a firm five star rating.However, somewhere in the middle Mr. Deutscher lost me. Was it that the inner workings of linguistics were too much to hold my attention for so many pages or that it's difficult to get immersed in the nuances of Hebrew grammar without actually speaking the language, I couldn't say. But I had to read diagonally or altogether skip the most challenging paragraphs in the second half of the book (unfortunately!), which left me with an impression that the presentation of the material was rather uneven. Some of it was good for a layman, but some was definitely fit for trained linguists or people with rather professional knowledge of the subject. I am also not sure I understood the exact logic behind dividing the information between the body and the appendixes of the book, which also affected my overall impression. So, I think one may still find ""The Unfolding of Language"" enjoyable, albeit slow and loaded with too much detail here and there."
173,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83243492-benno-krojer,4,"I wish the whole book was like the last chapter: Dealing with the big picture of language and its cognitive aspects instead of too many details of specific languages. On the other side there are many books on that cognitive aspect already and less on how language continuously changes in detail. And while I was sometimes annoyed by the abundance of language-specific details, I also appreciate that Deutscher tries to remain scientific while making simplifying statements to a broad audience, by giving evidence from languages for his points and not making any points when there is no evidence. For instance he makes no claim about how even rudimentary language (what he calls the ""me Tarzan"" stage of language) emerged in the first place, since this is pure speculation.Deutscher also did I fantastic job at continuously checking in with the reader that they still know what he is trying to argue for and where this argument fits into the bigger picture (in the manner: ""now of I've shown X but bear in mind that we initially tried to prove Y..."")This book has taught me more on language than my whole Bachelor's in Computational Linguistics! First, because my courses are mostly applied Machine Learning/Computer Science but also because it is simply a very good book from someone who knows how to explain his subject!"

The triad of economy, expressiveness and analogy is a great way for describing the cognitive machinery that is continuously altering language in certain ways. I will definitely have to re-read it, since one could a lot more out of this from a second reading. Especially the appendices. Also, the hall-mark of a good expository book is that it makes the reader see certain things with more sagacity. Prior to this, 'The Secret Language of Trees' gave me a new perspective of forests and trees and how there's so much more happening behind the curtains. Now, this book has made me keenly aware of the differences in the languages I know and how those differences could have manifested themselves through the ages via the action of order-seeking minds of human-beings.This is a solid 5-star book."
175,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82034260-nikhil,3,"For my first foray into linguistics, I think that it's fair to say that I learnt as much as I could. Guy Deutscher thankfully has an overarching premise where he proposes that languages are fluid for three reasons. For economy, which is why words and phrases are eroded for saving time and convenience, for expressiveness, which is why languages are laden with metaphors, and analogy, for understanding intentions using comparison. I found the p to f consonant shift in Germanic languages as opposed to Romance languages interesting, though I wish he had shed more light on linguistic families other than the Indo Aryan and Semitic ones, which he uses mostly for demonstrating grammatical similarities. de Troy's part is way too long to hold anyone's interest, though. Oh, and I found the Caesar joke funny. Reading this book requires a lot of patience on the part of the reader and more than an average interest in linguistics. If you have that, you just might find this to your liking. "
176,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,4,"I found this book particularly interesting because it continues past the point where other books are content to stop. I’ve read several books on linguistics aimed at the general reader and they are usually happy to stop when they have proven that the language mavens are overblowing the “decline” of their native tongue. While Deutscher is happy to give the same historical perspective of writers decrying the state of their language for the past thousand years, he also seeks to prove that the same forces behind the “decline” of languages are what build the complex systems that linguists love to praise. Writing in a style that is both compelling and easy to follow, Deutscher takes the reader through the latest discoveries in linguistics and how they have allowed us to peer back almost to the beginning of all languages. This was the most enlightening book on the development and evolution of language that I’ve ever read."
177,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7237154-sanket-patil,4,"I have always had a lot of curiosity about languages. I ponder about and often discuss with others as crazy as me about some obscure fine point concerning languages. I have spent a lot of time thinking about and discussing the complex interplay of language, thought, culture, etc. Given all this, I read The Unfolding of Language with great interest -- I almost devoured it. In this book, he author takes on the onerous task of tracing the history of language. He picks up examples from several languages to make a fairly plausible argument about how languages acquired such complexity starting from a basic set of sounds and words. He talks in detail about the role of “shortcuts” (saving breath to reduce effort) in creating new sounds and words; how metaphors and analogies brought in expressiveness to language beyond its early rudimentary, high functional purposes. The writing can seem dry and repetitive at some places. Also, there are some fairly technical details in this book, which are primarily of interest to those who are deeply into language, but you can safely skip those. It’s a highly entertaining and insightful read even otherwise. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it."
178,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5755899-michael,5,"An incredibly fascinating Indiana Jones adventure about language through time and cultures. Deutscher takes the reader on the tour in unique ways. In chapter 5 (The Forces of Creation) for example, he makes his argument through the story of a fictional academic speaker giving a talk at a conference. I found chapters 3, 4 and 5 to be my favorites along with appendices A, D, and E. To get the most out of this book it would be best to be familiar with different parts of language like word types, tenses, etc. To that end, I wish Deutscher had provided an appendix which acted as a primer or refresher on some of those. It's not strictly necessary to know a great deal about all that to get a lot out of this book, but certain chapters will go smoother with that knowledge.This was one of my favorite non-fiction books I've read so far, go read it!"
179,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4048835-rebecca,3,"Deutscher’s tone is engaging and he sets out with a very modest enterprise: to show how a complex language may in theory unfold. However, this still leaves the question: unfold from what? Since he cannot address the beginning state, it is more about historic change than an unveiling. He makes very pretty case studies, but I wonder how generalizable his theory is. A few times towards the final chapters, he also seems to suggest that all abstract concepts arose from concrete ones, which seems like a radical (and probably incorrect) view. With popular science, I always wonder what the counterarguments are, or if you can induce these changes computationally/experimentally (Pinker does a slightly better job on this front). Still, worth a read."
180,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10984529-wishkid,5,"Ok this book was simply AMAZING. I feel that anyone, ANYONE, endeavoring to learn a new language should FIRSTLY read this book! It is essentially an eagle eye's view over language itself, and the author exposes plainly and very easily (to follow) how language originated, from what and why we talk the way we do. It might sound odd to you, but halfway through this book my entire foundations of my view and understanding of life and the mind were shaken. I just never contemplated linguists or language, and was only ever fascinated with the topic. Believe me, this book took none of the fascination away but just added to it! All while giving me an entirely different perspective on language, mankind, and communications in general both past present and future. Seriously, Deutscher took a whole lot of linguistic knowledge and presented it in this very book right here beautifully, plainly, and he weaves a web of pure understanding and insight that I simply never would have without reading first this book. After having read this thing, (at the moment I am not even finished, not quite) I feel literally 100 percent more confident in picking up another language, and I have this understanding about language all across the world and how it changes that I truly hold dear. 5/5 would bang!"

His main goal in writing this book is to show how complex linguistic features could have developed from the earliest, most primitive ""me Tarzan"" stages of language. Deutscher does a great job explaining how the world's language develop all their extravagant bells and whistles, and by the end of the book this explanation adds up to an argument against nativist theories put forth by the likes of Chomsky and Pinker. Deutscher also ends up demolishing a whole lot of prescriptivist notions about grammar, by illuminating the elegant, self-perpetuating cycle of destruction and creation that drives linguistic development. One can hardly mention the evolution of language without someone lamenting the current state of linguistic decay, but Deutscher puts this persistent myth to bed. Things get a little technical towards the end, and the layperson might find it a little complicated, but it's worth the effort to gain the insight and understanding that this book provides."

Nor is it about proto-history of language—although he does refer to proto-history of language as it can occasionally be reconstructed. This is about the nuts and bolts—the mechanical processes that change language over millennia. Deutcher leads his reader through the maze of linguistics to describe the many things that will change language. For his illustrations he draws not only from the Indo-European languages (English, French, German, Greek, Latin, etc.) but also from such Semitic languages (Afro-Asiatic) as Arabic and Hebrew and occasionaly Egyptian and Akkadian. He draws also from ancient Sumerian as well as modern Turkish. He goes into Nilo-Saharan and Yoruba in Africa as well as Australian Aborigine. All of these resources provide him with the illustrations of the variations and changes that can happen in language.I would not consider this an an easy read, but I learned a great deal."

197,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36524004-nazrul-buang,4,"Linguistics has always been a topic I'm interested in and curious to learn about, and it's been some since I last read one about it, that being Steven Pinker's 'Sense of Style'. This book has been on my to-read shelf for some time, especially after hearing about it from some online article, so I decided it's finally time to get a copy of it from the library.Author Guy Deutscher is a linguistics historian specializing in ancient Semitic languages, who sets to address the key questions: where do languages come from, and how do they end up becoming the languages that they are now. He explores the vast and winding history of languages, with special focus on the Indo-European language family, and strives to provide clarity to the concept that basically makes us human.Linguistics first piqued my interest when I learned Japanese linguistics back during my university days. Like most other first-time learners of any form of linguistics, what captured my attention is how it changes the way I see language (primarily English) altogether, addressing the question of why one can know how to speak a language without understanding why. It's one of the topics that added meaning and perspective to my daily life, and to this day I continue to read up more on linguistics just to understand why certain languages work the way they work.Deutscher takes an academic approach to the world of linguistics, starting with the debatable topic of how they were 'invented' (or more accurately, 'formed'), and then gradually working up to how the structure of languages came to be, and so forth. His writing is fairly readable and digestible for the layman, where unlike some of Pinker's works, Deutscher's writing is more simple to understand. Furthermore, he gives simple examples to demonstrate and buttress his theoretical explanations, which makes his book feel like a well thought-out lecture addressing to people who don't share his expertise background.However, despite his attempts to write for the layman, his book (and perhaps linguistics in overall) eventually caters to those in the academia. Some chapters can be dry and prolix, such as topic on the change in vowel and pronunciation over time, although this is part of the bedrock of linguistics. Plus, readers must have a very firm grasp of English and selected European and Semitic languages, as it will come in handy when appreciating Deutscher's elaborations in their linguistics.'The Unfolding of Language' is an intellectual voyage in the seas of languages, spanning through time and space as it details the subtle changes what we fail to capture along the way. Language is one of human being's methods of communication that naturally undergoes evolution, and despite the protests of purists over the gradual degradation of language, it nevertheless abides by a timeless observation, that the only thing that is constant is change. The book is not for everyone; it would generally appeal to readers with vest interest in linguistics and keen interest in how languages came about. Whilst I find some parts too academic for my liking, I enjoyed reading it as a whole and learn a bit or two about a few languages I thought I already knew, but proven to be wrong in the end."
198,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41668866-lara-liz,3,"First off, I am not recommending this book to anyone who's, at least for now, anything other than an active student of Linguistics. If you're looking for a general interest book, I'd point you towards someone like David Crystal - while Guy Deutscher is a very clever linguistic theorist and a really key voice in the field, at least in my mind, this book seem to me like he decided what he was going to say, and then figured out a more complicated way to say it. That's academia for you, I guess, but this book felt particularly bad (I found Through the Language Glass, by the same author, much better).I did really like the chapter he chose to do as if it was a transcript from a much-harried young professor's attempts to convince a room full of English purists that 'decay' (you know ""young people don't even pronounce the ends of words anymore"" kind of stuff) can actually be a good thing. I remember most of the points in that chapter really well. The rest of it, with its dense style, was more of a struggle.To be honest, as glad as I am that I read this book, maybe I didn't really need to. Turns out my English Language teacher basically constructed 90% of his change syllabus based on its salient points, and while I'm glad I got to add to these with Deutscher's more in-depth examples, some of them over-complicated it.I'm aware I'm probably judging this book for adhering to academic style expectations. But I've never really understood why we should make ideas more complicated than they need to be just in the name of making them seem more prestigiously academic, to be honest."
199,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11040524-hannah,3,"Clearly written by someone who knows their stuff and vastly superior to that dire Bill Bryson book.The trouble with non-fiction is the author can't magically know what's obvious to me and what's quite technically heavy. I'd say this is not a book for someone with zero knowledge of linguistics but it's reasonably accessible.In discussing language change he says ""Consider again the change from p to f which seems so implausible today."" Implausible? Well I have some understanding of phonetics and of Welsh so it doesn't seem strange at all. Other language may change consonants over centuries but Welsh mutates from sentence to sentence. I'm surprised he doesn't refer to a Celtic language in this section as the analogy would be very helpful. Ble mae'r Cymraeg?The author also says ""Moreover, there is no system of communication today that is in the process of developing its first articulate words, so there are no parallells from the present to go on."" My question is what about sign languages? Can watching sign languages develop help us to learn about the evolution of language?One analogy is that languages are like traffic jams. People don't intend to create a traffic jam but their cumulative actions create one.His point about ""order-craving minds"" makes sense. ""If there is any element of 'invention' in language, it is surely the mind's craving for order - the instinctive difficulty to accept that so much is just random, arbitrary and coincidental."""
200,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29089487-alex-telfar,4,"The book was quite interesting, but, it left me full of speculation and hungry for evidence. Guy tries to argue that there cannot be evidence for many of the claims due to the our partial view of history, but I think he discounts (or is unaware of) how evidence can be provided by formal proof and numerical simulation. How does language evolve? According to Guy; energy saving shortcuts, decay of meaning, abstraction, the order-craving mind each interact and push and pull or words and structure to give what we see.There is also a level more of explanation and rigor required to make his argument truly interesting. Cool, we know it did happen (as can be seen from the history books), but why did it happen? Guy puts forward some nice candidate hypotheses, but does little to prove them. The main thing I would like you know is whether the four proposed mutagens are sufficient to build the languages we see, given the resources available (number of people and time) and which mutagens are necessary.Most of all, I am interested in what our languages imply about the structure of our brains, what problems those structures are solving and how we have adapted to be (sub) optimal.See my notes here."
201,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50989441-gordon,5,"A really well written popular-linguistics book with a great sense of humour and a very clear focus: how did grammatical structure and complexity come into being? This is closely related to the question of whether (for example) Indo-European languages are in long-term decay and losing complexity as many 19th century linguists thought. It also raises the question of whether there were ""complexity forming"" conditions in the past that are no longer around, something Deutscher is at pains to refute. I am not a linguist, but know enough about it to have wondered about this particular question for some years. It's reassuring to hear that the whole academic discipline wrestled with it for a century or so.One good thing about this focus is that it manages to give a good balance of exotic and more familiar examples (eg. English or French historical changes) without being ""just"" a bunch of fun and novel facts and cool word stuff, which some history of English books seem to fall into. Nor does it spread itself too thin trying to speculate about really early formation of words or sounds, or try to get the reader to engage with formal grammars or too much of the phonetic alphabet.I certainly am not going to think of ""gonna"" (one of his key English examples) in the same way again. I'm not sure that I'll miss the passive-reflexive form of ""to snog"", though."
202,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29824032-rouzanna-sarkissian,4,"It is with mixed feelings that I gave this book four stars. ""The Unfolding of Language"" started out as a fascinating story of the origins of language and the principles that have been driving its evolution. How and why words change, become shorter or longer, change vowels and consonants, shed one meaning to assume another - the first part of the book was captivating, and I was going to give it a firm five star rating.However, somewhere in the middle Mr. Deutscher lost me. Was it that the inner workings of linguistics were too much to hold my attention for so many pages or that it's difficult to get immersed in the nuances of Hebrew grammar without actually speaking the language, I couldn't say. But I had to read diagonally or altogether skip the most challenging paragraphs in the second half of the book (unfortunately!), which left me with an impression that the presentation of the material was rather uneven. Some of it was good for a layman, but some was definitely fit for trained linguists or people with rather professional knowledge of the subject. I am also not sure I understood the exact logic behind dividing the information between the body and the appendixes of the book, which also affected my overall impression. So, I think one may still find ""The Unfolding of Language"" enjoyable, albeit slow and loaded with too much detail here and there."
203,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83243492-benno-krojer,4,"I wish the whole book was like the last chapter: Dealing with the big picture of language and its cognitive aspects instead of too many details of specific languages. On the other side there are many books on that cognitive aspect already and less on how language continuously changes in detail. And while I was sometimes annoyed by the abundance of language-specific details, I also appreciate that Deutscher tries to remain scientific while making simplifying statements to a broad audience, by giving evidence from languages for his points and not making any points when there is no evidence. For instance he makes no claim about how even rudimentary language (what he calls the ""me Tarzan"" stage of language) emerged in the first place, since this is pure speculation.Deutscher also did I fantastic job at continuously checking in with the reader that they still know what he is trying to argue for and where this argument fits into the bigger picture (in the manner: ""now of I've shown X but bear in mind that we initially tried to prove Y..."")This book has taught me more on language than my whole Bachelor's in Computational Linguistics! First, because my courses are mostly applied Machine Learning/Computer Science but also because it is simply a very good book from someone who knows how to explain his subject!"

The triad of economy, expressiveness and analogy is a great way for describing the cognitive machinery that is continuously altering language in certain ways. I will definitely have to re-read it, since one could a lot more out of this from a second reading. Especially the appendices. Also, the hall-mark of a good expository book is that it makes the reader see certain things with more sagacity. Prior to this, 'The Secret Language of Trees' gave me a new perspective of forests and trees and how there's so much more happening behind the curtains. Now, this book has made me keenly aware of the differences in the languages I know and how those differences could have manifested themselves through the ages via the action of order-seeking minds of human-beings.This is a solid 5-star book."
205,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82034260-nikhil,3,"For my first foray into linguistics, I think that it's fair to say that I learnt as much as I could. Guy Deutscher thankfully has an overarching premise where he proposes that languages are fluid for three reasons. For economy, which is why words and phrases are eroded for saving time and convenience, for expressiveness, which is why languages are laden with metaphors, and analogy, for understanding intentions using comparison. I found the p to f consonant shift in Germanic languages as opposed to Romance languages interesting, though I wish he had shed more light on linguistic families other than the Indo Aryan and Semitic ones, which he uses mostly for demonstrating grammatical similarities. de Troy's part is way too long to hold anyone's interest, though. Oh, and I found the Caesar joke funny. Reading this book requires a lot of patience on the part of the reader and more than an average interest in linguistics. If you have that, you just might find this to your liking. "
206,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,4,"I found this book particularly interesting because it continues past the point where other books are content to stop. I’ve read several books on linguistics aimed at the general reader and they are usually happy to stop when they have proven that the language mavens are overblowing the “decline” of their native tongue. While Deutscher is happy to give the same historical perspective of writers decrying the state of their language for the past thousand years, he also seeks to prove that the same forces behind the “decline” of languages are what build the complex systems that linguists love to praise. Writing in a style that is both compelling and easy to follow, Deutscher takes the reader through the latest discoveries in linguistics and how they have allowed us to peer back almost to the beginning of all languages. This was the most enlightening book on the development and evolution of language that I’ve ever read."
207,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7237154-sanket-patil,4,"I have always had a lot of curiosity about languages. I ponder about and often discuss with others as crazy as me about some obscure fine point concerning languages. I have spent a lot of time thinking about and discussing the complex interplay of language, thought, culture, etc. Given all this, I read The Unfolding of Language with great interest -- I almost devoured it. In this book, he author takes on the onerous task of tracing the history of language. He picks up examples from several languages to make a fairly plausible argument about how languages acquired such complexity starting from a basic set of sounds and words. He talks in detail about the role of “shortcuts” (saving breath to reduce effort) in creating new sounds and words; how metaphors and analogies brought in expressiveness to language beyond its early rudimentary, high functional purposes. The writing can seem dry and repetitive at some places. Also, there are some fairly technical details in this book, which are primarily of interest to those who are deeply into language, but you can safely skip those. It’s a highly entertaining and insightful read even otherwise. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it."
208,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5755899-michael,5,"An incredibly fascinating Indiana Jones adventure about language through time and cultures. Deutscher takes the reader on the tour in unique ways. In chapter 5 (The Forces of Creation) for example, he makes his argument through the story of a fictional academic speaker giving a talk at a conference. I found chapters 3, 4 and 5 to be my favorites along with appendices A, D, and E. To get the most out of this book it would be best to be familiar with different parts of language like word types, tenses, etc. To that end, I wish Deutscher had provided an appendix which acted as a primer or refresher on some of those. It's not strictly necessary to know a great deal about all that to get a lot out of this book, but certain chapters will go smoother with that knowledge.This was one of my favorite non-fiction books I've read so far, go read it!"
209,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4048835-rebecca,3,"Deutscher’s tone is engaging and he sets out with a very modest enterprise: to show how a complex language may in theory unfold. However, this still leaves the question: unfold from what? Since he cannot address the beginning state, it is more about historic change than an unveiling. He makes very pretty case studies, but I wonder how generalizable his theory is. A few times towards the final chapters, he also seems to suggest that all abstract concepts arose from concrete ones, which seems like a radical (and probably incorrect) view. With popular science, I always wonder what the counterarguments are, or if you can induce these changes computationally/experimentally (Pinker does a slightly better job on this front). Still, worth a read."
210,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10984529-wishkid,5,"Ok this book was simply AMAZING. I feel that anyone, ANYONE, endeavoring to learn a new language should FIRSTLY read this book! It is essentially an eagle eye's view over language itself, and the author exposes plainly and very easily (to follow) how language originated, from what and why we talk the way we do. It might sound odd to you, but halfway through this book my entire foundations of my view and understanding of life and the mind were shaken. I just never contemplated linguists or language, and was only ever fascinated with the topic. Believe me, this book took none of the fascination away but just added to it! All while giving me an entirely different perspective on language, mankind, and communications in general both past present and future. Seriously, Deutscher took a whole lot of linguistic knowledge and presented it in this very book right here beautifully, plainly, and he weaves a web of pure understanding and insight that I simply never would have without reading first this book. After having read this thing, (at the moment I am not even finished, not quite) I feel literally 100 percent more confident in picking up another language, and I have this understanding about language all across the world and how it changes that I truly hold dear. 5/5 would bang!"

His main goal in writing this book is to show how complex linguistic features could have developed from the earliest, most primitive ""me Tarzan"" stages of language. Deutscher does a great job explaining how the world's language develop all their extravagant bells and whistles, and by the end of the book this explanation adds up to an argument against nativist theories put forth by the likes of Chomsky and Pinker. Deutscher also ends up demolishing a whole lot of prescriptivist notions about grammar, by illuminating the elegant, self-perpetuating cycle of destruction and creation that drives linguistic development. One can hardly mention the evolution of language without someone lamenting the current state of linguistic decay, but Deutscher puts this persistent myth to bed. Things get a little technical towards the end, and the layperson might find it a little complicated, but it's worth the effort to gain the insight and understanding that this book provides."
212,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43101325-michele,4,"This book is not about the “history” of language—although he does refer to the historic past in various places in his book. Nor is it about proto-history of language—although he does refer to proto-history of language as it can occasionally be reconstructed. This is about the nuts and bolts—the mechanical processes that change language over millennia. Deutcher leads his reader through the maze of linguistics to describe the many things that will change language. For his illustrations he draws not only from the Indo-European languages (English, French, German, Greek, Latin, etc.) but also from such Semitic languages (Afro-Asiatic) as Arabic and Hebrew and occasionaly Egyptian and Akkadian. He draws also from ancient Sumerian as well as modern Turkish. He goes into Nilo-Saharan and Yoruba in Africa as well as Australian Aborigine. All of these resources provide him with the illustrations of the variations and changes that can happen in language.I would not consider this an an easy read, but I learned a great deal."

This book makes up for it in spades (and hearts and clubs). If nothing else, this may be the first time I truly understand - not by guessing and instinct but know - terms like clauses and auxiliary's and prepositions mean. I knew how to use them before, but I didn't full comprehend - so if this book taught me nothing else, I have that. This book was, perhaps, a mistake to read during my night shifts as there were especially long passages involving semitic verb cases but I found it truly interesting. I suppose what I can glean from this book and all its lessons is that language doesn't have to be logical to make sense (or have a word for 'have' either, apparently). And that books on linguistics might be my in to that boring floor of non-fiction of the 4th floor of the library."

Some of it is speculation (because it must be, language being a lot older than writing), but it is plausible, and the author states where he's speculating rather than citing evidence.Lots of fun if you like that kind of thing.

227,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36524004-nazrul-buang,4,"Linguistics has always been a topic I'm interested in and curious to learn about, and it's been some since I last read one about it, that being Steven Pinker's 'Sense of Style'. This book has been on my to-read shelf for some time, especially after hearing about it from some online article, so I decided it's finally time to get a copy of it from the library.Author Guy Deutscher is a linguistics historian specializing in ancient Semitic languages, who sets to address the key questions: where do languages come from, and how do they end up becoming the languages that they are now. He explores the vast and winding history of languages, with special focus on the Indo-European language family, and strives to provide clarity to the concept that basically makes us human.Linguistics first piqued my interest when I learned Japanese linguistics back during my university days. Like most other first-time learners of any form of linguistics, what captured my attention is how it changes the way I see language (primarily English) altogether, addressing the question of why one can know how to speak a language without understanding why. It's one of the topics that added meaning and perspective to my daily life, and to this day I continue to read up more on linguistics just to understand why certain languages work the way they work.Deutscher takes an academic approach to the world of linguistics, starting with the debatable topic of how they were 'invented' (or more accurately, 'formed'), and then gradually working up to how the structure of languages came to be, and so forth. His writing is fairly readable and digestible for the layman, where unlike some of Pinker's works, Deutscher's writing is more simple to understand. Furthermore, he gives simple examples to demonstrate and buttress his theoretical explanations, which makes his book feel like a well thought-out lecture addressing to people who don't share his expertise background.However, despite his attempts to write for the layman, his book (and perhaps linguistics in overall) eventually caters to those in the academia. Some chapters can be dry and prolix, such as topic on the change in vowel and pronunciation over time, although this is part of the bedrock of linguistics. Plus, readers must have a very firm grasp of English and selected European and Semitic languages, as it will come in handy when appreciating Deutscher's elaborations in their linguistics.'The Unfolding of Language' is an intellectual voyage in the seas of languages, spanning through time and space as it details the subtle changes what we fail to capture along the way. Language is one of human being's methods of communication that naturally undergoes evolution, and despite the protests of purists over the gradual degradation of language, it nevertheless abides by a timeless observation, that the only thing that is constant is change. The book is not for everyone; it would generally appeal to readers with vest interest in linguistics and keen interest in how languages came about. Whilst I find some parts too academic for my liking, I enjoyed reading it as a whole and learn a bit or two about a few languages I thought I already knew, but proven to be wrong in the end."
228,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41668866-lara-liz,3,"First off, I am not recommending this book to anyone who's, at least for now, anything other than an active student of Linguistics. If you're looking for a general interest book, I'd point you towards someone like David Crystal - while Guy Deutscher is a very clever linguistic theorist and a really key voice in the field, at least in my mind, this book seem to me like he decided what he was going to say, and then figured out a more complicated way to say it. That's academia for you, I guess, but this book felt particularly bad (I found Through the Language Glass, by the same author, much better).I did really like the chapter he chose to do as if it was a transcript from a much-harried young professor's attempts to convince a room full of English purists that 'decay' (you know ""young people don't even pronounce the ends of words anymore"" kind of stuff) can actually be a good thing. I remember most of the points in that chapter really well. The rest of it, with its dense style, was more of a struggle.To be honest, as glad as I am that I read this book, maybe I didn't really need to. Turns out my English Language teacher basically constructed 90% of his change syllabus based on its salient points, and while I'm glad I got to add to these with Deutscher's more in-depth examples, some of them over-complicated it.I'm aware I'm probably judging this book for adhering to academic style expectations. But I've never really understood why we should make ideas more complicated than they need to be just in the name of making them seem more prestigiously academic, to be honest."
229,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11040524-hannah,3,"Clearly written by someone who knows their stuff and vastly superior to that dire Bill Bryson book.The trouble with non-fiction is the author can't magically know what's obvious to me and what's quite technically heavy. I'd say this is not a book for someone with zero knowledge of linguistics but it's reasonably accessible.In discussing language change he says ""Consider again the change from p to f which seems so implausible today."" Implausible? Well I have some understanding of phonetics and of Welsh so it doesn't seem strange at all. Other language may change consonants over centuries but Welsh mutates from sentence to sentence. I'm surprised he doesn't refer to a Celtic language in this section as the analogy would be very helpful. Ble mae'r Cymraeg?The author also says ""Moreover, there is no system of communication today that is in the process of developing its first articulate words, so there are no parallells from the present to go on."" My question is what about sign languages? Can watching sign languages develop help us to learn about the evolution of language?One analogy is that languages are like traffic jams. People don't intend to create a traffic jam but their cumulative actions create one.His point about ""order-craving minds"" makes sense. ""If there is any element of 'invention' in language, it is surely the mind's craving for order - the instinctive difficulty to accept that so much is just random, arbitrary and coincidental."""
230,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29089487-alex-telfar,4,"The book was quite interesting, but, it left me full of speculation and hungry for evidence. Guy tries to argue that there cannot be evidence for many of the claims due to the our partial view of history, but I think he discounts (or is unaware of) how evidence can be provided by formal proof and numerical simulation. How does language evolve? According to Guy; energy saving shortcuts, decay of meaning, abstraction, the order-craving mind each interact and push and pull or words and structure to give what we see.There is also a level more of explanation and rigor required to make his argument truly interesting. Cool, we know it did happen (as can be seen from the history books), but why did it happen? Guy puts forward some nice candidate hypotheses, but does little to prove them. The main thing I would like you know is whether the four proposed mutagens are sufficient to build the languages we see, given the resources available (number of people and time) and which mutagens are necessary.Most of all, I am interested in what our languages imply about the structure of our brains, what problems those structures are solving and how we have adapted to be (sub) optimal.See my notes here."
231,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50989441-gordon,5,"A really well written popular-linguistics book with a great sense of humour and a very clear focus: how did grammatical structure and complexity come into being? This is closely related to the question of whether (for example) Indo-European languages are in long-term decay and losing complexity as many 19th century linguists thought. It also raises the question of whether there were ""complexity forming"" conditions in the past that are no longer around, something Deutscher is at pains to refute. I am not a linguist, but know enough about it to have wondered about this particular question for some years. It's reassuring to hear that the whole academic discipline wrestled with it for a century or so.One good thing about this focus is that it manages to give a good balance of exotic and more familiar examples (eg. English or French historical changes) without being ""just"" a bunch of fun and novel facts and cool word stuff, which some history of English books seem to fall into. Nor does it spread itself too thin trying to speculate about really early formation of words or sounds, or try to get the reader to engage with formal grammars or too much of the phonetic alphabet.I certainly am not going to think of ""gonna"" (one of his key English examples) in the same way again. I'm not sure that I'll miss the passive-reflexive form of ""to snog"", though."
232,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29824032-rouzanna-sarkissian,4,"It is with mixed feelings that I gave this book four stars. ""The Unfolding of Language"" started out as a fascinating story of the origins of language and the principles that have been driving its evolution. How and why words change, become shorter or longer, change vowels and consonants, shed one meaning to assume another - the first part of the book was captivating, and I was going to give it a firm five star rating.However, somewhere in the middle Mr. Deutscher lost me. Was it that the inner workings of linguistics were too much to hold my attention for so many pages or that it's difficult to get immersed in the nuances of Hebrew grammar without actually speaking the language, I couldn't say. But I had to read diagonally or altogether skip the most challenging paragraphs in the second half of the book (unfortunately!), which left me with an impression that the presentation of the material was rather uneven. Some of it was good for a layman, but some was definitely fit for trained linguists or people with rather professional knowledge of the subject. I am also not sure I understood the exact logic behind dividing the information between the body and the appendixes of the book, which also affected my overall impression. So, I think one may still find ""The Unfolding of Language"" enjoyable, albeit slow and loaded with too much detail here and there."
233,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83243492-benno-krojer,4,"I wish the whole book was like the last chapter: Dealing with the big picture of language and its cognitive aspects instead of too many details of specific languages. On the other side there are many books on that cognitive aspect already and less on how language continuously changes in detail. And while I was sometimes annoyed by the abundance of language-specific details, I also appreciate that Deutscher tries to remain scientific while making simplifying statements to a broad audience, by giving evidence from languages for his points and not making any points when there is no evidence. For instance he makes no claim about how even rudimentary language (what he calls the ""me Tarzan"" stage of language) emerged in the first place, since this is pure speculation.Deutscher also did I fantastic job at continuously checking in with the reader that they still know what he is trying to argue for and where this argument fits into the bigger picture (in the manner: ""now of I've shown X but bear in mind that we initially tried to prove Y..."")This book has taught me more on language than my whole Bachelor's in Computational Linguistics! First, because my courses are mostly applied Machine Learning/Computer Science but also because it is simply a very good book from someone who knows how to explain his subject!"
234,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45356256-jhst-kmil,5,"This is the first linguistics book I have ever read (apart from Because Internet which was more focused on online culture) and it covered a whole lot of linguistics in a manner that made it possible for the layman to understand what's going on.The author's concise manner of explaining the forces that crate and destroy a language and its constructs was really enlightening. The triad of economy, expressiveness and analogy is a great way for describing the cognitive machinery that is continuously altering language in certain ways. I will definitely have to re-read it, since one could a lot more out of this from a second reading. Especially the appendices. Also, the hall-mark of a good expository book is that it makes the reader see certain things with more sagacity. Prior to this, 'The Secret Language of Trees' gave me a new perspective of forests and trees and how there's so much more happening behind the curtains. Now, this book has made me keenly aware of the differences in the languages I know and how those differences could have manifested themselves through the ages via the action of order-seeking minds of human-beings.This is a solid 5-star book."
235,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82034260-nikhil,3,"For my first foray into linguistics, I think that it's fair to say that I learnt as much as I could. Guy Deutscher thankfully has an overarching premise where he proposes that languages are fluid for three reasons. For economy, which is why words and phrases are eroded for saving time and convenience, for expressiveness, which is why languages are laden with metaphors, and analogy, for understanding intentions using comparison. I found the p to f consonant shift in Germanic languages as opposed to Romance languages interesting, though I wish he had shed more light on linguistic families other than the Indo Aryan and Semitic ones, which he uses mostly for demonstrating grammatical similarities. de Troy's part is way too long to hold anyone's interest, though. Oh, and I found the Caesar joke funny. Reading this book requires a lot of patience on the part of the reader and more than an average interest in linguistics. If you have that, you just might find this to your liking. "
236,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,4,"I found this book particularly interesting because it continues past the point where other books are content to stop. I’ve read several books on linguistics aimed at the general reader and they are usually happy to stop when they have proven that the language mavens are overblowing the “decline” of their native tongue. While Deutscher is happy to give the same historical perspective of writers decrying the state of their language for the past thousand years, he also seeks to prove that the same forces behind the “decline” of languages are what build the complex systems that linguists love to praise. Writing in a style that is both compelling and easy to follow, Deutscher takes the reader through the latest discoveries in linguistics and how they have allowed us to peer back almost to the beginning of all languages. This was the most enlightening book on the development and evolution of language that I’ve ever read."
237,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7237154-sanket-patil,4,"I have always had a lot of curiosity about languages. I ponder about and often discuss with others as crazy as me about some obscure fine point concerning languages. I have spent a lot of time thinking about and discussing the complex interplay of language, thought, culture, etc. Given all this, I read The Unfolding of Language with great interest -- I almost devoured it. In this book, he author takes on the onerous task of tracing the history of language. He picks up examples from several languages to make a fairly plausible argument about how languages acquired such complexity starting from a basic set of sounds and words. He talks in detail about the role of “shortcuts” (saving breath to reduce effort) in creating new sounds and words; how metaphors and analogies brought in expressiveness to language beyond its early rudimentary, high functional purposes. The writing can seem dry and repetitive at some places. Also, there are some fairly technical details in this book, which are primarily of interest to those who are deeply into language, but you can safely skip those. It’s a highly entertaining and insightful read even otherwise. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it."
238,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5755899-michael,5,"An incredibly fascinating Indiana Jones adventure about language through time and cultures. Deutscher takes the reader on the tour in unique ways. In chapter 5 (The Forces of Creation) for example, he makes his argument through the story of a fictional academic speaker giving a talk at a conference. I found chapters 3, 4 and 5 to be my favorites along with appendices A, D, and E. To get the most out of this book it would be best to be familiar with different parts of language like word types, tenses, etc. To that end, I wish Deutscher had provided an appendix which acted as a primer or refresher on some of those. It's not strictly necessary to know a great deal about all that to get a lot out of this book, but certain chapters will go smoother with that knowledge.This was one of my favorite non-fiction books I've read so far, go read it!"
239,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4048835-rebecca,3,"Deutscher’s tone is engaging and he sets out with a very modest enterprise: to show how a complex language may in theory unfold. However, this still leaves the question: unfold from what? Since he cannot address the beginning state, it is more about historic change than an unveiling. He makes very pretty case studies, but I wonder how generalizable his theory is. A few times towards the final chapters, he also seems to suggest that all abstract concepts arose from concrete ones, which seems like a radical (and probably incorrect) view. With popular science, I always wonder what the counterarguments are, or if you can induce these changes computationally/experimentally (Pinker does a slightly better job on this front). Still, worth a read."
240,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10984529-wishkid,5,"Ok this book was simply AMAZING. I feel that anyone, ANYONE, endeavoring to learn a new language should FIRSTLY read this book! It is essentially an eagle eye's view over language itself, and the author exposes plainly and very easily (to follow) how language originated, from what and why we talk the way we do. It might sound odd to you, but halfway through this book my entire foundations of my view and understanding of life and the mind were shaken. I just never contemplated linguists or language, and was only ever fascinated with the topic. Believe me, this book took none of the fascination away but just added to it! All while giving me an entirely different perspective on language, mankind, and communications in general both past present and future. Seriously, Deutscher took a whole lot of linguistic knowledge and presented it in this very book right here beautifully, plainly, and he weaves a web of pure understanding and insight that I simply never would have without reading first this book. After having read this thing, (at the moment I am not even finished, not quite) I feel literally 100 percent more confident in picking up another language, and I have this understanding about language all across the world and how it changes that I truly hold dear. 5/5 would bang!"
241,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7521918-jesse-markus,5,"I like Guy Deutscher. I enjoyed his book Through the Language Glass, and this one was a fun read too. His main goal in writing this book is to show how complex linguistic features could have developed from the earliest, most primitive ""me Tarzan"" stages of language. Deutscher does a great job explaining how the world's language develop all their extravagant bells and whistles, and by the end of the book this explanation adds up to an argument against nativist theories put forth by the likes of Chomsky and Pinker. Deutscher also ends up demolishing a whole lot of prescriptivist notions about grammar, by illuminating the elegant, self-perpetuating cycle of destruction and creation that drives linguistic development. One can hardly mention the evolution of language without someone lamenting the current state of linguistic decay, but Deutscher puts this persistent myth to bed. Things get a little technical towards the end, and the layperson might find it a little complicated, but it's worth the effort to gain the insight and understanding that this book provides."
242,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43101325-michele,4,"This book is not about the “history” of language—although he does refer to the historic past in various places in his book. Nor is it about proto-history of language—although he does refer to proto-history of language as it can occasionally be reconstructed. This is about the nuts and bolts—the mechanical processes that change language over millennia. Deutcher leads his reader through the maze of linguistics to describe the many things that will change language. For his illustrations he draws not only from the Indo-European languages (English, French, German, Greek, Latin, etc.) but also from such Semitic languages (Afro-Asiatic) as Arabic and Hebrew and occasionaly Egyptian and Akkadian. He draws also from ancient Sumerian as well as modern Turkish. He goes into Nilo-Saharan and Yoruba in Africa as well as Australian Aborigine. All of these resources provide him with the illustrations of the variations and changes that can happen in language.I would not consider this an an easy read, but I learned a great deal."

This book makes up for it in spades (and hearts and clubs). If nothing else, this may be the first time I truly understand - not by guessing and instinct but know - terms like clauses and auxiliary's and prepositions mean. I knew how to use them before, but I didn't full comprehend - so if this book taught me nothing else, I have that. This book was, perhaps, a mistake to read during my night shifts as there were especially long passages involving semitic verb cases but I found it truly interesting. I suppose what I can glean from this book and all its lessons is that language doesn't have to be logical to make sense (or have a word for 'have' either, apparently). And that books on linguistics might be my in to that boring floor of non-fiction of the 4th floor of the library."
244,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45704606-pete-harris,4,"All languages, every human language known, changes according to a set of similar, understandable processes, and many of the irregular or strange features of any language are produced by them.Word begin with concrete meanings, get conventionalised into grammatical markers, get smooshed onto adjacent words as affixes, get shortened to ease pronunciation, get re-analysed into morphological rules by children learning the language, lose pronunciation or meaning, and get replaced as the cycle begins again with new words.This book gives an overview and examples of how this process has shaped English, Hebrew, French and others further back, such as Proto Indo-European. Some of it is speculation (because it must be, language being a lot older than writing), but it is plausible, and the author states where he's speculating rather than citing evidence.Lots of fun if you like that kind of thing. I do."

Not only does he know a lot about language; he's an expert in using it, too! The first half of the book is devoted to the history of languages and linguistic research, and it depicts the familiar landscape of continuous erosion, splitting, merging, change. The second half I found much more enlightening. There, the Author argues that the erosion of language is also its building force, and he illustrates it with many examples wrapped neatly around a short story about a girl, her father, and a mammoth, presented at various stages of language development. The fascinating topic and the Author's excellent writing make this book a very pleasant read."

Their evolution is a negotiation between economy and expressiveness. For example, laziness, especially in prononciation, causes erosion and elision; the craving for order reinforces even accidental patterns; the desire to heighten expressiveness is achieved through the insertion of extra words; and the desire to extend the reach of language is achieved through the use of metapphor from concrete domains to abstract ones.Deutscher is like an archaelogist, dusting away layers of detritus from modern language, uncovering traces of earlier generations of the language. Thus he adduces evidence for his theory.Convincing and fascinating."

It is about how language evolved. I'm in agreement with most of his argument for the manner in which language evolved, but the main reason I single out this academic work is because it is readable. So many academic works are not; and, in all fairness, could not be made so because of the arcane nature of their content.

257,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36524004-nazrul-buang,4,"Linguistics has always been a topic I'm interested in and curious to learn about, and it's been some since I last read one about it, that being Steven Pinker's 'Sense of Style'. This book has been on my to-read shelf for some time, especially after hearing about it from some online article, so I decided it's finally time to get a copy of it from the library.Author Guy Deutscher is a linguistics historian specializing in ancient Semitic languages, who sets to address the key questions: where do languages come from, and how do they end up becoming the languages that they are now. He explores the vast and winding history of languages, with special focus on the Indo-European language family, and strives to provide clarity to the concept that basically makes us human.Linguistics first piqued my interest when I learned Japanese linguistics back during my university days. Like most other first-time learners of any form of linguistics, what captured my attention is how it changes the way I see language (primarily English) altogether, addressing the question of why one can know how to speak a language without understanding why. It's one of the topics that added meaning and perspective to my daily life, and to this day I continue to read up more on linguistics just to understand why certain languages work the way they work.Deutscher takes an academic approach to the world of linguistics, starting with the debatable topic of how they were 'invented' (or more accurately, 'formed'), and then gradually working up to how the structure of languages came to be, and so forth. His writing is fairly readable and digestible for the layman, where unlike some of Pinker's works, Deutscher's writing is more simple to understand. Furthermore, he gives simple examples to demonstrate and buttress his theoretical explanations, which makes his book feel like a well thought-out lecture addressing to people who don't share his expertise background.However, despite his attempts to write for the layman, his book (and perhaps linguistics in overall) eventually caters to those in the academia. Some chapters can be dry and prolix, such as topic on the change in vowel and pronunciation over time, although this is part of the bedrock of linguistics. Plus, readers must have a very firm grasp of English and selected European and Semitic languages, as it will come in handy when appreciating Deutscher's elaborations in their linguistics.'The Unfolding of Language' is an intellectual voyage in the seas of languages, spanning through time and space as it details the subtle changes what we fail to capture along the way. Language is one of human being's methods of communication that naturally undergoes evolution, and despite the protests of purists over the gradual degradation of language, it nevertheless abides by a timeless observation, that the only thing that is constant is change. The book is not for everyone; it would generally appeal to readers with vest interest in linguistics and keen interest in how languages came about. Whilst I find some parts too academic for my liking, I enjoyed reading it as a whole and learn a bit or two about a few languages I thought I already knew, but proven to be wrong in the end."
258,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41668866-lara-liz,3,"First off, I am not recommending this book to anyone who's, at least for now, anything other than an active student of Linguistics. If you're looking for a general interest book, I'd point you towards someone like David Crystal - while Guy Deutscher is a very clever linguistic theorist and a really key voice in the field, at least in my mind, this book seem to me like he decided what he was going to say, and then figured out a more complicated way to say it. That's academia for you, I guess, but this book felt particularly bad (I found Through the Language Glass, by the same author, much better).I did really like the chapter he chose to do as if it was a transcript from a much-harried young professor's attempts to convince a room full of English purists that 'decay' (you know ""young people don't even pronounce the ends of words anymore"" kind of stuff) can actually be a good thing. I remember most of the points in that chapter really well. The rest of it, with its dense style, was more of a struggle.To be honest, as glad as I am that I read this book, maybe I didn't really need to. Turns out my English Language teacher basically constructed 90% of his change syllabus based on its salient points, and while I'm glad I got to add to these with Deutscher's more in-depth examples, some of them over-complicated it.I'm aware I'm probably judging this book for adhering to academic style expectations. But I've never really understood why we should make ideas more complicated than they need to be just in the name of making them seem more prestigiously academic, to be honest."
259,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11040524-hannah,3,"Clearly written by someone who knows their stuff and vastly superior to that dire Bill Bryson book.The trouble with non-fiction is the author can't magically know what's obvious to me and what's quite technically heavy. I'd say this is not a book for someone with zero knowledge of linguistics but it's reasonably accessible.In discussing language change he says ""Consider again the change from p to f which seems so implausible today."" Implausible? Well I have some understanding of phonetics and of Welsh so it doesn't seem strange at all. Other language may change consonants over centuries but Welsh mutates from sentence to sentence. I'm surprised he doesn't refer to a Celtic language in this section as the analogy would be very helpful. Ble mae'r Cymraeg?The author also says ""Moreover, there is no system of communication today that is in the process of developing its first articulate words, so there are no parallells from the present to go on."" My question is what about sign languages? Can watching sign languages develop help us to learn about the evolution of language?One analogy is that languages are like traffic jams. People don't intend to create a traffic jam but their cumulative actions create one.His point about ""order-craving minds"" makes sense. ""If there is any element of 'invention' in language, it is surely the mind's craving for order - the instinctive difficulty to accept that so much is just random, arbitrary and coincidental."""
260,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29089487-alex-telfar,4,"The book was quite interesting, but, it left me full of speculation and hungry for evidence. Guy tries to argue that there cannot be evidence for many of the claims due to the our partial view of history, but I think he discounts (or is unaware of) how evidence can be provided by formal proof and numerical simulation. How does language evolve? According to Guy; energy saving shortcuts, decay of meaning, abstraction, the order-craving mind each interact and push and pull or words and structure to give what we see.There is also a level more of explanation and rigor required to make his argument truly interesting. Cool, we know it did happen (as can be seen from the history books), but why did it happen? Guy puts forward some nice candidate hypotheses, but does little to prove them. The main thing I would like you know is whether the four proposed mutagens are sufficient to build the languages we see, given the resources available (number of people and time) and which mutagens are necessary.Most of all, I am interested in what our languages imply about the structure of our brains, what problems those structures are solving and how we have adapted to be (sub) optimal.See my notes here."
261,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50989441-gordon,5,"A really well written popular-linguistics book with a great sense of humour and a very clear focus: how did grammatical structure and complexity come into being? This is closely related to the question of whether (for example) Indo-European languages are in long-term decay and losing complexity as many 19th century linguists thought. It also raises the question of whether there were ""complexity forming"" conditions in the past that are no longer around, something Deutscher is at pains to refute. I am not a linguist, but know enough about it to have wondered about this particular question for some years. It's reassuring to hear that the whole academic discipline wrestled with it for a century or so.One good thing about this focus is that it manages to give a good balance of exotic and more familiar examples (eg. English or French historical changes) without being ""just"" a bunch of fun and novel facts and cool word stuff, which some history of English books seem to fall into. Nor does it spread itself too thin trying to speculate about really early formation of words or sounds, or try to get the reader to engage with formal grammars or too much of the phonetic alphabet.I certainly am not going to think of ""gonna"" (one of his key English examples) in the same way again. I'm not sure that I'll miss the passive-reflexive form of ""to snog"", though."
262,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29824032-rouzanna-sarkissian,4,"It is with mixed feelings that I gave this book four stars. ""The Unfolding of Language"" started out as a fascinating story of the origins of language and the principles that have been driving its evolution. How and why words change, become shorter or longer, change vowels and consonants, shed one meaning to assume another - the first part of the book was captivating, and I was going to give it a firm five star rating.However, somewhere in the middle Mr. Deutscher lost me. Was it that the inner workings of linguistics were too much to hold my attention for so many pages or that it's difficult to get immersed in the nuances of Hebrew grammar without actually speaking the language, I couldn't say. But I had to read diagonally or altogether skip the most challenging paragraphs in the second half of the book (unfortunately!), which left me with an impression that the presentation of the material was rather uneven. Some of it was good for a layman, but some was definitely fit for trained linguists or people with rather professional knowledge of the subject. I am also not sure I understood the exact logic behind dividing the information between the body and the appendixes of the book, which also affected my overall impression. So, I think one may still find ""The Unfolding of Language"" enjoyable, albeit slow and loaded with too much detail here and there."
263,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83243492-benno-krojer,4,"I wish the whole book was like the last chapter: Dealing with the big picture of language and its cognitive aspects instead of too many details of specific languages. On the other side there are many books on that cognitive aspect already and less on how language continuously changes in detail. And while I was sometimes annoyed by the abundance of language-specific details, I also appreciate that Deutscher tries to remain scientific while making simplifying statements to a broad audience, by giving evidence from languages for his points and not making any points when there is no evidence. For instance he makes no claim about how even rudimentary language (what he calls the ""me Tarzan"" stage of language) emerged in the first place, since this is pure speculation.Deutscher also did I fantastic job at continuously checking in with the reader that they still know what he is trying to argue for and where this argument fits into the bigger picture (in the manner: ""now of I've shown X but bear in mind that we initially tried to prove Y..."")This book has taught me more on language than my whole Bachelor's in Computational Linguistics! First, because my courses are mostly applied Machine Learning/Computer Science but also because it is simply a very good book from someone who knows how to explain his subject!"
264,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45356256-jhst-kmil,5,"This is the first linguistics book I have ever read (apart from Because Internet which was more focused on online culture) and it covered a whole lot of linguistics in a manner that made it possible for the layman to understand what's going on.The author's concise manner of explaining the forces that crate and destroy a language and its constructs was really enlightening. The triad of economy, expressiveness and analogy is a great way for describing the cognitive machinery that is continuously altering language in certain ways. I will definitely have to re-read it, since one could a lot more out of this from a second reading. Especially the appendices. Also, the hall-mark of a good expository book is that it makes the reader see certain things with more sagacity. Prior to this, 'The Secret Language of Trees' gave me a new perspective of forests and trees and how there's so much more happening behind the curtains. Now, this book has made me keenly aware of the differences in the languages I know and how those differences could have manifested themselves through the ages via the action of order-seeking minds of human-beings.This is a solid 5-star book."
265,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82034260-nikhil,3,"For my first foray into linguistics, I think that it's fair to say that I learnt as much as I could. Guy Deutscher thankfully has an overarching premise where he proposes that languages are fluid for three reasons. For economy, which is why words and phrases are eroded for saving time and convenience, for expressiveness, which is why languages are laden with metaphors, and analogy, for understanding intentions using comparison. I found the p to f consonant shift in Germanic languages as opposed to Romance languages interesting, though I wish he had shed more light on linguistic families other than the Indo Aryan and Semitic ones, which he uses mostly for demonstrating grammatical similarities. de Troy's part is way too long to hold anyone's interest, though. Oh, and I found the Caesar joke funny. Reading this book requires a lot of patience on the part of the reader and more than an average interest in linguistics. If you have that, you just might find this to your liking. "
266,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,4,"I found this book particularly interesting because it continues past the point where other books are content to stop. I’ve read several books on linguistics aimed at the general reader and they are usually happy to stop when they have proven that the language mavens are overblowing the “decline” of their native tongue. While Deutscher is happy to give the same historical perspective of writers decrying the state of their language for the past thousand years, he also seeks to prove that the same forces behind the “decline” of languages are what build the complex systems that linguists love to praise. Writing in a style that is both compelling and easy to follow, Deutscher takes the reader through the latest discoveries in linguistics and how they have allowed us to peer back almost to the beginning of all languages. This was the most enlightening book on the development and evolution of language that I’ve ever read."
267,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7237154-sanket-patil,4,"I have always had a lot of curiosity about languages. I ponder about and often discuss with others as crazy as me about some obscure fine point concerning languages. I have spent a lot of time thinking about and discussing the complex interplay of language, thought, culture, etc. Given all this, I read The Unfolding of Language with great interest -- I almost devoured it. In this book, he author takes on the onerous task of tracing the history of language. He picks up examples from several languages to make a fairly plausible argument about how languages acquired such complexity starting from a basic set of sounds and words. He talks in detail about the role of “shortcuts” (saving breath to reduce effort) in creating new sounds and words; how metaphors and analogies brought in expressiveness to language beyond its early rudimentary, high functional purposes. The writing can seem dry and repetitive at some places. Also, there are some fairly technical details in this book, which are primarily of interest to those who are deeply into language, but you can safely skip those. It’s a highly entertaining and insightful read even otherwise. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it."
268,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5755899-michael,5,"An incredibly fascinating Indiana Jones adventure about language through time and cultures. Deutscher takes the reader on the tour in unique ways. In chapter 5 (The Forces of Creation) for example, he makes his argument through the story of a fictional academic speaker giving a talk at a conference. I found chapters 3, 4 and 5 to be my favorites along with appendices A, D, and E. To get the most out of this book it would be best to be familiar with different parts of language like word types, tenses, etc. To that end, I wish Deutscher had provided an appendix which acted as a primer or refresher on some of those. It's not strictly necessary to know a great deal about all that to get a lot out of this book, but certain chapters will go smoother with that knowledge.This was one of my favorite non-fiction books I've read so far, go read it!"
269,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4048835-rebecca,3,"Deutscher’s tone is engaging and he sets out with a very modest enterprise: to show how a complex language may in theory unfold. However, this still leaves the question: unfold from what? Since he cannot address the beginning state, it is more about historic change than an unveiling. He makes very pretty case studies, but I wonder how generalizable his theory is. A few times towards the final chapters, he also seems to suggest that all abstract concepts arose from concrete ones, which seems like a radical (and probably incorrect) view. With popular science, I always wonder what the counterarguments are, or if you can induce these changes computationally/experimentally (Pinker does a slightly better job on this front). Still, worth a read."
270,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10984529-wishkid,5,"Ok this book was simply AMAZING. I feel that anyone, ANYONE, endeavoring to learn a new language should FIRSTLY read this book! It is essentially an eagle eye's view over language itself, and the author exposes plainly and very easily (to follow) how language originated, from what and why we talk the way we do. It might sound odd to you, but halfway through this book my entire foundations of my view and understanding of life and the mind were shaken. I just never contemplated linguists or language, and was only ever fascinated with the topic. Believe me, this book took none of the fascination away but just added to it! All while giving me an entirely different perspective on language, mankind, and communications in general both past present and future. Seriously, Deutscher took a whole lot of linguistic knowledge and presented it in this very book right here beautifully, plainly, and he weaves a web of pure understanding and insight that I simply never would have without reading first this book. After having read this thing, (at the moment I am not even finished, not quite) I feel literally 100 percent more confident in picking up another language, and I have this understanding about language all across the world and how it changes that I truly hold dear. 5/5 would bang!"
271,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7521918-jesse-markus,5,"I like Guy Deutscher. I enjoyed his book Through the Language Glass, and this one was a fun read too. His main goal in writing this book is to show how complex linguistic features could have developed from the earliest, most primitive ""me Tarzan"" stages of language. Deutscher does a great job explaining how the world's language develop all their extravagant bells and whistles, and by the end of the book this explanation adds up to an argument against nativist theories put forth by the likes of Chomsky and Pinker. Deutscher also ends up demolishing a whole lot of prescriptivist notions about grammar, by illuminating the elegant, self-perpetuating cycle of destruction and creation that drives linguistic development. One can hardly mention the evolution of language without someone lamenting the current state of linguistic decay, but Deutscher puts this persistent myth to bed. Things get a little technical towards the end, and the layperson might find it a little complicated, but it's worth the effort to gain the insight and understanding that this book provides."
272,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/43101325-michele,4,"This book is not about the “history” of language—although he does refer to the historic past in various places in his book. Nor is it about proto-history of language—although he does refer to proto-history of language as it can occasionally be reconstructed. This is about the nuts and bolts—the mechanical processes that change language over millennia. Deutcher leads his reader through the maze of linguistics to describe the many things that will change language. For his illustrations he draws not only from the Indo-European languages (English, French, German, Greek, Latin, etc.) but also from such Semitic languages (Afro-Asiatic) as Arabic and Hebrew and occasionaly Egyptian and Akkadian. He draws also from ancient Sumerian as well as modern Turkish. He goes into Nilo-Saharan and Yoruba in Africa as well as Australian Aborigine. All of these resources provide him with the illustrations of the variations and changes that can happen in language.I would not consider this an an easy read, but I learned a great deal."
273,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19501892-heather-wickett,4,"While I very much enjoyed Through the Language Glass, at times I would have preferred a bit more grammatical explanation. This book makes up for it in spades (and hearts and clubs). If nothing else, this may be the first time I truly understand - not by guessing and instinct but know - terms like clauses and auxiliary's and prepositions mean. I knew how to use them before, but I didn't full comprehend - so if this book taught me nothing else, I have that. This book was, perhaps, a mistake to read during my night shifts as there were especially long passages involving semitic verb cases but I found it truly interesting. I suppose what I can glean from this book and all its lessons is that language doesn't have to be logical to make sense (or have a word for 'have' either, apparently). And that books on linguistics might be my in to that boring floor of non-fiction of the 4th floor of the library."
274,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45704606-pete-harris,4,"All languages, every human language known, changes according to a set of similar, understandable processes, and many of the irregular or strange features of any language are produced by them.Word begin with concrete meanings, get conventionalised into grammatical markers, get smooshed onto adjacent words as affixes, get shortened to ease pronunciation, get re-analysed into morphological rules by children learning the language, lose pronunciation or meaning, and get replaced as the cycle begins again with new words.This book gives an overview and examples of how this process has shaped English, Hebrew, French and others further back, such as Proto Indo-European. Some of it is speculation (because it must be, language being a lot older than writing), but it is plausible, and the author states where he's speculating rather than citing evidence.Lots of fun if you like that kind of thing. I do."

It took me quite a long time to finish it, but the fact that I'm not a native english speaker was partly to blame... BUT, otherwise it's a GREAT book if you're interested in the topic! It really teaches the basic and worldwide principles that 'move' languages.Of course the book is oversimplified but without downgrading the quality of information it gives. At some points, the author proceeds in a greater depth to answer questions that I haven't even thought about before!It's writing style is really pleasant and yet academic, with many examples and even some jokes here and there!I highly suggest it if you're into linguistics!

Not only does he know a lot about language; he's an expert in using it, too! The first half of the book is devoted to the history of languages and linguistic research, and it depicts the familiar landscape of continuous erosion, splitting, merging, change. The second half I found much more enlightening. There, the Author argues that the erosion of language is also its building force, and he illustrates it with many examples wrapped neatly around a short story about a girl, her father, and a mammoth, presented at various stages of language development. The fascinating topic and the Author's excellent writing make this book a very pleasant read."
277,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5982358-derek-bridge,5,"This brilliant book uncovers the forces that shape modern languages. Their evolution is a negotiation between economy and expressiveness. For example, laziness, especially in prononciation, causes erosion and elision; the craving for order reinforces even accidental patterns; the desire to heighten expressiveness is achieved through the insertion of extra words; and the desire to extend the reach of language is achieved through the use of metapphor from concrete domains to abstract ones.Deutscher is like an archaelogist, dusting away layers of detritus from modern language, uncovering traces of earlier generations of the language. Thus he adduces evidence for his theory.Convincing and fascinating."

It is about how language evolved. I'm in agreement with most of his argument for the manner in which language evolved, but the main reason I single out this academic work is because it is readable. So many academic works are not; and, in all fairness, could not be made so because of the arcane nature of their content. Deutscher, however, makes an effort to reach out, not just to fellow linguists, but to all those interested in language. A very good read."

Helps understand how language evolves, how it could have developed from the ""Me Tarzan"" phase into modern language, and which forces have shaped it. I found it very insightful, mostly entertaining, although some parts were quite hard to understand for a non-linguist and non-english native reader (not used to all the english grammar terms). I definitely recommend to read it on paper. I read it on Kindle and the book is full of examples which need to be magnified, which is a hassle on the kindle and sometimes the magnification failed on smaller examples.

Whilst I find some parts too academic for my liking, I enjoyed reading it as a whole and learn a bit or two about a few languages I thought I already knew, but proven to be wrong in the end."
288,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/41668866-lara-liz,3,"First off, I am not recommending this book to anyone who's, at least for now, anything other than an active student of Linguistics. If you're looking for a general interest book, I'd point you towards someone like David Crystal - while Guy Deutscher is a very clever linguistic theorist and a really key voice in the field, at least in my mind, this book seem to me like he decided what he was going to say, and then figured out a more complicated way to say it. That's academia for you, I guess, but this book felt particularly bad (I found Through the Language Glass, by the same author, much better).I did really like the chapter he chose to do as if it was a transcript from a much-harried young professor's attempts to convince a room full of English purists that 'decay' (you know ""young people don't even pronounce the ends of words anymore"" kind of stuff) can actually be a good thing. I remember most of the points in that chapter really well. The rest of it, with its dense style, was more of a struggle.To be honest, as glad as I am that I read this book, maybe I didn't really need to. Turns out my English Language teacher basically constructed 90% of his change syllabus based on its salient points, and while I'm glad I got to add to these with Deutscher's more in-depth examples, some of them over-complicated it.I'm aware I'm probably judging this book for adhering to academic style expectations. But I've never really understood why we should make ideas more complicated than they need to be just in the name of making them seem more prestigiously academic, to be honest."
289,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11040524-hannah,3,"Clearly written by someone who knows their stuff and vastly superior to that dire Bill Bryson book.The trouble with non-fiction is the author can't magically know what's obvious to me and what's quite technically heavy. I'd say this is not a book for someone with zero knowledge of linguistics but it's reasonably accessible.In discussing language change he says ""Consider again the change from p to f which seems so implausible today."" Implausible? Well I have some understanding of phonetics and of Welsh so it doesn't seem strange at all. Other language may change consonants over centuries but Welsh mutates from sentence to sentence. I'm surprised he doesn't refer to a Celtic language in this section as the analogy would be very helpful. Ble mae'r Cymraeg?The author also says ""Moreover, there is no system of communication today that is in the process of developing its first articulate words, so there are no parallells from the present to go on."" My question is what about sign languages? Can watching sign languages develop help us to learn about the evolution of language?One analogy is that languages are like traffic jams. People don't intend to create a traffic jam but their cumulative actions create one.His point about ""order-craving minds"" makes sense. ""If there is any element of 'invention' in language, it is surely the mind's craving for order - the instinctive difficulty to accept that so much is just random, arbitrary and coincidental."""
290,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29089487-alex-telfar,4,"The book was quite interesting, but, it left me full of speculation and hungry for evidence. Guy tries to argue that there cannot be evidence for many of the claims due to the our partial view of history, but I think he discounts (or is unaware of) how evidence can be provided by formal proof and numerical simulation. How does language evolve? According to Guy; energy saving shortcuts, decay of meaning, abstraction, the order-craving mind each interact and push and pull or words and structure to give what we see.There is also a level more of explanation and rigor required to make his argument truly interesting. Cool, we know it did happen (as can be seen from the history books), but why did it happen? Guy puts forward some nice candidate hypotheses, but does little to prove them. The main thing I would like you know is whether the four proposed mutagens are sufficient to build the languages we see, given the resources available (number of people and time) and which mutagens are necessary.Most of all, I am interested in what our languages imply about the structure of our brains, what problems those structures are solving and how we have adapted to be (sub) optimal.See my notes here."
291,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50989441-gordon,5,"A really well written popular-linguistics book with a great sense of humour and a very clear focus: how did grammatical structure and complexity come into being? This is closely related to the question of whether (for example) Indo-European languages are in long-term decay and losing complexity as many 19th century linguists thought. It also raises the question of whether there were ""complexity forming"" conditions in the past that are no longer around, something Deutscher is at pains to refute. I am not a linguist, but know enough about it to have wondered about this particular question for some years. It's reassuring to hear that the whole academic discipline wrestled with it for a century or so.One good thing about this focus is that it manages to give a good balance of exotic and more familiar examples (eg. English or French historical changes) without being ""just"" a bunch of fun and novel facts and cool word stuff, which some history of English books seem to fall into. Nor does it spread itself too thin trying to speculate about really early formation of words or sounds, or try to get the reader to engage with formal grammars or too much of the phonetic alphabet.I certainly am not going to think of ""gonna"" (one of his key English examples) in the same way again. I'm not sure that I'll miss the passive-reflexive form of ""to snog"", though."
292,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29824032-rouzanna-sarkissian,4,"It is with mixed feelings that I gave this book four stars. ""The Unfolding of Language"" started out as a fascinating story of the origins of language and the principles that have been driving its evolution. How and why words change, become shorter or longer, change vowels and consonants, shed one meaning to assume another - the first part of the book was captivating, and I was going to give it a firm five star rating.However, somewhere in the middle Mr. Deutscher lost me. Was it that the inner workings of linguistics were too much to hold my attention for so many pages or that it's difficult to get immersed in the nuances of Hebrew grammar without actually speaking the language, I couldn't say. But I had to read diagonally or altogether skip the most challenging paragraphs in the second half of the book (unfortunately!), which left me with an impression that the presentation of the material was rather uneven. Some of it was good for a layman, but some was definitely fit for trained linguists or people with rather professional knowledge of the subject. I am also not sure I understood the exact logic behind dividing the information between the body and the appendixes of the book, which also affected my overall impression. So, I think one may still find ""The Unfolding of Language"" enjoyable, albeit slow and loaded with too much detail here and there."
293,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83243492-benno-krojer,4,"I wish the whole book was like the last chapter: Dealing with the big picture of language and its cognitive aspects instead of too many details of specific languages. On the other side there are many books on that cognitive aspect already and less on how language continuously changes in detail. And while I was sometimes annoyed by the abundance of language-specific details, I also appreciate that Deutscher tries to remain scientific while making simplifying statements to a broad audience, by giving evidence from languages for his points and not making any points when there is no evidence. For instance he makes no claim about how even rudimentary language (what he calls the ""me Tarzan"" stage of language) emerged in the first place, since this is pure speculation.Deutscher also did I fantastic job at continuously checking in with the reader that they still know what he is trying to argue for and where this argument fits into the bigger picture (in the manner: ""now of I've shown X but bear in mind that we initially tried to prove Y..."")This book has taught me more on language than my whole Bachelor's in Computational Linguistics! First, because my courses are mostly applied Machine Learning/Computer Science but also because it is simply a very good book from someone who knows how to explain his subject!"
294,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/45356256-jhst-kmil,5,"This is the first linguistics book I have ever read (apart from Because Internet which was more focused on online culture) and it covered a whole lot of linguistics in a manner that made it possible for the layman to understand what's going on.The author's concise manner of explaining the forces that crate and destroy a language and its constructs was really enlightening. The triad of economy, expressiveness and analogy is a great way for describing the cognitive machinery that is continuously altering language in certain ways. I will definitely have to re-read it, since one could a lot more out of this from a second reading. Especially the appendices. Also, the hall-mark of a good expository book is that it makes the reader see certain things with more sagacity. Prior to this, 'The Secret Language of Trees' gave me a new perspective of forests and trees and how there's so much more happening behind the curtains. Now, this book has made me keenly aware of the differences in the languages I know and how those differences could have manifested themselves through the ages via the action of order-seeking minds of human-beings.This is a solid 5-star book."
295,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/82034260-nikhil,3,"For my first foray into linguistics, I think that it's fair to say that I learnt as much as I could. Guy Deutscher thankfully has an overarching premise where he proposes that languages are fluid for three reasons. For economy, which is why words and phrases are eroded for saving time and convenience, for expressiveness, which is why languages are laden with metaphors, and analogy, for understanding intentions using comparison. I found the p to f consonant shift in Germanic languages as opposed to Romance languages interesting, though I wish he had shed more light on linguistic families other than the Indo Aryan and Semitic ones, which he uses mostly for demonstrating grammatical similarities. de Troy's part is way too long to hold anyone's interest, though. Oh, and I found the Caesar joke funny. Reading this book requires a lot of patience on the part of the reader and more than an average interest in linguistics. If you have that, you just might find this to your liking. "
296,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3941555-carlos,4,"I found this book particularly interesting because it continues past the point where other books are content to stop. I’ve read several books on linguistics aimed at the general reader and they are usually happy to stop when they have proven that the language mavens are overblowing the “decline” of their native tongue. While Deutscher is happy to give the same historical perspective of writers decrying the state of their language for the past thousand years, he also seeks to prove that the same forces behind the “decline” of languages are what build the complex systems that linguists love to praise. Writing in a style that is both compelling and easy to follow, Deutscher takes the reader through the latest discoveries in linguistics and how they have allowed us to peer back almost to the beginning of all languages. This was the most enlightening book on the development and evolution of language that I’ve ever read."
297,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7237154-sanket-patil,4,"I have always had a lot of curiosity about languages. I ponder about and often discuss with others as crazy as me about some obscure fine point concerning languages. I have spent a lot of time thinking about and discussing the complex interplay of language, thought, culture, etc. Given all this, I read The Unfolding of Language with great interest -- I almost devoured it. In this book, he author takes on the onerous task of tracing the history of language. He picks up examples from several languages to make a fairly plausible argument about how languages acquired such complexity starting from a basic set of sounds and words. He talks in detail about the role of “shortcuts” (saving breath to reduce effort) in creating new sounds and words; how metaphors and analogies brought in expressiveness to language beyond its early rudimentary, high functional purposes. The writing can seem dry and repetitive at some places. Also, there are some fairly technical details in this book, which are primarily of interest to those who are deeply into language, but you can safely skip those. It’s a highly entertaining and insightful read even otherwise. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it."
298,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5755899-michael,5,"An incredibly fascinating Indiana Jones adventure about language through time and cultures. Deutscher takes the reader on the tour in unique ways. In chapter 5 (The Forces of Creation) for example, he makes his argument through the story of a fictional academic speaker giving a talk at a conference. I found chapters 3, 4 and 5 to be my favorites along with appendices A, D, and E. To get the most out of this book it would be best to be familiar with different parts of language like word types, tenses, etc. To that end, I wish Deutscher had provided an appendix which acted as a primer or refresher on some of those. It's not strictly necessary to know a great deal about all that to get a lot out of this book, but certain chapters will go smoother with that knowledge.This was one of my favorite non-fiction books I've read so far, go read it!"
299,0805080120,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4048835-rebecca,3,"Deutscher’s tone is engaging and he sets out with a very modest enterprise: to show how a complex language may in theory unfold. However, this still leaves the question: unfold from what? Since he cannot address the beginning state, it is more about historic change than an unveiling. He makes very pretty case studies, but I wonder how generalizable his theory is. A few times towards the final chapters, he also seems to suggest that all abstract concepts arose from concrete ones, which seems like a radical (and probably incorrect) view. With popular science, I always wonder what the counterarguments are, or if you can induce these changes computationally/experimentally (Pinker does a slightly better job on this front). Still, worth a read."
