0,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/146952-grumpus,3,"It’s the history of all of us. . . and we’re more alike than most people know. Mitochondrial Eve (our common female ancestor) lived fewer than 200,000 years ago and thus shows the recency of our common ancestry. “Some people might like to believe that genetic mixing of people from different groups is rare—and that their ancestors certainly didn’t mix with hoi polloi. But groups have many ways of mixing.”By comparing the DNA sequences of people all over the world, geneticists have found 85% of the total amount of genetic difference in humans occurs within groups and only 15% between populations. As the author puts it, “In other words, most genetic variants occur in all human populations. Geneticists have to look hard to find variants concentrated in specific groups. This pattern is not found in most other animals. Most biologists feel that group genetic differences have to exceed 25%-30% for a single species to be divided into subspecies or races. By this measure, human races do not exist.”That is a profound statement! “Most African-Americans have European ancestors; all European Americans have African ancestors. Race disguises rather than acknowledges our multifaceted histories.” Showing how insignificant these differences are the author states, “The genetic variants affecting skin color and facial features probably involve a few hundred of the billions of nucleotides in a person’s DNA. Yet societies have built elaborate systems of privilege and control around these miniscule genetic differences.”Just think about it, just ten generations ago each of us had 1,024 great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandparents and most of us got our surname from just one of them. Twenty generations ago, we each had more than a million ancestors and at thirty generations we had more than a billion—more than were actually alive back in the time. This is the result of what the author terms “circles of inheritance”—whereby you have individuals contributing to your ancestry through more than one branch of your family tree. It has to do with cousins marrying each other and gets quite complicated.The end result reminds me of two infamous songs, We Are The World and We Are Family. So, shouldn’t we be able to get along better?"
1,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26055396-sense-of-history,2,"This book has not made me any wiser about the earliest human history, compared to works I previously read by Douglas Palmer and Adam Rutherford. Steve Olson (° 1956) provides an introduction to what genetic research has yielded, at least up to the date of the publication of this book, 2002, and unfortunately that is far too long ago in this rapidly evolving sector. For example, he maintains that Neandertal and Sapiens never produced progeny together, because no Neandertal genetic material has been found in our species; that was later clearly refuted.Plus, Olson is a science journalist, not a scientist. This has the advantage that this book is very readable, but at the same time regularly contains factual errors. For example, he clearly misrepresents Jewish history by referring to the mythical kingdoms of David and Solomon. And according to him, the megalith builders were hunter-gatherers who responded to the advent of agriculture, a very curious and speculative theory. Also his long chapter on the origin of languages is a very strange element in this book. In other words, for a thorough overview of the genetic evolution of our species, you should not depend on Olson. Rather, the book's merit lies in its focus on refuting racial theory! Olson comes back to this time and again: making a racial distinction between people has no biological basis, and certainly no genetic: “Human groups are too closely related to differ in any but the most superficial ways. The genetic study of our past is revealing that the cultural differences between groups could not have biological origins. Those differences must result instead from the experiences individuals have had”. As mentioned, Olson comes back to this at random, but he also puts forward solid arguments. I only have the impression that he does this just a little too diligently, and doing so also wipes out all the cultural differences of people. And that of course is a bridge too far."

See my review in my History account on Goodreads: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...."
3,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3094832-steve,3,"Mid 3. Olson traces the evolution of mankind across four continents, and in doing so begs the question of whether racial distinctions are nothing more than historical accidents. According to his account everyone alive today can trace their biological roots to a small group of anatomically modern humans inhabiting the grasslands of Eastern Africa some 100,000 years ago. The four most momentous events in the prehistory of human evolution all probably occurred within 500 miles of the equator. Around 6 million years ago, a population of African apes split into two distinct species which would lead to humans and chimpanzees. Subsequently, more than 4 million years ago one of the species on the evolutionary path to humans adopted bipedality, which may have been a significant factor behind brain development. Then, about 2 million years ago, one species of biped assimilated tool-making skills, thereby earning the genus name 'Homo'. At the end of this chain of events, some 100,000 years ago, a new group within the genus 'Homo' appeared which were both more mobile, and had higher level cognitive ability. Yet, Olson is at pains to point out that human evolution should not be regarded as a smooth process from lower to higher forms, but rather, a product of a winnowing process where failed evolutionary experiments became extinct along the way. Moreover, at various points of this evolutionary timetable several forms of human species co-inhabited the planet. Prior to evidence from genetic research, one theory of human evolution which held sway was that of 'multiregionalism' which regarded racial differences as denoting descent from different species. Thereby Africans were partly descended from Homo sapiens, Asians partly from Homo erectus and Europeans partly from Neandertals. However, in 1987 a team of Berkeley molecular biologists studying mitochondria in human cells brought such theories under intense criticism. Mitochondria are maternally transmitted which led the team to propose that logically all humans descend from one original female - the mitochondrial Eve. The diversity which characterises the human population has arisen as the process of each cell replicating its DNA is not perfect,and therefore, 'mutations' occur, and are passed onto descendants. Olson ascribes such racial differences as resulting from the tribal phase of human history when gene flow could have been restricted by geographical barriers The lack of any basis in regarding racial differences as explaining genetic differences can best be evidenced by the fact geneticists have discovered that 85% of total genetic variation occurs within groups and only 15% between groups. This is of paramount importance as for any species to be divisable into sub-species, there should exist at least 25-30% genetic variation. fascinating though this central premise is, the author has not been able to enthuse this reader with his overall style."
4,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4996855-timothy-riley,3,"This was a quick read relative to the subject matter, informative but not too technical. The basic premise is that the human species is incredibly alike regardless of our visual differences. Race is nothing but a human construct designed to neatly put groups in categories but doesn't reflect DNA similiarities. The most interesting part of this book concerns the migrations out of Africa, about how there were several attempts and then maybe returns to Africa and the bottleneck that modern Egpyt and the Holy Land made to get to Asia and Europe. The caves of Skhul and Tabun in modern Israel prove that neanderthals and modern humans lived side by side and that neaderthals lived in Tabun both before and after modern humans joined them nearby. The rest is a mystery. A group of AFricans in Southern AFrica are members of the Cohen haplotype and it seems were a group who migrated or intermixed with Jewish people, possibly traders and matches their foundation story in a sense, long thought to be nothing but a silly myth. The other interesting point is that they groups most closely related to modern Native Americans (most proclaimed native americans are mostly mixed with Europeans and Africans) are previously nomadic peoples in Central Asia, Mongolia and NOT those groups closest to the Bering strait. The eventual horse culture similiarities are interesting there too. The "
5,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18605208-sally-hegedus,5,"In this wonderful book, Olson explores the origin of Homo sapiens and our eventual migrations to populate the globe. The bulk of the book focuses on the latest genetic research using DNA analysis to discover just where we all come from. How do humans genetically differ from one another, and more importantly, what does research tell us we all of us have in common? Olson argues strongly, and backs it up with science, that the human race is one; that we are all the product on interbreeding and the mixing of genes, that we all have literally common ancestors, that no one of us is racially ""pure"" and that, indeed , the very concept of biologically distinct races has become obsolete in light of recent research findings. It's fascinating stuff and should be required reading in schools; it's past time to put an end to ignorance and racism, and hopefully this well-researched and well-written book provides one more step along the road toward truth, equality and compassion for all.We're all mongrels and mutts with no pedigrees! I find that beautiful. Very recommended. "
6,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1860243-stig,3,"The scientific part of this book is fascinating reading. Olson gives a great account of how mankind evolved in Africa and spread to the rest of the world, along with some interesting case studies such as that of the Lemba people in Zimbabwe and South Africa who - based on genetic evidence - have Jewish ancestors. Also includes a good explanation of why we all have ancestors from all corners of the world. For me, the book is marred by a certain amount of preachiness, but if one can abstract from that, it is a good read."

8,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2751704-prasan-kaikini,3,"With a grandiose title such as this, I was expecting a lot more from this book. The book is very light on the science of genetics and how it helps in tracing human history and migration. he author does describe how mitochondrial DNA and the Y chromosome are used in tracing genetic ancestry, but it lacks the depth I was expecting. Since genetics is probabilistic and not deterministic the author cautions against using genetics as a basis for inheritance or anti-discrimination laws. The main thesis of the book is that all humans have the same genetic roots originating in eastern Africa about 200,000 years ago. I wonder if (or how) the recent discovery of homo sapien skeletons in Morocco, dating to about 300,000 years changes any of these arguments. "
9,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69281955-becca,4,"As an bio-anthro major, I thought it was a great overview of human genetic history. I very much liked the way it was set up by region, starting with Africa and working its way out, to model the migration of modern humans around the globe. I also liked that Olson made a point to pull research from geneticists that not only were interested in the genetics of certain parts of the world, but were also from the same region they study. The book is a little outdated though, as it mentions several times that Neanderthals had little to no contribution to our genomes, when in reality this was disproven after the book was written. "

14,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12179378-jenny,1,"I purchased Mapping Human History: Genes, Race, and Our Common Origins thinking I'd found an in-depth discussion of the genetic aspect of the origin and spread of Homo. After all, it was a National Book Award Finalist, and a Discover Best Science Book of the Year. Ordinarily such accolades mean little to me, but in the case of a non-specialist who, I hoped, would have a new take on the issue, I appreciated the professional nod.I'm sure it's no surprise from my introduction to say that I was terribly disappointed in this book. Aside from it's inane simplicity, it's years behind even my non-specialist's knowledge. Olson belabors the invalidation of the Multi-Regional theory in favor of the Out-of-Africa theory, simplifies mitochondrial research to the point of senselessness, and somehow finds it necessary to re-open the ""there's no biological basis for race"" argument.Nevertheless, in the hundred-or-so pages I managed before becoming disgusted, I did learn some things. I'll start with an excellent quote from page three regarding the postulated lack of interbreeding between groups of early humans: ""This conclusion seems totally at odds with our knowledge of human history, which shows that groups of people have eagerly interbred at almost every opportunity.""- Ju/'huoansi is the self-name of the group commonly known as the !Kung San. San is a term that can mean ""untrustworthy"".- In contast to what I'd considered the intuitive response, new species are rapidly formed in the central territory of the parent species, rather than on the periphery. My own thinking involved the reproductive isolation of those groups on the outside, allowing them to slowly branch off. However, rethinking in the light of evidence did lead me to consider that those in the center of the territory have a greater need for a reproductive advantage, thus increasing selectivity and accelerating speciation.- The ""Bushmen"" (also regarded as derogative term, but with nothing better available) have the oldest mitochondrial haplotypes in the world, making their territory the most likely origin point.- Any person (historical figure or otherwise) who lived more than 1600 years ago and had a child and grandchild is almost certainly an ancester of almost everyone in the current population. Historical figures, such as kings and conquerers, are even more likely to be in this category because of their prolific progeny. So, you're almost all descended from Nefertiti, Confuscious, and Julius Caesar.- It's been genetically found that 5-10% of the men noted on birth certificates are not the biological fathers. Nonpaternity is higher for the first and last born.2006-07-13"
15,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63971348-juanita-rice,3,"I am glad to have read this book. I had a general idea of the information about genetic tracking of human beings to common ancestry, about possible interbreeding with other primate/human-types like Neandertals [sic:], and of course the scientific evidence debunking ideas of race, of relative racial ""inborn"" differences, of ""difference"" itself perhaps. It was good to read more deeply in these topics, and Olson does a credible job of making such complicated science intelligible to a non-specialist.There are many fascinating related topics in the book, and to me the most fascinating was the idea of the ""universal Eve,""--a single individual to whom all existing genetic material may be traced. Less simplistically than that sounds, the theory has to do with differentials in inherited genes from women and men. Once a woman's genes enter the ""stream,"" they are retained in offspring differently than genetic inheritance from men. And that's as far as I'll try to portray the complex science.Downside: I am accustomed to high standards of attribution in non-fiction, especially in a book about specialized fields of knowledge and more especially one that relates to ideological constructs which may influence future geopolitical events. Recent world history has depended strongly on ideas of European (""white"") male superiority. If a book is to equip one with knowledge to resist a backlash, it must be dependable. Too much of this book seems to rest on ""some people claim"" foundations. A chapter on linguistics admits to being ""the most speculative in the book."" My alarm flags go up and jiggle. The penultimate chapter is naive and, I think, dangerous: he basically argues that Native Americans should consent to be included in the ""Human Genome [Diversity:] Project,"" despite their resistance to being catalogued by the very sciences and power structures that so recently dehumanized them, stole their land, destroyed their lives, killed and maligned them. The book claims to understand all the biases of racist projects for the last 400 years; why then can it not understand that all science is inherently political, and that dismissing the point of view of recent victims of politics is to be in collusion? (less)All in all, the book helped to clarify some topics but I would need more information before I could claim to understand genetic mapping with any degree of certainty."
16,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1647517-victor-sonkin,4,"Olson provides one of the most accessible accounts of population genetics, the fascinating field pioneered in the trenches of WWI and later developed into a full-blown science through the efforts of L.L.Cavalli-Sforza and many others. The book is divided into sections corresponding to parts of the world, though this is only a very sketchy division (since the human race is intrinsically interconnected, one can't really speak of Africa without touching upon the rest of the world).Olson is not a scientist, he's a science journalist, but he's done his research well, and he certainly delivers his message. There are some concepts that are not very clear in his account; for example, the we all have a MRCA - most recent common ancestor - and he, or she, or both, could have lived much more recently than we think, is pretty clear; but Olson also claims that we are all descended from Julius Caesar, or Xerxes - if that person's life did not eke out, today there isn't a single individual on the planet who is not descended from him or her. Olson doesn't really explain it, nor posits a date ante quam everyone's everyone's granddaddy.Olson is a proponent of the no-race idea, which I myself tend to support because I find it attractive. However, serious objections were raised to such treatment of human diversity, and the idea itself was termed Lewontin's fallacy (by the name of the American geneticist who came up with it). Olson does not address the issue, nor, indeed, lists any recent, scientific objections. It's easy to dispel 18-century notions.The book searches for the 'oldest existing human populations', the Khoi-san or bushmen of Africa; examines the effects of long-term inbreeding in Samaritans; explores the cohabitation of anatomically modern humans (that's us) and Neandertals in the Near East. One of the chapters is devoted to the apparent racial and ethnic harmony of Hawaii (not without its problems, of course); I never thought Hawaii were so special.With a couple of caveats, this is probably the best entry-level book on population genetics."

But if I had to pick a title for it, I would have called it The Case Against Racism. While it does talk a little bit about the origin, distribution, and diversification of the human species over the course of the past 200,000 years, that's not what Olson seems to be focused on. In the book, he goes into great detail discussing the history of bigotry on the basis of race, and then uses science to systematically dismantle those antiquated notions people have had about their human cousins. As far as the discussion about human genes is concerned, I didn't find any information in this book I couldn't find in a science journal or any book about anthropology or human evolution.While it is a very good book and well worth the read, don't go into it thinking you'll get and in depth account of how Homo sapiens diversified or an explaination of exactly how each ethnic group is related to the others. What you can expect, however, is really good, scientifically concrete ammunition to use against anyone who's still ignorant enough to subscribe to racism in this day and age."

Some fascinating info about the Jews, Bushmen, Mitochondrial Eve, the Neandertals, and the Native Americans. After each chapter, however, I was left wanting more. Too much commentary and speculation mixed in with hard genetic evidence. While I appreciated Olson's insight that race is a biologically indefensible construct, he seemed, by the end of the book, to be gathering as many quotes by researchers as he possibly could to make the same affirmation. Yes, we get it. Race doesn't exist in our species. I also thought his foray into historical linguistics was a bit unnecessary. He tried somehow to claim that our linguistic history can tell us something about our genetic history. While this may be helpful to the past 5000 years, comparative linguistics tells us nothing about any proto-language, and to speculate about this is beyond his purview. Overall, OK book, but I'd be interested to see something more up-to-date by an actual geneticist, like Spencer Wells. "
19,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5619631-chris-demer,3,"Steve Olson explains in this clearly written book how the Human Genome Project has given scientists new information in determining the history of our species, and some of those closely related. He discusses how genetic information (especially that provided by mitochondrial DNA and the DNA of the X chromosome) has helped us to understand where humans originated (Africa) and how they migrated out of that continent to populate the earth. The overriding theme is how very similar we are to all other humans. Outward, superficial differences by which humans have been categorized, frequently for nefarious purposes, have no counterpart in the genome. Looking at the DNA, all humans are very closely related indeed. The only reason I gave it only 3 stars is that I have read other books and seen videos by geneticists that hold similar information so a lot of it was not new to me. I do recommend the book highly for those who want to learn about human origins and the impossibility of racial divides as far as genetics are concerned."
20,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1289391-michael,3,"Olson's overview of genetic research on the migrations of modern humans out of Africa and into every inhabited land is very useful. He includes good notes for those wishing to read the primary sources. Although the material is fascinating, the style is somewhat unexciting. The book would benefit from a section on the spread of those hominids who left Africa in earlier migrations, since the work refers to the encounters between modern humans and pre-modern humans already established in territories outside Africa. I was not convinced by Olson's strong assertion of the primacy of nurture over nature in explaining differences between people. I believe he is right in emphasizing the role of culture over genetics in explaining the differences between peoples (nationalities, tribes, etc.), but with individuals, twin studies have shown that genetics exert powerful influences not yet fully understood. I recommend it with the reservations noted above. "

In doing so, it traces the fascinating story of modern humans' journey out of Africa 100,000 years ago and their subsequent migration around the world. One of the points of tension in the book is that while genetics demonstrates our fundamental similarities as human beings and the meaninglessness of racial distinctions, tiny genetic differences are enough to trace groups of people back into the distant past. The author takes pains to continually emphasise our commonalities, perhaps at times to the point of tedium.Interesting to see how many new advances have occurred since this book was published in 2002, particularly about mating between modern humans, Neanderthals and Denisovians, which more recent research has shown to have occurred, but for which there was no evidence back then.

We all can be linked by blood to Jewish ancestory, racism will vanish. It places its money on the genetic code for the way society will be in the future. It is about a segment of our society that is out to make an impact regardless of the upheaval or collapse it has on cultural beliefs. But then, there are many other groups that can make such a claim.

The writing is well-balanced with evidence and interesting facts. I finished the book with much deeper understanding of the distribution of humans and the diversity that marks our race today.

What's so compelling about it to me is that it makes the same arguments as many other books (we're really not that different after all) but does it with irrefutable evidence -- our own DNA. I've read this book twice already (as evidenced by all the underlining and margin notes on just about every page, in more than one color), and I'll probably read it again.

DNA and the concept of haplogroups allows us to see how we are all connected and originate from the same place and also how our ancestors parted ways and rejoined and parted and joined again throughout human history. Did you know there is no marker for race? And that, in fact, it really only exists as a cultural concept? Fascinating stuff, and this book is one of the better ones I've read on the topic."
27,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1905506-stephen,4,A good read. The book comes to the (I think) reassuring conclusion that race has very little to do with genetics. All humans are so genetically similar that race is irrelevant at that level. The really cool and interesting parts are about how the various continents became populated. There are also several highly interesting descriptions of isolated populations like the Basque in France and the Samaritans in Palestine. It is particularly amusing (and ironic) that the humble Bushmen appear to have the oldest DNA and language on the planet.

With that being said, I went into the book feeling a little apprehensive that I wouldn't learn much of anything and that it might be too basic for me. However, I was happy to find that it retold the information I already knew in a really interesting way, and wove in with some things that were new to me! "
34,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5385376-peter,0,"Similar to The Seven Daughters of Eve (above), but with a somewhat different focus. Goes into more detail on the spread of anatomically-modern humans across the globe, and how mitochondrial DNA has been used to discover what we know. Includes some fascinating discussion on the ethical aspects of this kind of research, and pros/cons for various small native populations that geneticists want to study. Less accessible than The Seven Daughters of Eve, but a bit more interesting overall."
35,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2161273-dana,4,"Interesting book- the author's premise is that there should be no racism as there are truly no races. He avoids the controversial subject of religion except at one point notes that Christianity has reinforced racism in some ways. I think Olson's point is extremely important- there are no genetic differences between peoples, so we cannot prove intellectual differences based on skin color or other physical attributes. Variation occurs more within groups than between groups."
36,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1051150-brent,2,"Another 'unfinished book,' this one was one of a few I'm checking out that deal with doing history (and thus genealogy) with genetics. This book was marked as a let down becuase it had too little novel information and what it did have was fairly basic. A better book:  The Seven Daughters of Eve."
37,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1029290-p,5,"This book is an excellent summary of our knowledge of humanity's origins as informed by archaeology, anthropology, DNA,etc. The last chapter is an especially good discussion of ""The End of Race"" that is the assimilition in Hawaii and that continues to be instructive."
38,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/138031-anna,3,"Gets a bit preachy in the last few chapters. Granted it's preachy throughout but it really starts to hammer at you in the last few chapters. Another reviewer is right, the proper title for this book should be 'The Case Against Racism.'The actual scientific information is good. Could use better maps and illustrations as well."
39,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3134940-booknerd-fraser,3,"A lot of interesting ideas about the place of a genetics in the debate on race, and of course as a science book a lot of useful destruction of said concept of race. Thought-provoking and good at the broad issues of genetic research, though for myself I would have liked more detail, especially about the prehistoric patterns of human migration. "
40,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1690457-nancy,4,"Olson puts together the story of how DNA and the human genome project has been used to trace the story of humans--where we apparently originated, how we all trace back to genetic Adam and Eve, why the number of our ancestors doesn't continue to double into infinity, why none of us is pure anything. It's a fascinating read and makes sense to the lay person. "
41,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4984449-cyndi,4,"Very well written and thought out. Olson gives a strong overview of the field of genetics for use in tracing human history. It's about 10 years old but mostly still holds up. He especially does an excellent job balancing concerns of the testing populations, the legacy of racism, and the excitement that comes from new evidence."
42,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/20889787-annika-altpeter,3,"I found this book sort of disappointing- really more of a 2.5. The premise was pretty interesting, but it wasn't as fact oriented as I had hoped. I ended up skipping over entire chapters which contained nothing but information that was either useless or obvious. That being said, I did get a few new facts out of it, so it was technically worth my time. And it was a (mercifully) quick read."
43,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16810404-mallory,4,"A genetic examination of the movement of the human race through history. To know that we all descended from the same place, and that all humans are so highly connected would be a wonderful, empirical tool to placate racists, possibly all misanthropes in general. That could be my optimism talking, but the information in this book is very important for people to know. "
44,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7934896-chris,4,"I think overall I really enjoyed this book. I think the reason for this is that it talked about migrations of people and talked about genetics from a generational perspective. I wouldn't call the conclusions all that shocking if you read books in this field. Both ways, good overall read."
45,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2726611-manuel,5,"Erudite and well-written. Gives a very thorough exploration of the idea, rooted in genetic science, that the concept of race is a fantasy. A great compliment to Ian Tattersall's and Richard Lewontin's work on the topic."
46,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/117327-daniel,4,"very cool. reexamines the movement of humans out of africa by looking at genetic stuff. Very readable (and understandable) for non-science poeple, like me."
47,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/206820-rung-muang,5,"I love the conclusion of this book, the author seems well understand the life of human being, there are very beautifully put at the end, it is very inpressive, eveybody must read."
48,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1657949-kat,2,Light read of the origins of the Homo spiens
49,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1231154-william-shep,3,"A very good read though not quite as engaging as Brian Sykes' work. Olson also seems more motivated by politics than science in explaining the interaction of race, genetics, and culture. "
50,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1858310-emilie,2,A bit repetitive but really interesting nonetheless....I could have used this for my thesis 3 years ago!
51,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1489689-tri,3,"its all about human history, since d beginning"
52,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1290853-ike,3,A nice review. Fairly introductory material.
53,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4539680-pat,5,Another history of ancient humanity through DNA. Great basic book.
54,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3870434-kimi,3,Read this book if you think that you are greater than others. read it and it will change your mind. that we all actually came from the same place.
55,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10823807-sarah,4," Very readable. Genetics, linguistics, physiology, culture, it's all there. "

58,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/315729-maggie,3,"We read this for book club. Some of it was interesting, but it was more like reading a textbook."
59,0618352104,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50771646-jay,5,"Current, relevant, fascinating, comprehensive, rational. Ever wonder how all the different peoples of the earth were created and migrated and mixed and when? This is the book (as of 2002). "
