0,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,4,"Another Oliver Sacks book, my last for a while. I definitely enjoyed this much more than The Mind's Eye though. Probably because hallucinations are much more fascinating to think about. I think the book did a good job going over hallucinatory experiences and I definitely learned a lot that I didn't know before. I even enjoyed hearing about Sack's personal experiences this time because he didn't give as much unnecessary detail and it was cool to know that someone so successful has his own struggles, it makes him much more real to the reader I think. I do find that towards the end of Oliver Sack's books though I begin to get tired of reading and wish it would end already for some reason. Not sure if it's just me but it gets to be a bit much because he does have a tendency to go on and on. All in all an interesting and informative read."
1,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x,5,"Hallucinations come in more varieties than you can possibly imagine - and Sacks details them all, exhaustively so, whether they are visual, tactile, audio or more rarely of smell and a combination of any of them. He details the causes whether it is an organic brain problem, temporary or permanent, or a more generalised reaction (dehydration and exhaustion), unwanted or deliberate - drugs. Almost more than you might want to know.The ""best"" sort of hallucinations, are those that feel absolutely real and pleasurable but you know aren't, so you know you are quite sane. A good example of this was an old woman freed of Parkinson's who begins to hallucinate erotic episodes on a regular basis. She knows they are hallucinations but enjoys them so much that she sets aside time for them.Synchronicity - I recently read Nellie Bly's 10 Days in a Madhouse where she, a journalist, pretended to be crazy to get into a madhouse to report on it. None of the patients were taken in by her but all the doctors were and she couldn't get out of her own accord. In Hallucinations, there is an anecdote about eight researchers who went to A&E and reported hearing voices. All were sent to the psychiatric ward - schizophrenia - and as with Nellie Bly, all the doctors but none of the patients were fooled as to the sanity of the researchers. What does this tell you? Nothing good, right? You don't have to be schizophrenic or in any way psychotic to hear voices. Hallucinations might well have an organic cause.One of the most interesting points of the book is to do with Dostoyevsky and his book, The Idiot. Dostoyevsky was an epileptic subject to a type of vision called ""ecstatic hallucinations"" just before his fits. These ecstatic hallucinations are much liked and sought after by those who experience them and depending on the person can be interpreted as religious in nature. This apparently influenced The Idiot who was also an epileptic.One person detailed by Sacks had ecstatic religious hallucinations very often and converted to sixteen different religions before ending up with an ecstatic atheist hallucination which is where he ended up. It is speculated that Joan of Arc and many other historical figures claiming out-of-this-world religious experiences may also have been subject to this hallucination.The other most interesting point in this book is that of phantom limbs. We've all heard of people who've had a limb amputated and continue to feel it, but I have never heard how useful this is. When an amputee gets a prosthethetic limb they are able to use that feeling of the phantom limb to incorporate the prosthetic one in a much more natural and useful way. This is why some people can do amazing feats with artificial limbs.What was also interesting but very creepy really is that some people who have been born without one or more limbs also feel these missing arms and legs. It is as if the brain knows where something should be and does its part, but there's nothing corporeal for it to act on, so it just feels.All in all a very interesting book covering everything from migraine auras, through drug experiences - Sacks tries everything, enjoys most things and details perhaps too many of them in the book - to organic misfunctionings of the brain as well as mind. Worth reading even if I did drift off a bit with some of the physical brain descriptions. Maybe you have to be a neurologist to appreciate those.(view spoiler)[This book exhaustively covers just about every cause and type of hallucination. Except one.And it's the one I'm having now.I'm on my fifth salad in two days and instead of beans and a few raisins I am sure I can see chocolate covered macadamias. The tofu looks just like Turkish delight. That diet yoghurt dressing is thick, whipped double cream with just a smidgen of Bailey's added I'm sure. I'm so deprived of proper nourishment that everything looks delicious but tastes likekale.:-( (hide spoiler)]"
2,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor,5,"I enjoyed this one, but I’m not going to review this book in any depth, really. It was all very interesting in its journey through both delusional and drug induced hallucinations – but what I found most interesting in this book, and the bit that I will remember in six months time, is the stuff about indigo.I need to start by saying I’m insanely dull, fairly close to the least interesting person I know. Unlike President Clinton, I have inhaled the smoke of the marijuana plant, but I found it anything but a recreational drug of choice for me. Anxiety and paranoia aren’t really my favourite emotions and so taking drugs to induce these feelings seemed, what? Counter-productive? Redundant? Other drugs likely to induce hallucinations always seemed far too terrifying for me to even consider. Like I said, I’m an intensely boring person – I can hardly remember the last time I was properly drunk. As an Irishman this is actually an act of treachery – an alcoholic stupor being the conscious state of choice for my people, as St Patrick’s Day makes all too clear. All this is meant as context, by the way.Now, Sacks is not like me at all. For a time he took lots of drugs, at least in part to observe the impact taking them would have on his consciousness – as good an excuse as any, I suppose. Since he is a neurologist, I can understand his attraction – but his descriptions of the effects of these drugs, like the other descriptions of drug use I’ve read over the years, has done nothing to encourage me to get my hands on some magic mushrooms or LSD. I have what is perhaps an irrational fear that ‘normal’ consciousness is something rather tenuous and so playing with stuff that turns the faces of people on a bus into something resembling an insect is exactly the kind of thing I need to avoid like the plague. That said, and as part of my own variety of self-rationalisation, I’m also likely to fall for stories that tell me that there are other means of achieving altered states of consciousness (particularly aesthetic experiences - religion being as barred to me as heavy drug use and for much the same reason) that are just as effective, if rather less fast acting, than chemistry.Like I said, I’m telling you all this because the story Sacks tells about indigo confirmed my biases and I want my biases to be up front.One day Sacks decided he really wanted to know what indigo looked like. Yes, it is a colour of the rainbow, the 'i' in Roy G Biv, but it also isn’t really. While it is easy to call ‘yellow’ to mind (although, yellow has changed in definition over the years – it having once having been a kind of murky brown) no such simple means of calling indigo to mind is possible. (This ‘calling to mind’ thing is also terribly interesting – interesting in that we can’t call smells to mind in the way we do music or images, why is that?) I’ve only recently found out Newton made indigo up, so it is hardly surprising we struggle with it as a colour. Indigo was necessary to give the rainbow seven colours and our eyes don’t really work according to numerology. Anyway, one day Sacks took a mixture of drugs and stood staring at a white wall and called out, “I want to see indigo” – and there in front of him was this most amazing blue-purple colour. Like nothing he had ever seen before. After this he spent years trying to find that exact colour again. And was never successful.Now, that last bit isn’t quite true. One day he was at a museum listening to a concert – I’ve forgotten the music that was played already – something Baroque, I think, and just right too – and it was really moving, you know, an ‘oh wow’ musical experience. Anyway, during the intermission and basking in the afterglow of the music he nipped out and looked around the Egyptian pottery and what-not and there it was: indigo. There was the colour he had been searching for for years and now his search was over, for all he ever had to do was call around to the museum when ever he needed to see it. Except that the second half of the concert wasn’t nearly as good as the first half, perhaps, ironically enough, disturbed by the thought of indigo being always available and at such close range. No earth moving this time. But when he went out again for a reviving dose of indigo from our friendly dealers in mystic colours from Ancient Egypt the indigo was gone. Now all he could see was blue.Like I said, I’m too much of a coward to play with the drugs Sacks did – but it is nice to believe (even if I have to force myself) that doing heavy art can produce much the same effect."
3,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6601778-parker-f,3,"I think that my decision to pursue neuroscience, and eventually get my PhD, was partly inspired from reading Oliver Sacks's ""Awakenings"" and ""The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat"" just before starting college. The strange things that happen to people with brain dysfunction reveal more about the nature of reality than all the great works of philosophy. In addition to the significance of Sacks's books to my academic choices, I was particularly excited about reading this book because since childhood I've had a strong interest in hallucinations. For instance, as a child I had a few hypnogogic hallucinations that I misconstrued as supernatural events, and not until I reinterpreted these as hallucinations was I able to abandon my beliefs in ghosts. Thus, I would undoubtedly enjoy this book.Somehow, though, I found HALLUCINATIONS a bit boring. Maybe all my neuroscience education made me a little less shocked by the many bizarre things that Sacks describes. Maybe it is because a large fraction of his stories are recycled from his previous books. Maybe it is because so many of his examples are from literary sources and their reliability may be compromised by creative flourishes. Maybe it is because the book is 95% a catalogue of hallucinations and only 5% an attempt to explain or synthesize these accounts. Nonetheless, the book will likely be pretty exciting for people who haven't already read several of his books or have little knowledge of the crazy things that the brain can do (or the things that the crazy brain can do). I've always been a bit incredulous of Oliver Sacks's descriptions of his own mental idiosyncrasies, for he seems to suffer from a medical student syndrome in which he has diagnosed himself with every conceivable neurological disorder. By his own accounts, he may have one of the most abnormal brains to ever exist as he suffers from or experiences migraine, synethesia, prosopagnosia, dyslexia, tone deafness, and alien limb syndrome (to name just a few). With HALLUCINATIONS, he adds to this list a new set of more plausible fatigue and drug-induced conditions. The most enjoyable chapter of the book describes, with little remorse, Sacks's more youthful experimentation with hallucinogenic drugs (does anyone know where one can get some Artane?), and actually attributes his decision to become a writer to an amphetamine-induced mania. With HALLUCINATIONS, I began to see the point of Sacks's self-overdiagnoses: he is acknowledging that such abnormal brain states are more common than one might expect, and even if they may startle or worry us, we can learn to appreciate them as sources of insight into the inner workings of our minds.  "
4,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4684009-william2,4,"I have completed the entire Sacks's oeuvre, with the single exception of Seeing Voices. Oliver Sacks has been one of those life altering writers for me. He has changed the way I see the world. The great revelation with this volume for me was just how commonplace hallucinations are. There are myriad reasons why the brain might produce them: sensory deprivation, disease, drugs, etc.—many of them surprisingly benign. Fascinating and highly recommended.

5,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2493714-cindy,5,"Two weird things happened while I was reading this book. I had been having some bad insomnia, so I took a little something-something to help get to sleep. Before it kicked in I was reading this book, and it looked like the background of my Kindle Paperwhite had clouds floating around behind the text. Conversation with my husband:Me:""There's clouds floating around the background of my Kindle.""Husband:""Sounds kind of pretty.""Me:""I guess.""Me:""But I'm trying to read.""The second weird thing is that I ended up with a freak infection in my arm, which caused some awful fevers. I paid close attention, and yup, got some fever-induced hallucinations. Specifically, when I closed my eyes, it was gray with what looked like b&w christmas ornaments raining down on me.Fantastic. I would have loved to read more scientific details of the biological theories of the various types of hallucinations. There was some of this, but I wanted more.By far the best part of the book was Sacks discussing his prolific drug use. He's pretty awesome."

Hallucinations

 was just not up to snuff for 
Oliver Sacks
— actually, it made me question just how much I would like Sacks' work were I to read it today, having been exposed to a breadth of narrative science writing in the years since I first read his essays. Sacks presents hallucinations (forms of consciousness wherein sensations occur autonomously, sometimes overlapping with misperceptions or illusions, but without consensual validation) through case studies, seasoning each one with socio-cultural/historical context and bits of neurological intel. And, as it turns out, hallucinations come in many more shapes and forms than one might expect—not all of which are unpleasant (or visual, but I digress). 

The material itself is rich. For me, the mere concept of 
Charles Bonnet Syndrome
 (complex visual hallucinations experienced by people with partial blindness), or 
Anton's Syndrome
 (a form of 
anosognosia
 wherein completely blind patients behave as if they can see) is inherently intriguing. However, I simply wanted more science, the lack of which made what narrative there was seem fractured. It was Sacks' accounts of his own drug-induced hallucinations, though, that really made me want to turn off and tune out (shoutout to my boy, Timothy Leary). As Sacks interspersed more and more of his personal anecdotes with patients' experiences, the stories became more and more (to use Sacks' own words) 
“like being privy to a dream.”
 But, guess what? Other people's dreams are often very, very boring. Seriously, I thought this was common knowledge. Of course, I learned some interesting things (the 
mare
 in nightmare turns out to be not a horse, but a lady-demon who sits on your chest, giving you bad dreams and potentially suffocating you). But, by the end, I discovered that hearing about hallucinations was just not my thing. There are, of course, exceptions— cases in which the floor appears to be lava, and/or people begin transforming into Decepticons might spark my interest.



"
7,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/175480-helen-helena-nell,5,"I gave this four stars at first because I think it's true that it's not written with quite the verve of some of Sacks' earlier books. But then I added a fifth because -- dammit -- I really did enjoy it. It did for me precisely what he's so good at -- leaving me thinking for hours about some of the case studies, the experiences and the far bigger points they raise about life and consciousness.Somewhere in it (and it is now enormously annoying to me that I can't find the quotation) he talks about the way current understanding of memory has changed-- that memory isn't fixed at point of experience and then accessed later -- but rather that recall (remembering) is a creative act in which the narrative is continually remade. I love this idea and it feels true to me. But that's the kind of potent idea that appears as an aside. It isn't even mainly what the book is about.We're on hallucinations, which have the property of reality in terms of the clarity with which they are experienced. They can be scary or enormously comforting. They are often associated with particular disorders, such as Charles Bonnet Syndrome and some types of dementia, but anybody may experience them from time to time. It is clear that Sacks regards hallucinations as delusions rather than illusions. That is to say they 'seem' real but are simply the brain doing something weird, a weirdness of perception that can be explained in various logical ways. So ghosts, out of body experiences, near Death experiences, spiritualist exchanges, religious ecstasy and God (gods) are all framed in the hallucinatory picture. This made sense to me, although the chicken and egg factor is intriguing. Sacks suggests, for example, that our folktales about angels, devils, demons, fairies and little people may have arisen because of the way these images populate hallucinatory experience, rather than the other way around. Religious faith, he argues, may be founded on a single profound, life-changing hallucination (though for many religious folk, there may be a whole series of them). Here's how he set me thinking, though. He distinguishes between different forms of consciousness rather engagingly. For example, consciousness in sleep -- leading to dreaming -- is nothing like the sort of consciousness involved in hallucination. What I don't quite 'get' is this: if hallucination is, to all intents and purposes, real to the person experiencing it, what is reality? If the brain perceives a large yellow man approaching, and the fellow hits you on the head, causing acute pain -- is this not pretty 'real'? Reality is only what we perceive. Hallucination is only realised as such (by and large) in retrospect, when the person experiencing the delusion realises, through force of logic, that it cannot have been true, or alternatively, if a second person with 'normal' brain function is present in the room and able to confirm that the yellow man is not actually there. Or not there to them. Oh dear. I was reminded, while reading this book, time and time again of Charlotte Perkins Gilman's ""The Yellow Wallpaper"", and indeed she could have been another case study. Sensory deprivation - being shut up and not allowed access to normal stimulation - can lead to hallucination. I like that the hallucinations are not necessarily visual. They can be aural, tactile or have the properties of smell. And of course one sits up smartly at parts of the book that tie in with personal experience. It has happened to me three or four times that I've woken at night smelling something burning so strongly that I've got up, wandered up and down the house looking for the cause (there has never been one). At one point I was slightly worried because I read somewhere that such phenomena can be associated with brain tumours. But the tumour didn't appear, and often years go past between the experiences. Once I woke in my parents' house (they were away) in absolute terror. I heard someone bang loudly and rattle the front door. Why? Who? Shaking, I crept downstairs. There was no-one there. It seems likely (after reading this book) that this was a case of a hallucination carried out of sleep into waking, much in the way one carries the emotion of a dream into waking life.I have experienced 'holy' hallucinations too: a powerful and almost overwhelming sense of goodness. I don't talk about this much (Sacks says people don't) and I found I didn't mind it explained in terms of delusion. But that's because hallucinations are so intense that they ARE real to those people who have them. There are certain types of unreality I'd like to continue to have. He doesn't deal with the interesting issue of group hallucination (i.e. several people seeing one 'ghost') except in passing, where he does bring in the delightful example of a whole French village who went dotty and had all sorts of strange experiences after the bread was contaminated with 'ergot', which effectively acts as a hallucinatory drug. (People on magic mushrooms, though, don't have group experiences, so far as I know. In fact, their mental experiences seem to isolate them in a way that alarms fellow experimenters.)Towards the end, Sacks talks about the doppelganger, the sense of a second self -- perhaps a comfort, perhaps a threat -- which can become the ""biological basis for religious passion and conviction, where the 'other', the 'presence', becomes the person of God."" In fact, that's the last sentence of the book. He suggests that the ""primal, animal sense of 'the other' . . may have evolved for the detection of threat"". Indeed it might. But it might be a whole lot less explicable than that. When I got to the end of the book, the sense I was left with -- yet again after reading Sacks -- was that of astonishment. The human brain -- the experiences we have of being alive -- are absolutely extraordinary. This book effectively discusses magical experiences. It doesn't explain them away so much as describe them in operation. Even tracking them to specific parts of the brain doesn't diminish the marvel that such things happen, and the even greater marvel of our consciousness. I am a vivid dreamer, though I don't hallucinate much. (This book is not about dreams at all.) I have had experiences in my dreams that make me vividly glad to be alive, and some of those reminded me of some of the hallucinations Sacks describes. Not that long ago I found myself in an extraordinary country. I was very high up, on a flat grassy plain that ended like a shelf in a sheer drop, a steep cliff dropping for several miles below. It was dizzying and I had to lie down on the grass to be able to look over the edge. At the bottom there was a marvellous country, with waterfalls and mountains and forests and lakes and rivers. The colours were absolutely stunning and it was all incredibly detailed. The air was bright and clear and invigorating. I could see it much more clearly than I can see when I'm awake; it took my breath. I can't remember it properly now -- I can only remember the acuteness of my response to the scene. It was realler than real. What amazing creatures we are that we have such things in our head! The Kingdom of Heaven is within us. Unfortunately, the Other Place seems to manifest in some cases too."
8,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie-g,4,"8-30-15 Rest in Peace, Oliver Sacks.The neurologist Oliver Sacks has written a compassionate book about hallucinations, full of individual patients' stories as well as his own experiences. Hallucinations caused by sensory deprivation were especially interesting. Blindness, hearing problems, solitary confinement, sailors staring at an endless calm sea, and sensory deprivation tanks can all lead to hallucinations because ""the brain needs not only perceptual input but perceptual change."" In addition to visual hallucinations, people can also have auditory, olfactory, and tactile sensations. Illness, fevers, migraines, epilepsy, dementia, delirium, sleep deprivation, alcohol, drugs, and grief are some of the other causes of hallucinations.Dr Sacks' own experiences with psychedelics and other drugs in the 1960s are very colorfully described. He also shares his experiences with migraines which he first developed as a child. He interviewed people who had hallucinations that took on a mystical aspect or a religious experience. He also gives theories about the possible causes of the near death experience. Ways that neurologists are helping patients with amputated limbs deal with the ""phantom limb"" sensation were also discussed.Dr Sacks' love of literature is evident since he quotes neurology papers that are centuries old, and references famous authors who have experience hallucinations. After reading this book, the reader could read with fresh eyes works by Edgar Allan Poe, Guy de Maupassant, Lewis Carroll, Dostoyevsky, and Nabokov. Even ""The Bible"", ""The Illiad"", and ""The Odyssey"" have examples of hallucinations--visions and voices. Many traditional fairytales and folktales also have elements of hallucinations--elves, leprechauns, and various demons.I thought it would have been useful if the author had included a short glossary of neurological terms since some readers might not have an extensive medical vocabulary. Overall, I found Hallucinations to be a fascinating book. "
9,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5649720-rebecca,2,"Ever get stuck talking about the fairly pedestrian dreams of a random stranger, ad nauseum? Yeah, that's this book.I've read several of Sacks' other books, which are usually good for both giving insight into how our minds work as well as scratching a certain voyeuristic itch. I'm not entirely sure why this book fails at both--perhaps because we don't really understand enough about why we hallucinate. (Or perhaps the answer of ""neurons fire when they shouldn't have"" is just too simple and not all that interesting.) The chapters are organized by type. We have hallucinations caused by phantom pain, by drugs, by Parkinsons, when falling asleep, etc. And they basically consist of lists: patient 1 saw zig zags, patient 2 saw random people in Victorian dress, patient 3 saw her dead cat. Nothing really about how this affected their lives or anything. Just ""so and so saw x"". Main conclusion: lots of things besides insanity cause people to see/hear/smell things. Many different things. That's about it."
10,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren,4,"One sentence review: Sacks gives a survey of the neurology of hallucinations - visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile - sharing his years of clinical experience, and many of his own experiences with hallucinatory states.I've read several of Sacks' books, and this one (from 2012) may be my favorite of them all. All of his books are inherently interesting as he explores the human brain, but this one also had more structure than some of his earlier works.It included many anecdotes like his other books about many (many) patients, but this one was grouped into different hallucinatory phenomena surrounding Charles Bonnet Syndrome, epilepsy, migraines, a lengthy and interesting peek into Sacks' own mind-altering drug experimentations, and several other hallucination-inducing / prone illnesses or states.Have you ever experienced a hallucination? Sacks shares just how common hallucinations are, and he mentions several that I've experienced myself, specifically ""grief"" hallucinations, following the death of a loved one, and seeing/hearing/smelling/feeling them again after death. This occurred for me after both the death of my beloved dog, and several years later, after my dear cat passed away. I heard, saw, felt, and sensed them several times for weeks afterward. He references several of his earlier works in this book, and it reminds me how much he published in his life."
11,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1627591-robert,4,"I have on my desk a drawing by Oliver Sacks of two octopi. He made it in my kitchen in the mid-90s in Germany to prevail in a discussion with my then ten-year-old son about the disposition of optical nerves in octopi. This tells you a lot about Oliver Sacks and Nick. I would suppose Sacks was right, but Nick wasn't having it. He'd looked into the question and Nick could see Oliver, as he called him, was all wrong, or at least part of him was wrong. Neither would give in. They stayed at it all through the breakfast my wife served them, Oliver being in the house because my wife had arranged for Oliver to have his morning swim, about which he was fanatical.Now…to Oliver's latest book, Hallucinations. It's not the best book as a book because it is a kind of compendium. As such, it is doesn't present marvelous mysteries that are solved or a grand story that is revealed. What it does it anatomize the species of hallucinations we human beings experience: we hallucinate when we suffer Charles Bonnet Syndrome, when we are in drug withdrawal, when we are about to die, when we have lost a limb, when we have suffered post-traumatic stress disorder, when we have consumed hallucinogenic drugs, and when we have conditioned ourselves to be susceptible to visions, voices, and the presence of others, sometimes an ""other"" self, who is passive or relatively autonomous. Oh, I forgot epilepsy. Can't do that.But Hallucinations is an important book because it sysnthesizes all these ways in which we experience that which does not occur because of the way parts of our brain interact. Let me offend some of you: there is no God, there are no ghosts, there is no phantom limb, there are no witches, no patterns in gold and blue on the surface of your mind…or actual voices…or actual fingers on your back…or most of what we categorize as religion, magic, the supernatural, or the inexplicable.Time and again Sacks points to a study that demonstrates these phenomena are brain-based. They are not ""imagination,"" which is voluntary; they are involuntary. They ""happen,"" but they are as remote from reality as the eyes are from sight. Didn't you know that the eyes don't see? The brain does.I had hoped Sacks would find a direct link between the artistic imagination and the ""other world."" Nope. I sit here at this desk every day imagining things without really knowing how as I write fiction, but I am not recording, if I may put this awkwardly, experienced experience.William Blake apparently did experience such experience and write it down, but most folks who do are not artists, they are normal people….lots of normal people. If you add up all the populations Sacks cites as susceptible to hallucinations, you will find yourself included. At some point you will have seen or heard or felt something outside yourself that had no basis in fact, only in your brain. You will have had an out of body experience, or you will have heard a voice, or seen a loved one, long dead, in the garden. Sacks goes into all this: it's not a matter of will or reality, it's a matter of how your brain expresses enigmas and offers you modes of intepretation.I can tell you, with relative surety, that neither Nick nor Sacks believes in the epiphenomenonal sparks of fiery vision cast off by the common brain. There is no logical reason not to believe God is behind all this. Really, He could have been, He may have been. But more likely we are experiencing the peculiarities of brain-based phenomena.If you deprive someone of sleep, of physical contact with the world, of someone to talk to, of sight, or many other common things…that someone is likely to hallucinate. This is why, in my opinion, torture and extreme stress are dubious interrogation techniques. You can drive someone ""crazy"" but what he tells you in that state won't stand up in court...or shouldn't.I don't want to underplay the power of hallucinations. They are not to be lightly taken. I have a friend who served in combat in Vietnam. From 1968 to today, 2013, he has not slept more than twenty or thirty minutes without being jolted awake by what happened to him almost fifty years ago. Think about that.Last week President Obama announced a $100 million initiative to map the brain, or some such thing. Not enough money. Really. Not nearly enough. The virtue of Sacks' book is that it points out the multiple ways that the brain duplicates and disdorts reality. Because of the brain, I might see witches, angels, demons, and octopi eyes some day.This is worth considering…and reading.For more of my comments on contemporary thought and writing, see Tuppence Reviews(Kindle)."
12,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61519-aerin,4,"""An hallucination is a strictly sensational form of consciousness, as good and true a sensation as if there were a real object there. The object happens to be not there, that is all.""- Wiliam James People hallucinate for a lot of different reasons, and neurologist Oliver Sacks explores a number of them in this book. Hallucinations can signify a neurological condition (Parkinson's, migraine, epilepsy, narcolepsy), fill an absence (blindness, deafness, intentional sensory deprivation), or be brought on by other experiences (fever, drug use, psychological trauma). Sacks covers each of these with his characteristic compassion and humor.The hallmarks of a Sacks book are all here, from the fascinating case studies to the rambling footnotes; from the incisive personal anecdotes to the extraordinary glimpses into the workings of our own cerebral hardware.While this book isn't as thoroughly fascinating as The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat or Musicophilia, it's worth a read if only for the chapter on drug use. After discussing historical references to altered states and delving a bit into the mechanics of a drug trip, Sacks launches into stories about his own experiences in this vein. They're bizarre and darkly hilarious.For instance, he recounts once deliberately taking a cocktail of amphetamines, LSD, and cannabis for the express purpose of experiencing the color indigo (for reasons that probably made sense in the 60's). ""About twenty minutes after taking this, I faced a white wall and exclaimed, 'I want to see indigo now -- now!'"" And sure enough indigo appears, there on the wall.Fully enraptured, he proceeds to spend the next several months trying to find the color again, but he only catches a glimpse of it once, shining through some ancient Egyptian jewelry in a museum. And never again after that.In another incident, Sacks shoots himself up with multiple vials of morphine and ends up staring at a painting of Napoleon for what felt like a few minutes, only to turn to the clock and realize it had been twelve hours.Finally, at one point while out of his mind on hallucinogenic morning glory seeds, he accuses a visiting psychoanalyst friend of being a decoy, a realistic replica of herself. Once he's sobered up, she tells him (in true shrink fashion) that his delusion had been ""a complex form of defense, a dissociation which could only be called psychotic."" Sacks disagrees, and instead ""maintained that my seeing her as a duplicate or impostor was neurological in origin, a disconnection between perception and feelings."" The friend wins the argument by pointing out that ""whatever view was correct, taking mind-altering drugs every weekend, alone, and in high doses, surely testified to some intense inner needs or conflicts, and that I should explore these with a therapist.""TOUCHÉ.While autobiographical anecdotes are common in Sacks's books, I'd never pictured him as a young acid head with a singularly methodical, scientific approach to tripping balls. It's oddly endearing. In any case, it is while high on amphetamines that he decides to write neurological literature in the first place, and so here we are.The rest of the book is somewhat hit-or-miss, some chapters more interesting than others, but overall it's an interesting look at some of the varieties of hallucinations, their neurological foundations and their subjective manifestations - from euphoric to terrifying, from sacred to meaningless. (On a personal note, the only significant hallucination I remember experiencing was when I was about six or eight years old. I had a giant Raggedy Ann doll that was as tall as I was, and she sat on top of a bookshelf about eye level across the room from my top-bunk bed. One night, while trying to get to sleep, I remember looking over at her and she was sitting there swinging her legs - slowly, deliberately, one after the other, all the way up and all the way down. With her frozen cloth grin gazing at me out of the gloom, it was the most unsettling, terrifying thing I have ever seen.Even as young as I was, some part of me knew it wasn't real, but I still threw that fucking doll into the back of the closet the next morning. Just thinking of it still freaks me out.)(Original review date: 24 February 2014)"
13,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/269235-david-schaafsma,4,"I prefer it when Dr Sacks focuses more closely on one or three people and tells their stories in depth, but this is a fine and entertaining collection of anecdotes in a kind of catalogue of non-schizophrenic hallucinogenic experiences, including his own sometimes drug-induced experiences in the sixties. The feeling you get as you read this book is that the brain is not a very precise instrument for perception, and that auditory, visual and other sensory hallucinations are less commonly to be associated with the ""insane"" than those who do not have psychiatric diagnoses. How can you get them? If you go blind or deaf, 20-30 % chance you will have them; grief; drugs (many artists did and do take drugs to find creative inspiration); head trauma and other accidents, sensory deprivation (some surrealists deliberately deprived themselves of food, water, sleep so they would hallucinate..), epilepsy (once considered a 'sacred"" disease), migraines, fever, on the edge of sleep or waking. . . Seeing ghosts or people you have loved intensely after they have died he sees as common, but he sees these things as hallucinations and not psychic phenomena (though the line seems pretty thin there). I have a son and sister and other family members who claim (and I believe have) psychic ""powers,"" and another son (now 13) who has had some psychotic episodes, and I am interested in the relationship between insight, vision, and madness. This book touches on these issues for me, and I'll keep reading, but this was, as always for me with Dr. Sacks, an enlightening and entertaining collection of stories that opened up my perspective on the bizarre and unpredictable and amazing human brain. "
14,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444651-david-katzman,2,"Updated: I accidentally deleted this review, so re-posting. I must've been Hallucinating.Herm, well. Disappointing. It was just so...clinical. I guess, what did I expect? Apparently, neuroscientists have figured out that hallucinations are triggered by parts of the brain being over or under stimulated. Thanks for that.The most interesting tidbit to me within the book is that there is a scientist named Dominic ffytche (yes, lower case). It kind of freaked me out every time I read his name. Dominic ffytche. How is it possible someone could have a last name that isn't capitalized? And a double f? What next, someone with the same first and middle name?Hallucinations was rather a survey of many of the different medical conditions that can cause hallucinations and the types of hallucinations. With one exception, the chapter about Sacks's experimentation with drugs. It seemed somewhat out of place with all the rest of the content, but I appreciated his generally positive attitude about psychedelics. I found the beginning of that chapter rather insightful:Humans share much with other animals—the basic needs of food and drink or sleep, for example—but there are additional mental and emotional needs and desires which are perhaps unique to us. To live on a day-to-day basis is insufficient for human beings; we need to transcend, transport, escape; we need meaning, understanding, and explanation; we need to see overall patterns in our lives. We need hope, the sense of a future. And we need freedom (or at least the illusion of freedom) to get beyond ourselves, whether with telescopes and microscopes and our ever-burgeoning technology or in states of mind which allow us to travel to other worlds, to transcend our immediate surroundings. We need detachment of this sort as much as we need engagement in our lives.We may search, too, for a relaxing of inhibitions that makes it easier to bond with one another, or for transports that make our consciousness of time and mortality easier to bear. We seek a holiday from our inner and outer restrictions, a more intense sense of the here and now, the beauty and value of the world we live in.He goes on to reference William James's book The Varieties of Religious Experience and his transcendent experiences with nitrous oxide and then follows that with:Many of us find the reconciliation that James speaks of and even Wordsworthian ""intimations of immortality"" in nature, art, creative thinking or religion, some people can reach transcendent states through meditation or similar trance-inducing techniques or through prayer and spiritual exercises. But drugs offer a short cut, they promise transcendence on demand. These shortcuts are possible because certain chemicals can directly stimulate many complex brain functions. Every culture has found chemical means of transcendence and at some point the use of such intoxicants becomes institutionalized at a magical or sacramental level, the sacramental use of psychoactive plant substances has a long history and continues to the present day in various shamanic and religious rites around the world.Although I believe he underestimates how our ""needs"" are generated by culture (c.f. The Society of the Spectacle I agree that there seems to be a natural desire to transcend and achieve a state of universal love, oneness or harmony with all things, but that desire is warped, moderated, stunted, rejected, or resisted by many people. Every mind is rather unique of course and will have varying reactions to such an abstract quality. When you reflect on those who are cruel and violent, it's easy to believe that such a desire is merely an affection of the privileged. But the native people who partake of Ayahuasca to commune with forest spirits give validity to the general sentiment. And it's not a stretch to suppose that cruel and violent people are frequently raised in a state of ignorance and blindness and their openness to the possibilities of life is stunted. And I do believe that my psychedelic experiences led me to ""open my mind"" and throw off certain mental conventions. To discover a greater level of creativity within myself. And they have perhaps helped lead me eventually to Zen Buddhism and meditation practice as well. I think there is a commonality between the psychedelic experience of the oneness and nothingness of all things and the Zen experience of oneness and nothingness.Another element of this book that was of particular interest to me was the brief discussion of mass hallucinations. In reflecting on both the ""...demonic possessions that swept over the French village of Loudun in 1634,"" and the Salem witch trials, Sacks writes about how, ""A deeply superstitious and delusional atmosphere can also foster hallucinations arising from extreme emotional states, and these can effect entire communities."" When religion takes on a fanatical character, it can drive groups to such extreme fear and stress that they can be lead to experiences hallucinations that pass like a communicable disease through the power of suggestion. In a similar vein, he makes frequent references to how common it is for various mild hallucinations to occur for individuals who are not afflicted with any particular extreme conditions. Sleep deprivation, concussions, partial blindness, and many other moderate conditions can trigger a variety of visual and auditory hallucinations and ""feelings"" such as paranoia, calm, someone being in the room with you whom you can't see, and so on. He goes on to note how individuals who ""see God"" or ""ghosts"" are simply experiencing undiagnosed conditions that trigger hallucinations.In total, Hallucinations will appeal to those who enjoy reading about medical science, and it had its moments, but overall, I felt it was too dry."
15,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/440651-dov-zeller,5,"I love Oliver Sacks (I know I am not alone in his sentiment). He represents to me the coming together of western medicine and compassion, humane curiosity, intelligence, insight (things I don't tend to associate with western allopathic medicine). He has become such a beloved cultural and medical figure and it is only now that I am listening to his memoir ""On The Move"" that I understand how hard he worked and the enormity of the challenges and setbacks he faced before he became a public figure.Over the years I've read many of his anthologized essays but it is only in the last few months I've been reading his books (listening to is more accurate). Before starting ""On The Move"" a few days ago (which I am about half-way through), I listened to ""Hallucinations"" and ""The Mind's Eye"", alternating between the two, finishing them both around the same time. I also own ""Hallucinations"", which makes it a bit easier to write a review of it (harder when I don't have the text in front of me.)The book starts out with a short reflection on the word hallucination--its definition of and evolution. ""When the word 'hallucination' first came into use in the early sixteenth century, it denoted only 'a wandering mind.' It was not until the 1830s that Jean-Etienne Esquirol, a French psychiatrist, gave the term its present meaning--prior to that, what we now call hallucinations were referred to simply as 'apparitions.' Precise definitions of the word 'hallucination' still vary considerably, chiefly because it is not always easy to discern where the boundary lies between hallucination, misperception, and illusion. But generally, hallucinations are defined as percepts arising in the absence of any external reality--seeing things or hearing things that are not there.""Not to mention smelling and tasting and touching things that are not there...I hadn't thought before reading this book that there were so many kinds of hallucination, nor had I thought about the fascinating and unclear lines between the perception of what exists on a more collective sphere and perception of what only exists for a party of one. The first time I recall hearing people talk of hallucinations is when my best childhood friend got chicken pox and had a high fever and hallucinations. I was likely somewhere between the age of 7 and 10. His hallucinations were spoken of with real reverence. It was a big deal. Enough so that I remember it. But I hadn't thought about it in years until reading about a similar experience in this book. In fact, if I remember correctly, Sacks himself had chicken pox in adulthood (from treating a patient with shingles) and came down with a fever and had hallucinations. (Though I believe it's in ""On the Move"" that he writes about his own experience of chicken pox. He does describe a chicken pox related delerium in this book, but it's not his own.)Many of Sacks's books are more focused on 'case studies' or in-depth explorations of the experiences of specific patients. There is still some of the intimacy of the 'case-study' in here, but it is less focused on specific 'case-studies' and more focused on describing many types of hallucinations. Those from different illnesses and injuries, from drugs, from loss and trauma. From migraines. Epilepsy. Medications and supplements gone awry. In addition to describing various forms of hallucinations and their causes, he considers the changing social and psychiatric/neurological understandings of hallucinations and the influence of cultural and psychological states on the experience and intensity of hallucination. As a person with an illness that is known for vivid, intensely sensory dreams and nightmares as well as hypnogogic and hypnopompic incidents (I won't go so far as to say hallucinations, though that may be the case for some), it was fascinating to read about hypnogogic and hypnopompic hallucinations in this book. (In fact, since I've been ill to the degree that I am [its possible I've had a milder version of the illness for well over a decade] I have recurring, though usually no more than once every few months, hypnogogic sound hallucination. I hear a very loud explosion as I am starting to fall asleep. It sounds like gun-fire or cannon-fire. At first it was terrifying. With a bit of research I discovered it's not harmful aside from the anxiety it can cause. But the name is worrisome. It's called exploding head syndrome.) I find reading Sacks's work adds richness to my experience of being a human animal. It's wonderful to think about the wildness and complexity of our systems of perception, and the uniqueness and resilience of Sacks himself and the people he comes into contact with.Also this book puts some illness/hallucination inspired novels into context that I now want to read or re-read. (By Dostoyevsky and Waugh, for example). I found this article with a video of Sacks talking about hallucinations. Very interesting and enjoyable and a little taste of what is in this book.https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/ar..."
16,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10008363-salema,4,"This book was an absolutely incredible read! Oliver Sacks has quickly become one of my favorite science literature authors. Neuroscience can be a really difficult and a dry subject to read about. But not this book. Oliver Sacks explores hallucinations in all its forms, those mediated by - vision degeneration, neurodegenerative disorders, drugs, genetic/birth defects in brain, and trauma. He talks of his personal experiments with drugs to experience and document his hallucinations; which is frankly terrifying. The book is rife with real examples of patients talking about their experiences. Ever wonder if that ghost you thought you saw was real or just a neural quirk? Or that someone is present but just outside the periphery of your vision, but you turn around, and no one is there? A dream that inspires religious enlightenment? You would be glad to know you are not alone in this. I give this book a 4.5/5. I hold back that 0.5, because I really wished that the book discussed the case examples. I was left feeling wanting to know more about their diagnosis and treatments."
17,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,3,"This book is a comprehensive review of all types of hallucinations. It is packed with case histories of people with a relatively common condition called the Charles Bonnet Syndrome, as well as hallucinations induced by Parkinson's, migraines, deliriums, narcolepsy, sensory deprivation, and hauntings. The multitude of descriptions of hallucinations gives the reader the idea that hallucinations are not all that rare--and this might be true. It is clear that hallucinations are under-reported, because of some stigmas attached to them. Where the book is lacking, is a thorough analysis of the causes of most of these hallucinations. Perhaps they are not understood--but only a limited amount of research is described here. Even negative results of studies would be of some interest. Nevertheless, the book is certainly entertaining, if only from the sheer variety of hallucinations."
18,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4209176-allison,3,"Sadly, I actually didn't enjoy this book very much. I love Oliver Sacks, and have read everything that he has ever written. Seeing Voices is one of my favorite books. However, his last three books -- Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain, The Mind's Eye and now Hallucinations -- I have not enjoyed as much.This book seemed like a list of descriptions of case studies illustrating the varying causes of hallucinations. A few of the descriptions were quite interesting, notably those of sleep paralysis and narcolepsy. However, I need some kind of overarching reason for reading the descriptions, whether that be implications for the medical field, implications for the functioning of the healthy human brain, something. A theme tying the different descriptions together. This book was lacking that.Actually, more than that, what I liked about The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat & Other Clinical Tales and An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales is that they were case-study-by-case-study romps through the amazing things our mind can do. Yes, they were voyeuristic, but they felt more comfortable (and interesting) to me because each one was different and succinct, and they were unified by the simple theme of ""look at the amazing things people's brains do! would you ever have thought?""The theme of this book, on the other hand, was essentially ""here are some things people hallucinate."" And while I'm very interested in *why* people hallucinate - the fact that people hallucinate with CBS (Charles Bonnet Syndrome) or because of the above-mentioned sleep paralysis is fascinating. However, I don't need a detailed description of exactly what they hallucinate, and Sacks includes many lengthy descriptions taken from either his own interviews or other people's articles of the content of people's hallucinations, and while I read those (at least for the first 50% of the book -- I confess I may have skimmed the later long quoted bits), they really were not very interesting to me. So, I'm very sad to say that this book was 2.5 stars for me. I'm rounding it up to three, because if it were by any other author I think I would have judged it less harshly, but I have such high expectations of Sacks! I'm going to go back and reread some of his classic works."
19,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38036772-annie,5,"Okay, first and foremost I need to acknowledge that I can understand why not everyone would love this book. It’s not an Everyone Book, but it’s totally an Annie book. Now, look. If there’s a cause of hallucination, it’s happened to me. Let me explain.1) I have temporal lobe epilepsy, and have hallucinated mildly during auras prior to seizures.2) I have hallucinated as a reaction to delirium (bad reaction to prescription drug).3) I have hallucinated as a result of serious sleep deprivation.4) Like most people apparently, I’ve occasionally experienced hypnogogic hallucinations (had while falling asleep).5) I have sleep paralysis and, connected with that, hypnopompic hallucinations upon waking up. Frequently. (I wasn’t even aware of the word hypnopompic prior to this book, so it’s interesting to put a name to it.) It was surprising how similar my hallucinations were to those of some of Sacks’ patients! I’ve woken up to seeing corpses on the floor, to hearing my old apartment neighbor banging the wall and screaming “You fucking whore!” (he was an eccentric man who was never anything but polite to my face, so I’m fairly certain this was a hallucination though I suppose I can’t confirm), to having upsetting conversations and vicious arguments via text with loved ones that never happened, to seeing angels of death coming to collect me, maliciously laughing goblin faces, police banging on my door demanding to be let in, and many more. 6) Finally, shall we say… I’ve hallucinated voluntarily. So I’ve had a lot of personal experience with hallucinations, and I’m quite sure I will hallucinate again (in fact, I intend to guarantee it). If that’s not true of you, I can see why this book might hold less interest (indeed, the bits I didn’t have experience in- like phantom limbs- I found a bit plodding). As it was, I found it endlessly fascinating, clear, and a wealth of memorable facts (not to mention sparking dozens of Google searches). 10/10 would recommend to fellow hallucinatees."
20,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/575806-kressel-housman,4,"Between The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Other Clinical Tales, Robin Williams’ portrayal in “Awakenings,” and several NPR interviews, I’ve really come to admire Dr. Oliver Sacks, even though this is only the second book of his I’ve ever read. He writes with such love and respect about his patients, it’s impossible not to love and respect him in return. Accomplished a doctor as he is, he is never condescending. He portrays his patients as people, not quirky specimens. He’s also open and honest about himself, and that’s especially true in this book in which he reveals that like so many others in the 60’s, he experimented with a pretty wide variety of mind-altering drugs. As a neuroscientist, it was literally experimentation – he felt he should know what his patients were going through – but as he also admits, his drug use also stemmed from the lesser motivations that drive so many people to drugs. Drug-induced hallucinations are the topic of just one chapter of the book, though. It also covers the phantom limb phenomenon, visual hallucinations in the blind (which is sort of the equivalent of phantom limb), auditory hallucinations (the most common type and not necessarily a sign of madness), the migraine aura, and out-of-body experiences, just to name a few. Sometimes all the examples seemed repetitive, but mostly they were fascinating. Probably all readers will find at least one type of hallucination familiar. And thanks to Dr. Sacks’ rational and reassuring attitude, you’ll discover you’re perfectly normal after all."
21,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1019174-terence,2,"UPDATE - 10-Feb-13: There's an essay in the Feb. 21, 2013 issue of the NYRB by Sacks. The telling paragraph is this:
There is...no mechanism in the mind or the brain for ensuring the truth...of our recollections. We have no direct access to historical truth, and what we feel or assert to be true...depends as much on our imagination as our senses. There is no way by which the events of the world can be directly transmitted or recorded in our brains; they are experienced and constructed in a highly subjective way, which is different in every individual to being with, and differently reinterpreted or reexperienced whenever they are recollected.... Frequently, our only truth is narrative truth, the stories we tell each other and ourselves - the stories we continually recategorize and refine. Such subjectivity is built into the very nature of memory, and follows from its basis and mechanisms in the human brain. The wonder is that aberrations of a gross sort are relatively rare, and that, for the most part, our memories are relatively solid and reliable.
_____________________________________If there is one thing I’ve learned from my readings in the science of the mind, it’s that the brain is most definitely not a reliable organ of perception. If you don’t believe me, believe Oliver Sacks, who has some experience with brain science. In Hallucinations he explores the wide variety of delusional perceptions humans are prey to – and not alone humans who’ve suffered trauma or are in a situation where you might expect delusions (like sensory deprivation or drug use). Perfectly healthy people are susceptible as well, including myself.At times, when I’m on the cusp of going to sleep and I’m reading in bed, I’ll hallucinate a page that doesn’t exist. I shake my head and come fully awake, and the illusory page will disappear but for that brief time, I will have been reading a perfectly legible and coherent story. Sometimes it will have some relationship to what I’m reading – characters will be the same; there will be some connection to the plot – but at other times, there will be none. I’ve also noticed that I’m prone to an olfactory hallucination most likely brought on by the fact that I currently live with six cats. Sometimes, I smell cat dootie (spelling?) when it doesn’t exist. It won’t happen when I’m in the room with the litter boxes so I know it’s not coming from there, but occasionally I’ll be sitting at the computer or come into a room and “smell” urine or kaka. When I search for its source, I can’t find it – no wet spots, no turds, and (once I’ve begun actively searching) no smell.And there’s my friend, who suffers from migraines. When I asked her if she hallucinated before a headache, she described exactly what other migraine sufferers describe in Chapter 7, “Patterns: Visual Migraines.” She also described losing half of her visual field – i.e., if she were looking at me, half of me would disappear; an experience I can’t even begin to imagine.The book is a collection of anecdotes. Sacks likes to tell stories but – in this book, at least – largely steers clear of asking “why,” which is why I’m giving this book two stars.The stories are interesting, however.One of my favorites is one he relates about Michael Shermer. For those who don’t know who Shermer is, he’s the founding publisher of Skeptic magazine, executive director of the Skeptic Society and a prolific author, including books on brain science. He’s also a marathon runner and triathlete. During one competition, he had reached a point of severe dehydration and utter exhaustion and hallucinated that he was abducted by aliens, losing 90 minutes of consciousness. It happened that the “aliens” were his support crew, who had forced him to stop running, take some fluids and rest.I also better understand the guests who show up on Coast to Coast AM with George Nouri, which I listen to on the drive home from work most nights. Most of the guests who claim to have seen, smelt and/or talked to angels, aliens, demons, ghosts, Loch Ness monsters, sasquatch, Star Children, etc., did.And the brain’s delusional propensity would also explain the astonishing and contradictory variety of religious revelations.I’d recommend Hallucinations as an entertaining, if rather hollow, diversion, but if you’re more interested in the why’s and how’s of brain science, this is not the book for you."
22,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/71163840-steven-meyers,5,"An eighty-four-year-old relative was very recently having a weeks-long hallucination in which she was seeing the devil standing in front of her. She was convinced that it meant she was going to Hell. The elderly Catholic had also loss her appetite and was barely sleeping. My wife and I, who live in another city and had long ago abandoned Christianity for a reality-based lifestyle, understood she was having a hallucination but did not know how severe it was. To complicate matters, our immediate family members, who do live near her and are still very religious, believed Satan HAD possessed her. To help her, they resorted to many prayer sessions in the relative’s living room. Naturally, their religious hootenannies did not have ole Beelzebub hightailing it back to Fire-and-Brimstone Central. Finally the eighty-four-year-old was admitted into the hospital for observation because she was threatening to hurt her husband as well as commit suicide. She was much too weak to pull off either task. Heck, pealing a banana would’ve been a major accomplishment for her. The doctors eventually discovered she had a urinary tract infection. Once it was treated during a long stay at the hospital, her hallucination disappeared. The eight-four-year-old does not remember much of what occurred during her plight and the relatives still maintain that Satan had taken time out of his busy day to possess their relative. I guess if you’re selected from the over seven-billion people on Earth for Mr. Horns-n-Hooves extended time and attention, it’s kind of flattering. I was shocked that the infection could raise such havoc to a person’s system. It was why I decided to read Dr. Sack’s ‘Hallucinations.’ The author’s book helped to clarify a lot about the condition and then some. Dr. Sacks keeps his book firmly planted in scientific observation and speculation. He explains how hallucinations have given rise to art, folklore, religions, and how Western stigmatization of the condition has caused many people to think they are going nuckin futz. The author does a good job of removing the social fear associated with having hallucinations. It is mostly written in layman terms but having a dictionary handy was helpful for me when looking up a handful of words and medical terms. The book is full of personal as well as clinical episodes. Dr. Sacks covers such topics as Charles Bonnet syndrome, how sensory deprivation can be a trigger, olfactory hallucinations, Parkinson’s disease, psychoactive substances, migraines, epilepsy, delirium, near-sleep hallucinations, narcolepsy, Lewy body disease (the late Robin Williams was a victim of it), post-traumatic episodes, death-bed hallucinations, religious visions, seeing your doppelganger, out-of-body and near-death experiences, and phantom limb sensation for amputees. Dr. Sacks does not delve into the evolution hypotheses for why our body reacts in such ways. This could be that while they do understand how the brain is triggered to show hallucinations, there is still much to learn. He also presents matter-of-fact scientific explanations about people who believe they’ve had religious experiences. If you are a believer in such godly interventions, you ain’t gonna like the author’s report. The late Dr. Sacks was a highly intelligent, inquisitive, gentle man. You will find no sarcasm or denigration inside ‘Hallucinations.’ It is a thoughtful exploration of a very interesting field. The book ends quite abruptly and was disconcerting. Most nonfiction works I read have some sort of summation but not Dr. Sack’s book. Despite that very minor complaint, ‘Hallucinations’ is wonderful. I learned a lot from it and will certainly read other works by the guy. He makes learning fun and helps readers to feel more empathy for people with such episodes. "
23,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7125076-rachel,5,"Hallucinations is a fascinating look at how people perceive things that aren't there. Auditory, visual, and tactile; with and without emotional significance; with and without the insight that the perception doesn't conform to objective reality. Sacks examines hallucinations caused by sensory deficits such as blindness; brain misfirings as in epilepsy and migraines; illness; trauma; therapeutic and recreational drugs; and more. He includes common experiences like sleep paralysis as well as perceptions that many would consider psychic or spiritual, such as near death experiences. It turns out that hallucinations are far more common than one might expect--for example, hearing voices is most often NOT associated with schizophrenia.There is not a lot of new information in this book; Sacks himself has covered much of the material before. The value is in his viewpoint and analysis. Some of the phenomena the book examines aren't what people would generally consider hallucinations, and I very much like how he pulls them all together into that category. For someone who hasn't read much about misperceptions the brain can produce, I think the book would be a lovely overview. I recently read, and loved, V. S. Ramachandran's Phantoms in the Brain. Sacks' writing is less technical; he mentions parts of the brain that produce effects when stimulated, but doesn't go into detail. Which makes the book almost as informative, but in a more general, more literary, and less scientific way. In fact, Sacks makes many references to writings by novelists, philosophers, and scientists of the last several centuries, which didn't interest me much but which many people probably like a lot. This helps him place current scientific thinking in a historical perspective. That perspective is one thing that makes this a wonderful book. But some of those references, some interpretations, and his use of some older terms made me see how quaint some of the material in this book will look in fifty or a hundred years.With those quibbles, I still give the book five stars, because it excited me and made me think (and because, hello? It's Oliver Sacks). I particularly liked two sections. First, the ""Altered States"" chapter, where Sacks talks about his not-inconsiderable experimentation with drugs, including LSD, opiates, and amphetamines. I haven't seen anything by him about this before, and found it endearing. (While reading Ramachandran's book, I kept thinking that if he just took some drugs, it would add a valuable dimension to his understanding.) Second, the material in the later part of the book dealing with altered perceptions that are often interpreted as supernatural visitations, visions, and spiritual experiences (good and bad). It is fascinating how scientists can pinpoint parts of the brain that are active during these experiences, and how stimulating those areas can produce the experiences. For historical perspective, among other things, Sacks notes the witch hysteria of several centuries ago, and notes that ""...witch-hunting and forced confession have hardly vanished from the world; they have simply taken other forms."""
24,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23002041-freckledbibliophile,5,"This book was so insightful.Ironically, a lot of us may have experienced a certain type of hallucination and didn’t even know it. In this book, Oliver Sacks speaks about some of the many hallucinations there are. For many, when you think of hallucinations you think of seeing things that aren’t actually there. Nonetheless, the book discusses how it’s more to it than that. It could also signify that you touch and even smell things that aren’t there.I admired most, Oliver Sacks honesty in this book, and some of the degrees he went to in order to test his theories. He was honest about taking fatal doses of a sedative and other drugs to have sound knowledge of his works. His case studies were very interesting, as with most of his books. I, likewise, was taken aback when he mentioned, Siri Hustvedt who also suffered from hallucinatory migraines, being that I’m currently reading one of her novels. Sacks, also, mentioned, Lewis Carol, who likewise suffered from migraines, and these migraines may have contributed to Alice In Wonderland strange alternations of sizes and shapes. Farther in the book, Sacks also addressed neurological disorders that go hand in hand with certain types of hallucinations. This was an enjoyable read, and in some parts funny, especially, the conversations with his friends after having a drug induced hallucination. I highly advocate this book if you’re into neuroscience."

He explains that hallucinations are underreported because most people (and many doctors) believe that any type of hallucination means you're crazy.Cool words I learned while reading this:the prisoner's cinema: a terrifying or entertaining hallucinated light show experienced by people confined in dark cellsCharles Bonnet syndrome (CBS): complex visual hallucinations by people who are blind or who have low visioncataplexy: a sudden and temporary loss of muscle tone when the patient feels emotion, particularly laughter or terror; common in people who also have narcolepsyhypnopompic: related to the semiconscious period before wakinghypnogogia: sleep paralysis--your mind feels awake, but you can't moveCapgras syndrome: the delusion that a spouse, friend, or close family member has been replaced with an identical impostor or replicantpolyopia: hallucinating multiple copies of a single real object"

Once I got halfway through the book, it was obvious that I was not as interested in the subject matter as that pretty cover had me believing.

The ball spins constantly until it breaks apart into sprays of very tiny, brightly colored spheres. As a child, I was surprised to learn that not everyone sees this ""show"" at night. Too bad because it is very relaxing. Oliver Sachs's new book taught me that what I see is a hallucination. This was news to me and worth the price of the book.Sachs' new book dedicates a chapter to each category of hallucination. The best parts are when the author describes his own hallucinations, drug-induced and otherwise. At times the book lapses into a catalog of hallucinatory cases, probably valuable to professionals but not terribly interesting ."

One of the most interesting cases was for me the first one. a blind woman who was experiencing hallucinations, but turned out to actually have a disease that caused this.

There are many types of hallucinations that are caused by a variety of reasons, not all of them illness. Sacks explains how they occur and what they reveal. This book is a great education for the world not schooled in psychology. Oliver Sacks is the genius that speaks in a simple language that everyone understands and enjoys."
31,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,4,"Reading a book about hallucination by Oliver Sacks after reading a memoir about schizophrenia by Elyn Saks was a good coincidence. Sacks doesn't say why, but he stays away from psychotic hallucinations in this book. Like other Sacks's books, this one shows again how we are at the mercy of the three-pound grey matter inside our head. Ideally, the brain constructs a model of reality based on sensory inputs gathered from the outside world. But when it decides to cut off this link and do things autonomously, there's nothing we can do other than hope to retain the ability to distinguish reality from the brain's trickery.This book offers a good survey of the conditions under which the brain's link with the outside world can be broken, resulting in hallucinations: loss of sight or hearing, sensory depravation, hallucinogenic drugs, some medications (such as the ones for Parkinson's disease), migraines, epilepsy, amputated limbs, sleep disorders, etc. Hallucinations are a lot more common than we normally think. The most interesting part of the book is when Sacks talks about his own hallucinations resulting from his experiments with drugs. Having a discussion with a talking spider about Russell's paradox must have been quite an experience! "

It has happened to all of us at one time or another. We usually pass it off and would never think about calling it an hallucination. The word ""hallucination"" evokes madness, schizophrenia, or other mental aberrations. But as Dr. Sacks explains, that is not the case. Hallucination has a broader definition and may be caused by such things as physical illness,blindness, loss of hearing, hypothermia, lack of food, etc. The author shares the experiences of many of his patients and some are particularly frightening. Seeking help, these individuals discovered that they were indeed not insane, although many had to learn to live with and adapt their lifestyle to the continuing ""visions"" and ""voices"". This is a fascinating book and it does help to have some clinical background as the author does touch on medical issues and brain function. Recommended."
33,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7367292-jessie,5,"Really interesting book. An account of various forms of hallucinations from delirium to self-induced altered states. It not only reports on visual forms, but also delves into auditory hallucinations and phantom smells. It felt very complete and covered many common misconceptions about the variety of hallucinations. Not deeply scientific as to the specifics of how and why these things occur, but a relatively complete account of experiences nonetheless. He shares his findings with enough of an explanation that I felt both informed and consistently entertained, while not having to be a schooled in neuroscience to understand him. It gave a sound history and clarification of various hallucinatory occurrences without overwhelming me with jargon. Oliver Sacks has a way of writing in a way that feels very conversational, but doesn't underestimate his reader either. I really enjoyed this book. "

35,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5485612-iona-stewart,5,"This is a comprehensive book. It turns out that hallucinations are not just seen by those suffering from mental illness; there are many different types.There is, for example, Charles Bonnet Syndrome, where blind people, those who have not seen anything for years, suddenly begin to “see things”. This is a reaction of the brain to the loss of eyesight.Complex visions may be seen. Incongruous figures may appear in the room. Most people with CBS will be aware that they are hallucinating while some hallucinations may be thought to be real.Faces, text, numerals, or musical notes may be seen.People subjected to sensory deprivation, e.g. those placed in dark tanks of warm water, may experience visual hallucinations.Hearing voices occurs in every culture and has often been accorded great importance.Voices may occur with anyone in situations of extreme threat or danger. Freud himself heard voices on two such occasions. Suicide attempts may be prevented by hearing a voice.Musical hallucinations are not uncommon.Parkinson’s patients, particularly those with post-encephalitic syndromes, medicated with L-dopa are prone to vivid dreams, nightmares and visual illusions or hallucinations.More than a quarter of the author’s patients with ordinary Parkinson’s disease experienced hallucinations after several years on L-dopa.But there is a more malignant form of Parkinson’s which is accompanied by dementia and visual hallucinations even in the absence of L-dopa. Examination of the brain may show abnormal aggregates of protein (Lewy bodies) inside the nerve cells.In a chapter on altered states, the author describes his own experiences when taking drugs, e.g. Artane, a synthetic drug related to belladonna. He took twenty pills of Artane and found himself having a conversation with a couple of friends whom he thought had dropped in to visit him but it turned out this was a product of his imagination.The author experimented with many drugs and, among other things, had experiences of seeing a wonderful indigo colour.After taking large doses of chloral hydrate to get to sleep, then stopping, he began to see “bug-eyed monsters” – he had the DTs, delirium tremens. He had hallucinations for nearly 96 hours.Migraines often induce hallucinations too, often complex ones, and the author has also experienced these.There is a chapter about epilepsy which can give “ecstatic” seizures, and one about “hallucinations in the half-field”, when one loses vision in one eye.The final chapters encompass also “psychical” or “paranormal” experiences. OBEs and also visits by angels.One thing that bothers me about Oliver Sacks’ text is that his scepticism of spiritual matters shines through, since he tends to classify spiritual experiences as “hallucinations”. I absolutely disagree that a spiritual experience indicates something wrong with the brain, on the contrary!I found the book fascinating; it introduced me to all sorts of experiences that I knew nothing about. Sacks’ language is not just extremely rich but filled with specialized words that not many will have heard of; neither are these likely to be found in the dictionary.I recommend the book for those interested in the brain and its abnormalities and will be reading further books by this author."
36,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose,5,"Hallucinations by Oliver Sacks is a collection of hallucination cases collected throughout the writer’s career. Some have been included in his previous books such as Musicophilia. Hallucination here refers to ""perception arising absent from any external reality"", even though the writer agrees that the boundary between hallucination, delusion and misconception is not always clear. This is a rather board definition, but most hallucinations included in this book are neurological and conditions such as schizophrenia are not discussed. I am surprised by the amount of different human conditions where hallucinations can occur. Certainly “hallucination = madness” is wrong.One chapter is dedicated to migraine. Migraine is my friend, as I have experienced many episodes of the zigzag visual hallucination which I now know is classic to many migraine patients. Oliver Sacks also suffered from migraines and his desire to become a neurologist came from his own “migraine experience, sort of spontaneous and fortunately reversible experiment of the nature, a window into the nerve system.”Had every interesting intellectual from 1960s taken drugs? In Chapter 6, Oliver Sacks documented his own drug use. He started in his thirties because he wanted to gain first-hand experience of the neurological and psychological effects of drugs. Curiosity or intellectual pursuit? It seems his effort to enhance his mental state is more about experience than enjoyment. What he experienced after taking high dosage of artane was frightening yet utterly beguiling, so was the Delirium Tremens after he stopped taking a drug to help him sleep, also his only morphine experience. I can’t help thinking how lucky he was for not having overdosed. The most fascinating story was his last experience with amphetamine. It raised a question: if your brain can produce all the enchantment you need, and if you can reach your desired mental state without drugs, do you still want to take drugs?Why hadn't he become addicted to any of these highly addictive drugs? Oliver Sacks explained why several types of hallucinations, such as: -- ecstatic temporal lobe epilepsy (Joan of Arc had ecstatic seizure? Dostoevsky’s religious belief affirmed by his ecstatic seizure?) -- hypnagogia, sleep paralysis and other sleep disorders -- oxygen deprivation in the brain causing out-of-body hallucinations (the neurological base for elements in Near Death Experience: out-of-body, tunnel vision and lights)..., may have contributed to religious beliefs, supernatural beliefs (ghosts, witches and alien abductions). “Divine”, “Touched by God” may have been be hallucinations induced by long term practice of self-suggestions (no judgement here).Is this ability of brain a blessing or a curse?In the end of the book, Oliver Sacks wrote:“The primal, animal sense of the 'other’, which may have evolved for the detection threats, can take on a lofty even transcendent function in human beings, as the biological basis for religious passions and convictions: the 'other' becomes GOD”A book to entertain as well as to offer food for thoughts."
37,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/81350561-k-a-ashcomb,4,"There is so much to concentrate on reviewing this book. Sacks telling the medical side of hallucinations, the personal side, his and the patients', the history of it, the different conditions, everything, but what piqued my interest was their relation to the imagination, arts, and creativity. Sacks repeatedly note that these hallucinations might have impacted our cultural imagery from the moire patterns on our art to horrible monsters seen between the wake and sleep as Edgar Allan Poe did. Sacks also wrote about how times and science have changed hallucinations from fairies to aliens. So, it is not a one-way street with hallucinations, but a dialogue between what is and what isn't. But also, that imagery of hallucinations seem to cross borders and have similarity to them despite the culture which might explain similarities with some of those archetypes we have. To think, what an impact these mental states have had to our world, to the words we speak, to the ideas we play with, to the monsters that torment us in movies and in our minds. Yet, they are so often seen as dangerous, harmful, and unwanted in our modern societies. So why do we have them if they are abnormal? What good do they do than enchant our culture's symbols and entertain us with horror stories? Are they some quirk that has snuck past individual selection for passing on genes or something else? I don't consider having an answer to these questions, only thinking aloud how hallucinations and even our ""normal"" mental state are fascinatingly complex and bizarre. That the lines we too quickly draw between sane, healthy, and useful are not as clear as we want to think. That out of bizarre can raise something that transforms our way of thinking and understanding of the world. I mentioned about the harmfulness, and I think it is not ours to judge. Sacks repeatedly writes what kind of impact the hallucinations have had on the people's lives he recounts, and some like to live with the hallucinations while others find them disconcerting. But I can understand why people might find seeing, hearing, feeling, tasting, smelling things that are not there scary. Scary enough to think people like that should be medicated. The unknown and uncontrollable is always frightening. But that depends on the person and of the hallucinations. It is beautiful how Oliver Sacks lets the people speak on their own, what the experiences are like. His text is not some cold medical facts account, but personal stories and reasons behind them, making this delight to listen/read to. I loved the book and how comprehensive it was. It made me question a lot of things. For one, what is normal, and what is not. Also, our consciousness is not straightforward or simple. If you are interested in hallucinations, consciousness, mind, mind-altering, then you should check this book out.Thank you for reading! Happy days!"
38,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6965537-james,5,"The author, Oliver Sacks, M.D. was a physician, a best-selling author, and a professor of neurology at the NYU School of Medicine. The New York Times has referred to him as “the poet laureate of medicine.” He found that visual deprivation (prisoners in total darkness, sensory deprivation tanks used in the 1960s) and monotony (sailors watching the ocean for days) can produce hallucinations. Some folks can hallucinate smells of something that is not there. I am one of those that hear musical phrases. ""Such practices as meditation, spiritual exercises, and ecstatic drumming or dancing can also facilitate the achievement of trance states akin to that of hypnosis, with vivid hallucinations and profound physiological changes (for instance, a rigidity which allows the entire body to remain as still as a board while supported only at the head and feet)"" (247). Physicians find that about one-third of patients with Parkinson's disease reported hallucinations. ""The effects of cannabis, mescaline, LSD, and other hallucinogenic drugs have an immense range and variety"" (102-121). The author has hallucinations with migraine headaches. In 1881, research categorized the auditory and visual hallucinatory effects of epileptic attacks. The loss of a significant portion of one's field of vision can generate hallucinations in the blind part of the visual field. It may be that alcohol or the vast number of medications prescribed and sometimes interact with one another can increase the risk of hallucinations. Those with narcolepsy fall asleep suddenly can hallucinate having auditory or tactile, visual, and feelings in the body in their experience. A hallucination that appears while awakening is ""often seen with open eyes, in bright illumination; they are frequently projected into external space and seem to be totally solid and real"" (210). ""Nearly one-half of recently bereft people had illusions or full-fledged hallucinations of a dead spouse"" (234), in one study. T. M. Luhrmann in When God Talks Back finds ""one day the mind leaps from imagination to hallucination, and the congregant hears God, sees God"" (250). Hallucinations may occur in children who have an imaginary friend or to those at the end of life, deathbed hallucinations. Finally, out-of-body experiences (OBE) and near-death experiences, seeing oneself as a double, and shadows can involve ""hallucinatory distortions of the body and body image"" (287)."
39,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5310282-silvia-cachia,0,"My second book by Sacks. My first book was his The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Other Clinical Tales, and I found it fascinating. This one, Hallucinations, was another fascinating title. I recommend it. I think we all should know lots of things he shares with us about hallucinations. We may think they are not as common as they are, specially in some type of illnesses like Parkinson, even migraines, etc.Each chapter is devoted to a different type of hallucination, in my last review, I mentioned the hallucinations caused by sensory deprivation, the Parkinson, drug induced hallucinations, those produced by trauma, epilepsy, induced by meditation, and the last chapters talk about outside of body experiences, doppelganger experiences, near death experiences, and ghost limbs.Oliver Sacks tone is very conversational, easy to understand, even though he mentions scientific details too, his aim is always the big picture, and he conveys information and facts through a nice narration tone.I cannot tell you which chapter was the most fascinating. Many writers and people come up in the book, Dostoevsky, Maupassant, Joan of Arc, Dickens... But I think the most shocking chapter is Sack's own experience with drugs. It went from medical curiosity and research, to a dangerous addiction. However, he survived it, recovered from it, and left it all for us to read about in his works.I have to add that I've never have a hallucination in my life, and, after the book, I felt kind of sad (not that I desire any of the tragedies that many times come with them), but some of these experiences were interesting, and beautiful too, and many were NOT BAD at all (like some only children who have imaginary friends for some years, until 7 or so, when they stop). Anyway, I don't want to idealize this either, I just say thanks to Sacks, he's helped me understand and learn many valuable things."
40,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18636605-erin,3,"Oliver Sacks rescues hallucinatory experience from the narrow realm of psychiatric illness and psychedelic adventure and places it in a larger cultural context; he brings it into the mainstream and shows us how common hallucinatory experiences are. Sacks gently reveals the fragility of our minds and how subtle influences such as imagination, sensory or sleep deprivation can have an enormous impact on our perception of reality. He invites us to revel in the realities our minds can create while in the same breath changing our inherited idea of normalcy. Sacks introduces the idea that hallucinations are not only common and often benign but that they can even be enjoyable and holistic. He asks us to consider the fascinating role our brains play in the human experience and condition. Sacks uses patients' accounts to illuminate humanity's long history with the supernatural and spiritual. His deft approach does not negate the profundity or spirituality of those experiences but offers a different lens by which to view them, he offers the lens of neuroscience.""Neuroscientists now tend to speak of “default networks” in the brain, which generate their own images. Perhaps one may also venture the term “play” and think of the visual cortex playing with every permutation, playing with no goal, no focus, no meanings—a random activity or perhaps an activity with so many microdeterminants that no pattern is ever repeated. Few phenomena give such a sense of the brain’s creativity and computational power as the almost infinitely varied, ever-changing torrent of patterns and forms which may be seen in hypnagogic states."""
41,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19370357-jack-barten,3,"I have been a fan of Sacks for a long time and I really looked forward to this one. The general topic is of great interest to me and have read many other books on the subject. However, something about this book didn't quite work. It seemed a bit more laboured than his earlier books and it told stories around the subject without really doing the subject justice. To be fair to Sacks, however, it is a difficult subject to bring to life. There is something about the subject of hallucination and dreams that prevents books from quite doing what we would like. No amount of words, no blend of stories can articulate something so personal, strange and indescribable. It's harder than trying to describe dancing or a perfect moment. Or a hellish one. Anybody who has not experienced something comparable would find the description tedious and those who have don't really need to read it. I should imagine most readers have picked it up because it was written by Sacks.For me the most interesting part of the book was Sack's own experiences with drugs. It would have been great if he was able to write in details about these earlier in his career as someone of his stature could have helped encourage more balanced debate than have often been had. But this may have caused some to write him off in the same way that many drug users have been written off. "
42,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,3," some interesting descriptions of hallucinations that are not related to mental illness. Cases such as Charles Bonnet syndrome which occurs when vision is degenerating and the mind fills in the gap for failing sense organs. There are also descriptions of Sensory deprivation like the experiments carried out in sensory deprivation tanks in the 60s. Their is hallucinogenic experiences related to drugs like LSD, Peyote and DMT. Hypnogogic and Hypnopompic hallucinations related to just before falling asleep or waking up. There are also night terrors when people claim to be visited by aliens or demons in the middle of the night. And hallucinations related to migraines and epilepsy. Kind of interesting but I would have like to have known a bit more about the neurophysiology of hallucinations. As a sidenote I liked the story about an old woman in a nursing home who hallucinated lovers who had sex with her. She related that it was a pleasant experience. I could live with that kind of hallucination."
43,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5416281-felix-hayman,4,"Why do we read Sacks? Is it the nature of all his subjects or is it the fact that there is always a Sacks memoir at the centre of all his books? ""Hallucinations"" is an examination not of the visions of the schizophrenic or the mentally ill, it is an examination of everyday experiences by people who hallucinate because of a point of stress - migraine, blindness, auditory loss or even the social use of drugs.Sacks opens each one of these boxes and shows the consistent patterns in each.He also looks at a long use of drugs in his own early life and the extent that hallucinations played their part as well as the hallucinations caused by migraine and other stress related illness.It is a personal journey along with anecdotal evidence from patients and friends.There are ""Saksisms"" throughout and a refernce across these experiences to a possible neurological theory but, as in all Sacks books, he does not labour the point."

I find the endless descriptions from people I don’t know rather boring – in the same way that tweets and blogs about dreams or what the writer had for breakfast are excruciatingly dull. The book really only comes alive for me when Sacks is describing his own experiences. "
45,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21613889-jay,3,"Prior to Hallucinations, my first reading of Oliver’s* work, I’ve been a fan through his appearances on Radiolab and recommendations by friends. What I found most enjoyable in his writing is the characteristic way he elucidates neurological phenomena through a humanitarian lens. I have a rudimentary education in science and lean towards the humanities in interest, so being able to read the first-hand accounts of patients made an otherwise dense topic approachable and relatable. It also allows for the reader to empathize with these patients in their search for understanding and consolation, which seems most important when dealing with neurological disorders that are so readily stigmatized as psychosis. Our contemporary scientific and medical practices have a tendency to isolate the person from the ailment in the search for understanding. Oliver trekked against the tide by placing the patient back into focus.Here are the four concepts I’ve found most insightful after reading Hallucinations…1. Perception is a two-way street, involving not only reception but also generation:“We are not given an already made, preassembled visual world; we have to construct our own visual world as best can. This construction entails analysis and synthesis at many functionals levels in the brain, starting with perception of lines and angles and orientation in the occipital cortex. At higher levels, in the inferotemporal cortex, the “elements” of visual perception are of a more complex sort, appropriate for the analysis and recognition of natural scenes, objects, animal and plant forms, letters, and faces. Complex visual hallucinations entail the putting together of such elements, an act of assemblage, and these assemblages are continually permuted, disassembled, and reassembled.”2. The stigmatization of hallucinations, especially hearing voices, is a recent societal development:“Psychiatry, and society in general, had been subverted by the almost axiomatic belief that ‘hearing voices’ spelled madness and never occurred except in the context of severe mental disturbance. This belief is a fairly recent one, as the careful and humane reservations of early researchers on schizophrenia made clear. But by the 1970s, antipsychotic drugs and tranquilizers had begun to replace other treatments, and careful history taking, looking at the whole life of the patient, had largely been replaced by the use of DSM criteria to make snap diagnoses.”3. Hallucinations are an incredibly common neurological phenomenon, occurring as a result of sensory deprivation (sometimes within one hour), the loss of limbs, migraines, Parkinson’s disease, post-traumatic stress, intoxication, hypnagogic and hypnopompic “sleep” states, exhaustion, sleep deprivation, epilepsy, brain damage i.e. strokes, dementia, delirium, and schizophrenia—to name a few.4. The meaning-making that we place on hallucinations is an entirely subjective exercise largely influenced by the superstitions of the current social climate, i.e. witch trials:“In Charles Bonnet syndrome, there seems to be a mechanism in the brain that generates or facilitates hallucination—a primary physiological mechanism, related to local irritation, “release,” neurotransmitter disturbance, or whatever—with little reference to the individual’s life circumstances, character, emotions, beliefs, or state of mind. While people with such hallucinations may (or may not) enjoy them as a sensory experience, they almost uniformly emphasize their meaninglessness, their irrelevance to events and issues of their lives.”“But one can readily see why others, perhaps of a different disposition, might interpret the “sure knowledge of the close presence of a sort of mighty person’ and ‘a startling awareness of some ineffable good’ in mystical, if not religious, terms. Other case histories in [William] James’s chapter bear this out, leading him to say that “many persons (how many we cannot tell) possess the objects of their belief not in the form of mere conceptions which the intellect accepts as true, but rather in the form of quasi-sensible realities directly apprehended.Thus the primal, animal sense of ‘the other,’ which may have evolved for the detection of threat, can take on a lofty, even transcendent function in human beings, as a biological basis for religion passion and conviction, where the “other,” the “presence,” becomes the person of God.”* * *I think I would’ve enjoyed the book a bit more if it started with the chapter titled “Altered States.” In this chapter we learn about Oliver’s own experiences of hallucinations, often under altered states of consciousness while on his “drug holidays.” It concluded with a revelatory story about how Oliver learned of his life’s purpose while on a 10-hour amphetamine bender. This story vividly displayed the depth of his curiosity and intensity with which he approached life. It aptly frames the rest of the book as the thesis for his writing, but we only learn of it six chapters in.While there’s a clear sense of Oliver’s compassion for his patients, I feel like he relied too much on his patients in telling their own stories. The tone of the writing felt a bit hands-off in providing grander insights into the mystery of hallucinations, which I found surprising since it was written at the end of his career. I wanted more connective tissue between stories. While this came in full force during Oliver’s own accounts of hallucination in Chapter 6, afterwards my interest began to waiver. It felt like I was being handed a stack of case studies to sift through, although each of the patient stories has its own poetic brilliance:""I am maneuvered into a delightfully soft chair. I sink, submerged as usual in shades of night…the sea of clouds at my feet clears, revealing a field of grain, and standing about it a small flock of fowl, not two alike, in somber plumage: a miniature peacock, very slender, with its little crest and unfurled tail feathers, some plumper specimens, and a shore bird on long stems, etc. Now it appears that several are wearing shoes, and among them a bird with four feet. One expects more color among a flock of birds, even in the hallucinations of the blind…The birds have turned into little men and women in medieval attire, all strolling away from me. I see only their backs, short tunics, tights or leggings, shawls or kerchiefs…Opening my eyes on the smoke screen of my room I am treated to stabs of sapphire, bags of rubies scattering across the night, a legless vaquero in a checked shirt stuck on the back of a small steer, bucking, the orange velvet head of a bear decapitated, poor thing, by the guard of the Yellowstone Hotel garbage pit. The familiar milkman invaded the scene in his azure cart with the golden horse; he joined us a few days ago out of some forgotten book of nursery rhymes or the back of a Depression cereal box…But the magic lantern show of colored oddities has faded and I am back in black-wall country without form or substance…where I landed as the lights went out.""—Virginia Hamilton Adair, poet (who suffered from Charles Bonnet Syndrome after losing her eyesight to glaucoma)I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in altered states of consciousness and the peculiar powers of perception. I plan to follow up this book with Oliver’s memoir, On the Move, to hear more about this endearing man who turned over rocks looking for pure indigo, “the color of heaven,” “the color of the Paleozoic sea!”*Oliver’s writing style feels like he’s writing more to a friend than an unknown reader, and ""Oliver"" has a much more pleasing sound than SACKS!"

The deeply interesting narration of clinical cases grows on you, slowly but surely. It's amazing how the human brain can trick you into believing things, how various disorders of the brain like various syndromes, Parkinsons, Migraines, Epilepsy, Deliriousness, Narcolepsy can cause hallucinations of sight, sound and smell, how some of these experiences are unworldly and life-changing. Right from our formative years, the human brain is trained to think in patterns, that reinforce each other, use the same networks in the brain. What happens in some of these disorders or when such a state is induced by hallucinogenic drugs, is that parts of the brain previously unconnected, which had never communicated before, get activated, which can in turn lead to hallucinogenic experiences. People who undergo such transcendental experiences are forever changed, in the sense that these experiences help to break the usual repetitive thinking pattern of the brain, forming links between parts of the brain previously unconnected, helping them to think in new ways. And herein lies the usefulness of hallucinogenic drugs like LSD and Ketamine in treating mental disorders like Depression or in aiding creative thought, helping people to think in new ways. In fact Oliver Sack's has himself experimented with half the drugs mentioned in the book and suffers from a couple of the mental disorders mentioned in the book. Fascinating read!"
47,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/491443-john,2,"Generally, when one thinks of hallucination, perceptions of something not present, a mental illness, such as schizophrenia, comes to mine. Dr. Sacks provides a description of other disorders where hallucinations might be present. Although the most common hallucinations tend to be visual or auditory, hallucinations can involve any of the sense organs. Other disorders or situations which can involve hallucinations include as detailed in this book: Parkinsonism, narcolepsy, and altered states of consciousness induced by psychoactive substances. The author provide detailed descriptions of these hallucinations from literary sources as well as many case studies. Subtleties in the hallucinations depend on which part of the brain is involved. I was drawn to this book hoping for detailed research involving hallucinations among the mentally ill but this area received very little attention. The number of case studies, although enlightening, became tedious after awhile and I had to put the book down."
48,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40281851-enrique,2,"After having read and enjoyed ""The man who mistook his wife for a hat"" several years ago, I followed a recommendation and decided to read ""Hallucinations"".I found the book very shallow and repetitive. It is probably because we understand so little of what causes hallucinations, that most of the explanations were hypothetical and hand-wavy. The book is organized in chapters, each of which is focused on a source for hallucinations: blindness, near-sleep, migraine, epilepsy, Parkinson disease, etc. The chapters are a sequence of descriptions from patients' symptoms, many of which are in common between the various causes. The first chapter was very interesting, but after several chapters each page seemed more of the same. I could predict what each subsequent chapter was going to say from the title.I guess I'll have to wait until neuroscience is far more advanced in order to understand better the root and causes of hallucinations."
49,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/91326071-zo,3,"I have Oliver Sacks to thank for my newly broad perspective on hallucinations and what may be considered as such. I do, however, wish the information could have been presented in a more palatable style. Sacks’ style of writing flowed well, and I would have enjoyed it a lot more if he had allowed it to flow more freely. The heavy use of footnotes gave me a sense of his flow being interrupted. It may only be my preference, but using so many footnotes to tell stories of historical figures or of those in his life distracted me from the other stories he was telling. They were all incredibly interesting, entertaining stories, so my distraction was disappointing, but continuing to read was mostly worth it for the anecdotes I couldn’t have otherwise imagined were possible for people to have."
50,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/62488403-ben,4,"Sacks' anthology of hallucinations (excl. Schizophrenic hallucinations) is worth reading, even if only for his account of his, rather prolonged, dabbling with hallucinogenic and stimulant drugs.""I want to see Indigo now""It spans far more than psychedlic or drug-induced hallucinations, covering the phenomena as it relates to delerium, sleep, lack of sensory input and synaesthesia. "
51,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8534584-d-l,4,"The best part about this book is how it brings hallucinations down a peg. It pulls them down from the rare obscurity of the asylum and puts them at the dinner table, or under the table...is that really a table? He illustrates the ordinariness of hallucinations in a way that seems to make them a part of human experience rather than an aberration thereof."
52,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6756276-sngsweelian,4,"Oliver Sacks offered a fascinating look into hallucinations in its various forms, showing us the mysteries of our brain that are unfathomable, yet wondrously illuminating in some ways. His books always leave me yearning to know more, but also very humbled in the knowledge that we will never be able to fully understand the intricacies of the human brain. "
53,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27745736-kayson-fakhar,4,A really nice book on hallucinations. Full of interesting details and historical stories. You just realize how pervasive it was and is.
54,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/24646261-ashlee-bree,4,"Many people (I exclude myself from this) can be put off by books about scientific/medical phenomena because they worry about accessibility, about being able to engage with subject matter that may be clinical or technical in way of explanation at times, so what Sacks excels particularly well at here is bridging the gap between the science and the experiences behind hallucination. He strikes a balance that's half personal, half objectively removed. It makes it so his explanations, observations, and deductions about hallucinations in all their forms are informative and instructive, yet also largely narrative in nature. It's that narrative element - which weaves his or his patients' own experiences into the text - that allows him to break down more abstract scientific concepts into something more approachable, more intelligible, for every day readers.I think one of my biggest takeaways from this is simply understanding that we all do or have experienced hallucination. It occurs more often and broadly than we realize, with the brain conjuring them for reasons benign or malignant. They can result from things like brain injury, blindness, drug use, epilepsy, fevers, sensory deprivation, lack of sleep, etc.Personally, I found one of the most interesting tidbits of the whole book to be about the connection between art/creativity and hallucination. For instance, Amy Tan has suffered from visual hallucinations for much of her life and often draws inspiration from them for her writing. Tries to find the right words to describe what she sees. Dostoevsky, too, who suffered from epilepsy, experienced ""ecstatic hallucinations"" and would welcome the episodes because he felt they were out-of-body enlightening, latter using his experiences as a plot detail in his book, The Idiot. It made me wonder about the myriad of famous artists/writers who indulged in mind-altering substances or reported to ""hearing voices"" or even claimed to have religious experiences as they were creating their work throughout history. Is hallucination more common among artists? Why? Is it somehow loosely connected to creativity, to imagination?Fascinating stuff. Gave me lots to think about."
55,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4756170-daniel,5,"Sacks is a neurologist and he described brilliantly the many different conditions that can trigger off hallucinations:1. Visual hallucination after blindness or visual cortex stroke2. Complex temporal lobe seizures can cause hallucinations, especially those of religious or spiritual nature. He postulated religious experiences and psychics have this kind of seizures. There are some postulations about Joan of Arc having complex seizures which appeared to her as divine visions. What this did not explain was how she led the French to victory, being a peasant girl... 3. Migraines can have auras which are hallucinations. 4. Patients with Parkinson’s Disease are treated with L-dopa which had been known to cause hallucinations. 5. Alcohol or drug withdrawals can cause delirium tremens.6. Certain lesions in the temporal lobe can cause out of body experiences. 7. Sleep paralysis can cause the doppelgänger hallucination where the patient does not know which ‘person’ is the real one, sometimes alternating between the two. 8. Near death experiences involve patients flying out, looking down on their bodies, and going through a tunnel to bright light, and a warm feeling. This may suggest the existence of heaven for some, but in neurology the lack of blood to the temporal lobe causes complex partial seizures with the out of body experience; lack of blood to visual cortex causes narrowing of visual field thus a tunnel, and flashing lights; lack of blood to the parietal lobe causes the warm feeling with God. Of course this does not explain what was seen by some patients which cannot be explained easily. See Jeffrey Long’s book God and the Afterlife. 9. Phantom limbs always cause limb hallucinations, pain and sometimes deformity of the limbs. It can be treated with a prosthesis, or a mirror that allows the good side to mimic the lost limb. 10. Post traumatic stress disorder happens when the experience is not processed normally, but locked away. Then flashbacks of the experience happens. 11. Last but not least, Sacks himself had fried many hallucinogens, which can of course lead to hallucinations. This is such a great book about hallucinations! "
56,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/95419686-joy,4,how amazing it is to now how my brain will compensate for my crisis!!!!
57,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14604594-april-eclecticbookworm,4,Interesting and entertaining look at the ways and whys of hallucinations. Not at all dry and makes me want to pick up his other work soon.
58,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3847310-bob,4,"A fascinating journey into the human brain and the world of hallucinations, visual, aural and other. Sacks takes both his personal experiences with psychdelic drugs and the worlds of his patients to explore the alternate realities, noting the many philosophers, writers, musicians and artists who have described their hallucinations, as well as people who have lost limbs, eyesight, hearing, or loved ones. As always, Sacks delves deep into these mysteries with color and insight. "
59,0307957241,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4626387-linda,4,"Oliver Sacks is the man who got me interested in neuroscience of the brain. I have a teaching minor in psychology, but back in THOSE days, the study of the brain through neurology was so much in its infant days that I'd never heard of it when I read The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat. Now I'm taking a course (date not set yet, but I'm enrolled) with Coursera (the free courses from tons of super universities - mine is with the Pennsylvania University School of Medicine) on the neurology of the brain.So I read all of Sacks's books. I'm still not sure that I believe that EVERYTHING we experience is just a result of neurons talking to each other in our brain, but I accept that a lot of it is.Hallucinations takes up the subject of those ""weird"" events that happen to us, when we think we see the ghost of our mother (or our cat), hear music when we're totally alone, etc. (I once heard an entire symphony, so completely that I could follow all the different instrumental lines).Obviously some of these come from brain damage. Sacks identifies the part of the brain affected when this is true. (Although I've been interested in this subject for years, I had trouble following which part he was talking about. For a complete understanding, have a detailed ""map"" of the brain available.)And, of course, he has lots of personal examples from people who have written to him. Although he doesn't come right out and say it, he feels that these examples come from a ""twitch"" in the area of the brain which usually controls this. I was frightened to death of the example of a woman who experiences sleep paralysis when she woke up once to the feeling of someone in her bed and when she opened her eyes saw this horrible,ugly (teeth missing or black), fierce grinned man lying in bed beside her. ""He"" slowly faded away and her paralysis let up. The description was HORRIBLE!Some of the effects I've experienced (the symphony mentioned above). I've had patterns and bright colors appear before my closed eyes just after I'd closed them to fall asleep. I'm learning to concentrate enough that I can pull up specific colors to calm my mind enough to fall asleep. I frequently have the musical hallucinations (probably because I've played instruments pretty much my whole life). I haven't yet seen a ""ghost"" or had an episode where the road suddenly diverged when I was driving, but who knows?Also scary are the stories from people who, as I just mentioned, will be driving and suddenly see two roads, or the highway diverge or even a person on the hood of their car, as if they'd hit a pedestrian.Fortunately, Sacks says, almost all of us recognize that we're hallucinating although we may not call it that. However, there are people who do not. He mentions, without judgement, those who hear the voice of God or feel his presence. Also those who are informed about the end of the world and how to prepare. It would be nice from my point of view to attribute all of that nonsense to ""brain farts"" but you can't convince those who experience these episodes of that.Sacks has produced another one of his incredible studies of the brain and I recommend that anyone interested in the subject read this book. The only reason that I didn't give the book a 5 is that Sacks is getting old and a few of the chapters repeated things already mentioned in other chapters at the end or just kind of drifted to a close. But when Sacks is good, he is very, very good."
