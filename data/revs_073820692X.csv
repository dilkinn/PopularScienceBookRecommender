0,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1849033-kiri,4,"I picked up this book during my recent trip to Edinburgh, and it quickly became my favorite companion. I'd wanted to learn more about James Hutton (father of geology!), especially since I was visiting the very city where he'd given his startling lectures in 1785 pronouncing the Earth as ""immeasurably old"" -- much older than the then-accepted age of 6,000 years! And indeed, this book delivers. It tells a great and gripping story---or rather, several stories. Other reviewers have complained that this book diverges from its primary topic of Hutton to go off on tangents about contemporary historical events, but this is precisely what I love about the book. It gave me a real sense of the context in which his work was set, and thereby provided a better understanding of its significance, and how it came about. I learned about Bonnie Prince Charlie and how his invasion of Edinburgh, accompanied by the highland clans, led later to the British exacting a brutal retribution that devastated the clans but, perhaps fortuitously for the future of science, afforded Edinburgh with its first real security that paved the way for the ""Scottish Enlightenment"" in the late 1700's, in which milieu Hutton thrived. Far from being irrelevant, since this all happened while Hutton was in college in Edinburgh, I think it is very relevant for imagining his life and his impressions.The book is filled with evocative descriptions of Edinburgh, and in reading them while sitting in cafes or pubs, during my own exploration of the city, I was impressed with how Repcheck had really captured Edinburgh in his pages. I also really liked that Repcheck didn't end his book with Hutton's death, but continued on to chase out the unfolding story of geology as a science. Hutton's friend Playfair, who worked unceasingly to popularize Hutton's views, with more success than Hutton ever had, provides a particularly interesting epilogue to Hutton's life. The book also covers Hutton's influence on Charles Lyell, who articulated so much of geology in his own writings, and went on to himself influence Charles Darwin. It really is all one big pageant, which continues to unfold today."

2,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3357765-jimmy,5,"""James Hutton burst the boundaries of time, thereby establishing geology's most distinctive and transforming contribution to human thought--Deep Time.""--Stephen Jay Gould. The Bible taught us that the world was ""created"" in about a week. By studying the ages of Biblical characters, scholars figured out that the world was about 6,000 years old. To counter that would mean hellfire and being burned to death here on earth. Some scientists still showed courage. Nicolaus Copernicus argued in 1543 that the sun, not the earth, was the center of the universe. Out of fear for his life, he waited till the end of his life to publish his information. It took Galileo, the first celebrity scientist, to publicize the true meaning of what Copernicus had written. He would be placed under house arrest for endorsing the Copernican system in an influential 1632 book. The King James Bible, first published in the 17th century, verified the religious argument by placing specific dates in the margins. Thus all Christians knew God created the earth on October 23, 4004 BC. In 1788, James Hutton would boldly confront this centuries-old wisdom. He knew the earth was much older. Most scholars relied on Noah's flood to explain geological formations. Such ignorance still prevails today. Hutton relied on observation. By so doing, he upset people in two ways: 1. the veracity of the Bible was in question, and 2. It displaced humans from the start of time. Just like Copernicus had taken man away from the divine center of things and Darwin would take man away from the divine altogether. All of these men--Copernicus, Galileo, Hutton, and Darwin--only wanted to seek the truth unconstrained by past biases, even those sanctioned by the clergy. Hutton could not see where the beginning of the earth was, and he did not believe in any upcoming end with a return of some godhead. Hutton would influence Charles Lyell, who would in turn influence Charles Darwin. Giants rely on the shoulders of giants to aid civilization. Hutton devised the first rigorous and unified theory of the earth. His two main discoveries: 1. The earth was consistently restoring itself, and 2. Subterranean heat was profoundly important. Hutton was part of a Golden Age in Edinburgh, Scotland. It included David Hume, Adam Smith, Joseph Black, James Watt. The Hebrew might have been lost if not for Eusebius from Flavius Josephus and Julius Africanus. His version is now known as the Septuagint Bible. 72 Israelites were brought to Alexandria to gather the oral histories. Legend! The truth is that Ptolemy II sponsored a translation in Alexandria. That version had tremendous influence. Exact days were given for lives of the famous people. It would be Johannes Kepler who discovered that Christ was not born in the year 0, but in the year 4 BC. Edinburgh smelled so bad, it was given the disparaging moniker Auld Reekie. Chimney smoke from burning coal helped. Also it was built on a ridge, so it could not have a plumbing system. When the clock struck ten, everyone was free to throw their trash out the window. People lit pieces of paper in taverns to kill the other smells. Sleeping meant covering your head with sheets to hide from the smells. In the mid 1700s, the study of the earth was in its infancy. Genesis covered all you needed to know. The word ""geology"" would not come into use for another generation. However, there were many books that at least broke some ground. Giants always need to stand on the shoulders of others. The great Buffon, for example, was forced by the church to recant or lose his job. Religions have never been leaders in freedom of expression. Hutton realized that erosion is necessary to form soil. Stephen Jay Gould called this ""the paradox of the soil."" Hutton also dropped his bombshell that the earth was unknowably old. Hutton was accused by some as being an atheist and a blasphemer. The importance of John Playfair cannot be underestimated. Hutton wrote his 1795 Theory of the Earth while he was in great pain. So Playfair took on the honorable of clarifying his friend's remarkable scientific discoveries. Then James Hall began experimental geology by also proving Hutton's ideas. His reputation as a careful chemist meant his results were taken seriously. But Hutton's enemies who could not leave their superstitions behind them continued to attack him. Charles Lyell would carry the torch forward. He would use both Hutton and Playfair to write his book on geology. For the next 100 years it was the definitive geology book. And that would influence Charles Darwin. Both Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace both came up with the theory of natural selection. We think of it as Darwin's because he had the idea 15 years earlier. Lyell became Darwin's literary agent. The world was about to change. "
3,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4393974-leah-k,3,"Do you know who James Hutton is? Don’t feel bad if you don’t, he is a name that has unfortunately disappeared over time. So who is he? He originated the theory of uniformitarianism, which explained the Earth’s crust by means of natural process. Hutton's work established geology as a proper science, and thus he is often referred to as the ""Father of Modern Geology"". Hutton wasn’t a great writer though and his communication skills needed some work so it would take almost a century for his work to get any reorganization and for people to start believing that perhaps the Earth far more than 6,000 years old. Ok, so I’m not the biggest geology fan – I took one course in college for a requirement and was perfectly fine after that. But I also know that geology plays a big part in our world so I was interested in this book. I had originally read a book called The Geography of Genius which brought up James Hutton and it’s my nature to research further and want to know more! I wish I had enjoyed this book a bit more. There seems to be a lot of gaps in the history of Hutton, so we get a lot of “we don’t know much about this time of his life….” So how do you fill in a 200+ page book when a lot of information on the main person is unavailable? Write about a lot of other people and the history going on around the time (some I found relevant, others not so much so) and be repetitive…sure, interesting, but not really what I wanted. However, I did learn some interesting things and I appreciated the terms in the back of the book since geology really is not my thing. A short book but not a particularly short read for me. If you are really in geology, you may enjoy this book but then again if you are THAT interested in the subject you probably already know about James Hutton…maybe. "
4,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/599340-chandar,4,Superb book! The fascinating age of discovery and exploration through the Industrial Revolution. Amazing to see how the age of the earth got pushed back from about 6000 years to a few billion!
5,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12022454-francis-riley,5,"I came across this book by accident while spending some time in Edinburgh, (my family on my mother's side originated from Edinburgh and I have spent many a happy hour in the city). Holidays are a great time time to explore and I wanted to know more about the characters that formed part of the Enlightenment, particularly those with the Scottish connection or background. I'd shown little interest in learning anything about history (and certainly not geology) at school so there was no reason to choose this other than mild curiosity. Reading through the book was like moving through a door into corridor with countless future options - spark to a flame - how many cliques are they for that moment when a slight interest becomes fascinated curiosity. I don't know if this is a great book but I'm certain it is a well told story of an amazing character in a remarkable period of time and well worth the effort of reading; highly recommended."

7,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17505654-walter,4," Review of Ages in Chaos: James Hutton and the Discovery of Deep Time by Stephen Baxter, November 2, 2009By Walter H. PierceThis review is from: Ages in Chaos: James Hutton and the Discovery of Deep Time (Paperback)This book gives an accurate assessment of the contributions of James Hutton (1726-1797) to science in general and geology in particular. Baxter gives ""deep time"" emphasis, but he does this, not by allowing the question of time to dominate the book. The organization of the book serves to elucidate the scientific concept of geologic time, a concept which Hutton jump-started, and delineates how the concept of deep time has evolved to modern day.New ground and interesting for me is Baxter's treatment of ""design arguments"" (page 42) stemming all the way back to Aristotle. ""Fred Hoyle - the British astrophysicist who unraveled the production of carbon I stars - said in 1959, 'I do not believe that any scientist who examined the evidence would fail to draw the inference that the laws of nuclear physics have been deliberately designed with regard to the consequence they produce inside the stars.""Stephen Baxter, the author, is an award-winning science fiction writer and was formerly educated as a physicist and engineer. I am a geologist by training and profession, and initially wondered if Baxter could give an adequate perspective to a work on Hutton. Please let me state to my geological friends that Baxter seems to have assimilated geology very well and shares most or all of our sensibilities. I can only guess that writing science fiction must be wonderful training and preparation for understanding and explaining the history of science and geology. As an example of two areas that satisfied my geologic chauvinism, Baxter pays very close attention to the roles of ""field work"" and Hutton's rock collection in the development of his scientific conclusions. This was new Hutton territory for me and I found Baxter's treatment fascinating - great book.One of Baxter's final conclusions concerning Hutton is: ""There have been many great geologists, but no figure before or since bequeathed a package of so many profound and integrated insights as James Hutton. And he was the first to construct a model of Earth's history containing its most essential feature, a vast and deep abyss of time.""To reach this conclusion Baxter takes us through a real History of Science lesson, not just Hutton biography, but the biography and contributions of his precursors, teachers, scientific peers, and successors who were impacted, conflicted by, and who supported and elaborated Hutton's work. Baxter is able to do this in 231 pages, and I think it would have been difficult to do it in fewer.Baxter quotes Stephen Jay Gould: ""......though Hutton was a great thinker, he was not a modern thinker. And he has been hugely misunderstood"" (page 216). Baxter attempts to place the reader in the historic context in which Hutton lived: ""How much harder it was for Hutton in a time when the textbooks had yet to be written!"" There is a splendid review of James Ussher, the Irish bishop, that had established the earth's birthday as 22 October, 4004, BC, on a Saturday, at about six in the evening. Although this was established religious dogma at the time of Hutton's youth "".......it was obvious there was something wrong. You didn't even have to look at the rocks to know that."" (Baxter, page 23). And, going against the Church was dangerous. Some of Hutton's most vociferous critics decried him as an atheist, in print. In addition to the obvious religious conflicts, Hutton's writing was obscure.He assumed that the reader was more knowledgeable. ""In addition nobody had really understood Hutton's careful epistemology and his uniformitarianism, or his arguments about heat - partly because he hadn't sufficiently explained them in a presentation Playfair called too brief."" (Baxter, page 147) ""Hutton was endeavoring to produce a complete and consistent body of physical theory and epistemological methodology to support his assertions about the Earth;...""(Baxter, page 177). By separating his observations from his inferences, Hutton was trying to explain the basis on which he derived his hypotheses, and by opening up his methodology for examination he was setting out his thinking as a basis for a true science of geology in the future - for that methodology itself could be improved (Baxter, page 132).It was almost as if Hutton had two enormous goals: 1) explaining how the earth worked and 2) how to think and reason scientifically about the new unnamed science of geology. It is no wonder that readers had difficulty.Playfair is well know to all geologists as the translator for Hutton. He was a warm friend and sought to make the significance of Hutton's work understood. He also wrote a biographic sketch of Hutton after his death which Baxter suggests is too idealized. Baxter attempts, I think successfully, to sleuth and flesh out the real man, Hutton, quoting some of his letters which are lively and salty.Hutton begins university at age fourteen (1740), and studied math under Colin Maclaurin, who had been recommended by Newton. Hutton developed an interest in chemistry in spite of the University of Edinburgh not having a chemistry curriculum. After three years at University he took a position as an apprentice to a solicitor, but this did not work out. Hutton was still interested in chemistry. He went back to the University to study medicine. He met a fellow medical student named John Clerk who was from a prominent Midlothian land and coal mine owning family. Baxter believes that this began Hutton's interest, at age eighteen, in minerals, coal, and rocks (1744). After three years studying medicine at Edinburgh he left to continue his studies abroad. At age 21 he arrived in Paris (1747). ""Hutton probably attended Professor Francois Rouelle's lectures on mineralogy in Paris. Rouelle pioneered ideas, concerning the order in which rocks had been laid down....."" (Baxter, Page 45). From Paris he went to Leiden to complete his medical training. He wrote a thesis in French entitled, ""On the Circulation of Blood in the Microcosm"".Returning to Edinburgh through London at age 23 he struggled with what to do next (1749). Apparently being a physician was not in the cards. He and a friend James Davie began a business producing sal ammoniac which was used in dyes and in the production of tin and brass. It was being imported from Egypt but he and Davie had worked a method to produce it in Scotland from chimney soot collected in Edinburgh.""But now his life was devastated by scandal."" (Baxter, page 58) There is fragmentary evidence of a women, and a son emerges after Hutton's death. The episode was so embarrassing to Hutton that he felt a need to retreat from Edinburgh to two small farm properties of his father's southeast of Edinburgh along the coast in Berwickshire (1752). ""The Land was wild and uncultivated, just open fields that backed on to sheep country. Stones had to be split and hauled away before Hutton could work the soil at all"" (Baxter, page 64).Here from age 26 to age 39 farming became his chief occupation. Initially he focused on learning what he could from other farmers that were sucessful. He traveled to and apprenticed under excellent farmers in Norfolk, Yarmouth, and Belton. ""He made many journeys - mostly on foot - to different parts of England. He visited Northumberland, Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Cambridgeshire, Oxfordshire, and the Isle of Wight. These trips were made primarily to study agricultural techniques, but by this time Hutton had also begun to study geology and mineralogy in a more serious way"" (Baxter, page 61). ""Hutton would later boast that he could tell you where a piece of gravel had come from anywhere on the eastern side of Britain"" (Baxter, page, 61).""Hutton persevered with his farming, and slowly his situation improved. His Norfolk plough transformed the land. As Adam Ferguson noted, 'The joke [of his Norfolk plough] has become serious, and is now the general practice from one end of Scotland to the other.' The farm, once 'very wild and uncultivated piece of land', had a 'degree of neatness and garden-like culture, which in farming had not been seen before. Persons of every description came from every quarter to gratify their intellectual curiosity, as well as to get information' "" (Baxter, page 72). With pioneering techniques, he had greatly improved the condition of his land, and his agricultural studies had become the focal point of his interlocking interests in chemistry, meteorology, geology and botany. His achievements showed the quality of his character and his mind"" (Baxter, page 80).Hutton's natural focus on soil must have led to this key intuition:....""the world did not suffer only decay: perhaps it also had the capability for repair"" (Baxter, page 76).""This was Hutton's picture, then: rocks decayed through erosion, the rubble was consolidated into new rocks, and then somehow uplifted to make new lands - erosion, deposition, consolidation, uplift. And cupped in the heart of this immense rocky machine, the priceless soil that sustained life was subtly created"" (Baxter, page 78). Arguing with the support of final causes and design arguments Hutton reached this hypothesis. "".....starting from first principles - that the final cause for the Earth is to sustain life - Hutton deduced that it must have some mechanism of repair from erosion, just as Harvey had once deduced the existence of capillaries in the body, then undetected, to complete his model of blood's circulation. The task now was to find that mechanism....."" Baxter continues on page 77 quoting Hutton: ' This is the view in which we are now to examine the globe, to see if there be, in the constitution of this world a reproductive operation, by which a ruined constitution may be again repaired, and a duration or stability thus procured to the machine, considered as a world sustaining plants and animals.'At the age of 41 in 1767 Hutton determined to return to Edinburgh. He build a new home facing the spectacular geology of Salisbury Crags and Arthur's seat for himself and his three sisters. Previously....""He had been elected to a committee which was to supervise the construction of the Forth and Clyde canal"" (Baxter, page 79). ""It was against the background of the elegant new city, and in the heads of a literate, independent-minded and newly prosperous populace, that the Scottish Enlightenment would bloom, causing Voltaire to say, 'It is to Scotland that we must look for our idea of civilization' (Baxter, page 86).It was a relief for Hutton to move into his new house on St. John's Hill, his collection was taking up to much space.......Hutton would examine his specimens chemically and under the microscope, and then varnish them to keep them looking bright. He would prune his hoard to focus on the most intellectually valuable samples"" (Baxter, page 97).This era was know as the Scottish Enlightenment. Many of the most famous men were personal acquaintances or good friends of James Hutton. The David Hume family farm was near Hutton's farm. Joseph Black, Adam Smith, and James Watt were personal friends. Hutton visited with Erasmus Darwin, grandfather to Charles Darwin. And Hutton attracted and mentored younger talents such as Sir James Hall and John Playfair. These men met and shared their scientific theories at the Philosophical Society and at gentleman's clubs such the Poker Club. Large volumes of Claret were also imbibed.As previously mentioned Hutton began a tradition of field work and travel with his agricultural studies. He went back to the low countries in 1754. In 1764 he traveled to the Scottish highlands with George Clerk-Maxwell where Hutton compiled notes, observations, and reflections on the geology. In 1774 made a long trip to Birmingham, Wales, Anglesey, Wiltshire, Bath, Warwickshire, and Derbyshire. ""....as early as 1764 his forays into the field had become directed and specific, as he sought evidence to support his arguments"" (Baxter, page 116). ""In Wales he mostly had to ride on horseback, and his backside took a good deal of punishment: during this forty-day tour his riding breeches would wear out four times"" (Baxter, page 111). In 1779 he went to Shropshire to climb Wrekin. In 1785 he went to Glen Tilt. In 1787 he went to Arran to search for his concept of an unconformity with, marginal results. Later in 1787 he discovered his first clear unconformity at Jedburgh, by serendipity in the ""borders region"" of Scotland. And finally by a directed effort from the sea to the coast he discovered at Siccar Point, a clear cut example of an unconformity. On that day he was accompanied in the field by John Playfair and Sir John Hall. What better way to make permanent disciples. Baxter quotes from Playfair: ""The mind seemed to grow giddy by looking so far into the abyss of time; and while we listened with earnestness and admiration to the philosopher who was now unfolding to us the order and series of those wonderful events, we became sensible how much farther reason may sometimes go than imagination can venture to follow.""Baxter does a masterful job of piecing together the rest of the story, and at the same time putting it into historical context. This includes the oral presentation in 1785 and print version in 1788 and book version of Hutton's Theory of the Earth in 1795 and the blistering attacks which followed. ""Hutton knew he had to defend himself. Even more so then in 1785, Britain in 1793 was not a good place to be called a heretic"" (Baxter, page 174).""By now most European geologists were divided into two camps, neither of which had been influenced much by Hutton's theories. The 'Vulcanists', including Desmarest and Faujas, were fire geologists, who believed that volcanoes must have had significant effects on the evolution of the Earth. The other school was the Neptunists, who thought volcanoes were irrelevant special effects. To them water was the key agent . All Neptunists hypothesized some kind of universal ocean, out of which the rocks had been deposited. But there was still a whole spectrum of theologically inclined thinkers, ranging from those who still held to the most literal interpretation of the Bible account, to others who interpreted its teaching in a more symbolic or allegorical way"" (Baxter, page 165-166).On a Saturday in March 1797 James Hutton died. ""Essential or not, Hutton's huge work was almost universally ignored by learned society, then and since. Even his closest friend, Black, wouldn't buy a word of it"" (Baxter, page 168). These words by Playfair serve as a memorial: ""With [Hutton's] relish for what ever is beautiful and sublime in science, we may easily conceive what pleasure he derived from his own geological speculations. The novelty and grandeur of the objects offered by them to the imagination, the simple and uniform order given to the whole natural history of the Earth, and, above all, the views opened of the wisdom that governs nature, are things to which hardly any man could be insensible, but to him they were matter, not of transient delight, but of solid and permanent happiness....No author was ever more disposed to consider the enjoyment of them, as the full and adequate reward of his labours"" (Baxter, page 185).Baxter continues with the history of the conflicts among the Vulcanists, Neptunists, Catatastrophists, and Uniformitarianists and the development of the concept of geologic time. By and large Hutton's team wins but the men he mentored, John Playfair, and Sir James Hall led the way by clarifying communication, updating, and finishing the science. ""In 1824, aged sixty-three Hall accompanied yet another keen young geologist on a repeat of Hutton's classic expedition to Siccar Point. The youngster was much impressed - and, a quarter of a century after Hutton's death, it was to him that the responsibility for the next stage of the argument would devolve. ....... His name was Charles Lyell"" (Baxter, page 203).Baxter abstracts the rest of the story, carrying on with Lyell, Darwin, Kelvin, Rutherford, and Holmes to near present day. This neat and concise volume gives us an excellent introduction to James Hutton and how he almost single-handedly turned the study of the earth into a science called geology; and gave us a way of fruitfully thinking about and making sense of the Earth."
8,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/31467977-tom-quinn,2,"I was put off by the prologue, which leaps out of the gate with a sneeringly nasty sense of superiority over Biblical Creationism. I very nearly put the book down because while I was curious about this important scientific discovery, the tone was so smug and derisive. So I paged quickly through to the first chapter, which to my relief, softened considerably into a peppy sort of adventure tale. Thankfully the further along I got the author's scholarship grew progressively more reasonable and less holier-than-thou. Repcheck sets the stage well for exactly why James Hutton's theory of geologic time was so important and so controversial, running through a quick history of European culture from Constantine through the fall of Rome. He moves quick, and readers who are already into Roman history may be testy at how simplistic his history is in this section. But it's understandable, I think, and easily forgiven because of how vivid (downright poetic) his descriptions of rock formations and geology are as compensation.2.5 stars out of 5. I enjoy learning about the background of scientific discoveries that I easily take for granted today, in a culture that's already accepted and disseminated them. It's very cool to learn just how much trouble these ideas caused when they clashed with the status quo of their time. I am less interested in the traditional biography style (Hutton's childhood home of Edinburgh, Hutton's time in school, the influence of Bonnie Prince Charlie and his Scottish Rebellion, and on and on). For those who do enjoy a biography, the narrative is light and having a cast of characters with some plot helps the text keep from being too dry."
9,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63558882-matt,3,"This book is well written and always interesting, but frequently ventures off topic. I suppose this is due to the fact that little information exists with regards to certain timespans in Hutton’s life and work. The man lived in the 18th century and didn’t keep a diary so the only solid information about him and his groundbreaking theory (pun intended) come from his publications, correspondences, and secondhand writings by people who knew him. The author seems to cope with these sparse areas of Hutton’s life by filling them with things like Bonnie Prince Charlie’s failed rebellion or Edinburgh’s urban planning. Instead, I think this biography could’ve focused more on humanity’s understanding of the earth and its origins before Hutton and after him. The beginning of the book discusses what Europeans believed for centuries based on biblical scriptures, but no mention is made about the beliefs of everyone living outside of Christianity, Judaism, or Europe itself. There is also no mention of beliefs from antiquity. The book is not overly long and it gives good insight into the workings of the scientific community in Scotland during the 18th and 19th centuries. It also helps readers understand the slow and arduous process of overturning long held societal beliefs (especially ones that were espoused by the christianity). "
10,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2088281-joe,4,"Interesting story of James Hutton. But the book is really about a lot of other characters who were responsible for the geology of determining the age of the earth. Scotland, England, France, and other locations and characters made this an interesting read. The subject matter may be a little dry to most readers, but it is fascinating to understand how scholars of that time determined what we know today.There are three men whose contributions helped free science from the straitjacket of theology. Two of the three-Nicolaus Copernicus and Charles Darwin-are widely known and heralded for their breakthroughs. The third, James Hutton, never received the same recognition, yet he profoundly changed our understanding of the earth and its dynamic forces. Hutton proved that the earth was likely millions of years old rather than the biblically determined six thousand, and that it was continuously being shaped and re-shaped by myriad everyday forces rather than one cataclysmic event."
11,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5881839-ben,5,"Awesome! The book informs the reader of one of the most exciting periods of human history with perhaps one of man kinds most powerful thinkers. James Hutton is if you can't already tell one of my favorite figures in history. Often in life you have many thinkers all considering the very same theories and notions and so new laws and axioms, conventions are simultaneously co-invented or established. Rarely do you have those historical figures that advance are understanding by centuries or depending on the moment perhaps light years. In my opinion Galileo, Newton, Hutton, Darwin, and Einstein of the scientist are a few. There are of course figures not just in the science as well who deserve the same recognition, but I digress. "
12,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/96058923-casey,4,"Very informative and an easy read. Kept my attention throughout. The book covered the life of James Hutton and his geological investigations, and also introduced many of his contemporary scientists. Charles Darwin (who came later) was very influenced by Hutton and his idea of an old earth. One of Hutton's supporters was Charles Lyell who wrote ""Principles of Geology"" which Darwin brought with him on his Beagle voyage.Reading this book, it struck me (again) how scientists do not work in isolation, but stand on the shoulders of previous explorers and their discoveries.I also got to know Edinburgh with the help of Google Maps."
13,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/84826805-aiman-adlawan,4,"This book gave so many interesting description of how James Hutton (One of the Fathers of Geology) laid out the basic notions of geological studies that opened to the our understanding of how old our planet is. Before his time, every scholars and educated men believed that the bible has told all the facts about how the origins of everything started, and that was from God's creation in the book of Genesis.But Hutton laid a practical explanation about the geological formations of earth by digging rocks and fossils and analysing its sediment formations and its mineral deposits. At his time, geology was not a well studied field of science. Great book to read. "
14,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1920955-kevin-kasowski,4,"Before Darwin capsized the boat of Creationism, Hutton fired a warning shot across the bow. This is an enjoyable read about someone who helped advance our understanding of our planet, in the context of those who came before, and after, him. It also tells a bit about the broader but less known (at least to me) “Scottish Enlightenment” and Hutton’s contemporary “free-thinkers” like Hume, Adam Smith and James Maxwell."
15,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/83941524-chad-kwiatkowski,5,"Excellent review of the life of one of the most important scientists of the 18th century, who is now only known by geologists. Let's change that! Without James Hutton, Charles Darwin could not have perceived deep time. James Hutton, using solid observation and reasoning, figured out the basics of how the earth works, overlooked by all who had come before, their minds warped by biblical indoctrination. Well-worth the read!"
16,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/56774077-mark-davidson,4,"A short very readable biography of an important but relatively little known member of the Scottish Enlightenment and father of modern geology. I was introduced to Hutton by Stephen J. Gould having read his excellent “Time’s Arrow, Time’s Cycle” many years ago. While the biographical details of Hutton are sometimes rather sketchy (as the author himself acknowledges) the book does an excellent job of places his life and works in the appropriate context. "

However, if you're looking for lots of insight on the geology related to this topic, you won't find it. The book was more about the social implications of the theory, how his life and history led up the the theory, and the historical ripples that occurred as a result of Hutton's theory."

25,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/50329544-roland,4,"Fascinating read. James Hutton should be a household name for his understanding of the earth and influence on scientists, like Charles Darwin, who followed him."
26,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15072306-dennis-mitton,4,"The evolution/creation debate isn’t the first time in history that science and religion have drawn a line in the sand. In the late seventeen hundreds, in the middle of the Scottish Enlightenment, James Hutton began to actually look at the geology of the countryside and ask himself if the prevailing Biblical explanation of a young earth and global flood provided answers that matched his observations. It did not. Over several decades he developed an argument for an old earth and was the first to scientifically broach the idea of uniformitarianism arguing that geologic processes we see today have been occurring in the same way and at the same rate since the earth began. Hutton studied medicine and chemistry in both England and Paris. He was a good student but was equally as happy roaming his native Scotland observing rock outcroppings. Prevailing ideas argued that the earth was recently formed and that evidence of tumultuous events were explained by a Noahic global flood or global ocean from creation. The idea was so firmly engrained that few people asked questions. Hutton, based on observations throughout Britain and Europe, was increasingly unconvinced. How could a flood invert rock layers? How could sediment rise? There were mineral lines found horizontally in rocks throughout Europe that were explained by the global ocean (from when God formed the earth): why weren’t these all at the same height? Even in the same outcroppings? Hutton – at odds with every other naturalist - came to explain the nascent science of geology as a continual cycle of the heat from the earth pushing stone up and that stone eroding. The silt from erosion flows downhill until it forms sediment and then rock under pressure. That sedimentary rock – shales, sandstones, schists – is then manipulated by earth’s heat and pressures and the cycle starts over again. His idea would be a hard sell and he used a poor choice of words when he delivered his first explanation to the Royal Society of Edinburgh. When describing his idea of continuous cycles he stated that the earth showed “no prestige of a beginning and no prospect of an end”. This was interpreted by a less than accepting audience as belief in a very unchristian eternal earth. The dogs set against him. Driven by theology his idea was rejected and Huttonism tossed in the waste bin. But any science based on fiat and theology will always finally succumb to observation and experiment. A decade later his ideas would be picked up by an Englishman named Charles Lyell who would successfully argue for an old earth characterized by slow, gradual, and uniform processes. His ideas, termed uniformitarianism, are foundational for modern science, and gave food for thought to a young Charles Darwin as he roamed South America and naturalist aboard the HMS Beagle.That this slim volume is a biography of Hutton is a bit misleading. It is much more. Repcheck begins with a brief history of Edinburgh and of the Scottish Enlightenment. After parsing Hutton’s life, influences, and ideas, he concludes with chapters on The Huttonnian Revolution and how these ideas transformed our understanding of the world and universe. The book is well written, clear, and follows easily from topic to topic. It lags in places, as do all biographies, with necessary background information. James Hutton has never quite achieved the importance he deserves. Repcheck’s book does an excellent job at moving him in the right direction. A must read for anyone interested in the history of science or of geology. "
27,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,4,"This book was really interesting. It covered a person I had heard of before, but not directly. As this book states, James Hutton postulated that the Earth was actually older than the Bible would have us believe. Some other people came up with theories for that too, but they didn't have satisfactory evidence to back up their claims. So Dr. Hutton goes out and finds proof of all of his theories, but there are detractors of course. Most people were wedded to the idea of the Biblical creation for many years after Hutton died, but then Charles Lyell comes along and rediscovers Hutton's theory.I thought the book was well written. It established the culture of the times, how Newton had been a believer in the Biblical Creation and the history of trying to count years from the bible. That in itself was really fascinating. I knew they could count off years that were given, but I didn't know the precise way it was done. It turns out that they tried to predict the Second Coming, and flubbed the numbers to make sure it happened after they were dead. So then finally someone came up with the precise date of Creation as being October 23, 4004 BC at Noon. This undoubtedly held back progress for years, but whatever.Back to the book itself though. It covers the years that Hutton had lived and touches upon some of the years of the Scottish Enlightenment. It talks about the luminaries of those times and lists Hutton as someone deserving of as much praise as Galileo, Newton, and Copernicus. This is something that I can agree with in the sense that Hutton turned a preconceived notion on it's head, and demanded hard facts."
28,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1795797-michael-haydel,3,"I picked up The Man Who Found Time at a HPB for cheap because it looked like the sort of book I tend to enjoy reading: nonfiction, on a somewhat obscure, quirky, or otherwise odd subject, and the veritable Title: Subtitle format.In the end, the book provided me with a much more in depth account of the beginnings of geology and the man who is widely considered to be its father than I would have expected for such a small and relatively short book. It did tend to lean more towards geology itself, more so than on Hutton, than I would have liked, but it still held my attention, even if at times it was a tad over my head.All things being equal, this book may not scratch everyone's itch, but in a time when there are still ongoing, heated debates about evolution vs. creationism, The Man Who Found Time presents an equally fervent debate from the 18th century about the age of the earth, a topic which is still polarizing today.A note about how long it took me to finish this: I started the book and read it quite regularly for a week, but soon, the holidays hit, and I got more and more into boardgames, not to mention skipping lunch a few more times than I would have liked (lunchtime at work is my prime reading time), so it simply took me a lot longer to finish this than it should.Hopefully that's not the case for the next book."
29,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/48903715-tom,3,"I found this book a bit of a disappointment. Not that it wasn't interesting, mind you. I learned quite a bit about the history of the City of Edinburgh. I learned more than I already knew (which wasn't very much) about Scotland's Jacobite rebellion in 1745-46. And I got a good feel for the ""Scottish Enlightenment"" era and the luminaries who made it one of the greatest periods of progressive thinking in history. All great stuff, but what I did not learn much about was how James Hutton (subject of the book) developed his concept of geologic time, what techniques he used to validate his speculations, or how he progressed from simple musings to scientific theory. That was what I expected and, I think, not unreasonably so given the book's title. To be fair, however, that interpretation of the title was my own and said title does not exclude the possibility that this work is a simple biography - which it is. I personally think it would have been much better with more emphasis on the geological science and less on Hutton's medical studies, friendships, and romantic dalliances. But that's not what it is. So if you are looking for some scientific/geologic history, there are better sources out there."
30,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18293816-bill-leach,4,"James Hutton is known as the ""Father of Modern Geology"". He is credited with the idea of Uniformitarianism which recognized that the geological processes affecting the earth today are no different than those of the past. He also recognized the role of subterranean heat in geologic processes, whereas previous theories all keyed on water as the agent.Geological theory before Hutton was largely based upon religion, holding that the earth's structure had precipitated out of the deluge and the earth's age was 4000 years. Hutton's work initiated a shift away from religious thinking to science.Very interesting book that goes beyond geology, with some detail on Scotland, its people and the culture. Of particular interest is the cast of thinkers that centered in Scotland at that time. The author brings out many of these personalities whose joint work became known as the Scottish Enlightenment.The book concludes with Hutton's successors, showing how Hutton influenced Lyell who in turn influenced Darwin."
31,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4025305-tom,4,"This is a wonderful book about a little-known geologist who was the first to pronounce that the earth is immensely old. His name was James Hutton and he had his heyday during the Scottish Enlightenment. He died in 1797. The book is very well focused and therefore rather brief (216 smallish pages). It gives a terrific sense of how knowledge is enlarged and how science progresses. Hutton's insight into the age of the earth was important because it broke the religious yoke that held that the earth was 6,000 years old, a belief held by many intelligent folks for a very long time. Its impact was great. For example, it showed Darwin that there was enough time stretching behind us for Natural Selection to work. The author is very good at keeping his eye on the essential. He sets out to raise general awareness of Hutton's contribution to science and attempts to put him on a very high pedestal as one of the people who freed us from the strictures of close-minded religion. In this he succeeds."
32,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/28447822-kennyo,4,"Although it’s been on my to-read shelf for a lo-o-ong time, I’d held off reading this for reasons unknown. I’m happy to have read it now. In other reading and conversations Hutton’s name kept cropping up so it was inevitable, I think, that finally I’d take this book from my shelf and read it. Jack Repcheck has written a book that I’ll be recommending to people, and not just to geology aficionados. It’s very well done and he goes to lengths to frame Hutton’s world, giving perspective to his work and to his working environment. I feel that devotion of an entire chapter to the Jacobite rising is a bit far afield from the main of the story but it is certainly significant to Hutton’s time and place and, besides, I enjoyed immensely that chapter. I’d have liked more detail on Hutton’s study out in the field, though I suspect that would quickly leave the general reader behind. Wanting more is what I feel now and, to my mind, that’s a sign of the author’s success."
33,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4414163-drew,5,"This book is about James Hutton, who is known as the Father of Geology. It goes through his life, how he came to his monumental theories, and how they eventually came to be accepted. Little is actually known about the life of Hutton, and I felt the author did a good job not dwelling on theories of what he *might* have been up to, but instead filling in the gaps with historical tidbits that gave the book a global feel. Topics touched on in the book ranged from famous people (such as Darwin, Hume, Lyell, Playfair, and more), to important scientific discoverys (such as the discovery of carbon dioxide and radiation), and to important stories from history (my favorite being the story of Bonnie Prince Charlie). Overall I found the book to be quite riveting and highly educational."
34,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13417829-john-mccullough,5,"This is a small, compact account of how James Hutton demonstrated that 6000 years was inadequate to account for the formation of rocks he knew around Scotland and northern England. Hutton was a man of many occupations, farmer being one of them. He know all about erosion - what it was and how it worked. He applied this knowledge to his interpretation of Scottish geology. How man hears to form the rock strata? How many years to shift this rock upright? More than 6000. And so the estimate by Bishop Ussher died a death by evidence and logic. Nicely written, can be read in the time it takes to wait for a doctor - well, almost. I enjoyed the read and used the materials in one of my lectures."
35,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30982871-james-f,3,"A very simply written -- I'm almost tempted to classify it as Young Adult -- biography of James Hutton, the founder of ""uniformitarianism"" in geology. There is no original scholarship here; the science and history are both oversimplified and not altogether accurate. Hutton is the hero, treated totally uncritically, and the story is basically just Scientist vs. Christians. Nevertheless, Hutton is an interesting figure and I enjoyed reading about the little that is known of his life, as well as some details on his relations with other figures of the Scottish Enlightenment. I might have been more critical if I had spent a lot of time on this, but for a few hours read it was worth the time spent."
36,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/49782808-kavan,3,"Whenever the great names in science are listed the Einstein, Lydell, Darwin, Mendle, Watson and others the name of James Hutton is rarely mentioned. Author Jack Repcheck wanted to alter that, to see as it were, that Hutton gets his due. Thus he titled his book The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton And The Discovery Of Earth's Antiquity. Herein lies the problem, I selected this book expecting to learn more about James Hutton. However, as other reviewers have noted this is not a book about James Hutton so much as it was a book about the times Hutton lived in and the people he knew. I came away from the book learning a great deal about Bonnie Prince Charles, Scotland, & the Scottish Enlightenment but knowing very little about James Hutton. "
37,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11610603-sarah,4,"Some complain of digressiveness in this book, which didn't deter me; I like to get extra context. In this case there isn't a lot of personal detail to be had about the man, so too bad for those wanting that sort of biography. I just wanted more after hearing about him in an introductory physical geology class. Here was lots. What his city was like, how unlike his personality his stuffy published work was.... I did get bogged down in the biblical cosmology stuff: interesting that people worked so hard to fit the chronologies together (horrifying actually) but I didn't need to know as much about as many as presented (being what Hutton was working against). Suffice it to say, take what you need and leave the rest. Skim when you must to get on with the work as a whole. "
38,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13615581-jp,3,"Repcheck places Hutton with Copernicus, Galileo, and Darwin for breaking science out of an erroneous, theology-driven paradigm. Hutton was among the first geologists to approach the field as a science through theory and observation. He was also the first to posit the theory that the earth continually cycled through erosion and volcanic pressure, which also implied ancient, immeasurable age. He died with the theory widely discredited, but it later triumphed due to the influence of his friends Black and Playfair, combined with later support by Lyell and ultimately through credit to it given by Darwin."
39,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/653318-stacy-peltier,2,"Some good back facts on the Scottish Enlightenment, but overall this book was just EH. The author's writing style was particularly lacking, and he kept repeating himself. It also seemed like there hasn't been enough preserved information about Hutton's life to make an accurate biography, so the book was filled with hypotheses and generalities. I gave it the extra star solely because the first couple chapters (albeit having nothing to do with James Hutton or geology) were pretty cool - a really quick history on the transcription of religious texts and the development of chronology."
40,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/976229-joshua,5,"What a pleasant surprise; I picked it up as a quick read while waiting for a requested book to be returned to the library. It is not so much the story (it is far too general to be a biography) of James Hutton, the father of modern geology who established the antiquity of the earth in the late eighteenth century, as an overview of the Scottish Enlightenment and of the many men of insight and imagination who inhabited Edinburgh and environs at that time. Repcheck's prose never bogs down as so many histories do but skips along informatively. A very nice read, indeed. "
41,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5767309-mex,4,"Although I got this book for my wife, I decided to give it a go myself as it looked quite interesting. I was not wrong, the book gives a fascinating insight into a fascinating man. Although it concentrates on Hutton himself other visionaries don't get left out. The only negative I could say about the book is the author tends to repeat himself quite often, but this is not a major problem. I would heartily recommend this book to any who has even passing interest in either geology, or the Scottish enlightenment."
42,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/299912-rachel-rogers,4,"Excellent book describing the life of James Hutton who was among the first to prove the Earth was older than the Bible says. Hutton's findings were apparently important to Darwin when writing Origin of the Species, all because he found fossils of seashells and other small sea creatures high on a mountain side and couldn't justify the runoff and sedimentary erosion over 6000 years.Well-written, entertaining, full of interesting tidbits about the world."
43,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1448404-emma,4,"I'm a fan of readable history, especially people-related history. And, having never heard of James Hutton, but being assured by the back cover of the book that he ranked alongside Darwin, Galileo and Copper-knickers, I was intrigued.It's a fast easy read and an interesting biography of the man who discovered that the world was a good deal more than 6,000 years old. Fortunately for him, he did this in an era when heretics were no longer burned at the stake."
44,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54451-anna,4,"An enjoyable read that will lead you through a brief history of the science of detecting Earth's age and Darwin's theory of evolution. The main focus of the book is the geologist, James Hutton, who was the first to state that the earth was older than 6,000 year. A belief wrapped up in biblical thinking of the time. The book is easy to read and shows the eureka moments that lead to the theories we understand today. "
45,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5894485-a-l,5,"This was an absolutely excellent book. I know people have taken issue with the fact that there isn't so much about Hutton in it, but it sounds as if details of his life are scanty and this book does an excellent job of bringing those details together in the context of the history of science, the area where he lived and made his discoveries, the climate of his education, and the influence of his work on future generations. The book was very well written and accessible. Fascinating throughout."
46,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1113365-clay,4,"Recomended to me by a friend, this short biography about the father of modern geology was engaging, inspiring and offers a very wide view into the life and times of not only Hutton but also his contemporaries.

47,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15352968-leslie-roy,4,"An interesting (and short) read about an obscure geologist who precipitated the concept of an ancient Earth. Before James Hutton, the age of the Earth was dated through the Bible. I enjoyed the aspects of Scottish history and the relationship among the scientists. The book would have benefited by pictures especially of the geographical reference points that were key to Hutton's theory."
48,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/378568-ken,2,"The book is well-researched and well-written, and definitely opened my eyes to a whole age of inquiry and discovery about which I was not much aware. However, ultimately I found the subject of geology to be, well, just not very captivating.I can only assume that if you find geology a more engaging subject, you should add at least a few points to my review."
49,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3620841-brian,4,"The object of this book is to make people think of James Hutton (who most folks haven't heard of) whenever they think of Isaac Newton or Charles Darwin. As an added bonus, the book connects the three. Neat."
50,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5090725-pete,4,"I didn't need any convincing about the scientific premises of Hutton, but it was interesting to read how Hutton arrived at his conclusions that the Earth is ""unfathomably old"" and how other, better-known scientists were influenced by his work."
51,073820692X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2924431-pam-porter,4,Excellent perspective on James Hutton's contribution to the fields of Geology and Evolution.
