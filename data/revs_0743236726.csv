Solomon, who won The National Book Award for The Noonday Demon: An Atlas of Depression, spent ten years interviewing families that are extraordinary in every sense of the word, but most particularly in that the parents, by having borne children who are incredibly different from themselves, have become better people in ways they could never have imagined. These children are deaf, dwarfs, have Down Syndrome, autism, schizophrenia, and other severe disabilities; they are prodigies, criminals, conceived in rape, or transgender. Spanning 700 monumental pages (the remaining 250 are notes and index) the stories in Far from the Tree,which are interspersed with deep research and bookended by Solomon's own story as a gay son and father, create an astounding narrative scope, at the heart of which is the argument that we need to accept these people as having full and rich identities, as opposed to simply illnesses or conditions. Solomon writes, “Having always imagined myself in a fairly slim minority, I suddenly saw that I was in a vast company. Difference is what unites us. While each of these experiences [of the disabled] can isolate those who are affected, together they compose an aggregate of millions whose struggles connect them profoundly. The exceptional is ubiquitous; to be entirely typical is the rare and lonely state.”There’s so much in Far from the Tree that to capture its breadth in a review this short is impossible. Let’s just say it’s about nothing less than what it means to be human. To read even a page of its laser-sharp prose is to experience a worldview that’s revolutionary in its humanity and empathy. Don’t be daunted by the length; reading experiences this good are worth drawing out and savoring as much as possible."

Though my parents sought medical attention for me, eventually they embraced my paternal grandmother's Christian Science faith. I have through the years been considered crippled, handicapped, disabled, differently abled and physically challenged. I am who I am both because of and in spite of my parents. Andrew Solomon's book is wonderful because he is so open to any possibility. He enters so fully into the lives of the people whom he interviews that he helps you understand what their lives are like. All of these families have difficulties but the ones who seem to do best are those who accept (and in some cases) embrace the difference and who say to their children ""I love you as you are"" and thereby allow their children to accept themselves.(That, alas, sounds like a Hallmark greeting card and Mr. Solomon's book never gets mawkish and his explanations of the difficulties these families face are never facile). I also loved Mr. Solomon's inclusion of all sorts of differences. He talks about transgendered people, criminals (his interview with Dylan Klebold's mother is very moving) and geniuses. I know a bit more about Joshua Bell's relationship with his mother than I might like, but the chapter was very entertaining. Mr. Solomon himself is part of this tapestry. He discusses his mother's wish to correct his homosexuality much as she fixed his dyslexia and the teasing he underwent because of he was more interested in opera plots than football plays. As an adult he has married and talks about the feelings he had as he contemplated the possibility of having to raise a disabled child (the child is not disabled and Mr Solomon confesses his relief) Many the families to whom Mr. Solomon speaks are well off (if they can't find a suitable place for their children to be treated they start one) and I sometimes fear he may be preaching to the choir. Nonetheless, this is a marvelous book and it's wonderfully written. It deserves the widest possible audience."

Most deaf children are born to hearing parents, and those parents often prioritize teaching them to function in the hearing world, spending years on lipreading and spoken language, precious years that could have been spent learning history, maths or philosophy. Many of those children stumble upon Deaf identity in adolescence, setting out onto a liberating ocean of Sign as language, leaving their parents behind on the shore. Then a friend of Solomon's had a daughter who was a dwarf, and she spent much energy on the vexed question of how she should bring her daughter up: should she consider herself the same as everyone else, only shorter; should she have dwarf role models, or should she investigate surgical limb-lengthening?Solomon saw in these patterns arresting parallels with his own life: he is both dyslexic and gay. The first condition was one that his mother fixed, through hard work, practice, training, but always with a sense of this being a kind of private game between the two of them, a puzzle that needed to be solved. At six, he was turned down by eleven schools in New York City on the grounds that he would never learn to read or write. A year later he showed advanced reading skills - a triumph over a neurological abnormality which, unfortunately ""set the stage for our later struggles by making it hard to believe that we couldn't reverse the creeping evidence of another perceived abnormality-my being gay.""After ten years of thorough research and interviews with over three hundred families Solomon produced this monumental and deservedly lauded book, which sets out the conundrum within those families who have children in some way alien to the parents: in how far do you see a condition that your child is born with, or develops later, one that makes her atypical, as an illness that needs to be fixed, and how far do you see it as an identity that needs to be accepted? If you try to fix it are you rejecting the person your child is? And if you don't, are you condemning that child to a much tougher existence than might be necessary, maybe one involving pain, mental, or physical, or both? Surely as a parent, your first instinct is to protect? A child may interpret even well-intentioned efforts to fix him as sinister. Jim Sinclair, an intersex autistic person, wrote, ""When parents say, 'I wish my child did not have autism,' what they're really saying is, 'I wish the autistic child I have did not exist, and I had a different (non-autistic) child instead.' Read that again. This is what we hear when you mourn over our existence. This is what we hear when you pray for a cure. This is what we know, when you tell us of your fondest hopes and dreams for us: that your greatest wish is that one day we will cease to be, and strangers that you can love will move in behind our faces.""Solomon is a gifted narrator: he has a felicitous knack of swift and memorable characterisation, he braids together the individual human and scientific insights, he is able to retain the equivalence and the moral quandaries without losing focus, he has the lightest of touches, sprightly without ever stepping over the boundary into over-intimate flippancy. He must be a congenial interviewer too, never judgemental I'm sure, otherwise people would not lay open their lives to him as they do. I rarely weep at films or books, but this one brought a lump to my throat and a tear to my eye on more than one of the 700 pages. The most challenging chapter was the one on autism, because it is such a complex phenomenon, and so little understood despite its increasing incidence and recognition. I found the chapter on the children born of rape very hard to get through at all, had to space it out in small doses. But the most affecting was the close relationship that Solomon managed to build with the parents of Dylan Klebold, one of the two Columbine perpetrators. As might be imagined, they were ostracised by the community where they live, thus having to deal with the loss of their son as well as the shock of his crime and how they had misapprehended him, along with the opprobrium of their friends and the curiosity of strangers. When Sue got breast cancer, that, for her, was 'comic relief'. Resilience through sardonic humour.Human beings are amazingly resilient. With the caveat that those willing to be interviewed are more likely to be those who are not bitter, what nevertheless roars out of these pages is a lionhearted vindication of the power of love. It has to be said that love and acceptance are not the same thing; love will often be there, unasked, unquestioned, unassuming and unconscious. Acceptance takes time. Sometimes a very long time. Those who manage best to negotiate the stormy waters are those who can find positives in their ordeal. Religious faith can be helpful, but it isn't a sine qua non. There was at least one mother who said that if another person says to her something along the lines of ""God gives his toughest battles to his strongest soldiers"", she'll scream. Divine beings do not need to be invoked: humans are quite capable of recognizing for themselves that problems and troubles can act as a crucible, tempering their love into something harder and stronger. The most important thing, often, is a belief in something bigger than one's own experience. The most common form of coherence is religion, but it has many other mechanisms. You can believe in God, in the human capacity for good, in justice or simply in love.I found so much that resonated in this work, and not just because I am the mother of a dyslexic gay myself. Fortunately, for me and for her, the dyslexia was not severe. Hardly a defect at all. "

There were some lovely sentences, some very nice connections established between ideas....but there was a lot of clunk, too.One of the disappointments for me is that the book doesn't so much document how ""ordinary"" families have dealt with unexpected horizontal identities in their children as it documents how extraordinary and wealthy families have done so--except in the chapters about rape and crime....there, it seems the poor could be included, while the non-poor must be excluded. Except for Dylan Klebold.The book reads as if Solomon recruited families by placing an ad in the back of The Atlantic. The poor and working-class families I work with face the same challenges as the parents of autistic, intellectually disabled, deaf, etc., children Solomon writes about, but with none of the access to information, services or respite afforded by wealth. I hesitate to suggest anything that would have made the book even longer, but I don't feel like he's given a realistic description of family responses to unexpected horizontal identities when he's leaving out the vast majority of families and most of those without the buffers that can help parents tolerate very difficult caretaking situations.As for his focus on poor families in the chapter on crime, sigh. Low hanging fruit. What about all the criminal kids from higher income families? They are all around. If he didn't look for those kids, ergh. If he looked and their parents wouldn't talk, then (again, not to make the book longer, but come on!) say so, and say something about what that means."
4,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6257531-caroline,5,"This highly lauded and hefty book is about the experience of having a child outside the norm. The author explores homosexuality (his own), and the lives of a variety of children who are dwarfs, severely disabled, schizophrenic, deaf, transgendered, criminal and those with Down's Syndrome. The author is a psychiatrist. I found him to be a man of exceptional kindness and wisdom, who writes with much thoughtfulness about the families he interviewed, and the illness, disabilities or identities he has researched. The book took him ten years to research, and I think this is reflected in the depth of his insights.There is a huge amount of information in this book, and rather than cover titbits from various sections I am going to just refer to two chapters. Firstly the chapter about children resulting from an episode of rape. This was an area I knew little about, and it was a devastating eye-opener. I had underestimated how cruel and savage most rapes are, especially when part of the gross abuses of war. I was also very upset to learn about the common outcome for children who have resulted from war rape, and the deep ambivalence and sometimes hatred felt by these mothers for their children. Unbelievably, due to US policies they were not able to access help with abortions via US aid, which under the circumstances would seem the only humane option for many of these women. (view spoiler)[
  ""Whilst the UN Human Rights Council has indicated that denying a woman an abortion after rape may constitute cruel and inhuman treatment...the United States continues to enforce the 1978 Helms Amendment, which states, ""No foreign assistance funds may be used to pay for the performance of abortion as a method of family planning or to motivate or coerce any person to practice abortions."" The current interpretation of that language is that any country or organisation that receives US aid is prohibited from discussing or providing abortions even to women pregnant owing to war-time rape. ""The truth is, almost all women pregnant from wartime rape would choose to abort,"" Said Janet Benshoof, president of the Global Justice Centre. ""In Congo, 40% of the rape victims are children. If you're thirteen, how can you bear a child? The mortality rates are incredible. The UN estimates that 20% of women who are raped in conflict and denied abortions will try to self-abort - which doesn't include the ones who have killed themselves instead..... The US government pays for so-called clean-up kits to treat women who have botched their self-abortions"", Benshoof said, ""so we clearly know what's going on."" 
(hide spoiler)] The other chapter which really made me review my ideas (my prejudices?), was the chapter on crime, families who have children who are criminal, and how we treat people in the juvenile criminal system. Whilst the author accepts the need for prisons, he feels there is a desperate need for therapeutic intervention to help these kids. In many instances he feels they are keen to change their lives. Instead they often get imprisoned, which just encourages further criminality.(view spoiler)[  An argument for therapeutic interventionsThere are organisations promoting other ways of dealing with wayward teenagers. One of these is ""Fight Crime: Invest in Kids"" This is an organisation led by more than 2,500 police chiefs, sheriffs, prosecutors and others in law enforcement. They state:""Those on the front lines in the fight against crime know that it's impossible to arrest and imprison our way out of the crime problem""A meta-analysis that collated 200 studies found that whilst the best rehabilitative programmes - behavioural therapy, teaching family programmes - achieved a 30%-40% reduction in recidivism even for serious offenders, punitive therapies had null or negative effects. The National Institute of Health advised ""Scare tactics don't work, and may make the problem worse.""The rate of violent juvenile crime has gone down since 1994It is about half of what it used to be.The rate for murder is down 75%.In some instances criminality may be geneticThe idea of a bad seed seems outmoded, but some people seem born without a moral centre....some are geared towards violence and destruction, lack all sense of empathy, or have a blurry sense of truth.In most people though, the criminal potential requires external stimulus to be activated.Maribeth Champoux at The National Institute of Health and her colleagues have shown that newborn monkeys with a gene for extreme aggression will not grow up to be aggressive if they are cross-fostered by extremely gentle mothers. Avashalom Caspi at Duke has done research with humans that suggests the same. The gene (a genetic irregularity associated with changed function in a particular serotonin transporter) appears not to confer criminal behaviour, but a vulnerability to develop such behaviour under certain circumstances. A family can provide a positive or negative environment.Many Juveniles are drug or alcohol usersOnly 1% of those arrested receive substance abuse treatment.Many juveniles have mental health problemsAs many as 3 out of 4 incarcerated juveniles have a mental health diagnosis, as opposed to 1 out of 5 in the general population of 9-17 year old youngsters.Many juveniles have learning disabilitiesSome 50-80% of juvenile crime is associated with learning disabilities.Young criminals often don't enjoy their own crimes""Often they were trapped in a behaviour that made them as miserable as it made their victims. Criminality felt in many cases more like an illness than many of the ""illnesses"" I had set out to study. We fail to treat some people with this condition who could recover and would like to do so.""There are theories that it is the social milieu that influences children more than their familiesThis is what social critic Judy Harris argues. Unlike adults, juveniles most often commit crimes in groups; and 'groupness' often determines their criminal patterns. It is part of the youthful urge to fit in and impress.GangsTwo-thirds of chronic juvenile offenders are gang membersGangs in the USA in 2009 731,000 gang membersHalf of them juveniles28,000 gangs.Gangs are brutal and violent, but also allow young men intimacy with their peers - often in situations where they have no other occasion to bond.Helping parents to help their kids""I kept meeting parents who wanted to help their kids but didn't have the knowledge or the means to do so effectively. They couldn't access the social services to which they were entitled. Heaping criticism on these parents exacerbates a problem that we could instead resolve. We deny the reality of their lives not only at the expense of our humanity but also at our personal peril.""In a meta analysis of 163 studies William R Shadish, professor of psychology at the University of California, demonstrated that family interventions are the most productive ones . Another meta analysis concluded the same.Family therapy has also proved to be very good.Early intervention brings the best results.The 2001 US Surgeon General's report on youth violence confirmed that prenatal home visits to teach parenting skills to expectant mothers can reduce juvenile crime. Such programmes are most effective when followed up. One researcher likened this approach to the dental model, in which regular maintenance is required to ensure good health - not the vaccination model, in which a single early-childhood action can prevent disease.  (hide spoiler)] I got a tremendous amount from this book. I learnt lots of things about conditions which I knew little about before. I learnt a huge amount about parenting and having children (I am childless). But most of all I got to sit in the mind of a generous, wise and caring man, and share a vision of the world more benign than my own. I think it was probably the last benefit that was most important."
5,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/127893-ami,5,"When this book originally came out, I thought I didn't need to read it, since I'm not especially interested in having children of my own. There are not even words to describe how off the mark I was about that. Like the book Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, which purports to be able introverts but is actually more about what humans need to exist happily in the world, this book is ostensibly about children but is really about how humans learn to fit themselves into the world. It is not a short book--I've read nothing but this title for the past two weeks, and I am not a slow reader at all--but the length is completely worth it. Now that I've finished it, I find myself quite missing his compassionate and wise voice. I don't think I have the attention span to immediately jump into his previous books, but they are on the list to read in the future. "
6,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/419287-jessica,0,"I'm still not sure if this was a great book or a terrible book to read while 38-weeks pregnant. I didn't go looking for Far from the Tree, but I came across a copy a few days ago and felt drawn to it. Throughout this pregnancy (my first) I've felt terrified by the possibility of having a child with a serious intellectual disability. It really bothers me that I feel this way, and I was hoping that this book might help me understand why the thought upsets me so much, and even see how I might come to terms with that situation, should it arise. I think Far from the Tree did help me with this in some ways, but it transmitted a previously nonexistent horror of having a kid with severe autism, so I'm not sure I came out ahead.This is a pretty long book and I read it in three days without doing much else, so in some ways I obviously must have really liked it. In other ways, though, I had some issues with it, and I'm not sure which star rating to give -- it's either a three or a four.Okay, so this sounds incredibly cheesy to say, but my heart loved this book while my brain kind of hated it. If you're familiar with the existing discourse surrounding Solomon's topics, and if you expect certain, I don't know, scholarly or intellectual conventions to be followed, there's a lot in here to make you uncomfortable as you read. First, there's a huge conceptual leap of faith in accepting the book's basic premise: Solomon is a gay man born in 1963, and organizes the book in reference to his parents' negative reaction to his homosexuality. He describes homosexuality as a ""horizontal identity,"" not shared with his parents, as opposed to a ""vertical"" one, which in his case would be qualifiers he shared with them, such as rich, white, and Manhattanite (more on those later). Solomon's homosexuality is thus the controlling metaphor for the very widely varied categories of children he explores: he looks at the relationship between parents who are not and their kids who are deaf, dwarves, affected by Down syndrome, autistic, schizophrenic, severely disabled, musical prodigies, the product of rape, convicted of crimes, and transgender. While the categories in the first half of the book share an obvious consistency, some of the later categories are at best odd and at worst incredibly problematic. Solomon's continued references to his own experience being gay are supposed to function as the glue that holds this all together, and for me this just didn't work. The chapter on children of rape was the most bizarrely out of place: it seemed like he was trying to make this completely divergent topic fit with his other material, but for me it just didn't on any level. The chapter about kids who commit crimes was similarly disparate, and had some real internal problems of its own. The one on musical prodigies, which fit a bit better with the disability stuff, I found tiresome for the most part and if you're not interested in classical music or the people who play it, I might suggest skipping it (there were two interviews I liked -- both of Chinese-American boy prodigies and their mothers -- but I wish he hadn't focused exclusively on the musical set if he was going to look at prodigies, because it veered off into a discussion of classical music that felt irrelevant to the rest of the book and personally bored me a lot).More distressingly, Andrew Solomon has a tone deafness about class that for me undermined the entire book. While I didn't keep a formal count, it seemed that an overwhelming majority of the families he interviewed in the first (disability) half of the book were extraordinarily well off. This made some sense when he was seeking out parents who'd started schools and organizations, since it follows that that population would have more than the usual amount of resources, but a lot of the families hadn't done anything like that, and it was hard to understand the enormous overrepresentation of rich, Ivy-educated Manhattanites, except by recalling that this describes Solomon's own (vertical) identity. As other reviewers on here have noted, presenting mostly families who have vast economic and social resources presents a very incomplete picture of what it's like for most people to raise a disabled child. There were a few working-class families interviewed here and there, and these were among the more compelling stories in many ways.While it did not suffer from any such focus on people of great means, the lack of attention to social class and context was most glaring in the ""Crime"" chapter of the book, which was also the most problematic in its lack of any clear guiding theory or method. This section didn't make sense to me with the rest of the book, and Solomon seems to see no difference between an inner city gang member robbing people, on the one hand, and Dylan Klebold's mass shooting at Columbine, on the other. For Solomon, crime is crime, whether its origins are in drug addition, poverty, or sociopathy, and whether the crime in question is child molestation or robbery. This is so alien to my own understanding of crime, and of the variation in parents' responses to their children's crimes, that this chapter was difficult at times for me to read.Solomon covered several topics I already know a lot about, and for me these tended to be the weaker chapters and the ones that made me most uncomfortable. While he is conversant with the discourse of disability rights, he is also at many times critical of it. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but in places I felt he missed some important points about people's right to determination. The schizophrenia chapter was another one I didn't like and felt was deceptively selective in the people it represented. Nearly all the schizophrenics he talks about are on Clozaril, which makes sense in a way since he's interested in the most extreme cases, but in another way it doesn't. I also felt that the paucity of the schizophrenic subjects speaking for themselves here, as opposed to being largely represented by their families' narratives, was a bit hard to understand given that these subjects were all adults and capable of language. I've worked with a lot of people with schizophrenia and felt he made the disease sound like a much more totalizing, dehumanizing force than it usually is, and his dismissal of mentally-ill activists felt very dismissive and paternalistic. Much of this was because of his focus on very sick (and, it seemed to me, perhaps disproportionally violent) people, which to some extent makes sense, but I felt it painted a more extreme and bleak picture of schizophrenia than I myself have after years of working in the mental health field. If I hadn't known a lot of schizophrenics who live compromised but not completely horrible lives, Solomon's portrayal would've freaked me out and made me think schizophrenia was the worst thing in the world. This made me question his credibility in the chapters about things I know less about -- such as autism -- that had made a big impression on (i.e., scared the shit out of) me.So those are some of the issues that I had with the book. Basically, I could have done with a lot less of Solomon's personal pronouncements and analysis, which I sometimes strongly disagreed with and sometimes just found unnecessary and inadequately justified. As I read, I had a very active, angsty critical response that kept being upset by characterizations and generalizations that seemed problematic to me.But despite all these objections, Far from the Tree is in many respects an exceptionally fine book. While I never bought into the central premise that these subjects are all connected, nearly all of them are fascinating and the breadth of his research is astonishing. What is most impressive, though, is Solomon's skill as an interviewer. Andrew Solomon is clearly a very gifted person who is able to get his subjects to express themselves eloquently about the most intensely emotional and private topics, and then represent their voices and narratives in a way that throws all their dignity and the complexity of human experience into gorgeous relief. If you take out all the problematic stuff this book is a series of narratives, and they are almost all fascinating and profoundly moving. I kind of wish he'd done it as a Stud Terkeley-type oral history and just let his subjects speak for themselves, but that probably wouldn't have worked to make a coherent book, though I might've liked it more.The book's theme is about parents loving a child who is different from them, whose experience is not what they expected for their offspring and that on some level remains incomprehensible to the parents. It's also about the challenges of raising kids who need a lot of accommodation and support that most other kids don't. Solomon claims in the title and inside that the book is about ""the search for identity"" but I felt this was an inconsistent theme. This inconsistency reflected the central problem with his basing this on personal experience being gay, which seemed much less relevant in some chapters than in others. It worked in some ways for the Deaf chapter, though not entirely; it worked best in the Trans chapter, which is probably why this struck me as one of the more nuanced and less objectionable treatments in the book.Toward the end, Solomon quotes William Dean Howells's assertion that ""what the American public always wants is a tragedy with a happy ending."" With his book Solomon ""seeks the nobility buried in Howells's disparagement,"" and he finds it. The intensity of pain represented by the stories here is nearly overwhelming. What sticks with me most at the end is not so much the physical torments of young children born with severe physical disabilities, but the shocking cruelty and ignorance of other people, in particular the heartlessness of medical staff. Over and over again, parents reported comments by doctors that made me cry when I read them. One example: ""Louis asked the doctor whether [his newborn infant] was going to be okay. 'I wouldn't rush to endow a chair at Harvard for her,' he said. Louis and Greta were outraged. 'I couldn't believe that was how he'd tell me that my daughter was likely to be profoundly retarded,' Louis said."" Uh, yeah, it's a little hard to believe? But that's really mild compared to many other stories showing how often doctors and the wider society have told parents that there is something so severely wrong with their children that these children aren't deserving of love.The happy ending of this tragedy is that these parents nearly all do love their children, fiercely and often at the cost of enormous sacrifice and effort, and always in a way that is transformative to the parent, which sounds corny but in the book it really isn't. One really striking thing is how many of the parents said, even after losing their children to early death, that they would never exchange that experience or child for a different one, and that this child was the best thing that ever happened to them. The whole book is about the strength of parental love, which sounds dumb, but it does avoid saccharine cliches, evident by its darkness in the areas where there are exceptions -- most disturbingly, for me, in the autism chapter, which represented the most miserable group of parents aside from the rape victims, which I don't really count because I don't think the rape section fit into the book.Far from the Tree did make me think more about why the idea of having an intellectually disabled child upsets me so much. The answer was somewhat illuminating, and made me think a lot about being a parent, and why I'm doing it, and what I need to consider more carefully. A big theme of this book was that parents have expectations of what their children are going to be like, and that they tend to want their children to be like them. While obviously any parent would hate to see her child sick or in pain and most of us want our kids to have as few obstacles to overcome as possible, the thought of having a kid who is, say, deaf or who can't walk doesn't freak me out. While I do value my mobility and really hope my kid has that advantage too, my ability to hear and walk, like being attracted to men, isn't something I feel defines me in an important way and I don't have a strong emotional attachment to my daughter doing those things. But when I think about raising a kid, I do fantasize about teaching her to read, and look forward to watching her learn to think and articulate her thoughts with words, because these are things I care about, that are important to my sense of who I am and why I enjoy living in the world. I also look forward to seeing her interact with other people and form personal relationships, because while I might not be very good at it, my sense of connection with others is hugely important to me. So ultimately, being afraid to have a kid who is very limited mentally, who isn't highly verbal or who lacks the ability to form connections with others, springs from my own narcissism. In wanting a daughter who'll be capable of and interested in these things that I value, I'm not so different from the aging football star who tries to force his son to become quarterback, or the super-feminine mom dismayed by a daughter who takes androgens and goes by Steve. You shouldn't have children because you want them to be like you, and you need to let go of your expectations of how your kids will be because however they are you're going to need to love them. This book helped me think about that, and it also helped me conceptualize how a parent's hopes and expectations for her kid can be really damaging, if they're inflexible or overvalued. Solomon uses disability and other difference almost metaphorically to illustrate how parental love must not be contingent, and how difficult that can be for parents truly to understand and put into practice. This was one level where his gay thing did sort of work in pulling it together, and where most of the disparate topics gained some kind of cohesion.While his book did a good job of illustrating these points, they're hard to remember. When I got to the largely incongruous and mostly boring Prodigies chapter (which seems to have been written when Solomon got burned out halfway through and decided to have a little fun about something he personally enjoys but I don't, i.e., classical music), I was like, ""Jesus, my kid better not want music lessons, dragging her around to all those practices, and sitting through fucking recitals, ugh, I'd die..."" Then I jarringly remembered that just three chapters earlier I'd sworn I'd be thrilled as hell to wind up with any kid who isn't physically assaultive, nonverbal, and prone to smearing shit all over the walls.Obviously, I could totally wind up with a kid who does all these things, or who, despite my fervent hopes, plays violin. Far from the Tree simultaneously terrified me by making me read story after story about children missing parts of their brains who will never be able to care for themselves, and also comforted me, by showing that in these situations, many (though not all) parents are able to step up to the plate. Far from the Tree demonstrated that you don't stay the same person you were when necessity demands more from you. I think Solomon does a great job of showing the dangers of hagiographies and depictions of these parents that make them seem like superheroes, while showing the strength that people do display when faced with really difficult situations. I cried like fifty times while reading this book, sometimes in horror and despair at human cruelty and suffering, but more often at stories of people proving themselves to be highly decent human beings. It is an optimistic book: things are generally better now than at any time for most of these groups of people -- though as Solomon discusses in depth, selective abortion is shrinking the numbers of some, such as those with Down syndrome, even as public understanding and access to services improve. And while there are certainly tons of shitty, terrible people and parents out there, there are also good people and good parents, which is a comforting thought as for the first time I prepare to try and become one myself."

Andrew Solomon's 700-page powerhouse Far from the Tree explores the families of kids with stigmatized conditions: kids born deaf, with autism, or as prodigies; kids who are the progeny of rape, who commit crimes, who are disabled; kids who have disabilities, dwarfism, and Down syndrome. He delves into the intricacies of each of these issues, including several case studies that he collected after ten years of interviews with more than 300 families. Solomon displays remarkable research skill in this book, as well as a stunning compassion and care for the diverse humans he writes about.I appreciate this book so much because it focuses on love instead of hate. Yes, hatred for these kids is well and alive - people scorn boys who want to be girls, teens who've committed crimes, and disabled children who are already so often mocked and denigrated. But through listening to the families of these children, sharing these stories, and synthesizing research about their unique situations, Solomon builds a deep reservoir of empathy, an empathy that is more necessary than ever when our world is so filled with anger and misunderstanding (I'm looking at you, President Elect Trump.) He discusses how transgender children have to fight against outdated gender norms to live as their true selves, how kids who have committed crimes have suffered unspeakable abuse and need more therapy than punishment, how disabled children often exhibit a special, bittersweet resilience, and more. Humans often turn their fear of the unknown into hate. I hope that through reading this book, we can all come to understand those who are different than us, so we can spread a message of unity and kindness, instead of division and hate.Overall, recommended to anyone who wants to read about extraordinary families, psychology and sociology, and humans who are often ostracized, even when they deserve love as much as any of us do. While Far from the Tree is lengthy and sometimes reads like Solomon just lists one case study after another, it is a manageable read if you give yourself space to digest it. As a gay Asian man who has faced my own trials and tribulations, I have so much respect for Solomon and how he transforms his suffering into such beautiful, intelligent writing. Looking forward to reading more of his work in the future."

9,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2908629-ellie,5,"Far from the Tree: Parents, Children, and the Search for Identity by Andrew Solomon (author of the also excellent work, The Noonday Demon: An Atlas of Depression) is a lengthy (yet precise) examination of what Solomon calls ""horizontal"" identity: the identity that a child has that is markedly different from that of his or her parents (which Solomon calls vertical identity). There are many ways in which this happens. Solomon examines a variety of ""differences"" children may have: autism, Down Syndrome, multiple disabilities, deafness, transgender children, children who are prodigiously gifted, even children who are criminals. He concludes his work by sharing about his own journey to parenthood, including the ways that researching this text affected his views of parenthood, relationships, and love.The book is profoundly moving and endlessly interesting. The stories are engaging: parents and children (when possible) share their experiences around difference and identity as well as the ways in which they are also ordinary families, human beings struggling as everyone does to make sense of their lives and to cherish their loved ones. Some of the stories reveals where family fails to come to terms with difference but more often, even when facing children with severe disabilities, what is revealed is love, the ability of many ordinary people to deal with extraordinary challenges.I was abashed by many of the families, unsure if I could face the challenges they dealt with as well as they do. It did seem that most of the focus (though not all) was on families who had the financial means to help accommodate their children's needs. These families were educated and articulate and often inspirational. But Solomon tries to include some representation from other levels of economic status, particularly in his very moving chapter on transgender children.Although the book is long, it feels as though every word is necessary. The subject is big-bigger even than this book can completely cover. But part of the power of the work is the diversity of differences Solomon examines and his willingness to participate emotionally in the project. Ultimately, the book demonstrates how we are all enriched by diversity, even that which is challenging to our views of what it means to be human in a complex world.I strongly recommend this book to everyone. It is an education in humanity."

Since I'm a freelance journalist, I wrote an op-ed about my issues with the book: My op-edBecause of the gross inaccuracies in the Deaf chapter, I was leery about the other chapters, so the whole book was kind of ruined for me.There is ripe fodder for discussion - for many reasons. I did enjoy the families' stories, and learned some things about other disabilities. I didn't know, for example, about the controversy surrounding limb lengthening. And the whole vertical vs horizontal identity concept is interesting. I'd give this one star because, frankly, I get pissed off when talking about this book and its potentially negative ramifications. But I have to give Solomon credit for opening the conversation about horizontal identities."
11,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10820707-judie,5,"When it comes to having children, Andrew Solomon doesn’t believe in reproduction. He says the word implies making a copy of something. He does believe in production, recognizing that every child is a new, different, individual person. He acknowledges that children do share some traits with their parents, which he calls vertical identity. They may have some traits different from their families but shared by peers. These he calls horizontal identity. He is gay. His parents are straight. Gay is a horizontal identity.In FAR FROM THE TREE, he interviews people who have a child in a horizontal identity. The categories are deaf, dwarf, Down’s Syndrom, autism, schizophrenia, multiple severe disability, prodigies, children conceived through rape, crime, and transgender. In each chapter, he interviews both the families as well as individuals in the category and provides information about causes and treatment. Many of these theories have changed over the years.Children who don’t resemble their parents are more likely to be abused. He states. “Prehistoric societies were cruel to those who were different, but did not segregate them; their care was the responsibility of their families. Post-industrial societies created benevolent institutions for the disables, who were often whisked away at the first sign of anomaly.”Solomon compares, in a nonjudgmental way, not only families with children having the same condition, he contrasts the way different conditions affect both the child and the family. For example, deaf children can live in families where one or both parents and other family members are also deaf. He discusses the benefits of oral speech versus sign language, the pros and cons of cochlear implants, and whether mainstreaming the children or having them with other deaf children is more beneficial to the child. Should they live at home or with peers? He mentions many groups do find local communities of peers. Some, for example dwarfs, are much more isolated and asks what difference that makes. He points out the advantage of on-line communities to help children who are different develop contact with peers.When discussing dwarfs, he writes about providing surgery to help the child grow taller and in the case of children with Down’s Syndrome, the use of tests to determine whether a fetus has DS and whether or not the fetus should be aborted. In all these cases, he raises the question of if these conditions are eliminated or ameliorated, what message does it give to a person who is living with condition? Should severely disabled children be kept alive by medical means? Are children with disabilities less valuable than other members of society? He asks who has the problem, the child or society and quotes British academic Michael Oliver who wrote “Disability has nothing to do with the body; it is a consequence of social oppression.” Children who don’t resemble their parents are more likely to be abused. He asks if the child should adjust to the world or if the world should adjust to the child. He mentions many groups do find local communities of peers. Some, for example dwarfs, are much more isolated and asks what difference that makes. He quotes Simon Baron-Cohen:”Autism is both a disability and a difference. We need to find ways of alleviating the disability while respecting and valuing the difference.” A deaf child will develop other senses to compensate for the loss of hearing. He points out positive aspects of some conditions, e.g., DS children are usually very sweet and trusting.	He presents many viewpoints, both medical and via family interviews. This results in some contradictions such as why autism is more common now.The timing of the onset of the condition creates different experiences. A child with Down’s Syndrome is often identified at birth. Schizophrenia usually doesn’t develop until the mid to late teens. The parent and child are faced with dealing with a major change for which they are usually unprepared. Transgender children may know before they start school that they are the wrong gender. Should the parent support a son’s request to wear dresses to school? Should they allow surgery before the child reaches puberty to keep the child from developing the characteristics of their current body?While most conditions are caused in the child, in the case of children who are conceived via rape, it is the mother who provides the difference. Children who commit crimes are often removed from their homes and institutionalized. Whether the child receives treatment or punishment is largely decided by the community-at-large as it opts for retribution or prevention. Many communities blame the parents. Parents who don’t want to label their children may find the child is not able to receive services unless they are labeled.While most people don’t think of prodigies as a problem, the way the child is raised can have a profound effect on the family. Like other families with a horizontal identity child, the child may receive more or less attention than his siblings. Solomon focuses on musical prodigies and has examples of parents pushing their children as a way to fame and fortune as well as letting the children determine what they want to do with their gift. He asks what do parents need from their children and how can a horizontal identity child fill that niche. At the end of the book, he observes that in almost all cases, if the parent of a horizontal identify child could choose, they would pick their own child.FAR FROM THE TREE Parents, Children, and the Search for Identity is more than 700 pages, plus extensive notes, bibliography, and index. I think it could have been at least 100 pages shorter without losing its point. It raised a lot of issues I had never thought about previously and provided a lot of information to consider. I would recommend it to all readers who have ever met someone who is different from themselves."

And now I find myself 3 days later having not been able to put it down. Reading in one stretch -- as one chapter lead to another and the histories brought these cases to life. One reason is Andrew Solomon's obvious empathy for his subjects. Having grown up knowing he was gay, Solomon shared a sense of feeling marginalized from an early age. He spent ten years researching and getting to know the families of special children, establishing relationships that in some cases spanned that entire time. This book is beautifully written in clear prose, and even the more technical material is clear for the lay reader. Definitely worth the time, worth the effort."

14,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19126246-kaitlin,5,"This book was a real journey for me. I wasn't expecting to enjoy it anywhere near as much as I did, I have to admit. I thought that it was going to be pretty dry and terse, but actually it's filled with stories of love and tragedy. It's one of the most thorough looks at a whole variety of conditions, illnesses, disabilities and challenges. The research behind this is thorough and profound. It's also written in a lyrical but scientific way. Even someone who knows next to nothing about these conditions is probably going to find this a very fascinating and eye-opening read. I am therefore admitting that this book surprised and excited me throughout, and I did so much google-ing and research myself to join in with the discovery of these topics and the personal stories. As I went through this book I made notes and so I am going to probably just include those below. I will note that I audio-booked this one and I would certainly recommend the audio version as the author narrates the book.  2.56% ""This is depressing, brutal and yet so far it's a whole lot more compelling than I expected. I'm liking it even though it's crazy long."" 5.12% ""'Wrongful Life' - this addresses the idea of what life is worth living. How is this a real thing? It sounds insane to me, but it does make sense that this some may feel this way."" 5.64% ""Deaf culture is up first as the topic. I have a personal interest in this one as I have constantly had operations to stop deafness myself, so far, I am highly interested."" 5.74% ""It's crazy how much language you take in between birth and 6-months. Now imagine being deaf and not being able to learn any language as your family are forcing you to conform to 'normal' spoken languages..."" 7.68% ""Really interesting snippets of history are interwoven with specific examples of people who have experienced vastly different forms of deafness and schooling and life."" 16.0% ""Absolutely loved the whole of Chapter 2. It was all about Deafness, Deaf culture, how parents and children have tackled Deafness, ASL, hearing, speech-therapy and much more. Personally, as someone who has a strong interest in Deaf culture (I may well have been deaf without lots of operations over my life) it was a fascinating, real, and very informative insight. I even felt emotional at times! Great!Dwarfism next..."" 23.0% ""Finished up chapter 3 which was about Dwarfism and I have to admit it was an eye-opener. Unlike the first chapter about Deafness where I felt some kinship, this one was a lot more foreign to me personally and really made me think about re-evaluating the stereotypes that surround fairy tale Dwarfs and the reality of living life as a Little Person. There's a theme of isolation and community throughout each group."" 31.0% ""Finished the section on Downs Syndrome and it again was truly eye opening as the the way some people have to deal with their children's conditions, and the way that they're looked down on by so many health professionals. I feel like again this is an area where I'm lacking in knowledge and experience, but I do hope after reading this I now have more empathy for the trials families and people with DS face.Autism next."" 41.0% ""Just finished up the Autism section and again it was really interesting to learn more about the extreme version of Autism and just how little we still know about the condition and how to treat it or what causes it. I do think that there are some deeply disturbing cases details here of family killings due to stress of raising autistic children, but the sentencing being light is troubling. On to schizophrenia..."" 50.0% ""Psychosis is definitely a scary one. Hard to identify between reality and delusion..."" 57.0% ""Finished up Psychosis and children with sever physical disabilities. Both again very interesting chapters and the examples shows were always the right blend of informative and heartfelt. Seeing the different options families may take is at times shocking e.g. giving up your child or performing drastic surgeries (Ashley X Treatment), but I have a lot of sympathy + understanding for the situation of these families too!"" 64.0% ""Gifted and Prodigy children. Definitely a vastly different lifestyle, but also some big similarities to the other conditions."" 72.0% ""Prodigy section was very interesting if very different and more privileged than some of the other situations. Now on to children conceived through rape. It's a controversial and thought subject, but I'm very intrigued by its inclusion."" 77.0% ""Through the section on Rape and children who are the product of it. This was interesting as it touched on some of the same issues I'm currently reading about in The Morning They Came For Us. Now on to 'crime'..."" 85.0% ""Finished the section on Crime, finding out about some of the terrible things kids have done, from rape of siblings through to full-on school massacres is horrific, but seeing how the families have all dealt differently and the things that may have led to these crimes is also insightful.I have to admit this book is one where I am constantly finding things out and google-ing to learn more.Now on to transgender...."" 85.0% ""Transgender people frequently understand that they aren't of their prenatal gender very early on and the frustration and worry over the inherent gender roles we place on kids can really affect their lives."" 96.0% ""Transgender section was interesting again but less so than some of the others as I feel like I already knew a lot of this one from having a friend who was transitioning through college. Think we may be down to the final chapter and summary here...called Father and it deals with the author's reasons for writing the book and researching parenting and families.""Overall I would hugely recommend this even though I do think the beginning is a little bit slow. I found myself moved, horrified, happy, awed and inspired by the stories of these families and the lives they have crafted. Many of the people who give their personal accounts are dealing wth all sorts of outside and inside stresses, this can really affect the people in their family and around them, and yet many are hugely positive. The other side is that Solomon doesn't shy away from the tricky troubles that challenge these families, rather he addresses these too and shows why people get to hard decisions and controversial methods.I ended up giving this 5*s because part of this were so excellent and as a whole it really surprised me and I wanted to keep reading. It's a long, long book, but so very relevant and I think it would be worth many more people reading it in order to make the world a more understanding and welcoming place. "
15,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4152240-lambert,5,"It took me a fairly long time to read this book. Not because it is dry, but because it made me stop and reflect not only on my life, but on those around me. This has to be the kindest book I have read in a long time. Mr. Solomon is so generous and open with everyone he interviews. He also gives of himself to those same people. Many are in very distressing situations, others have coped with awful situations and done so spectacularly, The author is not at all shy to point out what he learned from them. I only wish that some of the textbooks I used in medical school could have been written so engagingly to contain so much information. While reading this book the data regarding the DNA analysis of certain different mental disorders sharing the same genetic aberrations was released. This made understanding this book so much more straight forward. Reading about the families, one almost had to suspect something like that from the case histories and family histories.The book is extraordinarily well written, very approachable, and in terms of typographical or grammatical errors perfect. It has been proofed to be that way. If you are interested in thinking about who is really normal or abnormal, read this. If you have a relative or close friend with developmental disorders or mental health issues, then this book will help you."

All I can say in response to this is, duh. I imagine this book will be one of the best works of nonfiction I read this year, if not for the next few years. Solomon writes about parents raising children very different than they are, children with what he terms ""horizontal"" identities. His chapters discuss schizophrenia, autism, Down Syndrome, criminality, transgenderism, severe disability, deafness, children of rape, and one or two other categories I'm not remembering at the moment. Tying them all together is the conflict amongst many between valuing the child's condition as an identity to be celebrated or as a disease to be eradicated. Solomon, a gay man, comes to the subject from a very personal place, and his writing is extraordinary in its compassion and even-handedness. Really, this is one of the most human books I've ever read, in that it makes me feel more connected with more communities of my shared humans. I recommend it most highly."

If you haven't heard of this book, read the summary and, most likely, you'll want to win/read it, too! If you love learning as I do, Far From The Tree is for you. I'm shocked and in awe that I WON this! Yes.There is a lot of information to be learned in this book. At times, Andrew Solomon writes pages and pages of his thoughts mixed with facts. While I may not agree with him on everything, I thoroughly enjoyed learning so much I never knew before. Not just about facts, but about myself. His writing caused me to form my own opinions, based on fact, and still respect his. It was so much fun! It would take days to write all I learned and I could learn even more by reading it again. This is like a reference book and I LOVE IT. I am even more happy I won it and will keep it forever. Buy this - and never as an e-book - and keep it in a safe place so as not to ruin it. Have fun reading, learning and forming your own opinions! :) "
18,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/208489-margie,5,"Here's a trailer for the book:http://www.upworthy.com/news-flash-th...What a great book. Solomon looks at families, which usually have vertical identities (shared family traits), where children have horizontal identities (characteristics they share with people outside of their families). Being a prodigy or schizophrenic or born with Down syndrome usually gives children an identity they do not share with their parents. It can be bewildering, heartbreaking, and sometimes richly rewarding for those parents.Solomon did research and interviews for this book over the course of a decade. His depth of understanding of his subjects shows. His study is at once caring, understanding, and academically informed. He neither sugarcoats nor dismisses the struggles these families face, and one can often feel the respect he grows to feel for his subjects. Far from the Tree: Parents, Children, and the Search for Identity is bookended by Solomon's personal stories; growing up dyslexic and gay, and deciding to become a dad. He reflects meaningfully on his personal journey throughout the book, but does not make it a book about himself. I appreciated the extent to which he was able to share himself without turning the focus to his own story.One of my favorite plugs on the back of the book is from Siddhartha Mukherjee: ""This is one of the most extraordinary books I have read in recent times - brave, compassionate, and astonishingly humane. Solomon approaches one of the oldest questions - how much are we defined by nature versus nurture? - and crafts from it a gripping narrative. Through his stories, told with such masterful delicacy and lucidity, we learn how different we all are, and how achingly similar."" I highly recommend it."

For one thing, it's a long book, and you should spend your precious reading time on the book and not on myreview of it. It's a huge book, and a great one, a book of unbearable sadness that provides a tool for how to deal with it. Mr.Solomon had to write this book, and I felt that on every page, with every tale, with every family he met, a world of people who discovered through their extraordinary children (autistic, gifted, transgender, criminal) their own extraordinary capacity for resiliency and deep, abiding love. I can think of many books I've loved, or admired; many books I wished I could have written myself. But I can think of only a few that have changed my life, and made me see things differently. FAR FROM THE TREE is one of them. "
20,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish,4,"I did not read every word of this huge book, but I read sections and enough of the whole to get the gist of his focus. Solomon is inclusive in his view of the wide variety of human development and manifestation, and his tone must be incredibly reassuring to parents with children that are different from their more mainstream brethren, to say nothing of persons who themselves manifest special needs. Solomon is remarkably fluent for someone who struggled with dyslexia in his childhood. One wonders if he dictated this book, for he writes so easily, warmly (passionately), and clearly that a reader is drawn in and loses oneself in his many histories of persons or families dealing with exceptionalism of all types. Solomon is a homosexual and so states at the outset of this book. ""Long after childhood, I clung to childish things as a dam against sexuality. This willful immaturity was overlaid with an affected Victorian prudery, aimed not at masking but obliterating desire."" That he includes homosexuality with what others might call ""diseases"" of the mind or body is a curious thing. In any case, he explains his position as one of ""other,"" and as one reads, he explains that the ""other"" in those disabled in some way makes him a part of that larger group. He in no way suggests otherness is aberrant. In fact, he recommends a celebration of differentness.There are a couple of passages that I found, in Solomon's words, ""radicalizing"" and, to show you a small measure of the pleasures in store in this book, I quote some of them for you here.""Then a friend has a daughter who was a dwarf. She wondered whether she should bring up her daughter to consider herself just like everyone else, only shorter; whether she should make sure her daughter had dwarf role models; or whether she should investigate surgical limb-lengthening. As she narrated her bafflement, I saw a familiar pattern. I had been startled to note my common ground with the Deaf, and now I was identifying with a dwarf; I wondered who else was out there waiting to join our gladsome throng. I thought that if gayness, and identity, could grow out of homosexuality, an illness, and Deafness, an identity, could grow out of deafness, an illness, and if dwarfism as an identity could emerge from an apparent disability, then there must be many other categories in this awkward interstitial territory. It was a radicalizing insight. Having always imagined myself in a fairly slim minority, I suddenly saw that I was in a vast company. Difference unites us. While each of these experiences can isolate those who are affected, together they compose an aggregate of millions whose struggles connect them profoundly. The exceptional is ubiquitous; to be entirely typical is the rare and lonely state.""""Anomalous bodies are usually more frightening to people who witness them than to people who have them, yet parents rush to normalize physical exceptionalism, often at great psychic cost to themselves and their children. Labeling a child's mind as diseased--whether with autism, intellectual disabilities or transgenderism--may reflect the discomfort that mind gives parents more than any discomfort it causes their child. Much gets corrected that might better have been left alone.""[on schizophrenia] ""In 2011, I was privy to a conversation between a biotech executive and James Watson, the Nobel Laureate who, with Francis Crick, discovered the structure of DNA, and who has a son with schizophrenia. The executive opined that schizophrenia research was diffuse and chaotic; he had a grand scheme for getting everyone to collaborate, so that people could each benefit from the knowledge of others. He had hoped he could inspire a breakthrough if he raised $400 milllion to address the problem. Watson said, 'We're nowhere near the stage where collaboration is useful. We don't know enough; there's nothing anyone has figured out for anyone else to build on. We need an insight, not a refinement. If I had your four hundred million dollars, I'd find a hundred bright young scientists and give them each four million. If I chose right, one of them would come up with something.'""[on prodigy] ""If Zhenya plays the piano with the fluidity with which I talk, he talks with the awkwardness with which I play the piano. His profound intelligence and complex thoughts are indicated but not expressed by conversation...I had been toying with the idea of music as a first language before I put it to Zhenya about a year after we met. I wanted to know something about the structure of a Rachmaninoff cadenza. 'This one?' asked Zhenya, and played six bars. On the tape of our meeting, the emotional transition is more suprising than the shift from speech to music: the notes contain all the feeling absent from the words...A yearning to be understood--the primary beauty of Zhenya's playing--distinguishes this from technical facility...I felt for the first time that we were in full conversation; it was as intimate as a confidence or an embrace.""Whatever normality Solomon lacks, one must inevitably conclude after glancing through this book that he is exceptional also in speech. We have long known through our history that those with the ""gift of tongues"" have an outsized impact upon the masses. Solomon has this gift. Solomon demonstrates his gift in this book to begin people thinking in a new way on issues of disability and differentness, even homosexuality and transgenderism. Ignore him and what he has to say at your peril, for this man has sway.In the end, there are 250+ pages of notes in this book, so the text is only six hundred-some pages. It is absorbing to read, and so thoughtful in addressing pressing issues of differentness, one feels that some breakthroughs in our understanding of ""disability"" is imminent. Rather than be the last to know, you may wish to take a stroll though the thinking that may change the way we live our lives. "

However, I think he goes on way too long with his own ruminations.I lost patience with Mr. Solomon several times, but I'm still glad I read it."
22,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2922699-genia-lukin,1,"This is an absolutely riveting book, which I really didn't like. The entirety of my problems with it cannot be put into one single review - I'm afraid they may require a book all of their own, with a central thesis and an equivalent amount of research. So I am going to put down some key points of disagreement, and leave it at that.1. Structure: The book's chapters are absolutely fascinating, unfortunately, they often - almost always - do not focus on the central topic of the book. They describe a condition and its political ramifications, bring family stories, but mostly focus on the particular group of the chapter's interest as a group, whereas I would have wanted to see not so much the political and social history of the groups, as how parents identify with children - and children identify with their parents. I felt the book meandered about that way.2. I feel the author confused three different concepts, or psychological states, or what will you. He could not, or did not want to, separate between identity, the sense of self, and belonging and commonality, the sense of community. Those two )or three) things sometimes go together, but oftentimes are completely different. One can feel acceptance and belonging in a group that does not construe a part of his or her identity. Conversely, identity can stem from a source where one feels no belonging whatsoever. As an example, as a Russian expat who left very young, I feel no belonging in Russia. However, no one would argue that ""being a Russian expat"" constitutes a good part of my identity.3. There is far too much emphasis on not being lonely. Perhaps it's the cultural milieu, but the author seems to espouse a theory where it is most important for a person to feel involved and engaged in a group of similar likes. That a) one cannot be involved and engaged in a group of people dissimilar from him or herself, and that b) if one is lonely, it's the worst place to be in. Man being a social animal and all, loneliness can be problematic, but it has its own advantages, and it is not in my opinion as bad as complete isolation from the world. It is also possible to be involved and feel a sense of community with people very dissimilar from you, ones whose identity lacks the part yours does have, or has parts you don't.4. I feel the author often is inconsistent, espousing different solutions or approaches for analogous problems. Whereas I often feel that what's good for the goose is good for the gander, and the reverse. If surgery for body alteration is bad in one place, one would assume that it would be bad also in another place, unless the difference in circumstances is explicitly and thoroughly explained. This is actually a bonk I foresee myself recommending often, if only because it is sufficiently controversial for me to want to hear other people's opinions about it. I will also say that the author does make good points, generally when he is not in fact trying to make a point. Most of the best food for thought to be found in this book came as casual remarks in the middle of other material. Beware, however, of political diatribes. The author has something of a chip on his shoulder, and it shows."

I listened to the book on my (2+ hour) Los Angeles rush hour commute. The book is so good it has made me relish the time. No small claim. The (40+ hour) Audio book is narrated by the author, and the spirit (a word I rarely if ever use) of his words shines through the beautiful and precise nonfiction prose, lending the book an entirely other, deeply felt dimension. Rich and meaningful and brilliant. This book moved me.It made my think and rethink and rethink my opinions, laugh out loud, flat out cry in despair, wince in shame, howl at the indignity of it all and weep in the presence of such love, heart and sensitivity. Sometimes all at the same time.In a large book, full of profundities, perhaps the single most impactful of them (and perhaps the one that most aptly summarizes the book) is the notion (accredited to Talmudic theology) that god (another word I rarely if ever use) occurs in dialog. God occurs in dialog. God is between people. The divine occurs in the act of caring service.I put this on my short list of great books. Giving this book a five star rating feels banal and trite. Akin to ""liking"" Sistine Chappell on Facebook. It took Andrew Solomon 10 years to write this book. He traveled the globe. He interviewed hundreds of people about intensely painful and person subjects. Perhaps the most painful and personal subjects people experience. After listening to him read this amazing work, I feel like he's taken residence in my heart and mind. Sitting here and popping out a ten minute review and a five star rating feels really week. That being said..........This is a great book and Andrew Solomon is an amazing writer, gifted intellectual and a profoundly insightful and deeply soulful humanist."
24,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1948178-viridian5,1,"I finally had to give up on Andrew Solomen's Far from the Tree: Parents, Children, and the Search for Identity because parts of it kept making me angry. When I picked up the book I thought it'd be a thoughtful piece on people different from the parents--like deaf children with hearing parents--and how they have to find what he calls ""horizontal"" identity and to some extent support from people like them outside their family. I didn't know it would have such a strong agenda about it, an agenda Solomen follows through with no matter what the facts he just relayed tell the readers. I just wanted to read about these groupings without having somebody else's judgment of how I should think and what group I belong to constantly shoved in my face. Ironically, that's exactly the kind of thing a lot of this book is arguing against. This agenda is most pervasive and non-stop in the introduction. Solomen's eternal position, only occasionally and lightly diluted, is that all difference is automatically better for people and society. Always. I agree that disability desperately needs to be destigmatized but his position that parents should accept and encourage every natural aspect of their offspring, even a lot of the very harrowing self- and family member-harming behaviors, can be hard to accept, especially since it's difficult to tell from later parts of the book how much support and medical intervention and what kind of education he thinks is improving the offspring's life and what's warping them out of their natural condition. One of what he calls ""horizontal"" groupings is the disabled and his thing is that the disabled have their own culture and shouldn't be selected out and told they're not normal. I can understand some of the reasoning behind this, but ""the disabled"" is too large a grouping and I do not identify with people who would think my disability, Chiari I malformation, is a valuable condition with an important culture to be respected. I don't want another person to be born in this world who suffers from Chiari the way I and too many other people do, including young children. If I could fix myself and every person in pain on my Chiari support groups, I would want to do so. And it's not because society oppresses me into thinking my condition is abnormal, it's because nobody should have to go through the kind of intensive, risky surgeries and procedures full-flare Chiarians have to go through or live with the daily pain and various debilitating physical ailments. This kind of life shouldn't be considered normal. Don't count me in your group! Don't parse what's ""normal"" physically for humans based on how lifespans were decades ago since I would've died young, slow and in agony and wasting away but undiagnosed, a few decades earlier. I'm neuroatypical but not like someone with some form of autism, which gives me different concerns and problems than them, and that's a smaller group than ""the disabled.""Every time I read myself lumped in with his ""the disabled"" it's like biting down on tin foil. Another problem is that he makes every condition directly analogous to him being gay. Parents opting not to carry a child who will have a lifelong painful and debilitating condition is not the same as opting not to carry a baby they find out will be gay. It's not even close! And he ropes in a lot of different conditions into being analogous to being gay: people with a number of physical and mental health differences, children of rape, children who become criminals.... Once again, he makes general blanket assumptions about a huge number of people. I made it through his sections on the deaf, dwarfs, autism, and part of schizophrenia. The section on the deaf was very interesting, though I would like to have seen more about different parts of the brain develop for language based on whether it's a visual or verbal language. The fights over who's deaf ""enough"" in the community, though.... In the dwarf section he gives tiny mentions of the many debilitating physical problems some dwarfs have due to their structure. He says that most of them wouldn't mind staying short but would like to get rid of the physical pain but since they can't, whatevs, man. Beautiful diversity! The section on Down syndrome is relentlessly sunny, with very little time given to the negatives of the condition that Solomen can't blame on society. Down syndrome people are so sweet-natured, and they make their parents and siblings better, more moral, more outgoing, and more sympathetic people. Everybody wins! (If a family member told me that my disability made him/her a better person, I'd punch said person. Glad you found personal benefits in my suffering.) Meanwhile, my roommate knows a single mother with Down syndrome son who has no family support and is totally failing to handle it well. He's learned from her that tantrums get him what he want and he's super aggressive, having been suspended from his special school a few times for throwing furniture at other, usually smaller, students, something that's getting worse as the testosterone that comes with his age is kicking in.The sections on autism and schizophrenia are more harrowing, with the stories talking about people harming themselves and assaulting family members, smearing their own feces and blood around, going on rampages, and many needing to live with family or in a group home for the rest of their lives, and parents and family members having depression and mental breakdowns from having to deal with the system to get the massive help in education and medical care necessary for autism and carefully watch a child 24/7 to make sure they're not destroying themselves, the house, or another person. During one instance of a watcher looking away, an autistic child started strangling her sister. But all this is great too! Somehow. And all these experiences are directly comparable to each other!I can't get too far behind the idea that we should let everyone go off their meds if they wish because I live in a city, which gives me experience with mentally ill walking the streets doing what they wish, unmedicated, as their ""natural"" selves. (Deinstitutionalization is not the greatest.) I've gotten screamed at out of nowhere, including a woman who came up on me yelling that I better stop looking at her but I managed to talk her down enough to get away. One homeless man who didn't like that my brother wouldn't give him money no matter how threatening he got took advantage of us going away from my car to rip my car's diver's side sideview mirror off and tried but failed to yank my car's fuel door open to mess with my gas tank. New Yorkers know to be somewhat cautious while interacting with dickish strangers because they can be armed and dangerous. Also, a lot of people have been pushed to their death in front of subway trains by random strangers.This book is mostly made up of anecdotes, so mine should be worth something too. I didn't even get to the child of rape section, which better not be as directly compared to everything else here, including homosexuality, since the author can't stop bringing that in.I was getting too upset so I gave up at page 345 because I couldn't make it to 900-something."
25,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1333177-ciara,5,"this book is like 900 pages long, & i was reading it in dribs & drabs in between caring for a newborn baby, so it seriously took me three months to read the whole thing. if you're reading this review, you are probably already familiar with the concept of the book: it's all about horizontal identities--children that differ from their parents in some meaningful way. there are chapters devoted to children with down syndrome, autism, schizophrenia, & dwarfism, transgender kids, children that commit crimes, children conceived in rape, prodigies, etc. explanations regarding genetics, oppression, politics, treatment, & psychology are interspersed with case reports on real families grappling with whatever issue at hand--& it seems that no two families approach their situations in quite the same way, even if the are experiencing similar issues. it's thought-provoking & eye-opening to read about how different parents tackle the same problems, & how different children relate to their unique difficulties & differences. i really enjoyed this book--obviously, or i wouldn't have plowed on with it for hundreds & hundreds of pages. it's intellectually rigorous enough to avoid descending into what could be very treacly territory, but the sharing of real people's stories helps to keep things engaging--even compelling. my one quibble was with the author's tendency to occasionally compare his interview subjects with his own experience of being gay. it seems to me that in this day & age, being gay doesn't really hold a candle to the problems some of these people have experienced. particularly for a professional, well-educated, well off middle aged gay man with family support, a partner, & children. but solomon is from a different generation than i am & things have moved very quickly for gay rights...plus i inhabit a subcultural world where being gay just isn't a big deal at all, so my perception is skewed even more.but that's seriously a really minor complaint in the face of a very interesting, well-written book. food for thought, for sure--particularly for a parent. i am just grateful i read this after my daughter was already born. some of the information about birth defects & birth injuries was way more than i would have been able to deal with while i was still pregnant."

When my grandmother told me that I had to help her in the kitchen and I asked her why all my cousins could go out and play, she told me because I was ""the girl"". I dress girly, play the piano and have excellent manners, often my mother has been told, like a good girl everyone expects me to be. That is all me, these things were not forced on me. But I am more. I have always done better than my cousins, who incidentally are all male. And as a child I never understood, why is it ok for my male cousins to not know how to make an egg but I had to learn? Why does no one care if I excel at anything except my ability to keep my room tidy and help with the house chores? My dear grandmother, bless her soul, told me: ""When you get married, this will be important."" My beloved mother, who has enormous patience with me and loves me, still wonders to this day about why I am different from other people's daughters. I was just a little ""odd"", a little ""out of the box"". I could even pretend to be ""normal"", keeping my mouth shut and faking a good little girl. And I struggled with it. I have a little experience with being different. And I speak from experience that it is not easy for a child. Imagine that experience multiplifed by 1000 times, for a child who really stands out, being a prodigy, having Downs Syndrome, being over-active, being gay, wanting to be a girl but born a boy, my heart aches just thinking about what they must go through in life. Unbearable pains, I say, unbearable. This is not a book for parenting skills. Yes it is especially important for parents to know, their children deserve to be loved, no matter what. But I feel that this is a book about being human, aboug having compassions, about self-acceptance, and about love. It matters not whether we are a certain way. It matters only, that it is my way, and I will go my way with pride and humbleness, knowing that I am true to myself and I need not to apologize to anyone, for not fulfilling their expectations. "
27,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/58348-elizabeth,5,"Andrew Solomon has written an epic book about families who have children who are ""different"": gay, deaf, dwarfs, down syndrome, autistic, schizophrenic, disabled, prodigies, criminals, transgender, and the product of rape. It might seem this is a grim topic for a huge (700 pages) book, but it is not. It is about coping, learning, triumphing...in most cases. There seems to be no way to celebrate the life of a criminal...and Solomon interviews one of the families of the Columbine shooters...but there is always something to be learned by the living. This is a book about people and how we are all different. As I read it, I thought of the ways in which all my ""normal"" friends are different from one another and myself. Each of us falls within a range, yet we are different. We can celebrate these differences.Parents have certain expectations of their children....boys will be athletic, their children will read, their children will dance. After parents read this book, they might instead look at their babies and find out who they are and celebrate their unique personalities.It is a book about love."
28,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13156054-shana,5,"Don't let the thickness or the seemingly daunting and depressing description keep you away from this book! On the surface, this book is about families living with extraordinary circumstances, but in fact, it is much, much more. It is about vertical identities (shared within a family) versus horizontal identities, which a child shares with people that are not his or her parents.Solomon takes a chapter each to fully examine topics ranging from Down Syndrome and Deafness to children born of rape and musical prodigies. Using families he has interviewed and spent time with, he explores how these families' lives changed with each situation. He also does a thorough job researching the background of each ""condition"" and its history, politics, treatments, controversies, and more. Although it would have been easy for this to end up being a simple non-fiction review, Solomon injects so much humanity into his writing about these families and also puts so much of himself and his journey into it, which makes it all the more compelling. As a new parent, I found a lot of it difficult to read because of all of the emotions it brought up, but I appreciated that because it made me question my own prejudices and become more honest with myself. It seems that Solomon also had an awakening of sorts in his process of researching and writing this book. Besides being a new parent, I am also studying to be a family therapist and I believe that having read this book will help me in my career because I now have a basic understanding of many subcultures that I previously knew nothing about. Likewise, it taught me about the different ways in which families grow resilient when forced into what often amount to difficult or scary circumstances. Solomon truly provides a well-rounded perspective that stays respectful without minimizing or sugarcoating the challenges these families face."

I was afraid at first that the subject matter would leave me feeling voyeuristic, depressed, and/or enfuriated. I finished the book feeling as if I had gained a deeper understanding of humanity. It caused me to reflect on my own differences and similarities, both within my family and in relation to other families. The book does get long and it can be a downer, but I thought it was worth every page.I am completely impressed by Solomon's power of empathy, intellect, and open-mindedness. He is a sympathetic guide, while being unafraid to say ask loud the hard or ugly questions and make judgments - not an easy balance. Solomon lives like prince in NY - one review described how he would roll up in a chauffeured car to interview people. You might think this class difference, along with his elite education and sexual orientation, would prevent him from connecting to the families he intereviewed. The fact that it didn't is in itself supportive of the message of the book."

The author treats disabilities and controversial identities of children through development and family and with an eye on the larger society. He covers Deafness, Dwarfism, Downs Syndrome, Autism, Schizophrenia, Precocity, children conceived in Rape, Criminality , and transgendered. We can bring children into the world but they never belong to us. They are their own people and they aren't necessarily going to fit into a parents plan or hopes. This book looks at children far away from the norm and how families struggle to bring them dignity and a decent life. Some parts of this book are very moving and it is very informative. It really opened my eyes."
31,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15011938-ryan-bezerra,5,"This is one of the best books I've ever read, in the top ten certainly. I'll admit that a large part of the reason I liked it so much is that it captures, through what must have been hundreds of interviews, the experience of being a parent of a child with a disability. It is perhaps a little too ambitious in that it ventures beyond disability-based experiences to those involving the parents of children of rape and, especially, of children who have committed crimes. Frankly, I think that the chapter concerning children who have committed crimes did not work very well, although it did contain interviews with the parents of Dylan Klebold, which were amazing and disturbing to read. The broader and very well-done point of the book was to explore what it means to have a child whose ""horizontal identity"" of his or her condition competes in importance with his or her ""vertical identity"" as a member of his or family. What you see through the book is the process parents go through to identify with the child's horizontal identity -- or, in some cases, not. The book does an excellent job of demonstrating how parents often reexamine themselves so that they can better understand and care for their children, sometimes against very long odds. It also does an excellent job of explaining in detail the choices that parents make in deciding whether to try to ""fix"" their children's conditions. Some of these are truly tough to read, as with the honest depiction of what is involved with limb-lengthening for dwarfs or what one set of parents did to ensure that their child with multiple debilitating conditions did not grow beyond the point that they could carry her. It can be tough read and I doubt I'll return to it much, but I am very glad to have read it."

I've seen other reviews and they seem to vary depending on your life situation and opinions. Each chapter dealt with a different disability/difference/issue which kept it uncluttered and allowed the author to focus. The book deals with those born different from their parents or at least not what the parents expected. I found it very interesting to see the perspective of families dealing with each subject and the differing opinions and causes that are specific to the issue. For example, dwarfism: some see the dwarf population as a separate diverse group that needs no research for prevention and ""cure"". Its easy to agree that we should just accept diversity and move on, but the other side of the coin is that there is a whole set of health issues related to dwarfism that could be prevented if the dwarfism could be avoided. Do we relegate an entire section of our population to lifelong pain and health issues or do we continue to search for a way to avoid it?The same can be said for Downs Syndrome or deafness. The author also delves into the world of families where a child has committed a crime or has experienced rape. The book is written so anyone could understand what he is saying, avoiding medical terms that confuse. He also uses many personal families' stories that make the subject a reality."

I deeply loved his previous book, ""The Noonday Demon"", and was excited to read this. But.....the writer is a gay man, who was moved from his own experience as a young man struggling with his own 'difference' within his family to...write about parenting children with disabilities? Mental illness? Children who had been raped? This odd pairing of being gay with having a disability or being raped made me decidedly uncomfortable. Another reason I was not entranced by this book was that it was not at all what I was looking for. I was looking for experiences of raising a child who is not at all like me: doesn't like to read, not interested in working hard, totally into being entertained and constantly watching TV and videos, not interested in health and fitness, and someone who admittedly ""doesn't like people"". How do other people handle this? When I had children, I knew they would not be copies of me or my husband; however, it is hard for me to get 'into her mind-set'. I wanted thoughts and feedback on this, and this book was far from that. I love my kids for who they are, but wanted some reflection on how to support each one.Perhaps I should write my book, the one I was hoping to read!"

I feel educated by this book, in the best possible way. I feel as if the book gave me a greater understanding of what brings us together, both as families and as members of larger communities, and what holds us back from being our best selves. What better reasons to read a book?You should not be put off by this book's heft.

36,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5472535-frrobins,2,"I was diagnosed with autistic tendencies as a child and my four year old son has been diagnosed with mild autism. Further, in college I did ABA therapy with children with autism. So coming in with this perspective...When I read the introduction of this book I was struck by how thought provoking the ideas Mr. Solomon presented were, and I read it slowly to fully appreciate the nuance of his arguments. I loved his comparison of whether disability is a disability or an identity to the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle, depending on how you look at it it could be both and neither. That really resonated with me and reflected a paradigm shift in my way of thinking and jived with my experience. And I was intrigued by the idea of horizontal identities, parenting children who are very different from you and showing that acceptance.Then I finally progress into the balk of the book. An exhaustive look of deaf culture. Another exhaustive look at dwarfism. Each chapter started out fascinating but then drowned under the weight of all of the same ideas he presented over and over again, except this time these conflicts as they result to the deaf, this time as they result to dwarfs, this time Down Syndrome. Finally I got to the chapter on autism. And I found I couldn't relate to the stories. Granted, considering autism is marked by difficulties fitting in ironically this shouldn't be surprising, but still I felt like I should have related on some level with that chapter. It also doesn't overlap with a lot of the struggles I have witnessed the parents of children with autism having. The stories he included were from families who had children who were severely low functioning and had to be institutionalized as children. He mentioned some high functioning adults prominent in the Neurodiversity movement, but did not do a full history on any of them. I understand that this book was mammoth in size and that a mere chapter cannot express the full breadth and range of what you find under the autism umbrella, but there was none of the more middle of the road journeys that most families with a child with autism would recognize. I don't know if my son will be able to live independently and hold down a job, but his behavior is good and institutionalizing him is not on the table!The chapter ends with several anecdotes of parents so frustrated they murdered their autistic children. Considering the previous chapter was the rainbows and puppy dogs one on Down Syndrome and how people saw their children as a blessing, with the autism chapter being the only one of two marked by parents wishing their children had never been born and murdering their children, it was a bit of a slap in the face.It also made me wonder if I felt my own experience was so poorly represented, what did people who are deaf or dwarves or criminals feel reading their own chapters? Scanning through other reviews I've noticed a several from people with conditions in the book echo my own experience, and one that didn't. Not a good track record.After the autism chapter I started skimming a lot more, with the exception of the chapter on children conceived when their mothers were raped. And some more things troubled me. I felt like the book had veered far from its thesis on parents accepting children who are different from them. A parent can easily accept that a child is different, but have difficulty helping their child due to lack of education, money or resources. And it went into exhaustive detail on the issues facing each group of people the book dealt with in securing those resources or struggling over the best decision. The only chapter that I felt dealt exceedingly well with the themes of parental acceptance was the one on trans children. I also wondered about his selection. A family with a history of going to the Air Force may have a harder time accepting a child who goes into the Navy than someone could welcoming a child with Down Syndrome. Considering genetics play a factor in some of the conditions, such as congenital deafness and autism, it's not so much a horizontal identity. Even though my son's symptoms are more severe than my own I get him and relate to him very well. We're buds. My daughter who does not appear to be on the spectrum is more like my husband and more baffling to me, though I relish in her because she won't have the struggles I have had. The whole horizontal identity boils down to perspective, which he does admit by studying deaf people through the generations, but at the same time it marks people with dwarfism, autism, Down Syndrome, etc as other with the family career thing as mundane.The other problem was similar themes came up over and over again, such as aborting fetuses who have been screened as having a disability and surgery for cochlear implants, limb lengthening, or sex change, and it got tedious. This is how this argument applies to cochlear implants. This is how it implies to limb lengthening. To sex change. Etc. I felt the book would have been stronger and less cumbersome if he had picked up on themes that parents who struggle with accepting their children encounter and then including how different groups approached it, or even how different families within the same group approach it.A lot of debate I've seen over this book focuses on whether certain categories should have been included. I had an issue with the chapter on criminality, especially since I work with criminals. And I'd say that most of them were raised in homes where committing crime is an accepted part of life and being in jail is seen as normal. Even if the parents interviewed in his book had not been in jail, most were physically abusive, and I wanted to scream that beating a child is a crime, even if the parent never gets caught and goes to jail for it! There are some who don't and parents' struggle with coming to terms with their children's actions. The interview with Dylan Klebold's parents reflected this. But then I guess this could get into a long winded debate as to how much our actions are our identity.I also felt his chapter on crime focused more on the broken criminal justice system, which IS broken and counterproductive and needs to be fixed, but it seemed outside the scope of the book.My final issue is that while on some level I appreciate Mr. Solomon's attempt to look at every issue from every exhaustive angle, I got tired of him giving equal weight to all ideas. He brings up the abortion question again and again, most prominently in the chapter on children who were conceived by rape. He brought up a conservative think tank trying to prove post-abortion traumatic system and never says that objective sources have not found any evidence for such a symptom. Granted, considering the mental breakdowns suffered by most of the women he interviewed in his chapter and how several of them ended up relinquishing their parental rights he made a strong point that keeping the child tends to be traumatizing, for both the mother and child.I was also exasperated with the weight he gave to Facilitated Communication. While it is possible that some children have figured out how to communicate through such means, there's a wealth of evidence showing that it is not the case and it is really the interpreter, either deliberately or subconsciously, manipulating the communication. Further, false accusations of sexual abuse have been brought against parents of children with autism on the basis of FC. I've witnessed a lot of desperate families of children with autism chase after snake oil and end up damaged for it to be very wary of miracle cures and seeing it given so much weight was maddening.For a moment I thought he was going to do this for reparative therapy for children who are gay and trans, but as a gay man it seemed he was a bit closer to this issue and, after exploring both sides, came out on the side against it and said that the American Psychology Association does not recommend because it is damaging for people who are gay (more complex for trans).The one criticism I see lobbed at this book is that it selects from privileged wealthy families, and I'll admit to being baffled by it as I could recall several families in each chapter that were far from privileged. At the same time, families that are easier to get a hold of are families who are prominent in the movement and tend to have financial resources available to them. When all is said and done, this book did make me think. It throws a lot out at you. And I enjoyed the new perspective on some issues. I also think Mr. Solomon has good aims and intentions. However, by focusing on so much the book lacked cohesion and opened the door for people with these differences to say, ""wait a minute, I'm not recognizing myself here."" I'd recommend reading the first and the last chapter. As for the rest, that's up in the air. If you're wondering if each chapter needs to be read in sequence I would say no. You won't miss any big ideas by skipping chapters or reading them out of order. The same arguments are pounded into the reader repeatedly.That said, I am glad I am done with it."

It took me nearly seven weeks to read this but I think it will stay with me forever.Over the course of his 7 1/2 years of life, I have often looked at my child, my son, and eagerly sought the signs of sameness with either Frank or myself: the dimpled chin, the curly blond hair, the small frame, a sharp mind, stubborn independence, at the same time as fearing the other manifestations of our genetic gifts: nearsightedness, anxiety, sadness. We observe and study him, a specimen, the receptacle of all of our hopes and dreams, both ours and completely himself. Solomon writes on page 1, ""Parenthood abruptly catapults us into a permanent relationship with a stranger."" And I have been reminded of that repeatedly by my own child who vehemently cries that he is the only one who knows his own brain, his own heart. Out of the mouths of babes. Also - Solomon is the type of writer I am in my fantasy world - expansive, poetic, delicately blunt, commanding, thoughtful."

What reveals our world, our society, and our identity more vividly than our relationship with our children? Their health, their unique perspectives, their fears and hopes and needs and battles mirror the future of humanity. And while Solomon’s book is not without its comforts and its moments of joy, it often reads as a stunning documentation of our present, as well as an alarming prophecy, a call for the care and protection of our children, both their collective and individual needs.Far From The Tree is immense, but I found myself wanting to slow down, fearing that my journey into the lives of today’s diverse families (so generously and empathically rendered by Solomon) would end too soon.There is tragedy in many of the stories Solomon shares - severely disabled children, adults whose lives are ravaged by mental illness, parents pushed to despair, but there is also an almost magical redemption that reminds us how vulnerable, and meaningful, life is, for every individual. We are reminded that, for many, diversity is redemption. Andrew Solomon makes me want to be a better mother, a better partner, a better teacher and writer and storyteller, a better person.I’m looking forward to incorporating all that I learned from reading Far From The Tree into the final edits of my novel, refining the characters, who are all parents dealing with their own identity struggles, as well as the emerging identities of their children.There is one character in particular in my novel — Leigh, a mother to a child with special needs — who I feel exceptionally close to after reading Far From The Tree. Some aspects of Leigh’s experience in raising a “non-neurotypical” child are similar to my own, and I worked revision after revision until I was confident I’d made her character authentic and complex. After reading Solomon’s interviews with mothers of children with autism, with developmental disorders and schizophrenia, I am ready to add just a bit more nuance to this character. She deserves it.I feel more empathy than ever for my novel’s mommies and daddies, and their children, and I am grateful to Andrew Solomon for this.After you read Far From The Tree, visit the book’s website, a rich and meaningful addendum to an already extraordinary reading experience.http://juliafierro.tumblr.com/post/39..."

Was so impressed by this NYT review of the book: ""Far From the Tree” is partly an argument for the merit to be found in extreme diversity. Discussing athletes with disabilities, for example, Mr. Solomon says, in lines that echo across this book: “Some kinds of grace would not have entered the world if everyone’s hips and legs worked the same way. Deformity has been brought into beauty’s fold, a catalyst for justice rather than an affront to it.”Mr. Solomon fears, as do some of his subjects, that some of this wild diversity may be on the verge of vanishing from our planet. Cochlear implants are reducing the number of deaf people, a complicated issue for those among them who prize sign language as an expressive form.Many fetuses found to have Down syndrome are aborted. If we learn to test for autism or homosexuality, among other things, will those children be aborted as well? Will there be no more Temple Grandins in our world?Mr. Solomon quotes one expert who asks, “If you removed the capacity for someone to become autistic, would that also remove the things that make us interesting as human beings?” The author quotes Leon Botstein, who makes a similar point this way, “If Beethoven were sent to nursery school today, they would medicate him, and he would be a postal clerk.”http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/13/boo..."

Solomon opens the book with a chapter that bashes his mother for not fully understanding him as a child, his gayness, his cleverness, his uniqueness. Then he devotes other chapters to informational essays on the current studies of autism, schizophrenia, etc. which have nothing to do with his personal past. As with many nonfiction books, I skimmed the book, devoting more time to material of interest, but the chapters seem to have no rise and fall in developing the material. I felt pelted by stat upon stat that did not leave me feeling a better grasp of the subject. The author was clearly trying to awe me with his intellect. Why has this book garnered so much praise? It's a mystery. "

I say ‘finally’, not because it was a chore, but because this book is so rich and thought provoking that I had to take breaks in order to absorb the astonishing ideas contained within it. Solomon explores a seemingly diverse collection of ‘differences’ – among them dwarfism, autism, criminality, genius, Down Syndrome – and explores what it means for a family to raise a child who falls into one of these categories. His findings are nothing short of revelatory – about the parent-child relationship, about what it means to have an identity, about the nature of love, and about what it is to be human. I mean it when I say that this is the most powerful piece of writing I’ve read in years."

It is a beautifully written compilation of amazing and ordinary lives that are affected by being different or obscure. It is loaded with information and never one sided. I loved that I was never told how to feel or what to think, he provided the information and let me figure it out on my own. ""It is a description of how to tolerate what cannot be cured, and an argument that cures are not always appropriate even when they are feasible."" (Andrew Solomon) I have been changed by this book."
44,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1404429-alla,5,"If someone would ask me to recommend only one non-fiction book for a lifetime, I would undoubtedly mention Far From the Tree by Andrew Solomon. In addition, this book has two beautiful explanatory titles: Parents, Children, and the Search for Identity and A dozen kinds of love. The latter one is even the closest to the main message and a tone of this book. The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree is a phrase that is typically said in connection with children who show qualities or talents that are similar to those of their parents. But what if unexpected happened? What if your child is not like you? What if the apple fell far from the tree ?This book is a product of extensive journalistic research that lasted for 10 years and produced hundreds of meters of tape with interviews of families with “extraordinary” children (hm, well, what is “ordinary” in any case?): deaf, dwarfs, children with Down’s syndrome, schizophrenia, autism, children with severe physical disabilities (some of them are gently called “pillow angels”), musical prodigies and transgender children. Two chapters are dedicated to kids conceived in rape and children who became criminals. Although the focus is mainly on the families living in the US, certain chapters go beyond those geographical borders. For example, chapter about rape contains heart-breaking stories from Rwanda in times of genocide and chapter about deaf describes deaf villages in Indonesia. In order to bring some structure and clarity to extremely complicated topics, Andrew Solomon introduces and defines two types of identities: -	vertical identity which can be shared between generations: race, nationality, language, sometimes religion, and-	horizontal identities which are alien to parents: homosexuality, dwarfism, deafness, gender identity disorder, autism, schizophrenia, etc. As any wise person, Andrew Solomon is not providing clear answers, but he is telling stories and raising questions:Is deafness a disability (a special condition) or beautiful horizontal identity with its own language (sign language)? Does neurodiversity movement, especially with regard to people with schizophrenia, have a future? Are we able to understand autism at the current level of neurological science? Do we actually understand how human brain works? Why do transgender children and their family face so much hatred and violence? Why more and more kids are born with autism and gender identity disorder?Being a gay child of straight parents, Andrew Solomon went through school bullying, depression, pressure from his parents and denial of his own horizontal identity. He started this book to forgive his own parents and ended it be describing his experience of becoming a parent.I respect and admire how Andrew Solomon managed to share different stories, some of them shocking and some of them truly inspiring, without judging anyone. This book really tested me and created a very strong empathetic reaction to stories, when I did not expect that reaction at all. For me one of the strongest interviews was an interview with parents of Dylan Klebold who was one of the two Columbine High School shooters.In my opinion, this masterpiece is a textbook of tolerance and kindness. We are so different and we are here in this complicated world not to hate each other, judge each other, but to survive together, especially during tough times that are coming. Hatred and intolerance are products of ignorance and this book teaches how to understand and accept diversity, how to include people with special needs into the world. If you do not have time to read the whole book (it took me about a year to finish it), you can watch Andrew Solomon on TED. There is also a beautiful documentary produced on the basis of this book - Far from the Tree - Official Trailer.P.S. Chapter about autism struck me, because I had no knowledge about this condition. And I was very happy when my neighbour for a 5-hour flight was a 30-year old Dutch guy with Asperger syndrome from autism spectrum. Most of the time, I do not like talking to people during flights as I just want to use this precious offline time to get lost in my books. But this time I closed my book without any regrets and enjoyed one of the most interesting conversations of my life."

  I was the last to hear you Scream because I did not Want it to be true. You cried Out in torment and the sun Kept shining through the leaves. That wasn't right.  -- Jennifer Franklin 

Parenthood is usually something to celebrate. In traditional societies, parents raised children that will continue their trades and that one day will take care of their parents in turn. So how would parents react to raising children that were 'different' from themselves?Deaf children posed such challenge to hearing parents. Parents would be confronted with many choices that they themselves little understood. For example, they should decide whether they would educate their children to read lips and mimic sounds or to teach them sign language instead. Both choices carried consequences that cannot be predicted at the time of the decisions, making them all the more intimidating.Other children were born as dwarfs and they carried with them their own problems. Parents of dwarfs mostly worried that their children won't be accepted by their society, that they won't have any friends or social life, that they won't be able to marry and have children, or that they will never be seen as more than 'freaks'. Other parents sought out conventions where their children could meet other dwarfs, an encounter that could be a blessing or a curse.Children born with down syndrome were usually very sweet and gentle, but their parents must come to term with the reality that their children won't be able to do what other 'normal' children could do. That independence was beyond them and that they will need someone to take care of them for the rest of their lives.Children with autism, on the other hand, were sometimes very detached emotionally, to the point that their parents couldn't tell whether their children recognize them, let alone love them back. This one-sided pouring of love, combined with the erratic/aggressive behavior of the children plus the need for constant supervision demanded of the exhausted parents sometimes pushed them to the brink of madness and homicidal impulse.With schizophrenia, parents saw their children gradually or suddenly turn into a stranger. What once was a bright, happy, and promising future was now a bleak, strange, and hopeless one. Schizophrenia could be manageable with medication, but the medication itself usually had severe side effects that the patients often loathed it and discontinued the medication.Children born with multiple disabilities usually didn't live for long. If they did, it was lives fraught with multiple operations, medical interventions, and severe limitations. Parents were often told to 'let nature take its course' then 'forget it and have another baby'.Parents of prodigies sometimes didn't feel that it was a blessing. Their children were beyond their ability to understand and they were often wrapped in their own ambitions that they turned into domineering parents. The fact that natural talents without strict discipline and guidance is often not enough to reach professional level only exacerbates the problem. Parents worried about forcing their children too much and destroying their lives or not pushing them hard enough and losing the chance to let their children manifest their talents fully.Children born of rape were often unwanted. They become the symbol of the atrocity and it hindered their parents ability to love them. Still other parents claimed that their children were their salvation, that they would've committed suicide instead. But in general, society were harsh towards such children, even the parents were blamed if they insisted to carry such pregnancies.In the case that a child committed serious crime, their parents often had to shoulder the blame as well. Often such children were products of physical/sexual abuse. Yet sometimes, children committed horrible atrocities despite the fact that they were raised in caring and loving households.With trans-gender children, it was often the children that insisted to their parents that their gender was wrong. Their parents then must decide whether they should do early intervention to make gender correction surgeries easier later or insist on correcting their children's behavior. Again, both choices did not guarantee happiness. A child might come to regret his gender changing decision after the operation. Parents may force their children to act like their natural gender and found their children committed suicide. And even if the parents were accepting and supporting of their trans-gender children, their children will live in a harsh and rejecting world with a very high murder rate.In the end, parenting such children was no walk in the park. Parents might drown in sorrow and regret, saying that if they had known they would've aborted or gave them up for adoption. How would that made their children feel? To know that their parents wished that they never even existed. Other parents embraced their children's differences, and despite all the hardships and sufferings, loved them for all they are and became stronger and better persons because of it. This book is a book that celebrates difference. That 'normal' was not always the norm and that it was okay to be different. It might not be a rose-colored life, but it was a life that worth celebrating for."
46,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6498062-aliza,5,"A really powerful and intense exploration of identities, both inherited and adopted. Solomon mostly explores horizontal identities (i.e. those you most likely do not get from your parents, such as being deaf or a prodigy or transgender or autistic) and how parents cope with a child who will belong to a community they knew little to nothing about beforehand. Solomon, who is gay, writes about belonging to the LGBT community as a horizontal identity, and is able to draw a lot of parallels between a deaf child of hearing parents or a dwarf child of average-height parents. In many cases, the child's ""differentness"" is evident at birth, so parents have had a lifetime to cope with a disabled child or a child with Down's Syndrome; in many other case, the ""differentness"" didn't manifest until later in life (criminality, schizophrenia), leaving parents still mourning the ""normal"" child they lost and thus less able to come to grips with the new identity. Solomon is also usually able to find at least some positive aspect of even what others would consider the most negative: the sweetness of children with Down's Syndrome, the determination of the disabled, the resilience and self-sufficiency of those with a criminal past. It is only in the chapter on schizophrenia that he finds he is at a loss for any positives, which is disheartening and also says a lot about the way mental health is perceived and treated.While I have read before about some of the topics in this book (autism, for example), other chapters were completely revelatory. The chapter on deafness I found particularly fascinating. In many chapters in this book, there is no cure or simple fix (for Down's Syndrome or schizophrenia or dwarves, for example, there are treatments but that child will always be different). But where science and technology have conspired to make deafness easier to manage than ever before, they have also managed to decrease the number of people growing up deaf, because of cochlear implants and childhood treatments and even the ability to abort children who will be afflicted, with the result that many deaf people feel their culture is being eradicated and stigmatized. There is also a side debate on whether to teach a deaf child Sign (which hearing people can learn, but with the result that the child will always feel more comfortable conversing with other deaf people than his/her own hearing family), or to lipread/speak, referred to as oralism (with the understanding that the child will then always struggle to fit into the hearing world and try to ""pass""). I found both of the these debates, on Sign vs. Oralism, and on the viability of Deaf culture, to be fascinating. In many cases, Solomon spent more than a decade with some of his sources, and his closeness with the subjects is evident. The children have grown up knowing him and sharing their stories; the parents feel he is a confidante and a friend. In many cases, he was also willing to travel extensively to get the full story. The chapter on mothers whose children were the product of rape included interviews with survivors of the Rwandan genocide, and the chapter on deafness included time spent in an Indonesian village where the percentage of deaf people is so high that everyone speaks a local sign language and the lack of hearing is no issue at all. This is a lengthy book, exhaustively researched and beautifully written, and well worth the time and energy to read."

The author is so brilliant and the book so complex that I feel a bit silly saying anything about it. However, for those of my friends who actually read these reviews I am compelled to praise and recommend the book if nothing else. Be forewarned---this is not a book you can read through without a break. It's a book that you can and will return to repeatedly, taking in just as much as you can absorb in one sitting before putting the book aside for another day. The book is a study of parents and their children including a chapter on each of the following: deaf, dwarfs, down syndrome, autism, schizophrenia, disability, prodigies, rape, crime, and transgender. The author is a brilliant guy who lectures in psychiatry at Cornell and who has won numerous prizes for writing. But beyond that, he is so kind and compassionate that it's easy to see why all of the people he interviewed (and he collected over 40,000 pages of interview transcripts) opened up to him. From the very beginning of reading this book I felt like someone was gently pushing my mind open to see things I had never seen before. For example: I didn't know that there is a huge population of deaf people who do not see deafness as a disability and who in fact go out of their way to produce deaf children, and/or reject the cochlear implants for their deaf children. I didn't know that suicide rates in prodigies are much higher than the general population. I also began to realize what a huge portion of our prison population in the US is comprised of truly mentally ill people who will never get treatment and will go on injuring people and being injured by people until they die. ""Nearly 300,000 people with mental illnesses are in jail in the United States, most convicted of crimes they would not have committed if they had ben treated; another 550,000 are on probation.. . . They are dealt with not by doctors, but by police officers--and then prison guards and other criminals. . . ."" In the chapter on crime he interviews the Klebolds (parents of one of the Columbine killers), and I cannot get that out of my mind. How would you feel if your child committed an atrocious crime? It's heartbreaking. In the concluding chapter he talks about his own experience with fatherhood (he and his partner had a surrogate carry a child that is biologically part of the author). Beyond the nature and nurture factors, he wonders if there is a third element which he calls "" . . .some unknowable inflection of spirit or divinity. One's children are so specific, and the notion that they wouldn't exist if one hadn't conceived them at the moment one did feels impossible. But why does any of us prefer our own children, all of them defective in some regard, to others real or imagined?"" "
48,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5870882-sunny,5,"I have to admit that I was absolutely blown away by this absolutely tome of a book. Andrew Solomon who also wrote the noon day demon (about depression) researched for about 10 years and the fruit of his effort he put into this book. The book is a study of “different” children, their identity and their relationships with their parents, extended family and society and the world at large. It’s about 700 pages long and Solomon studies about 10 different categories of children. 1. deaf 2. dwarfs 3. downs syndrome 4. autism 5. schizophrenic 6. multiple severe disabled 7. child prodigies (focussed on piano players) 8. children born of rape (Rwanda, Grbavica) 9. criminals 10. transgender. He tops and tails the book with a study of himself as a gay bloke and the last chapter is of his marriage and the child he has with a surrogate mother. Solomon has three aspects of his character which went on to become identities for him as he mentioned himself – he is gay, he has depression and he is Jewish. He was bullied at school and if you look at his depression Ted talk you can see that he isn’t completely “normal”. But for me that was the point of the book. Where as in the west we dichotomise between black and white and because we live with the Binary code as the DNA of anything technical, we have this us or them, me or you, black and white, east meets west, east side Westside type mentality ingrained into us and for me the main point of the book, as highlighted by the countless examples of children and parents he talked to, is that we are all different to certain degrees, there are mildly prodigal, schizophrenic, autistic, mentally dwarfish, criminal, transgender (?) tendencies in all (?) of us. The book reminded me of I am legend by Richard Matheson where a semi human semi vampire group has taken over the world and humans have become a minority and certainly not normal any more. The book certainly pushes you to question what to be normal actually means. It certainly got me to understand with much more empathy the children in the 10 categories mentioned above. The book was super rich in detail but was written in an incredibly readable way. What an incredibly enriching and humbling process it would have been just to talk to and engage with some of the parents and of course the children themselves. Highly recommended."
49,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5900066-amy-warrick,4," I was intrigued by the avalanche of publicity surrounding this book and was happy to find it absolutely fascinating.  Andrew Solomon is gay, and his parents had difficulty accepting and understanding his identity. He is also married, and he and his husband were contemplating having children. After writing (for magazines) about couple of the topics that ended up in the book, he embarked on an incredible ten-years' journey seeking out how parents deal with children who are markedly different, looking for understanding both of his past and the uncertainties of a future as a father.  All that - his own personal story - is covered in the beginning and end of this massive book. In between, he covers ten areas - ten 'identities' in which children differ from their parents...for example, extreme physical disability, deafness, autism, and genius (he selected musical prodigies for this section). His writing style becomes a bit formulaic; here is a factoid, here is some background, and here are a few pages about a family. But it's incredibly interesting, until it becomes tiring. You may never reach that point. I did, somewhere between schizophrenia and transgender. In the end, through some lovely writing (he seems to have great respect and affection for the people about whom he writes), he comes to two conclusions: (a) parents love their children no matter what; and (b) he, Andrew Solomon, was ready to chance having a baby.  Andrew Solomon killed a lot of trees coming up with these two revelations, but like I said, it was fascinating.  As an aside, Solomon touches on the issue of abortion in the case of rape, or the chance of a profound disability, and comes down squarely on the side of 'that's a hard question. I don't think anybody should tell anybody else what to do.' "
50,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/667235-jan,5,"Fan-freaking-tastic! This is one of the most fascinating, thought-provoking books I have EVER read. I'm only half-way through, but on page 1, I had to stop and get a pen, and now I have underlining, notes, and comments on at least 2/3 of all pages. The book is about parenting children who are different in some way - they are dwarves, deaf, autistic, have Down Syndrome or schizophrenia, are children born of rape, are prodigies or criminals, etc. The topics alone are endlessly provocative, but the meticulously researched detail blended with true human-centered stories makes this one of the best books ever, in my view. After you read the first chapter and before you reach the last, feel free to skip around and read the chapters in any order you wish. It's surprising how much they overlap in context and content. You wouldn't think that autism and deafness or schizophrenia would have much in common, but they way people deal with, live with, or think about them, they do. And yet they are also very different. Information on the ""neurodiversity movement"" is also endlessly fascinating as are the facts that force you to think about disability, culture, and identity. Which is which? How is pre-natal testing (and abortion) equivalent to genocide or the elimination of an entire ""culture""? Where do we draw the line -- at a mother's right to choose or a severely disabled fetus's ""right"" to exist simply because it will grow up with tremendous medical need or as a part of Deaf culture? (Yes, there is even a difference between deaf and Deaf.) And if we provide accommodations such as cochlear implants for the deaf, do they then cease to be deaf and are, therefore, no longer disabled or allowed the same legal or other protections formerly afforded them? This book will forever alter the way you think about it all."
51,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2272233-peggy,4,"An intimidatingly gigantic book about family life and horizontal identity. Solomon explores family situations in which children have a different identity from their parents, requiring them to seek out non-familial communities in order to develop an identity. These include deafness, dwarfism, down syndrome, autism, schizophrenia, disability, prodigies, children born from rape, criminals, and transgender individuals. Solomon spent considerable time with his subjects and provides keen insights about the impact of horizontal identities on parents and children. The chapter on children of rape was especially heart-rending and information about the crimes committed against transgender people solely because of their gender identity was equally difficult. In the final chapter, Solomon relates his experiences becoming a father. As a gay man, this required great planning, thought, and preparation. The final pages are a paean to love. Solomon's writing is always a pleasure to read and it accommodates profound thought that verges on the spiritual at times, dealing as it does with love and family ties. Don't let the thousand page tome discourage you from reading it. Each chapter deals with a different topic, so it can be read over the course of a month, which is what I did. Although written in a very accessible style, there are copious notes and an index, making this book usable for research, should anyone wish to mine this information for their own purposes. Recommended for anyone fascinated by diverse families and the capacity of humans to care for each other. "

Then I saw that my daughter was reading it and we talked about it a bit and the next thing I knew the library had notified that it was waiting for me. And I am so glad that I didn't let the length of this book deter me from reading it. But how do I review it?As Solomon states near the beginning of the book, we as humans possess vertical traits, those we inherit from our parents and their parents, and horizontal traits, those that are foreign to the parents and for which the person must acquire identity from a peer group. He then goes on to tell the stories of families touched by deafness, dwarfism, Down syndrome, autism, schizophrenia, disability, prodigies, children of rape, children who commit crimes, and transgender. All of the stories are riveting and told with compassion. My only complaint is that his focus in the chapter on prodigies was heavily in favor of musical prodigies, although there are others.For a book so long, this was immensely readable and engaging. I was thinking of people to whom I could recommend it - this person for this reason, that person for that reason - and I decided I could recommend this to everyone. It's a commitment but one that leaves the reader with a better understanding of human diversity and its place in the world."

A decade or so ago, along came Guns Germs and Steel, which also changed how I viewed the world. Then came Far from the Tree. The book was recommended in passing by a medical student applicant I interviewed a month ago or so for our residency. I was intrigued so I downloaded the book from audible.

You will come away to a different view of people with impairments--maybe even see your children and parents from a different perspective. little doubt that it will change the way to interact with impaired. You might even accept your children and parents more. It's also quite long--40 hours on audible--almost 1000 pages, but I had trouble turning the audio off.

Reading this book has made me a better person--more empathetic, more knowledgeable, more thoughtful, and more forgiving. Solomon is an outrageously gifted writer and thinker. He captures untold layers of nuance with clear and concise language. He seamlessly transitions from personal memoir to history of psychology to incredibly vivid descriptions of the people and families he befriended during the many years he spent researching and writing. He knows when to use a clever turn of phrase and when to let the people and facts speak for themselves. He evokes understanding not only for people in circumstances different from our own, but also for people who hold viewpoints with which we may violently disagree. It is an awe-inspiring accomplishment.Despite the often sad subject matter, the book is more often inspiring than depressing. It contains so much love, so much humanity in its pages.

With a lesser writer, this would be a complete disaster. As it is, Andrew Solomon has written something thoughtful and entertaining that's not sufficiently cohesive. It really couldn't be, as the subject is far too broad. He approaches the subject of what it's like to be the parent of a child who is dramatically different from the parent (has a disability, dwarfism, down syndrome, a musical gift, schizophrenia or is transgender). There are many admirable parents here (as well as some who are appalling), and Solomon generally approaches them with a remarkably nonjudgmental tone, although it occasionally slips in, usually when dealing with someone who isn't well-educated and wealthy. It's an inspiring read; at the same time, I reject the premise he begins with: That people become parents to create people like them. Some people may, but I don't think that's the ultimate goal of the majority."

61,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10721156-jie-li,5,"I did not tell anyone about my new year resolution. When people asked, I told them that I wanted to lose 10 pounds, play more piano, or read more books. Secretly though, I told myself that 2015 would be a year to withhold judgement. It would be a year to exercise acceptance of matters beyond my comprehension.It has not been easy. Opinions form easily like fog does on a bathroom window. Deliberate efforts are often needed to keep the window clean. If you asked me a month ago, should parents go for genetic screening knowing there are defective genes in the family, or should parents take their deaf children to lip reading learning sessions so they can communicate with a larger crowd, it would be pretty easy to give out an answer. And I would not even realize the biases coming into it. Andrew Solomon’s immense 1000 page book: “Far from the tree, Parents, Children, and the Search for Identity” opened my eyes in a way that was never expected. It changed my answer, or thoughts in answering these questions. This is a book about difference, it is about parental journeys of “exceptional” children or children came in unexpected ways. The storm it brought on my value system will linger on for many days to come.Solomon opens the book by introducing the concept of horizontal identity, a part that comes in “recessive genes, random mutations, prenatal influences or values and preferences that a child does not share with his progenitors.” Unlike vertical identity, a part that children inherits, horizontal identify can come in unexpected forms. Solomon spent 11 years interviewing hundreds of families with children possessing horizontal identities that are completely foreign to their parents. These children are deaf, dwarf, transgender, prodigies, conceived in rape, criminals, or they have down syndrome, schizophrenia or a combination of severe disabilities. This is a group of children that are not “normal” by conventional standards, this is a group of parents that struggle, triumph and harvest the deepest love and intimacy in front of the world’s unexpected cruelties. The book starts with chapter “son”. A memorial of Solomon’s own childhood. With the beautiful, eloquent writing, it is hard to imagine that Solomon had dyslexia when he was young. His mother helped him overcome the obstacle. When his sexual orientation surfaced as different from the most, she started him on a similar journey, determined to find a fix. They went to doctors and endless therapies. For the entire childhood, Solomon tried to fight it or hide it. As an adult, he went so far as to go through sexual surrogates in hoping he would be able to get intimate with women. The anguish in the self hatred and decline to one's identity is daunting. Years later, being gay is no longer considered an illness but an identify in many parts of the world. Then, what about the lack of hearing? This book argues the fragile balance between illness and identity. Most deaf people do not consider their lives incomplete. To them, deafness is not an absence, but a presence. Solomon says statistically deaf children born to deaf parents achieve more than deaf children born to hearing parents. The deaf community considers sign language adequate and capable of expressing every shade of an emotion. When hearing parents send their deaf children to lip reading learning sessions, while they could be learning something else, are the parents giving the children a fuller completion of self realization? Or they are just making the children more like themselves? Who are truly benefiting from this process, the children or the parents? In Solomon’s words, “it is a description of how to tolerate what cannot be cured, and an argument that cures are not always appropriate when they are feasible.”The story of Jason, a boy with down syndrome, will stay with me for a long time. Jason’s parents, Charles and Emily took 10 day old Jason to Mental Retardation Institute to participate an experience of early intervention program on kids with down syndrome. They were asked to provide as much stimulation, especially with the engagement of all his senses. Emily got every kind of fabric possible and made it a blanket for baby Jason to sit on. She hang huge disco lights and super market’s ridiculously sized snowflakes in his room. The room was also painted in bright colors with exaggerated patterns, normal people would get headaches just walking in his room. Music was always on, Charles and Emily talked to Jason non stop. They made Jason play in a pool of jello, brushed his tiny feet with bristles. All possible measures they could think of were used. At 4 month old, Jason responded to Emily’s question for the first time. 4 years later, Jason learned how to read. At age 6, Jason read at grade 4 level and was able to do basic math. Both Emily and Jason became celebrities and the mom was giving inspirational speeches country wide. Things started to change a few years later. People with DS tend to have a sweet gentle nature. Jason loves hugging strangers, not understanding the social awkwardness in it. He is also crippled in observing subtle social cues. He was turned away from camps, soccer games and all the other normal kids activities. He started to stood out and being isolated in school. In the meantime, his intellectual ability staggered and his classmates caught up and passed by. Later as an adult, he had trouble keeping jobs. He learned to assert his position as an independent adult, but it is often used in the wrong context. He is smarter than most people with DS, but also less content with himself than them. Unlike most of them, he is able to acknowledge his inadequacies, and feels sad for what he can’t do. Jason sometimes talks about what he might have done if he didn’t have DS, Emily says, “I have never allowed myself that fantasy, it is too dangerous for me.”At least Jason is loved. And he knows it. What about the kids conceived in rape? In these situations, half the women choose abortion, some miscarry or give up for adoption. A staggering 8000 rape conceived children are born and kept by the moms each year in US alone. When a child’s very existence reminds you of a horrible trauma, the detangling of an innocent child and its origin is a constant battle. One mom cannot bear the touch of her daughter, even she loves her immensely. Others walk the fine line between self healing and motherhood. Maternal love does not always triumph here. The horror from genocidal rape is extremely difficult to read. And here I learned the first time the lack of aftermath support to the women. And the infanticide after the rape of Nanking. This bring up my only disappointment in this book, the lack of voice from the children. I fascinate at least some children will prosper on the path of building identity, despite the dark origin of their lives. In each chapter, Solomon presents sensitively what has been researched and an extensive list of carefully selected families and their stories. Each horizontal identity discussed here has its specific challenges, one thing is common: with the most despair comes the deepest love.I find myself pondering on one question repeatably: is there a standard on what life is worth living? In Jason’s case, a more enlightened life with more sadness or a happier and oblivious one? With the raped women that choose to keep their children, can maternal love produce enough courage for them to fight the demon? In Solomon’s words, parents do not reproduce, they recreate. I think the first step to this recreation is acceptance. Acceptance takes courage, wisdom and resilience. For that, I have greatest respect to all the families here and I applaud Solomon for his compelling book.Good non fiction books are like scalpel in surgeon's hand, sharp, precise, cold, lays bloody facts in front you. Far from the tree has all that yet remains warm and hopeful. The last chapter of the book is “father”, an echo to the first chapter “son”. As a psychologist, Solomon went on this journey to find answers to his childhood pain, and he ended up being a father himself. The book ends with “sometimes, I had thought the heroic parents in this book were fools, enslaving themselves to a life’s journey with their alien children, trying to breed identity out of misery. I was startled to learn that my research had build me a plank, and that I was ready to join them on their ship.” I am grateful to have Solomon share this journey, and help me continue my journey of learning acceptance. Differences unite us. In the end, what does it mean to be human? There is no simple answer, but I believe the answer is in the quest itself."
62,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/35789244-paul,4,"This is an exceptionally long book about parents who produce offspring who fall far from the tree. It deals with parents of dwarfs, criminals, prodigies, schizophrenics and several other distinct psychological and physical types. The author did massive research and interviewed hundreds of sources. There are many anecdotes that show specificities of the behavior and personalities of children who are far different from their parents in the manifestation of their genes. It is an interesting series of case studies and would likely be best appreciated by people in clinical psychology, but the cases are unusual enough to be interesting to any reader with an interest in psychology, especially abnormal psychology."
63,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/326171-carolyn,4,The first chapter of this book is outstanding and should be required reading for all parents. The rest needed a serious editor - both to organize the author's thoughts and to take out the editorializing that took away somewhat from the overall message of the book. Still highly recommended but be prepared for a let down in some of the chapters.
64,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8194961-max-carmichael,2,"An ambitious, gripping but ultimately inadequate attempt by a New York psychiatrist to investigate phenomena which can only be understood in broader contexts beyond the author's experience.It's a seemingly encyclopedic treatise with academic pretensions, but with a deeply conventional, mainstream, Euro-American urban- and media-centric bias. Based on extensive psychiatric research and immersive case studies in the U.S., the book unfolds in a regular rhythm of personal stories alternating with neurological and pharmacological overviews, and the stories of problematic families vividly and relentlessly accumulate into a dramatic and often harrowing tapestry which is worth exploring for its insights into human nature as well as for the author's balanced and compassionate voice, yet it does its subjects a disservice by portraying them in such a limited context.I was intrigued by the subject matter and quickly drawn into the case studies, but it became apparent that something essential was absent from these stories - a sense of the communities in which they took place - and the author's repeated citation of the role of media - social and otherwise, Oprah, Jerry Springer and other celebrities - in supporting ""horizontal"" identities revealed his dependence on the dominant paradigms of our society. And when he delved into music as an illustration of prodigies, his Eurocentric value system was highlighted as he bemoaned the decline of European classical music in the U.S. and the need for young classical composers to collaborate with pop artists, ignoring the vast global spectrum of traditional ethnic musics which offer far more value in their communities than the elitist, specialist and bourgeois classical paradigm.As a lifelong urbanite and Europhile with no experience in sociology, anthropology or ecology, Solomon is simply unqualified to investigate these phenomena, and the focus on individual identity itself is largely a symptom of the dysfunction of our individualistic society. Solomon takes urban society and the nuclear family for granted, but in the long history of our species these have been minority phenomena. Traditionally, parents don't raise children - elders do - and none of these case study families are described by Solomon as part of a nurturing community, yet it doesn't seem occur to him that community could even be a factor in individual success and well-being. He's just a product of the idiosyncratic Euro-American field of psychiatry itself, a woefully culture-bound enterprise.At the end, Solomon sheepishly admits to being a proponent of ""progress"" - which of course translates primarily to technological progress, since in our species technology wields the power. Ironically, progress itself has destroyed traditional communities and natural habitats, resulting in societies in which people are isolated and alienated and forced to struggle for individual identities rather than the group identities which characterize traditional societies. And as an urbanite, Solomon is profoundly alienated from the natural habitats we all depend on but can seldom connect with in the ""advanced"" societies he treasures.Media, celebrities and the nuclear family are part of the problem and can't teach us anything useful. My wiser gay and disabled friends recognize that they can't survive or thrive without a foundation of healthy hetero couples and food providers working in harmony with a healthy ecosystem, and their individual identities only make sense within the framework of such an ecologically and sociologically complete community identity. Sadly, only a small minority of people enjoy this in today's world - hence the painful stories in Solomon's book."
65,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1897227-mara,5,"A week or so into reading this I realized that every time I would wax rapturous about this book to my husband the conversation would fall sort of dead and eventually he told me he found the whole subject sort of dark and depressing. I read an interview where Andrew Solomon said that being a thousand pages long and dealing with disabled kids, a few months ago he thought he might not sell a single copy.I think a lot about discomfort and dignity and respect and about privacy and about openness and my own desire to be more open because I continue believing that when we are afraid of talking about a thing it gives it too much power. And because it seems like a form of violence (word used with consideration) to suppress the telling the lives of any subset of the population; more to the point--you may start out believing in principle that it's important for the parents of children with an identity that makes you uncomfortable (whether it's transgender or retardation or criminality) and for the members of communities that feel overlooked or misunderstood by mainstream culture/media (Deaf culture or dwarfs( to have the opportunity to be heard and have their stories told, even if you don't think you want to read it. And yes, I was worried the stories might be 'depressing'--which I think meant a contagious sense of helplessness in the face of the universe's random cruelties. But then a funny thing happens when you read the first chapter. You start to trust Andrew Solomon. And the profiles have no hint of ""There but for the grace of God go I"" nor patronizing declarations of respect that take the place of actual respect. Framing the book with Solomon-the-son and Solomon-the-father, his willingness to have his own life subjected to the same scrutiny as any of his subjects feels radical and profound and maybe is why nothing in here felt depressing to me (except maybe the musical prodigies). Because even though the lives and the parenting journeys he describes are hard--emotionally hard as well as physical endurance hard--hard does not begin to equate to short on joy, and he's emphatic about that.It's interesting, ""diversity"" as a value is a challenging one. Jonathon Haidt points out the difficulty it runs into when it includes embracing those whose values are different from our own, those who don't value diversity. I think that the easy analogy of the ecosystem and the dangers of monoculture needs to be held up to some rigorous criticism, but in this book the value of diversity as a tangible quality in people's lives and stories, the dissipation of the small shames, the ambivalent relationship we have to conformity which can reassure and comfort us as well as constrain and strangle us, the strengthening of the small staked claims of individuality and identity that end up not infringing on anyone else's claims... these seem to absolutely warrant all of the challenges and discomforts that attend trying to embrace diversity.I wish that this book could be read by the people who are made uncomfortable with the very idea of it, because as much as I adored the lovely crafting of sentences and the precise delicate balance of a respectful interpreting authorial presence in the telling of other people's stories, I think that the greatest gift of this book is the clear demonstration of how the acceptance of one's own self and the acceptance of others are mutually dependent."
66,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47899340-emily-s,1,"As the hearing girlfriend of a profoundly deaf person, I’ve been recommended this book by several people. I just finished the chapter on Deafness (the second chapter of the book) and ... wow. The conclusion he comes to is breathtakingly simplistic and frankly asinine in its language choices and false equivalencies. “You can admire Deaf culture and still choose not to consign your children to it. The loss of diversity is terrible, but diversity for the sake of diversity is a lie. A Deaf culture kept pure when hearing is available to all would be equivalent to those historical towns where everyone lives as though it were the eighteenth century.”.......... First of all, parents often make choices based on what’s best for them not their children. As he concedes earlier, a choice to implant a toddler is often for the parents’ benefit so they don’t need to learn sign language. In one lazy swoop, he devalues Deaf culture and the lives of deaf people. Why bother with all that when you can just genetically and/or surgically modify deaf fetuses and children?People with hearing loss don’t choose to be part of Deaf culture for the sake of diversity. They choose to be part of it because of the innate human desire to celebrate and engage with their identity — this is literally the premise of his book. How is this “a lie”? I don’t follow the logic of that sentence at all. (Another gripe: nonsense shrouded in poetic prose may sound profound to a disinterested reader but anyone with a stake in his flowery exposition will or should quickly notice the lack of logical/scientific/ethical support for many of his proclamations ...) Lastly, it’s utterly irresponsible and offensive to compare upholding Deaf culture to living in fake historical communities. Much less call it equivalent! Deaf people use adaptive technology to enable them to live in a world functionally built for hearing people. They certainly aren’t hiding in backward-looking colonies trying to recapture life in a simpler time. A person (a parent, a child) has every right to forgo an invasive surgery or in vitro modifications (which he seems to believe is the way we will and should eradicate deafness). Oral culture isn’t necessarily the future. Hearing isn’t destiny. He could just as easily (more easily!!!) have reached the conclusion that a hearing world kept inaccessible when accommodations can be made available to all is the equivalent to those historical towns where everyone lives as though it were the eighteenth century. That would have been a far more apt comparison.Regardless of all the awards this book apparently got, I don’t know if I want to read the rest. I’m really not inclined to read 600+ more pages of Andrew Solomon’s thoughts on marginalized identities now that he has made his agenda and bias so clear. And while I understand that he, perhaps for framing or ego purposes, decided to superimpose his own narrative as a gay man onto his “study” of these other horizontal identities, his choice to also impose his opinion and judgment on these other identities is distasteful to say the least."
67,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1289730-jeffrey-akiva-savett,5,"This was one of the best books I've ever read. Top 25 easily. This should be required reading for parents before having children. I was inspired by the compelling stories of love's strength.To make a 900 page story short, Solomon's argument is that parents don't REproduce, we produce originals. And as originals, kids, as a rule, not an aberration, are frequently UNlike their parents. Solomon begins with by sharing his own story of dyslexia and homosexuality. The book then looks chapter by chapter at some of the more ""anomalous"" apples: dwarfism, autism, Down's Syndrome, and schizophrenia as well as chapters devoted to parents with children who are homosexual, gifted, criminal, and transgender. The parents of these children don't sugarcoat the truth: their lives are often dark and difficult, ugly and painful. But invariably, they tell of the leaps of love for their children, no matter who they are. Solomon's goal, obviously, is to suggest that if such love is possible in these inarguably difficult situations, certainly, it is possible in ones less so. Most interesting, perhaps, is the way it seems that deeper love and intimacy in those tough situations isn't just POSSIBLE, but inevitable---by the end, Solomon provides interesting, non-cliche perspectives on the conundrums presented in Brave New World: is an existence free of pain, suffering, and disease worth anything at all? How much suffering is deeper intimacy worth? If we could design our children exactly as we'd like, would we like it? Would they like us? Would our children being exactly like us make us less like ourselves? Upon what is identity based? Seeking to eradicate a disease is often a complex entanglement of hope, love, unconscious eugenics, acceptance and rejection and contradiction. That's why there are so many pages here! Solomon doesn't always answer these questions or address these issues as you might expect. His perspectives are informed by common sense, consideration, empathy, and a love for nuance. As someone who lives with a chronic disease and as a parent, I was so moved by Solomon's interviews with parents whose love for their children demonstrates the incredible capacity for human kindness and connection. Solomon argues that loving anyone who isn't YOU is an act of imagination, and that the world only benefits from more imagination as it is the foundation of empathy. In demonstrating that ""difference"" is the norm and that ""normal,"" however defined, is actually quite rare, Solomon explodes definitions, expectations, and stereotypes. Successful evolution progresses only through difference and Solomon explores the ethical, philosophical, sociological, and economic implications of turning our differences into positive identities."
68,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2508518-julia,5,"This w a fascinating, great read, but I warn you in advance: its long. The book is heavy on the endnotes (half of the weight of the volume is from notes, not narrative), but more than that, each individual chapter is pretty lengthy. The good thing is that the length gives the author the space to cover these complex, difficult topics fairly comprehensively, treating each with dignity, respect, and scholarly rigor. Far From the Tree is a book about difference, particularly those differences that children do not inherit from their parents. These so called ""Horizontal traits"" like Down Syndrome, Autism, dwarfism, prodigious ability are often baffling and challenging it parents, who's truffle with how to handle a child whose experiences are by nature so much different from their own. It's a challenge to society as well, which tends to view, rightly or wrongly, horizontal traits as something to be fixed or altered. Few would argue that a child should be cured of his black skin or that Catholic parents should be prohibited from raising Catholic children. But many argue that deaf parents should be prohibited from trying to have children who are deaf (or the same for parents with dwarfism) and that deafness itself is something that should properly be cured, even if some Deaf people view this as a genocidal assault on their unique culture and language. It's these attitudes and contradictions that Solomon tries to explore, and to his credit, with a minimum of judgement or editorializing. I knew about the capital D Deaf community and their attitudes toward cochlear implants and hostility toward scientific advances to ""fix"" them. But I did not know about similar anti-fixing movements in people with Down Syndrome, autism, even schizophrenia. Solomon is careful to bring all sides of the story, event he frighteningly high instances of parents who kill their severely disabled or autistic children, which courts usually view as a act of ""mercy"". Is it so to the child? This book goes a long way towards challenging your preconceived notions of difference, of good and bad, worthy and unworthy. It's not always an easy read, I found the chapter on children of rape, With its extensive coverage of the lack of services and options open to victims of rape who find themselves pregnant, to be an especially difficult read. But it's also not all gloom and depression. The vibrant love of these families, faced with difficult choices and existences, is evident, though it doesn't mask the realities of their lives in some saccharine cover. Lengthy, nuanced, and fascinating, Far From the Tree is a great book of the year, and I'm so glad I stuck with it to the end. "
69,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/811362-judy,5,"I don't often give five stars to books, but Solomon's lengthy exploration of what happens when parents have children who are not at all like them deserves every single one of them. These are children with major issues such as deafness, autism, dwarfism, Down Syndrome and severe disabilities, not to mention dealing with children who are transgender or the result of rape. And those who commit crimes even though their parents have been law abiding citizens all their lives.Solomon tells the stories of hundreds of families taking on the challenges of making a life for a child who's not at all like the parents, or other children. It's amazing how heroic these parents are, how they become advocates for their children, and love them for who they are. Which can be heart breaking when the children are not capable of loving them back.The questions he raises are valid and thought provoking. Some children have their own ""horizontal"" identity as Solomon puts it, as with deafness. Solomon finds that parents who allow their children to be Deaf--communicating by Sign and exposing them to the Deaf community--often find that they lose their children to that community. They can never become fluent in their child's language so there's always a barrier. Either the parents sacrifice having the child in the Deaf world so the child can be happy, or the child sacrifices his or her happiness to be in the world of the parents. It's no surprise that most parents choose their children's happiness even though it means giving them up to another culture they can never be part of.In fact, Solomon quotes some Deaf activists who believe that all Deaf children should be taken away from their hearing parents so they can be raised among their own kind.Along with the personal stories of the families, Solomon has packed the book with lots and lots of research. He quotes scholarly studies and journal articles by experts in all the relevant fields. In fact, the notes and bibliography make up half of the book. In short, this guy did his homework. He knows what he's talking about.I loved this book for making me think about issues that are difficult to wrap your head around. And if anything, after reading this book, you will have a new found appreciation for your own ""normal"" children. As Solomon points out at the beginning of the book, we don't ""reproduce"" ourselves, but create new people entirely. People who are not at all like us. And we love them anyway."
70,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/124879-beth,5,"I will most likely never have children of my own, but I have often wondered what kind of parent I would have been. I specifically wonder how I would respond to having a child with a severe disability or health problem. In my work, I often care for infants who will obviously lead very limited lives due to severe physical problems. It is always fascinating to see how parents react to this. Some respond very poorly, through withdrawal or neglect. However, other parents can truly blossom in this situation. The challenge brings forth qualities of strength and grace that can be remarkable to see. (I will also add that it's not always easy to predict in the beginning which families will respond positively......)Andrew Solomon's book Far from the Tree describes the experience of parents who are confronted with children who turn out to be profoundly different from them in some way. Solomon discusses the parenting of children with autism, deafness, dwarfism, transgenderism, and schizophrenia, as well as children who develop into musical prodigies, and children who become violent criminals. The historical background and current science of each situation is beautifully presented. In addition, he uses in-depth personal stories to illustrate the development of parents in response to these situations. As I have seen in my own work, the reactions are quite varied, and parents who appear at first glance to have the best resources are not necessarily best prepared to deal with it. One of my neighbors had a son with severe cerebral palsy who led a very difficult life and died in his late teens. I spoke with her about it once, and she said, ""I always wondered what I would do if I had a handicapped child. I thought I would not be able to handle it. But, it just becomes your life, you know? And I loved him just like I would have loved a perfect child."" And that is really what Solomon's book is about: love, and how it changes our lives into something we could not have imagined before we encountered it. "
71,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17277847-barry-dank,5,"this book is a tour de force. Anyone interested in the human condition should read this book. As a social psychologist/sociologist I learned a great deal. His material on deaf culture filled in many gaps for me, such was also the case on child prodigies and music. His description of the attraction of gangs in terms of the feelings of intimacy and closeness was impressive.Throughout the book the reader feels the power of dehumanization, the denial of personhood re the disabled. The dilemmas faced by parents was presented throughout. His chapter on the children of women who were raped was a difficult and powerful read. He presented material on the raped and their children from the US and Rwanda, such included material on politically motivated mass rape.Although, much of the content of the book was anecdotal and based on his interviews, the book was well researched. Reading the footnotes was quite informative. Even though it was well researched, no research methodology was included. We don't know how he went about obtaining the interviews, nor do we know the number of interviewees.Some of the chapters included a ses bias, interviewees were mainly well off, highly educated, not so in his chapter on rape, the chapter on crime.Omissions, the major one was no inclusion of Alice Miller's book- For your own good, hidden cruelty in childhood and the roots of violence. Much of his book actually dealt with cruelty toward children, issues of power and control, and Miller's writing is so germane. For people who liked Solomon,do read Miller's book.I also thought that Solomon made short shrift of Thomas Szasz. Szasz did do much to sensitize us to the use of mental illness as a form of social control, that the label often benefited the labelers rather than those so labeled, and, of course, mi labeling was overtly used to control and degrade gays.In any case, bravo to Solomon for this book."

It would be much easier to rate each chapter as its own entity (but I don't really have the time or patience for that). First off, I have to say, as the mother of an autistic child that the chapter on Autism didn't speak to me at all. He chose basically the 2 ends of the spectrum-kids who were non-verbal and kids who were able to mainstream. There was really nothing about the unique challenges in the middle. He really does have a talent for finding the most exceptional cases which may make for a more exciting story, but also is a highly unrealistic portrayal. I was also seriously put off by his clear prejudice that having an autistic child was the worse case scenario. I must admit to being deeply offended by that attitude. He even reiterates that sentiment throughout the book [ in comparisons that having this ---(fillin issue here) kind of child is not as difficult as having an autistic child etc]I was annoyed by how deeply biased a lot of this book was.The chapters on Prodigies and his own Fatherhood chapter I found to be throw-aways. I didn't think he even really made a serious attempt to justify including the Prodigy chapter. Maybe he felt it was needed to alleviate the grim nature of the rest of the book. ANd maybe the Father chapter was meant to ""always leave them smiling""I found this a difficult book because of the tone and the harrowing stories but did find some redeeming virtues. It really was an insight into the lives of families with other disabilities (though I would be very interested to know if most parents from the chapter that purportedly dealt with their issues had the same reaction that I did)"

This book took me all summer to read, not only because it's absurdly long but because it's so heavy and well-written. I want each of you out there to read this book, parent or not, desiring to be a parent in the future or not. It's so. good. Are you interested in the lives of: deaf, dwarves, autistic, child prodigies, transgendered, down's syndrome, schizophrenic, criminal or conceived in rape children? If yes, read this. If not, maybe you should be. The sheer humanity revealed in this collection of interviews struck me time and time again, about how parents struggle or excel at surviving parenting children with unique ""horizontal"" identities. The book is so well done. The author spent over 10 years interviewing hundreds of families and their children, as well as compiling research from other sources. It reads as touching and unbiased. Even if you only have interest in one of these maladies/identities, pick it up and read just that chapter. I guarantee you will look upon the world and the wonderful humans that thrive on it with greater appreciation. An incredibly humble read."

75,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8093511-patricia,5,"Andrew Solomon spent 10 years meeting and learning about families where the child is different from the parents (or from the social norm) in some fundamental way, including being deaf or autistic, having Downs syndrome, or being a dwarf or a genius, having been conceived in rape, etc. He then took what he learned to write this amazing book with the stories of these families and individuals. Many have overcome their challenges and their stories are inspirational. Some were not able to overcome and those stories are sad. But all of these stories together give us a chance to consider the ethics, morality and choices of living. This book is made of up 702 pages (with an additional 204 page of notes and references) of thoughtful prose and as such it is a commitment to read, but I found it very rewarding. It reminds you of what is really important in life - the acceptance of ourselves and the love we show for others."

These accounts of families in difficult and unexpected circumstances are largely uplifting, with many examples of unwavering commitment and love. It gave me new appreciation for the hardships facing these familes. The chapter about autism in particular left me stunned--I had no idea. I renewed my own selfish gratefullness and total awe for my healthy children many times over while reading this book. There but for the grace of God ... The book is well researched. While I am a geek at heart, I found myself focusing on the family stories generously sprinkled throughout each chapter, and skimming over the more scientific, academic cultural analysis; as I found myself becoming numb to it after the first 5 chapters or so. Perhaps a better reading strategy would be a chapter a week, versus one after the other to avoid information and emotional overload!"

I was especially impressed with Solomon's balanced presentation of the complicated and often vexed relationship between the conception of difference as disability and the competing conception of difference as identity. The more I read about horizontal identities and the challenges faced by parents and children whose circumstances are far different from mine, the more connected I felt to the larger experience of social difference. It is Solomon's great achievement that he has written a history of lived experiences that acknowledges both the joy and the sorrow of those who've landed ""far from the tree"" without diminishing either perspective.See complete review here: http://onoffspectrum.blog.com/2014/01..."

Each morning from 5am-6:30 I walked (instead of running) and occasionally stopped under the stars as Solomon brought me deep into different worlds I might never lead or otherwise understand.As the book went on I would sometimes think...well he ought to consider 'x' only to realize that he had not only considered 'x' but 'p, q, r, $, ♧,¤, y, & z besides.I fell in love with Solomon through his depth of his research and the thoughtful compassion that came through every word he spoke.

It's the kind of book that stays with you and that provides both comfort and inspiration as you read about how the brave individuals he chose to write about come to terms with incredible hardship, discrimination and heartache as a result of conditions like autism, schizophrenia, dwarfism, deafness, crime, rape etc... I would highly recommend this book to anyone as we all come across challenging situations or individuals who deserve and need our understanding and empathy instead of our fear and rejection.

That being said, the stories of the families he interviewed were compelling, and it raised interesting ideas about what differences and disabilities do and should mean about a person and a family.

Covering categories like parents of deaf children, children with Down’s syndrome, autism, schizophrenia, cerebral palsy, transgender children, parents of prodigies and criminals, and children born out of rape. Andrew Solomon beautifully weaves these stories together revealing the similar theme that unites them - that in the end love conquers all. In spite of how foreign their children’s lives may be to their own, mostly all of these parents would not wish for different children but desperately love the ones they have.With insightful, and challenging discussions on topics like ethics and technical advances in medicine, and on the social model of disability, this is a book that will really get you thinking. Personally, I realised some of my own prejudices towards certain conditions that I wasn’t aware of on a subconscious level before. The section on transgender was especially eye opening for me. Conversely, I couldn’t finish the chapter on children born in rape due to the detailed retelling of these stories, but otherwise every page had me hooked.This is the kind of book that makes you more loving, kind and tolerant. Everyone should read it. "

Since the book is long, please note my opinion that all group readers need not read every chapter. In fact, while the first chapter is a must and the last is highly recommended for all to read, there is wiggle room for the middle chapters.  Having various group members choose one (or two ) additional chapters to specialize in for discussion purposes may add depth and dynamism to the discussion. Group members can be encouraged to read the entire book, of course, but at least in certain book groups, the length may be an issue for some of the slower or busier readers.

Here are two suggestions: Simon & Schuster http://books.simonandschuster.com/Far...or Lit lovers.http://www.litlovers.comOne of the teacher ideas below contains a hint of topics that may arise during a book discussion. ""Solomon describes numerous difficult and controversial issues affecting groups in the book. Assign your students a paper in which they must research an issue, explore moral and ethical considerations, and take a position on it. Topics may include the following:• cochlear implants for deaf people• limb-lengthening for dwarfs• insurance coverage for gender-reassignment surgery• genetic screening during pregnancy• institutionalization of the disabled""........Here are some of the QUOTES from Solomon's book that I flagged during my own reading.""There is no contradiction between loving someone and feeling burdened by that person; indeed love tends to magnify the burden.""""All kinds of attributes make one less able. Illiteracy and poverty are disabilities, and so are stupidity, obesity, and boringness. Faith is a disability insofar as it constrains you from self-interest; atheism is a disability inasmuch as it shields you from hope. One might see power as a disability, too, for the isolation in which it imprisons those who wield it. ….Likewise, any of these characteristics can embody strength, some more easilty than others.""""Although we have moved in recent decades away from illness models and toward identity models, such a shift is not always ethically defensible... to propose that anorexics are merely pursuing an identity is as morally lax as accepting the belief of gang members that they are merely pursuing an identity that happens to entail killing people."" ""It is always both essential and impossible to tease apart the difference between the parent’s wanting to spare the child suffering and the parent's wanting to spare themselves suffering.""""Having a severely challenging child intensifies life. The lows are almost always very low; the highs are sometimes very high. It takes an act of will to grow from loss: the disruption provides the opportunity for growth, not the growth itself."" ""Positive transformations are achieved when initial disequilibrium, which is traumatic and brief, gives way to psychic reorganization, which is gradual and enduring."" ""Many people are outraged when a disabled or challenged adult produces a disabled or challenged child.... Whether to consign someone else to struggle with the extraordinary burdens you have carried is a personal moral issue. Yet all parents make that decision on some scale. Most choose to procreate even though the affluent could conceive children in vitro with donated Superman sperm and wonder Woman egg. Asinine people gamely produce asinine children even though stupidity makes life terribly hard; morbidly obese people often produce corpulent children who may be marginalized because of their body weight; depressive parents produce children who may grapple with chronic sadness. The poor have children despite the obvious disadvantages of poverty.  It is not a great leap from choosing to keep a pregnancy despite a prenatal diagnosis to selecting for difference. Creating made to order babies with genetic defects would seem to be an ethical minefield, but to some parents with disabilities—say, deafness or dwarfism --- it just means making babies like them.” ""...Suffering does not imply love, but love implies suffering..."""

Through interviews with family members backed by extensive, scientific research, Solomon paints a compassionate and brutally honest picture of the lives of the children and their families. Difference is difficult but that doesn't mean it isn't good for us as individuals and a community or world as a whole. Just as some social taboos of bygone centuries are unacceptable in modern times, Solomon gently reminds us that by accepting others where they are - instead of putting family, friends and strangers in ""boxes"" - we can slowly learn from these brave families' lives."

98,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7264313-tom,5,"You will possibly love Andrew Solomon’s tome on child-raising, “Far From the Tree,” for the first eleven and a half chapters, and then feel a burn of irritation in the closing few paragraphs, so it’s best to air grievances first: The ending of this book is too self-important and ancillary to work as well as what precedes it. Solomon has spent over six hundred pages telling us of how other people bring up their disabled or unfortunate children, so perhaps he has earned the right to tell us of his own path. Yet the reality is that the story of he and his male partner having a child is too unexceptional to have been worthwhile, and Solomon cannot bring the drama or faculty of verse requisite to make it more than skim-worthy.But the time and detail that have gone into this mammoth account are too profound for the conclusion to be anything but a minor disappointment. Indeed, it may have been impossible to follow up such an accomplishment with a worthy coda. One is reminded of the indulgent essay that closes out Leo Tolstoy’s “War and Peace”—sure, it wasn’t how you wanted to finish the book, but you’ll never forget what you discovered about the world in the pages that came before.Solomon covers ten child-raising subcultures—from Deaf to children of rape—over twelve chapters, alternating between journalism and essay in a rhythmic style that might be called ground-breaking. At times he is too eager to include every human being he has encountered, and the briefer tales of parents’ experiences are less poignant—but the material synthesizes so organically that the book rarely feels overfed. Discussing disabled children, for example, Solomon will tell of how one mother was so optimistic about her future child, then had her dreams crushed by its mental and physical incapacity, then move to a passage about how so many parents he has met still speak positively of their experiences, despite the weight of their tribulations. His ability to dig into the nuances and discomfiting realities of his subjects sedate readers so that we feel adrift in a world of new, invaluable knowledge.Take his chapter on schizophrenia. Many people might be familiar with the multiple-personality disease as a joke you see on Hot Topic t-shirts—e.g., “I used to have schizophrenia, but we’re okay now”—and others might think that schizophrenia is something easily cured, a mere delusion talked away through therapy. But did you know that schizophrenia actually involves deterioration of gray matter in the brain, and that in its final stages will leave the brain with almost no gray matter at all? Or that some schizophrenics embrace the neurodiversity movement and argue that there is nothing wrong with them, only that they are ostracized for being different? (Which of course plays directly into the paranoia associated with schizophrenia.)Stepping so deep into cultures hitherto unknown, readers will find their own perspectives challenged. Solomon quotes Woody Allen saying that “dwarf” is one of the funniest words in the English language, but why is it that we cackle at little people when any of the other disabilities described in the book—such as autism or Down syndrome—are typically thought of as tragedies? Solomon set out to write this book wanting to broaden the perspective of the common man seeing a disabled person in the street, but this is also a work of social advocacy—nearly every single person suffering in this book is to some extent crushed by a lack of funding, as government or charity cannot funnel in the monies necessary to change lives. Solomon writes of one study showing that “kids on probation … were almost ten times more likely to reoffend than similar kids who participated in family therapy.” We read such statistics and walk away with a profound sense of loss.The most affecting chapter is close to the end: “Crime.” As in Deaf culture there is “Deaf of Deaf”—Deaf people born of Deaf people—there is very often Crime of Crime, so many criminals likely to have come from abusive childhoods. Solomon follows up stories of such households by voyaging into the inexplicable—Dylan Klebold’s mass murder of his classmates at Columbine High School in 1999, despite having come from a happy, loving home. Solomon stays at Klebold’s parents’ house, sleeps in his room, and what could be the book’s most pretentious or sentimental section becomes its most tragic and provocative. Klebold’s mother, Sue, speaks of how much she has learned from the experience, how much sympathy she has gained for criminals and their parents. She says, “I know it would have been better for the world if Dylan had never been born. But I believe it would not have been better for me.” Some may read it and scorn, but Klebold’s comments mirror that of every other troubled parent in the book, and that is precisely why her story, contextualized by Solomon, is so effective.Rating: A/A- "
99,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1924156-liesel,4,"This is a review the deaf chapter. I am living the experience of a hearing parent with three daughters, two of whom are deaf. I felt this chapter was unbalanced toward the Deaf culture perspective, rather than the current experiences of hearing parents raising deaf children. Solomon usually writes well-researched books, but I found some errors or misleading information I wish to address. The book is wonderful, but I gave it four stars because it was too unwiedly. It is almost appropriate I just review one chapter as it is so large. My two daughters have bilateral cochlear implants and use sign language. Currently, one is using English as her first language and the other is using sign language as her first language. I also mentor, support and educate families who have deaf or hard of hearing children.I hear all the time you should wait until the child is old enough to choose to have a cochlear implant. What people are missing is that if this was done, you still took away a choice. If you choose not to implant, you have permanently taken away the choice to hear and speak well because the time period of neural plasticity will pass. You can have both by getting cochlear implants and signing. The deaf adults of hearing parents grew up in the half-century when oralism was in vogue. There are many tragic stories of children who were unable to gain access to communication because it was not possible before the advances in amplification of better hearing aids and cochlear implants there are today. I completely understand the worldview from this experience, Deaf pride and even anger of many Deaf adults of this generation. But, this dominated the chapter rather than the experiences today and what it is looking like for the future. There are a few areas that I found to be inaccurate or misleading. Cochlear implant surgery is on the inner ear or the cochlea and does not include any surgery on the brain. There is no wire coming or anything else coming out of your neck. The internal device is completely enclosed and the external device magnetizes on and off with a behind the ear component. He writes that this is approved in the U.S. only for children over the age of two. This has not been the case for many years before this book was written. It is 12 months in the U.S. My youngest received bilateral implants in the same surgery at 14 months. He mentions briefly that the danger of the surgery is over exaggerated. Then the only example is the experience of the family whose daughter had a seven hour surgery just for one implant, then got an infection and the parents were told she might die. This is not typical and would be the risk of any surgery. He mentioned facial paralysis without any statistics and this is quite rare because they have electrodes on the nerves during the surgery. As for one in four children having complications, perhaps they are slightly dizzy for a few days. But, I'd hardly call that a complication. For my family as is typical, the surgery for two was less than four hours. My daughter walked out six hours after the surgery. She was on minimal pain meds by day three and running about as if nothing had happened. Although it certainly does not sound the same, my daughter does enjoy music, listens to her iPod, sings and is learning to play an instrument. People with cochlear implants can enjoy music. I am certain it sounds quite different and they cannot hear the nuances of an opera or a turtle dove in a forest of crows, but it is adequate enough to experience some. The last point I will touch on is the financial. In the book it says that Deaf people who sign are less expensive and cheaper to accommodate than those with traumatic childhoods. Of course, I take offense that children who do not sign have traumatic childhoods. I’m not sure how the financial cost came down to being cheaper for signing people. If you look at the numbers of deaf adults on SSI or other public benefits, who are underemployed, and who have not attained higher education it is exceptionally high. This is a cost to society that was not considered. I'm not saying this means you shouldn't embrace deaf culture or deaf people cannot be successful, but overall this is the reality. Cochlear implants are indeed expensive as a surgery and to maintain. But, the cost benefit analysis over a lifetime, I believe that this is the less expensive choice for the person and society. If you read this far, thank you for reading my review on the deaf chapter. "
100,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2754669-liz-demar,5,"This is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. Admittedly my interest was piqued as I also have a child who is ""far from the tree."" I immensely enjoyed the chapters on disability (Deaf, Dwarfs, Down Syndrome, Autism, Schizophrenia, and Disability in the form of multiple severe disabilities) and really think that they are a must-read for anyone and everyone. I didn't think that I would be able to get into the chapters on prodigies, rape, crime or transgender but in the end these too were fascinating. The author frequently interjects with his own thoughts and experiences from the perspective of someone who himself was ""far from the tree"" and as the perspective of an author who spent a decade researching his work. This personal narrative keeps the book fresh and relatable. At the same time, on several occasions the author goes too far, in my opinion, in describing his personal history. On these occasions it really felt like he just had to get some things off of his chest, even though they were intensely private and really superfluous to the work as a whole. But back to the meat of the book. The differences between different types of disabilities and the different challenges faced therein are fascinating. People who are deaf are otherwise no different than anyone else, and yet they are treated as stupid and frequently are not even given the dignity of having their own family members learn their language. People with Down syndrome have always been sold short of their abilities - and this is a truth that remains to this day. Most everyone in this book is grossly misunderstood, especially by those who are not themselves affected by disability. I am sure that many people would assume that a physical disability would be preferable to a mental disability. In fact, my husband said the same to me when we were in the process of trying to find a diagnosis for our daughter. At the time I was frustrated by the comment, because we aren't given the luxury of choosing our disabilities. I really appreciated this survey of disabilities because it demonstrated that there are benefits to be found in most any situation. Likewise, it's next to impossible to appreciate the challenges faced by someone else unless you try to live it with them. I thought of my husband's comment as I read the chapter on dwarfs: while there was an account or two of dwarfs who had mild learning disabilities, in general they have normal IQs. However their physical disability isn't just being shorter than the general population; they are often in frequent pain and they can face a host of health issues. If we were in a position to choose, is a slightly higher IQ really worth constant physical pain? I don't think anything is so clear-cut. I found it fascinating that families affected by schizophrenia would be thrilled if their family member could hold down a job at the grocery store and could live even semi-independently, yet that's usually not considered enough for families recently affected by Down syndrome. It is interesting how disability strikes us at the root and has the power to change us for the better, if we let it.The chapter on Disability (which covered multiple severe disabilities) was difficult to read and gave me a few anxiety attacks as I was transported back to the time when we didn't know what was going on with my daughter. After reading of so many inspiring, super-human families who dealt with disability it was difficult to transition into a chapter on prodigies. In light of the incredible strength and gusto presented in the disability chapters, reading about prodigies was just... boring. We all want to have a child who is a prodigy and all things equal we would prefer a healthy child without disabilities. Yet real prodigies come off as one-dimensional workaholics with various emotional complexes. Again, nothing is so clear-cut. The Rape chapter was the most difficult to read and I admittedly skimmed through portions of it. I definitely experienced an expansion on my view of rape-induced pregnancy.The chapter on Crime included a good mix of stories. Most interesting was the account of the Klebold family (Dylan Klebold was one of the Columbine shooters) that really demonstrated that anything can happen to any family.If you're interested in broadening your horizons and understanding other people who are far different from yourself, then this book is your ticket."
101,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2489535-mick,4,"This book was truly fascinating, and I enjoyed both the writing style and the mix of individual narratives and research. A few chapters were really challenging and heartbreaking, particularly those about ASD and schizophrenia. However, it is a book that restores faith in humanity and brings hope.I will say, however, that this book made me feel kind of lonely by the end. Each tale relied on the bond, the instant love, that happens when one produces children biologically. This bond was the silent star of every story, and as a foster mother who has seen both the power of that bond and the damage it can do, and who has never and will experience it with her own children, I closed the last chapter feeling quite down about it all. Adoption is yet another horizontal identity, actually multiple horizontal identities that compound one another, and it would have been interesting to see if the lack of shared biology would change the tone of the narrative (especially if foster and adoptive parents meet their children when they are already out of infancy and are well aware of the lack of biological connection)."
102,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/801479-jgrace,5,"Far From the Tree – Andrew Solomon 5 starsI’m convinced that this is the most important book that I will review this year. I hope I can do it justice. That familiar old adage, ‘The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree’, turns up usually when a child demonstrates the same undesirable tendencies as the parent. Sometimes it might be used as a compliment if a child shares a notable talent with an ancestor. But what if the apple falls far away from the tree? What if the parent tree is an apple and the child is an orange? Andrew Solomon’s massive book examines ten different populations in which the child’s identity differs widely from the family. He considers the needs of the child to establish a personal, ‘horizontal’ identity associated with his difference, within the context of the ‘vertical’ identity of the family. He also considers, with great compassion, the needs of parents who raise such a child. In the first chapter, Soloman speaks of his own experience as a dyslexic, gay child of straight parents. The final chapter, Father, reflects his personal experiences in becoming a parent. The other chapters are titled: Deaf, Dwarf, Down Syndrome, Autism, Schizophrenia, Disability, Prodigies, Rape, Crime, and Transgender. This is a heavily researched book. There are over 150 pages of footnotes and references. But if it is a textbook, it is the most readable textbook I’ve ever held in my hands. Soloman interviewed, and frequently lived with, hundreds of participants, but at no point does this book become a tabloid ‘tell-it-all’. Even in the chapters which draw primarily and intimately on his own experience, he uses each anecdote to illustrate major issues in the development of identity and the treatment of those who differ from ‘us’. Each chapter is comprehensive in providing historical context, current research and public policy issues. Where controversy exists, he has a clearly defined liberal bias, but takes pains to show all sides of an issue. Solomon’s personal comparison between dyslexia, for which intervention is desirable, and homosexuality, as an identity that he embraces, becomes a major theme for discussion throughout the book. What must the hearing parents of a deaf child consider before giving their child a cochlear implant? If your child is a dwarf, should you inflict the pain of limb lengthening surgery for her future benefit? Is genetic testing leading us to ‘laissez-faire’ eugenics? The questions are fascinating. The answers are complex. I don’t own a copy of this book yet. I’m waiting for the paperback (or a decrease in the kindle price). I checked the book out four times from two different library systems before I was able to finish it. At nearly 1000 pages, it is not a book to read at one sitting. It is not difficult to understand. Soloman’s writing is clear and direct. I found myself rereading because I needed more time to digest the depth of his analysis. I had to resist the urge to underline sentence after sentence that expressed an important fact or a profound truth. Despite dyslexia, this man knows how to write.  “Ability is the tyranny of the majority. If most people could flap their arms and fly, the inability to do so would be a disability.”“Loving our children is an exercise of the imagination.”“Though many of us take pride in how different we are from our parents, we are endlessly sad at how different our children are from us”“While accommodating people with physical disabilities must be undertaken out of moral conviction, adequately treating people with severe psychiatric illness is a win-win situation; if moral conviction fails, economic self-interest should prevail.”“Perhaps the immutable error of parenthood is that we give our children what we wanted, whether they wanted it or not.” There is a definite investment of time required to read this book. Certainly, if you or a family member belongs to one of the target groups, you will find something of interest in the relevant chapter. Teachers, social workers, health professionals; of course, this is an important book for anyone working in those fields. Do you vote? Are you a parent? Do you have parents? Solomon has a lot to say to all of us. He’s given me a lot to think about."

Solomon starts the book by discussing his own experience as a child who is slowly realizing that he is gay (although he does not completely come out of the closet til later in life), and also by alluding to his previous book, ""The Noonday Demon"". The significance of this is that Solomon himself has 2 of the so-called ""undesired"" identity markers: depression and homosexuality. From here, he describes the concept of ""horizontal"" vs ""vertical"" identity. ""Vertical identity"" is, quite simply, the part of your identity that you family can readily accept because it is part of the identity. If you are Catholic because you were raised Catholic, for example, that would be a vertical identity. A ""horizontal identity"" is when you have to go outside your family and seek validation from your peers in instances when your immediate family is unsupportive. While some of the identities Solomon describes in this book can be characterized as potentially either horizontal or vertical (ie, since one's parents could be deaf), overall he is interested in how parents cope with horizontal identities in their children, and with how children react to this coping. What surprised me is the depth and degree of identity movements that I was completely unaware of. We learn that there's a portion of the deaf community that believes cochlear implants threaten the existence of a uniquely deaf culture; we learn that people with schizophrenia and other forms of mental illness have formed groups that advocate for the various manifestations of mental illness as a form of diversity or difference. Solomon renders their struggles to gain recognition for these diversity movements with compassion, but also makes firm, qualitative value judgments about them (perhaps because of his own intense struggles with mental illness, a mental illness community that even implies advocacy for leaving something untreated troubles him greatly, to the extent that he sees it to be as irresponsible as, perhaps, the parents of these troubled individuals would). The first third of the book (covering birth defects such as Down syndrome) really puts the reader closest to the day-to-day experience of what it's like to raise a child with learning disabilities (Down syndrome, autism). We learn of parents who firmly state they would not have such a child again; we learn of parents who think that their child will somehow be extraordinary in what they can learn with Down's syndrome, only to reach a certain grade where they hit a wall with classroom activities, or to reach adolscence and not be able to have relationships with their peers as they enter puberty. Overall, there's a palpable sense of being left behind for the child, and for the adults the sense that their lives have been swallowed up. Yet, in the vast majority of the cases Solomon discusses the parents do not regret having the child. The same cannot be said for the children of rape, or for the transgendered; many vignettes in the book talk about the adversarial child/parent relationships that lead these children to run away from home at ages that leave them vulnerable to the predatorial world, even in cases where they are actively making decisions about that world. "
104,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4758766-stacy,5,"What a beautiful piece of work! Far From the Tree explores various issues surrounding parents and children of ten marginalized sub-communities: deafness, dwarfism, Down’s syndrome, autistic, schizophrenic, severely disabled, prodigies, children of rape, criminal, and transgender. Solomon distinguishes between vertical identities that are passed from parents to children (i.e. language, ethnicity, religion) and horizontal identities where children depart from their parents into unfamiliar territory (i.e. a deaf child born to hearing parents). The culmination of a ten year project, this book is primarily anecdotal although he does include statistics and studies when they exist. The format of this book being mostly a recounting of numerous interviews was strangely effective. (Note: I listened to the audiobook, which is read by the author. I may very well be projecting here, but I sensed a sincerity in his voice as he read these accounts that was quite touching.) While listening to these tales of real people from all over the social spectrum, I kept pondering what my own reaction might be in those situations. Long after I’d stopped listening, I found myself thinking about abortion, eugenics, foster care, parents’ rights, children’s rights, limitations of the legal system, the still-in-existence of the Ku Klux Klan, economic disparity, health care, the criminal justice system, capital punishment, human resilience, and the power of hope and love. It’s a truly fantastic experience.I found Andrew Solomon to be a magnificent writer: eloquent, introspective, intelligent, and compassionate. I was extremely impressed with how he gracefully extracted such heartbreaking and inspiring stories from people and the sensitivity with which he handled them. While maintaining a journalistic honesty, he navigated some painful revelations with profound delicacy. I thought his observations and reflections were sensible, fair, and also challenging. The issues raised here are very important and very relevant. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Here are a few memorable quotes from the website:“I hate the loss of diversity in the world, even though I sometimes get a little worn-out by being that diversity. I don't wish for anyone in particular to be gay, but the idea of no one's being gay makes me miss myself already.”“Social progress is making disabling conditions easier to live with just as medical progress is eliminating them.”“All kinds of attributes make one less able. Illiteracy and poverty are disabilities, and so are stupidity, obesity, and boringness. Extreme age and extreme youth are both disabilities. Faith is a disability insofar as it constrains you from self-interest; atheism is a disability inasmuch as it shields you from hope. One might see power as a disability, too, for the isolation in which it imprisons those who wield it.”“Rumi said that the light enters you at the bandaged place. Most of the families I met ended up grateful for experiences they would have done anything to avoid.”“In the Torah, they describe building this huge tabernacle out in the wilderness with two angels facing each other, because that is where God exists, between people. The day Adam was born, my life became purposeful, and it has kept purpose ever since. God exists between us. I knew that soon after he was born, but Judaism gave me a vocabulary for it."" —Susan Arnsten"

One review said that the first chapter is required reading, and I do hope that the book's length won't prevent people from at least reading the first and last chapters along with whichever middle chapters most interest them. I highly recommend it.In the context of reading parenting advice books, and researching specific disabilities, and then reading _Columbine_ and trying to imagine what the killers' parents felt like, I was really yearning for a ""big picture"" book that would dwell on what it means to be a parent at all, especially to someone who is different from you (or perhaps different from anyone you know). I think I'm more humane after this book. I think I value diversity in a new way, and that I see human imperfection in a new way. ""I think all love is one-third projection and one-third acceptance and never more than one-third knowledge and insight."" This book helped me see the value of even imperfect parental love, what's at stake. Love is necessary but never a given. Parental ambivalence can be very natural, or unavoidable. Every child is different, and some have very specific unusual needs, and there is no guarantee that any parent will have the resources to provide them. There is something powerfully human about what drives some parents to try to accept our children's individuality and give them what they need. Sometimes the costs are overwhelming, and there is no guarantee that ""God never gives us more than we can handle,"" as one parent in the book says. There are enough other stories in the book to break our hearts. But whatever parents are able to do, without sacrificing other priorities (like siblings, like sanity, like the parents' own health and well-being), is so vitally important.One of my children was diagnosed with something that seems very minor compared to the chapters in this book. Especially before I knew what was going on, I encountered some worst-case-scenario fears. I don't think worst-case scenarios could be more beautifully and profoundly explored than they are in this book. Some of them don't look so worst-case anymore, and the breadth of the stories is enough to give any family some blessings to count.""Most of us believe that our children are the children we had to have; we could have had no others. They will never seem to us to be happenstance; we love them because they are our destiny. Even when they are flawed, do wrong, hurt us, die--even then, they are part of the rightness by which we measure life itself, and they bring us to life as profoundly as we do them.""""Most of the parents I interviewed for this book said they would never want other children than the ones they had, which at first seemed surprising given the challenges their children embody. But why does any of us prefer our own children, all of them defective in some regard, to others real or imagined? If some glorious angel descended into my living room and offered to exchange my children for other, better children--brighter, kinder, funnier, more loving, more disciplined, more accomplished--I would clutch the ones I have and, like most parents, pray away the atrocious specter."""
106,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1449138-scott,5,"Andrew Solomon's last book, The Noonday Demon, was a vast, deep, and brilliant portrait of depression, in which he deftly combined memoir (Solomon suffered for years), medicine (how the malady/disease has been treated through the ages), and, I guess, sociology (how society and culture have dealt with it, across time and around the world). The Noonday Demon came out in 2001, and is one of my all-time nonfiction favorites. Solomon is super smart, thoroughly engaging, an insatiable reporter and researcher, self-deprecating (and even, at times, quite funny), and has an enormous heart. Highly recommend. All of which is to explain how excited I was about this, his most recent book, a dozen years in the making, Far From the Tree. And, really? Even with sky-high expectations, all of the above apply here as well. I loved reading this, all 700-plus dense pages. In Far From the Tree Solomon explores... well, he explores a million things. But the core theme is the ways in which parents react when they have children who are different from themselves, and/or different from their hopes, fantasies, assumptions. Solomon breaks the book into disabilities / challenges / the horizontal communities into which these children are born (as opposed to their ""vertical communities"", which would be, for example, if two white parents have a white kid; or two orthodox jews an orthodox jew kid, etc.). So there's a chapter on the deaf, and one on dwarves. He spends time with autistic children, and schizophrenics, and kids with downs syndrome, and those with ""multiple severe disabilities."" He has a chapter on prodigies (mostly musical), transgenders, and children born of rape, and kids who become criminals. It's all fascinating stuff, usually quite gripping, and, because he gets at each community through the stories of the people who live within them--Solomon spent 10 years interviewing 300 families--Far From the Tree can be harrowing, inspiring, profoundly moving. But this isn't just a collection of up-close-and-personal profiles, as interesting as they often are. As in the Noonday Demon, Solomon uses this foundation to launch into countless trajectories on the science and medicine behind each ""issue"", and its cultural history, and, overall, what it all means for how we define a family, a community, humankind as a whole, an individual person. Best of all, Solomon isn't afraid to interject his own feelings, opinions, and personal stories into the narrative. We hear from him throughout, but most of all in the book's opening and closing chapters, the first in which he discusses his own experience as an ""exceptional"" child, born gay into a straight (and, it turns out, initially intolerant) family; and the last which ends Far Fron the Tree on an extraordinary note, the story of his own decision to have a child with his husband, via a surrogate mother whom they knew, and so were present every step of the way, including, of course, in the birthing room. Amazing stuff, all of it. "
107,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5589466-frank-spencer,5," This book is excellent for many reasons. Several characteristics which make people different from the norm are each given a chapter. In each chapter, the stories of many families are told. The author interacted with most of the families (there must be at least a few people mentioned with whom he did not have personal interaction). The focus is on how the children and parents influenced each other. How helping professionals contributed (or didn't) is also part of the picture. In the chapter on Crime, the situation of Dylan Klebold's mother is presented; it has gotten a fair amount of press. The author doesn't leave out any details about the brutality of war, crime, and the way in which people are often treated by each other and by mother nature. Besides individuals who commit crimes, there are chapters on Autism, Dwarfism, severe hearing loss, Schizophrenia, and others. Whether and to what extent horizontal identities can be forged, providing support from others with the same issues, is an important idea. Then, Andrew Solomon's description of his own families (the one he grew up in and the one he has now)is really interesting and moving. The book ends with the description of a communication from William Dean Howells to Edith Wharton; don't miss that. I'll include here, however, a passage about how Goethe's mother interacted with him, from the chapter named Prodigies.  ""Goethe's mother described telling stories to him: ""Air, fire, water and earth I presented to him as beautiful princesses, and everything in all nature took on a deeper meaning. We invented roads between stars, and what great minds we would encounter. He devoured me with his eyes; and if the fate of one of his favorites did not go as he wished, this I could see from the anger in his face, or his efforts not to break out in tears. Occasionally, he interfered by saying, 'Mother, the princess will not marry the miserable tailor, even if he slays the giant,' at which I stopped and postponed the catastrophe until the next evening. So my imagination was often replaced by his; and when the following morning I arranged fate according to his suggestions and said, 'You guessed it, that's how it came out.' he was all excited, and one could see his heart beating."""" ""That one phrase, ""my imagination was often replaced by his,"" bespeaks all that is most beautiful in the parenting of a remarkable child. In so replacing one's own imagination, one facilitates the growth of the child's. For the parents of prodigies, such wise self-effacement may exact a high price, but those who can set their own path by the light of their child's brilliance may find great solace in the ways that child remakes the world.""  I think that the principle is the same when parents are relating to children who have other characteristics, ones which are not usually seen as positive in the way that being gifted is seen."

Andrew Solomon spends 702 pages investigating the circumstances of extraordinary families across the globe, and I regarded each consecutive story with increasing awe. It's a staggering journalistic achievement.Solomon explores what he calls ""horizontal identities,"" or identities acquired by children with drastically different traits than their parents. Each chapter is devoted to profiling families and the challenges they cope with on a daily basis, from Down Syndrome and Schizophrenia, to Autism and Deafness, as well as detailing their scientific, political, and cultural peculiarities, One particularly engrossing chapter illuminates the lives of child prodigies, and the lengths to which their parents go to help them realize their sometime voracious intellect and skill. Another explores the lives of criminal minors, and the situations that bring about and perpetuate underage crime here in the United States. The penultimate, and perhaps most moving chapter focuses on transgender and gender-questioning children, and their quests for identity in a world full of unfair and abominable judgement. Some stories are deeply disturbing and heartbreaking, like in the chapter that explores the lives of children conceived through rape, and what effect their conception has on the way their mothers approach their care. Parents of autistic children explain the sometimes insurmountable difficulties of navigating their children's behavioral idiosyncrasies; families with schizophrenic children tell of their daily struggles with sudden onset paranoia, violence, and fear. Their stories are told with heartbreaking clarity, but overpowering the somberness and tragedy that pockmarks each chapter is the shining and remarkable love with which many of these parents embellish their children. Indeed, this is the central focus of the book. More often than not, families professed that they would never wish for their children to be ""normal,"" having grown and fostered a powerful love through their countless trials and tribulations. Love, Solomon realizes, is the great leveler, cutting through socioeconomic disparities and societal norms to bridge the often disparaging gap between these parents and their children; ""My journeys toward a famlly and this book,"" he states, ""have taught me that love is a magnifying phenomenon--that every increase in love strengthens all the other love in the world...""In the end, this book will deepen and broaden your humanity. It is unwavering in its honesty and sincerity, and I know that I finished it with a greater sense of compassion for those whose experiences I never truly understood, and a more concrete understanding of the power that love has to crash through prejudice, uncertainty, and fear. Don't let the page count deter you--it'll be perhaps the most important book you'll ever read."

Beginning with his own experience as a gay child with straight parents, he set out to find out how parents of children with very different conditions manage. He calls this a horizontal line, that is, people are the same racial makeup as their parents, but in other ways are a total surprise and sometimes burden to their families. While the saying goes: “the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree”, in the case of these children, the apple falls in a different world! He deals with deaf children and parents, both from the oral language communication concept and the sign language concept, along with auditory implants. He discusses children born as dwarfs, children who are born with Downs Syndrome, children who are autistic, children who in teenage years become schizophrenic, children who are prodigies and their problems, children from other cultures born with HIV from parents who are HIV positive and with no possible escape or medication, children of rape, children who become criminals, and children who know early on that they are born into the wrong sex. He follows many families for a long period of time watching the family dynamic develop and change. One of the most moving stories was of the woman who adopted three boys with behavior problems-all three because social services were going to separate them-and the youngest one turned out to be in a boy’s body with a girl’s feelings, in other words a transgender child. She supported this child’s right to dress and behave as a girl. The results were frightening. A formerly friendly town with good neighbors became a town where the family was threatened with murder. The family had to move away, and she cannot go back even to see her family. It was frightening to see the huge difference that occurred in a short period of time in how that family was treated. He ended the book by telling of his decision with his gay partner, to have a child, which he has done. This book brings out a lot of different feelings in me. I have a disability, I am blind, and I am also a lesbian. Many things in this book rang true for me, and I got some new insights as well. Andrew Solomon narrated his book very sensitively, but did read too slowly for my taste. Also, I felt that the chapter dealing with children and parents in Africe and and Sarayevo was a little too far removed. They belonged in another book, I felt. Those experiences, while moving, were too far removed from the family experiences in the rest of the book. It is probably one of the best nonfiction books I’ve read in the last couple of years and it will stay with me for quite a while. "

It challenged a lot of my prejudices, it taught me a lot about lives that I had never stopped to wonder about, and it really drove home that cornerstone of all empathy: the universality of human experience.Aside from the overarching themes (horizontal identity groups, the love and personal growth that comes from challenges, identity vs. disability), each chapter really taught me new things about the independent subject matters. Sometimes it was cut and dried: x number of people in the United States are born with multiple severe disabilities; 80% of dwarfs are are born to non-dwarf parents; there is a village in Africa where 30% of the population are deaf. Sometimes it was completely unexpected: children in Iraq gain citizenship from their fathers, so the 10,000 children born of rape since the U.S. invasion have no citizenship. The 10,000 Iraqi children born of rape since the U.S. invasion. 10,000 children born of rape since the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Jesus. There are some aspects of that conflict that they aren't covering on CNN, aren't there?Some of the chapters were really challenging, philosophically. If you could test for any of these outcomes in utero and chose to terminate, what does that say about your conception of the value of people living with MSD, schizophrenia, severe autism? If cochlear implants are less useful the longer you wait to have the surgery, is it child abuse or loving parenthood to implant your deaf toddler? Are you correcting a disability or erasing and devaluing a worthwhile identity? Can you be doing both? The rape chapter fit the book better than I had expected it to, but the crime chapter was a reach, IMO. I knew the most about transgender going in but probably learned the most about autism. The chapter on prodigies was eye-opening, particularly toward the end where he talks about how more and more children are being trained for a career that has less and less value and a smaller and smaller audience. It's heartbreaking, and it kind of made me think of Dance Moms. If your kid has rhythm and you push them to train and compete, are you a tasteless fame-chasing cultural bottom feeder, or are you Mozart's mom for the 21st century? Unclear.Anyway, I think you should read this book. Yes, you. I was going to pull a long quote from the final chapter that really summed up the themes and paste it into my review, but every time I thought, this really gets to the heart of it!, the next paragraph would be even better, and eventually I realized that the reason the conclusion was so well-done that I couldn't find just one pull quote was because the entire book was that good.

The subtitle is ""Parents, Children, and the Search for Identity"", but that is only a slight sliver of what he covers in this book, which he has been writing for over a decade.I think the impetus to write the book was his relationship with his parents and his search for identity. In the first chapter he divulges that he has a personal history of depression, and that he is gay. His parents were very unhappy to learn that their son was gay. So unhappy that it made him wonder if there was a genetic test for gayness and they had gotten that information that he might have been aborted in utero. He was getting in touch with what it might be like to be an unlikable child. On top of that, he considered the challenges of raising a child that was different from yourself in a significant way. Every couple has one member who is a different gender from their child--in my case all of my children are a different gender. But that wasn't the sort of difference that interested him--he was looking at more unusual differences, things that wouldn't appear frequently that parents had to cope with. He did extensive interviews with families of children with 6 different medical conditions--deafness, dwarfism, Down's syndrome children, autism, schizophrenia, and then children with multiple and severe disabilities rendering them unable to care for themselves in a serious way. These chapters deal with issues about love, connectedness, making decisions about child rearing and transitioning children into independent lives. He asks them questions like what have you learned, what have you gained and what have you lost, and would you do it over again if you had a choice. Very disturbingly, there were parents of autistic children who had murdered their children, feeling like it was their only option--the desperation is palpable in some stories, and the wells of resiliency are equally compelling in other stories.The next four chapters deal with issues that are different--one of them is transgendered children, which the author has an intense interest in. One is based on raising a child prodigy, which comes across as being just as challenging as raising a child with a disability and in some ways less rewarding, because so many of the children end up being estranged from their parents. The other two chapters are on children born of rape, and children who become criminals. There is a lot of emotion in this book, but the stories are compelling, well told, thought provoking, and you do not walk away from this book unscathed. You look at yourself, your parenting, and the results of that parenting in a different light as a result."
113,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4017921-mckenzie,4,"In Far From the Tree, Andrew Solomon explores myriad ways in which children can differ from the expectations their parents initially had of them: they can have a disability or condition, such as deafness, dwarfism, autism, or schizophrenia; they can be gifted prodigies; they can commit crimes, ranging from petty to murderous; they can be conceived in rape; they can be transgender or gay. Solomon spent a decade interviewing families living with these various existences, to understand how parents learn to adapt to their child, the kind of world their child's horizontal identity (differing from their families and more similar to other non-related people with the same experience or condition) exposes them to, and what kind of love they develop for their child through the hardships they face.The first chapter of this book is astonishingly insightful, and I would urge anyone who could not commit to the entire book to just read that one chapter to learn about Solomon's work. The questions he asks about how any of us develop an identity separate from our parents, how our parents cope with that identity, and how we learn to love each other anyway, are important for anyone who is a child or parent to consider. This book, and that chapter in particular, made me entirely rethink how I might react to finding out my hypothetical future child could be born with a condition that most people would assume should be aborted to make life easier for both the child and the parents. People living with conditions that are routinely aborted argue that this form of eugenics devalues the lives they are able to lead, since the majority view them as lesser and not worth the pain that we imagine they experience. After the first chapter, Solomon explores the identities listed above, including hundreds of stories from families he met. Oftentimes the experiences and viewpoints of the families contradict each other; some parents of autistic children say they love their child and would not have their life any other way, while others say if they could go back in time and abort, they would. Some deaf children raised with cochlear implants are perfectly happy; others raised with sign cannot imagine taking away their unique language and culture. While every family deals with their unique difficulties differently, all express to Solomon a boundless love for their children, and an appreciation for how their struggles have enriched their lives. The only reason I knocked one star off this amazing achievement is that it perhaps goes on too long; ten years of interviews makes for a long book, and eventually each chapter starts to wear thin. However, I still absolutely recommend Far From the Tree, and know that it will continue to impact me as I move forward in my life. "
114,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9247560-dw,3,"The first thing that sticks out to me about this book is how much it needs an editor. There were lots of places, particularly in the first and last chapters, where the writing simply wasn't clear and I had to re-read several sentences to deduce the meaning. In some cases, like the passage about the author's high school teachers, the meaning never became clear. The book contains many direct quotes in which people switch pronouns and tenses. This is common in speech, but I'm used to the New York Times pre-digesting quotes for me and fixing the tenses. I suppose it is a stylistic choice to leave the direct quotes untouched, but the choice made the book harder to follow.The author often jumped from one idea to another without a suitable transition. Several parts of the book felt like the author was writing to somebody to whom he had already expressed his ideas, so he felt that he didn't need to lead the reader by the hand. I suppose, looking at the author's pedigree (English degrees at Yale and Cambridge) and accolades, he was trying to be poetic and that most of the rest of the world likes how he writes, but I was not impressed. My taste is for the clear and direct, like Popular Science articles.That aside, this book is an impressive tour de force. It almost felt like reading ten separate books, with a nod to a few common themes in each section (mainly identity vs disability) and bookends of the first and last chapters. I was impressed at the empathy the author showed for all his subjects, and the sheer amount of research that he must have done to become intimately familiar enough with each topic to write this book. (Though I did think that part of the section on dwarfism sounded like it had been lifted directly from an informational pamphlet for parents. It wasn't relevant to the book that babies with dwarfism need to have their heads supported when they sit up.) The only condition on which I question his expertise is in fact his own, homosexuality. His first chapter in particular seems to conflate ""acting feminine"" with ""being gay."" I understand those to be two independent things, even if he personally embodies both.I downrated a previous book because I had read passages from it in the New York Times. From this book, I recognized the section on prodigies from The New Yorker and (I think) part of the section on the deaf from the New York Times. The reuse of material didn't bother me quite as much as in the other book, because Far from the Tree had so much other material as well. But is this reprinting something I should expect? It doesn't seem quite fair, particularly when entire passages are word-for-word.All in all, a book worth reading that gave me a lot to think about."

116,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4057623-ryandake,5,"i picked up this book (with both hands, it's quite a wristbreaker) because i had read Solomon's Big Book of Depression (The Noonday Demon: An Atlas of Depression) and found its erudition, scope, and sheer humanity quite compelling. i read The Noonday Demon also because i have suffered from depression, and so it was very germane to my own life.Far From the Tree is not, fortunately, quite so germane to my life. this book examines the lives of parents whose children are abnormal in one way or another: through deafness, autism, dwarfism, a tendency to crime, schizophrenia, and so on. so while my own son is so far quite enjoyably weird, he is in most respects normal, as that is understood in contemporary society.a book on this subject could easily have been a carnival freak show, at one end of the scale, or one of those saccharine encomiums to Love (Parental) At All Costs at the other. fortunately Solomon is far, far too skilled, too discerning, and too searching to settle for any easy answers. he interviewed hundreds of families over years to write this book, and the depth of his research, along with the depth of his compassion, make for some agonizing, rapturous, and quite mind-opening reading.the NYT wrote a very good review of it here; i don't think i can say it better.but i will add that while i found this book a very emotionally difficult read in some respects, i also found it to be an entirely rewarding one. Solomon consistently asks the really hard questions about what makes a human, what makes a human normal, how a human is valued or devalued by society, what is gained and lost by society in crushing its odder offshoots. and Solomon not only asks the questions, but answers them in unexpected ways. one can't help but approach a nonfiction book these days with some trepidation about its agenda, 'cause there are so few books that begin with genuine exploration that leads to some conclusions, rather than some conclusions that seek their carefully selected supporting evidence. so much nonfiction is just more of the braindead megaphone. ""wisdom"" is one of those words that's been co-opted by the greeting card and chicken-soup book industries; i can't use it without feeling slightly woozy. but what you cannot miss noticing in this book is a great deal of exploration, of turning a question to all of its facets, and the honest attempt to answer those questions. in the end, what you find is wisdom."

It's supposed to be about children who are different from their parents in some fundamental way (Down syndrome, deafness, schizophrenia and so on) ... but I think everyone should read it, literally just everyone. Even if you are not a parent, or even if you are a parent but have perfectly typical kids with none of these tremendous issues ... these issues will still touch you someday, in some way, as you move through the world. I learned so much.What is really amazing is that the author has written an absolutely huge, incredibly detailed, totally non-fiction book ... that I could not put down. I don't know how anyone could write something that big on subjects that complex and capture the reader's attention so fully. I did read a chapter here and a chapter there, with some fiction books in between, but I never once considered not finishing this book. Most of the time, it felt like a page-turner ... which seems unbelievable when you consider the subject matter. What a testament to the skill of this author. I am in awe of him.I also learned a lot about myself reading this book. I started out feeling weird about it, almost voyeuristic -- here I was with two very typical, healthy kids, reading these ""horror stories"" of things that just went terribly, terribly wrong with other people's children -- I felt overwhelmingly glad not to be those people, and thankful that I was done having kids because I could not imagine reading those stories with a pregnancy ahead of me, knowing about all those outcomes ... but then as I read the anecdotes and learned more about the different disorders ... I felt more empathy, and more understanding ... and less fear. I always thought it was bizarre when people would say they wouldn't change their child's disability or condition if they could -- what?! how could they NOT? -- but chapter by chapter, the book chipped away at my preconceived notions ... hard to explain but somehow, even though this book helped me understand more than ever how severe disabilities in a child can exhaust a family's resources in every way possible, it also made me understand for the first time how much the disability is part of the child, and how it shapes the whole family, and lots of people wouldn't change that for anything. And that it's not the end of the world. It's really not.Every day when I pick up a magazine or the newspaper or talk to a friend, something reminds me of a chapter or an anecdote from this book. Thank you, Andrew Solomon, for writing this book."

Don't be intimidated by its length, the brilliant structure of this book makes it easy to read chapter by chapter, while still achieving a cohesiveness at the end. This book makes you reexamine your opinions about diversity and disability. How much of a disability caused by its direct physical and mental effects, and how much is caused by society's negative reaction? Does genetic screening imply that a life with a disability is not worth living? From page 29: ""Ruth Hubbard... maintains that expectant parents who test for Huntington's because they have a family history of the disease are in a quandary: 'If they decide on an abortion, they are as much as saying that a life lived in the knowledge that one will eventually die of Huntington's disease is not worth living. What does that say about their own life and the lives of their family members who now know that they have the gene for Huntington's disease?'""Is it selfish, as a mother, to terminate a pregnancy because the child will be born disabled?

Does it have any silver linings? Lots of people think suffering makes you a better person, but maybe these people are just struggling to find some sort of purpose to their suffering?Other thoughts:- Is Andrew Solomon's favorite word ""ameliorate""?

121,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/583557-sue,3,"I found this very thick book to be partly excellent and partly irritating.To begin, it’s much too long. Too many case histories, too much detail, too much repetition. The book would’ve been more effective if the 700 pages of text (not counting the additional 250 pages of notes!) had been cut to, say, 300.The author’s whole horizontal-vertical concept is interesting. This is the idea that unlike in “normal” families, where there’s a vertical sense of transmission, these families have children who are so different (“far from the tree”) that they actually belong to a horizontal community of other people like them. This idea makes sense for deaf children and dwarf children (the first two situations he examines). Deaf people and dwarfs have support groups, national organizations, &c. It may arguably apply to transgender children and prodigies. But I see no evidence it applies to the other situations, such as autistic children, children with birth defects, especially severe ones, schizophrenic children, criminal children. Or for the children of rape.On the subject of vaccines & autism – the author does mention Wakefield's stuff being retracted but doesn't make clear that it was FRAUD pure & simple - then devotes many pages to anti-vaccine people, which could possibly leave impression that this is a legititimate scientific discussion.On the subject of elective abortion (where abortion is relevant & possible) -. It’s good that he comes down so clearly on the need for abortion to be available & for women to have the choice.. But he (inadvertently) gives a skewed impression, in that naturally he mostly interviews only the women who kept their babies, not those who terminated. (They would be hard to find.)Overall, I feel the actual theme of this book was not the vertical-horizontal idea, or the ""search for identity"" in the book's subtitle. The actual theme is what an unbelievable burden some of these conditions place on parents, particularly on mothers. And society provides relatively little support. Parents with a severely handicapped child (may) get some help from various agencies, but the real burden falls on them. Some of the parents he interviewed say that as tough as it’s been, they wouldn’t have missed the experience for anything. Others describe honestly how their marriages failed, how they’re always exhausted, &c. I found THIS theme moving."
122,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2726439-scooping-it-up,4,"A dense but fantastic and fascinating read. The author, through research and extensive interviews over many years, allows readers into the lives of parents who raise children with what many folks would consider disabilities. It covers dwarfism, deafness, autism, Downs Syndrome, transgendered children, schizophrenia, prodigies, criminals and more. How do families handle it when their children turn out to have special needs that are often life-long life changing? What is society's role in helping families, do communities, doctors make things worse or better? What is a disability and what is actually just another, legitimate way to be? The book seeks to shed light on these questions and the most poignant moments were in the words of the families who were willing to be interviewed for the book.I found the section on children born of rape the most ill-fitting in the book, it seemed like it was a subject the author cared about and certainly one worth writing about but didn't really work. It needed its own book I think.As an adoptive parent who has children whose past trauma manifests in ongoing special needs that most closely resembled the chapter on children with Autism, I actually felt the author missed a cool opportunity to write about the ultimate ""apple falling far from the tree"" which is when apples actually come from different trees. He could have talked about trauma that comes from separation from birth families, the identity and culture of adult adoptees, the sad history of closed adoptions and adoptee rights in the US, the terrible trauma of international adoption and how these children also often require the kind of therapy so many of the children discussed in the book do. But he never got there. I think that could have made the book even more special and significant. But I am biased. As an adoptive mom, I felt the whole book was dancing around an elephant in the room, adoption, and he totally missed it.A wonderful read, I feel better and more compassionate and knowledgeable having read it, though I didn't really connect to the author when he wrote about his own experiences in the beginning and the end. His voice wasn't one that moved me, though all his interviewees certainly did. I highly recommend."

The book is by turn uplifting and sad, poignant and hopeful. From the perspectives of various people, Mr. Solomon explores the culture of the deaf, dwarfs, Down Syndrome, autism, schizophrenia, disability, prodigies, victims of rape, crime, the transgendered, and fathers. He explores the lives of real people who have to deal with these situations and examines what their lives are like, what the medical community has to offer, and how our culture deals with their situation.The book gets its name from the fact that many parents have children that 'fall far from the tree'. They are often unprepared to deal with the differences in their children and are puzzled by how this could have happened to them.Mr. Solomon has wonderful insight into the people he talks about and makes this book very readable and understandable. I especially enjoyed his discussion of deafness and the pull of the deaf community. This strong community is against providing hearing to those who might choose surgery to become hearing individuals. The deaf community, a strong advocacy group, treasures its cohesiveness and pulls away from hearing people.He has a wonderful knowledge of all the types of diseases and syndromes he explores and and has done his research well. He has chosen families that have interesting stories to tell and he has interviewed them widely. I know a lot about schizophrenia and Mr. Solomon has done a wonderful job with this chapter. I also have counseled many transgendered individuals and Mr. Solomon, again, has a close affinity to this population and provides a fair and considerate discussion.I loved Noonday Demon and wondered if Mr. Solomon could come up to his previous work which won many accolades. He has not only come up to it but in some ways even surpassed it. Far From the Tree is an amazing book and one that everyone would benefit from reading. It is long but well worth the time spent to read it. I highly recommend it."

I don't think I ever would have read this without my Kindle and an ebook copy. I basically read a little every night before bed and any other time I had downtime, I don't think I could have finished it if I had to carry around a 900 page book (700 pages of text, 250 of notes/bibliography). This is also a though-provoking, well researched and beautifully written book about a complex subject. If you had the misfortune of talking to me while reading this book, I probably mentioned it in conversation extensively. Everything kept coming back around to this book. I want to make everyone read it and then have long conversations about the nature of identity, of love and culture. There's such a balance in here of personal stories and science. It seems weird to say that every night I looked forward to reading about people with impossible seeming problems and how they chose to deal with them, but I did. ""If you banish the dragons, you banish the heroes--and we become attached to the heroic strain in our personal history. We choose our own lives. It is not simply that we decide on the behaviors that construct our experience; when given our druthers, we elect to be ourselves.

But we retain the startling evolutionary imperative for the fact of ourselves, and with that splinter of grandiosity we redeem our flaws. These parents have, by and large, chosen to love their children, and many of them have chosen to value their own lives, even though they carry what much of the world considers an intolerable burden.

While I believe I was certainly more sensitive to things because my wife and I are expecting this fall, I think parents should read this BEFORE they get pregnant. This is a book about parents, children, and identity as researched and experienced by the author through his own personal history and by integrating himself writhing very specific communities that identity as different, many that today's culture label disabilities: deaf, dwarf, Down syndrome, autism, schizophrenia; and difficulties: children born of rapes, children that become criminals, transgender, and musical prodigies (that last one just to lighten the really dark mood, showing it's not always ideal on the flip side either).And when I say deep dives into research and first hand interviews with case studies, I mean deep - it would take me a whole day to get through the introduction about horizontal/vertical identities and the language of disability. So I lived a few weeks in different difficult intense families dealing with the unwanted and unexpected hurdles life have thrown them in a child as well as how it's shaped all their lives. There's much debate about acceptance/cure, disability/community, intervention/education, and whether you test for the warning signs during a pregnancy and abort or stay the course and prepare. These are heavy subjects that the author approaches very carefully and with empathy, often trying to illuminate both sides with insight and understanding. You will be a better person for reading this book. I will never so casually overlook another's experience and I will be more sensitive to how I think of and interact with those affected by the 'non typical' parenting experience. In the end, everyone want to love and everyone deserves that love - no one is perfect, we just all have to help each other try.

An anecdote-heavy survey of a wide range of conditions from deafness and dwarfism to schizophrenia and genius, this book tells the frequently heartbreaking story of families struggling to make sense of these differences.Solomon (Yale '85) devotes considerable focus to the tension between identity and illness. It's a fascinating and ambiguous conflict - and one particularly relevant to our society's current obsession with identity politics. I've always been a believer in the Western quest for the perfectibility of man, so many of the chapters in this book were especially challenging for me. The idea that one should accept limitations rather than trying to overcome them still feels wrong to me, but Solomon makes a compelling case that much harm often comes from attempts to ""fix"" these conditions.I was particularly affected by Solomon's observations on the parents of children with these conditions. While many parents claimed that they experienced profound personal growth and wouldn't have had things any other way, many others desperately admitted to thinking that killing their child might be the best outcome for all parties. There is such tragedy in all of these cases - it left me wondering what I would do in such a situation. There seem to be only hard choices.His chapters on physical conditions, mental illnesses, and musical prodigies were quite strong. His ""rape"", ""criminal"", ""transgender"", and ""father"" (about his own exceedingly unconventional reproductive strategy) chapters were less compelling. A chapter on homosexuality was absent - conspicuously so because Solomon is gay himself.Overall though, this book was not only thought-provoking but emotionally powerful as well.

He writes about families ""coping with deafness, dwarfism, Down syndrome, autism, schizophrenia, multiple severe disabilities, with children who are prodigies, who are conceived in rape, who become criminals, who are transgender.""I fell in love with Solomon's insight right from the first page. He also raises a lot of intriguing questions that I have to admit in my innocence I never asked myself. For example: is being Deaf a disability or an identity? If it were a disability, then that means we believe there is something wrong with a deaf person, that he must hear, and that we must do all we can to give every Deaf child a Cochlear implant and teach him how to speak and live in a world with sound. But if you believe it is not a disability but an identity, then wouldn't giving a child a Cochlear implant be tantamount to erasing a culture (for example, Deaf Theater) and language (for example, ASL)? Wouldn't it be, in effect, an act of genocide? The same question is asked about autism and Down syndrome: if each were an identity, then does that mean we should stop looking for a cure and instead focus on celebrating different expressions of personhood? But even stripping them of the disability label has repercussions - they will lose state support and the financial protection given to PWDs.Identity is complex. We cannot blame or praise just one factor, be it genetics, or environment, or education. How do you raise a child you give birth to but who is different from you? In the book are stories of courageous men and women, but also stories of horror (like that story of a schizophrenic who was driven out of town by his mother and sister, and shot by his sister on the side of the road).This beautifully written book was an eye-opening read for me."
128,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5919045-niamh,3,"I expected to love this book. I heard Andrew Solomon interviewed on 'Fresh Air', about his interview with the father of Adam Lanza. I felt his empathy and ability to tackle painful nuance came across so clearly on the radio. For the most part, this book is deeply empathic and Solomon discusses some of life's most painful vicissitudes with elegance and a strange but admirable hybrid psychoanalytic-lived experience-philosophical wisdom. But, conceptually, the book did not hang together for me. I think I expected the book to be about parent-child relationships, when it is perhaps more accurately about parenthood and its phenomenology. The research and reading that went into producing it, as many others have commented, result in a very impressive, intellectual end product. But I wanted more about the interviews with parents. I wanted the same level of detail and reflection as contained in his description of meeting Peter Lanza. The descriptions of families sometimes felt very 'thin', while Solomon's abstract musings, albeit wise and well-informed, pulled me out of the lived experience and left me cold, even irritated. For me, the different chapters varied in quality. The chapter on schizophrenia was the weakest. For someone so attuned to the tensions, pitfalls and high emotions of 'identity politics', Solomon seemed to have no compunction about using the word 'schizophrenic' as a noun. In relation to the autism and the schizophrenia chapters, it felt as though Solomon was so eager to share the stance he ultimately decided to take on debates concerning these conditions, that the experiences of those he interviewed and described fell out of focus. I feel quite conflicted about this book because I learned a lot (or, more accurately, was prompted to do lots of useful thinking) but was less enamoured with the whole thing than anticipated. And can't quite put my finger on why so am off to read lots of other reviews. "
129,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/673291-chris,5,"This book is a lot like a roller coaster ride -- at times unbelievably moving and at others a difficult uphill slog. Solomon writes intimately and knowingly about children that have fallen 'Far from the Tree': a chapter each is spent on deaf, dwarfs, down syndrome, autism, schizophrenia, disability, prodigies, children of rape, children that commit serious crime and transgender. At over 700 pages, it is tempting to declare oneself an expert on each of these conditions after reading each chapter although the effort at times resembles listening to a detailed and difficult college lecture. Each condition is clinically examined, treatments explored and advocacy groups explained. I can't say whether it is a good idea or bad idea for prospective parents to read this book -- you will certainly be more prepared to understand your child is inherently different from you and that this difference needs to be respected and honored. At the same time, if I were still a young parent-to-be this book could give me nightmares over what can go wrong. The stories are what ultimately make this book one of the best nonfiction books I have ever read. Solomon's personal story told in the first and last chapter provides a deeply meaningful context for why this book is important to him. The stories throughout each chapter of parents and their children are what made this book take so long to read. They demand respect by virtue of what they describe: the human condition when a parent is challenged with the unbelievable and the never-imagined. It's tempting to turn away but each story adds to the puzzle of defining what makes us human. While there are many stories of pain, loss and suffering, what I primarily took away were stories of incredible sacrifice, courage and generosity. There are many brave and loving souls in this book and I thank Solomon for writing about them. "

Solomon spends time with families affected by deafness, dwarfism, Down syndrome, autism, and schizophrenia. He also interviews people conceived by rape, parents whose children have been convicted of crimes, and parents whose children are transgender. Normally I would be leery of someone trying to come up with a grand unified theory of ""difference,"" but I was impressed at the comparisons he made.Solomon, a psychiatrist, says that we all have ""vertical identities"" (ones that people usually share with their parents and children, such as speaking Greek, being Unitarian Universalist, or being African American). All of us also have ""horizontal identities"" (ones that they usually don't share with family members, such as being gay, deaf, or schizophrenic). The horizontal identities are usually much harder to bear, not only because they can involve physical or mental difficulties but also because the person may not meet someone like him or her for years, if ever. I was impressed by how deeply Solomon immersed himself in each type of difference. He didn't just attend some Deaf conferences; he learned sign. He lived with the family of a severely disabled child for 10 days. He went to Kigali to interview women whose children were conceived in rape.Solomon had severe dyslexia and is gay, so he understands that some differences can be overcome and others are simply part of who the person is. I wouldn't want this book to be anyone's sole informational resource on any of these conditions, but this is a worthwhile read for anyone interested in humans."

This inspiring and eye opening book explores circumstances when a child turns out to be different than his or her parents anticipated, when they instead fall far from the tree. The author Andrew Solomon interviews numerous families dealing with conditions such as autism, schizophrenia, Down syndrome, prodigies, dwarfism, and others. He explores the history and progress of cultural perceptions toward these groups, and describes differences in approach between disability and identity politics. Solomon captures the beauty as well as controversies within Deaf culture, he talks about horrific circumstances that accompany crime and mental illness. Everyone raising kids runs into unexpected challenges (though rarely to the extent of those found in this book), all of our kids fall far from the tree in some regard. “Parenting is an exercise in safety, and the perpetual menace of danger is what exalts parental love above affection; without the night terrors, the spiking fevers, the litany of bruises and woes, it would be a second rate entertainment.” p 700.Solomon beautifully demonstrates that in nearly all cases of parenting, profound love ultimately rises above everything else. “Parenting had challenged these families, but almost none regretted it; they demonstrated that with enough emotional discipline and affective will, one could love anyone.” p 677.

In many ways, I discovered, they were not as inflated as realised. Solomon worked ten years on this book and it shows. The depth of research, and the discussion of many ethical issues embedded in the problems families he explores encounter, are truly impressive. The book’s structure is impeccable – rich, creative, smooth. Even though some of the issues – schizophrenia, autism and more – I already knew about quite well, I still learned lots. I do have an issue with this book though, and it is the voice of its author. Where Solomon is in the background - explains, tells stories of others, facilitates some of the understanding of complex emotional undertones of these stories – he’s brilliant. But whenever he stepped on the front stage to tell either his own story or to pass judgement on others, I cringed. Unfortunately, he’s too steeped in identity politics, and occasionally in saccharine, for me to listen to him with interest. I also found him somewhat saintly, or at least trying to pass himself as saintly, and as saints often do, demanding of others similar saintly moral standards. I found myself particularly irritated when he passed judgement on a mother who placed a severely disabled, barely conscious, child in foster care (Solomon himself wrote about how he fathered two healthy children). But irritation with the writer’s personality aside, this is a deeply thought provoking book that draws fresh, unexpected connections between very different types of families and issues. "
133,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5792421-carrie-magnan,4,"This book is not for the faint of heart. Notwithstanding its length (about 900 pages), the subject matter can be challenging. The author's premise is that while most children are much like their parents (i.e. ""the apple doesn't fall far from the tree""), there are children who fall very far from the tree. The first chapter is devoted to Andrew Solomon discussing (and discussing and discussing) how, as a gay man, he is different from his straight parents. Chapter 2 deals with deaf children born to hearing parents (and vice versa); chapter 3 deals with children born with Downs Syndrome. There are also chapters on dwarves, criminals (Dylan Klebold's parents are among those interviewed), children with autism, prodigies and others.The book is excessively wordy - the author could have cut 2/3 of this book and it would *still* be an interesting read - and the book is inspiring in many ways. However, the chapter which was entitled ""Disability"" was the one that made me put the book down. It deals with children born with the most serious mental disabilities - malformed brain stems, part of the brain missing, etc. It was incredibly difficult to get through and I could not finish the book after reading it. It certainly gives the reader a great deal of compassion for parents facing every physical, mental and emotional challenge possible. I'd recommend this book with the caveat that it will take time to get through. The book is thought provoking and both inspiring and heartbreaking at the same time. "

The only reason I gave it four instead of 5 stars was its tendency to drive the same point home more than was necessary at times. Other than that, I thought this was a masterpiece.In this book, Solomon investigates the concept of ""horizontal"" identity: when children identify in a way that is not the same as their parents. For example, deaf child born to hearing parents. Autistic child born to non-autistic parents etc. his chapters each focus on a different ""difference,"" - deafness, dwarfism, autism, schizophrenia, prodigies, criminality, and so forth. His interview with the mother of Dylan Klebold (of Columbine) - for the criminality chapter - will stick with me forever. She, like many of the other parents, spoke of a radical acceptance of circumstances and a remarkably enduring love for her child. Unlike parents of children with severe genetic disabilities, one might question whether Klebold's circumstances were entirely beyond her control. I was just utterly impressed by her attitude and insights. The same was true of many other parents in the book. One word of caution: if reading this book as a parent of young children, if you're anything like me, you will worry that your infant is going to turn out to be autistic or that your toddler will develop mental illness etc. On the upside, should any of those conditions impact your family at some point, this book would be a valuable place to turn for solace and information.

This book should also be required reading. We all dream of the perfect baby, child, son , daughter. No one ever gets that, of course, but some parents are given a child that guarantees hardship and crisis for the family. Andrew Solomon spent a decade getting to know families who were dealing with a wide variety of disorders/conditions/differences that are devastating to families either because of prejudice, financial hardship, caregiver burnout, medical catastrophes or societal ignorance. The book is set up so that each chapter discusses a different condition such as homosexuality, transgender, autism, downs syndrome, severe physical disability, etc. I was awestruck at just how deep Mr. Solomon got with each of his case studies, to the point that he is still in contact with most of them today. It really put a human face on the struggles each of these family's go through each day and how it might affect me if I were to have one (or more) of these challenges presented to me.This book is LONG but I desperately did not want it to end. This is easily the most important nonfiction book I have read in a very long time if not of all time.

However, I think this book is relevant and interesting for any parent (or even anyone who HAS parents!), because the main point of the book is that there are horizontal identities in every family, and the best parents are those who accept their children's identities and do everything they can to support them in living positive and fruitful lives. It is not a ""parenting"" book per se but I found it much more useful and meaningful than any parenting book I've ever read.I thought that some of the chapters lost the thread of the central theme at times, but for the most part they came back to the main point. The most notable example of this was the chapter on criminality. For most of the chapter it seemed like something of a misfit in the book, but then the discussion of the Klebold family was one of the most resonant and emotional parts of the book for me. I hate to say this because in no way do I compare my own son with Dylan Klebold - in fact, he is one of the strongest and most beautiful people I have ever had the privilege to know - but I very much identified with the experience of Susan Klebold making her way and forging new relationships after Columbae. This is a long book, but the writing is excellent and engaging throughout and it is very much worth the commitment of reading it."

Andrew Solomon spent over ten years researching and interviewing families of children who had horizontal identities, identities that were not a part of their identity as members of their family. Andrew Solomon tells stories of families with deaf children, children with dwarfism, children on the autism spectrum, children of rape, transgender and gay, children who are criminals, prodigies, and children with disabilities. He explores the challenges the families face along with the successes and navigates the communities that provide support to the families or the individuals. He introduces the reader to how different communities use different language to describe who they are and how they live in the world and how often there are differences in groups on how people want to be seen or identified in the world. The book is a celebration of resiliency and family interspersed with some heartbreak while also giving the reader a wide range of diversity to explore. I found my mind expanding on many issues and seeing different points of view on many topics, not the least of which were abortion. This book is 700 pages of intense but often enjoyable reading. It kept me up at night and I often found myself longing to get back to it. I expect this will end up being a well worn and loved member of my library."

It is long and full of closely researched information and stories, but very compelling to read. I found I would read 20-30 pages and then need to take time to reflect on the issues raised in the book on imperfection and the value of all human beings.Each of the identity groups that Solomon explores has unique characteristics, but also surprising universalities. The parents of these children have stories of heartbreak and stories of triumph. This book asks hard questions about the increased use of genetic testing to screen for disabilities. Is that really a good thing for the world? Or is it a tacit form of modern eugenics? What is normal anyway? Doesn't everyone have at least a little abnormality in some facet of their being? And, as Solomon points out, there are other kinds of ""disabilities"" that might come from things like abuse of power, or lack of values, or imposition of religious beliefs. He makes a powerful argument that what is really abnormal is when we try to eliminate our differences, what some groups call the ""tyranny of intervention."" I came away from this book in awe of the courage and love in these families and a new appreciation for diversity in all its manifestations. "

Very thought-provoking with chapters on parenting children with medical conditions like autism, Downs, serious disability, and dwarfism. The author also explored what it is like to raise children who are the product of rape, or who go on to commit crimes. There is even a chapter on parenting the gifted child.I tried to digest this book slowly, as each chapter was very detailed and illuminating. Solomon pulled no punches - each family was portrayed honestly and realistically; although many of the parents were heroic and inspiring, not all were. I empathized so much with all of them, which is a credit to the author.Solomon stated that he had tackled other conditions and variables where children can differ from their parents (""horizontal identities"") that ended up not being included (probably for space reasons!) I found myself wishing he had included all of those perspectives as well, it was that interesting and enlightening as a concept. It was very effective how he began and ended the book with applications to his own life - both as a son and then later, a father. He was just as candid about his own flaws and potential prejudices. I highly recommend this book!"
140,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1042235-glenn-hyman,4,"I read this book fairly quickly for a 700 page book. In that sense it was hard to put down. It is weird to say this, but the book had some similarity to passing an automobile accident and every body slowing down to see what happened. Each of the conditions discussed in the book – things like autism, down syndrome, dwarfism, kids who commit crimes, transgender, etc. – holds a certain fascination, especially seeing how parents dealt with these conditions. And I agree that facing up to these circumstances for the parents can be a transformative experience that makes you a different person, in a positive way. That does not negate the fact that these parents truly experience very very difficult ordeals that in some senses nobody should have to go through. As a society we need to do much more to improve the environment and the services under which families experience these difficulties. For the families that experience these conditions, the book Holds out hope that there are good things that come out of these circumstances, and even some families that would not change a thing. For ""normal"" families, count your blessings. And perhaps be content that your child is ""normal"", relax and don't feel like you need to develop the exceptional in your kid. Normal is okay."

He manages to be at once rigorous and sensitive in his exploration of families whose children possess ""horizontal identities."" At times, the difficulties and hardships Solomon recounts can feel overwhelming, even to read, but he masterfully weaves together factual information and personal stories to bring to life the issues and questions at the heart of each of the larger identities he investigates. (Solomon's style in this regard reminded me of another excellent, lengthy, award-winning work of non-fiction, The Emperor of All Maladies.) The final pages of the book--in which Solomon offers a reflection on his own experiences and how they have been informed by the long work he has done on this book, with the individuals and families whose stories are so carefully and thoughtfully contained in it--are incredibly moving and well written.

143,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2581288-laurie,5,"Andrew Solomon, you wrote an amazing book. I cannot think of another book as thorough in making its points, conveying its information. I got this book for the Deaf chapter, and as much as I already knew, it added depth and breadth to my understanding. The Transgender chapter was phenomenal. I had just read Margaret Talbot's article in the New Yorker, About a Boy, and appreciated its info and insight (it was really the first time I completely understood why a transgender person wouldn't be able to simply wear what they wanted to wear and act how they wanted to act, rather than needing to so radically alter their bodies). But, Andrew Solomon brought me to a whole new level of understanding. I didn't read every chapter -- the Rape and Prodigies chapters not at all, the Disability chapter I skimmed, the Schizophrenia chapter I read through but maybe quickly. I read the Crime chapter, which was fine, especially the Tom and Sue Klebold part, but the level of helpful insight was less, as we might expect. Anyway, for such an enormous piece of work, exploring subjects on which general wisdom and insight are hard to come by, this was a great piece of work. I appreciate it. I may pick it up another time and go back to what I skipped. "

I have just finished reading a chapter on parenting autistic children, have read about the challenges of being a parent of deaf children, children with downs syndrome, dwarves,children who grow up to murder and rape. Solomon writes deftly, though he definitely could have used a better editor. He doesn't need quite to many stories in each chapter, but the stories are what keep luring me on. What did Tolstoy say? Each happy family is alike. Each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. But since there are,I believe, no such thing as ""happy"" families, each story is unique in the way that our own stories, our own childhoods, our f*ed up parents and our own f*ed up parenting is unique. There is something heartening about the brave souls, the embittered souls, the flat out defeated and angry souls who people this book. I respect the deep research Solomon has done and the deep trust his subjects obviously have in him had to have been earned over years and years.

I don't have children, let alone a child with special needs, and I can't even imagine what the experience of reading this book would be like for someone who does--although I don't suppose they'd necessarily agree with the comparison between their situation and the situation of a parent of a prodigy.Every one of my preconceptions about ""disability,"" about identity, about abortion, about the role of parents in the lives of their children, and about the role of children in the lives of their parents were turned upside-down by this book, and I don't think I'll ever look at any of these things the same way again.Despite the heavy subject matter, this is a true page-turner. I must admit that, at nearly 1,000 pages or 41 hours for the audio edition, I was initially intimidated by the size of this book. But by the end I wanted it to keep going on for much longer.

It's as if Andrew Solomon has never heard of intersectional identities; this book takes on portraiture of several disenfranchised groups, including people with autism, dwarfism, and hearing disabilities, and tries to tie them together with a vague notion of ""difference."" Solomon's claim is that these groups are all comparable because their difference is all ""vertical"" -- that is, usually putting parents and children on opposite sides of the divide. If that sounds like a weak organizing principal, it's only because it's a weak organizing principal.As far as I can tell, the readers who get something out of this book are the ones who have never carefully considered issues of privilege and difference. The scholarship on any given section is insufficient to offer real insight in the field, and Solomon's stance manages to constantly exoticize and other his subjects. Attempting to lump together this many marginalized groups is folly, and the result doesn't respect any community's struggles.Besides all that, the writing is just plain horrible (and long, to boot). I liked The Noonday Demon, but Andrew Solomon has truly lost his way with this book."

I am grateful to Solomon for introducing me to the concept of horizontal identities, ten of which he has chosen to shine a spotlight on. Each chapter is a nice balance of both information and personal stories, the latter of which run the gamut from hopeful to gut-wrenching. The weakest chapter is the one on prodigies since Solomon chose to only focus on those within the arts, yet it is still fascinating and the other chapters more than make up for this low point. Although the opening and closing chapters weren't quite as engaging to me as the rest, I like how Solomon chose to bookend his material with his own personal experiences in childhood and parenting.Note: The fact that I took nearly three years to finish should not serve as a deterrent to others! I discovered that the best way for me to experience this book was in bits and pieces since I felt a need to decompress after each chapter and fully process everything I had just read; it is definitely not designed to be read cover to cover all in one sitting."

A lot of parents (or those planning to become parents) might find some of the stories worrisome or upsetting. On the other hand, nearly all of the people interviewed, both parents and children, had come to terms with the differences they dealt with, so it might actually be encouraging or comforting to some. Be prepared to skip around. I feel that the Crime section should not have been included. Having a child who commits a crime is certainly an identity, but it's the result of choice, unlike Deafness, dwarfism, or any of the other identities examined. I also had a problem with the chapter on parents of children conceived in rape. It felt like the author ran out of North Americans to interview, so decided to include Rwandans. That would be fine except that all the other sections only looked at the North American perspective.Honestly, I probably would have give this four or even five stars two days ago, but I've been reading this sucker for a week and I just feel fatigued.

Above all this book is about the dignity and value we offer others. It is written with both radical compassion and honesty, and shows these are not mutually exclusive.By exploring the horizontal identities that contrast with our inherited vertical identities, Solomon identifies the differences that we are so keen to either dismiss as illness or deficit, or romanticise as extraordinary and superior. Rather than locate himself at either end of the spectrum Solomon acknowledges the ambivalence in these positions, alongside our broader cultural ambivalence around exceptional ism and belonging in general. With chapters on deafness, dwarfism, autism, prodigies, and schizophrenia amongst others, this book has significantly impacted my understanding of identity, disability and giftedness.

Highly recommended for those who have ""perfect"" children :-) and for those who face challenges at any level with their kids, and even for those who at any point considered parenthood. The remarkable thing here is that the author was not a parent when he wrote this book but became one during this journey. This is an incredibly profound book! Parenthood demands so much more than our assumed definition of ""unconditional love"" -- in fact that's the easiest part -- and we can and need to learn from those for whom the apple fell far from the tree. Took me longer than usual to get through this book because there was so much to process, it was exhausting and disturbing in parts; besides he packs in insight after insight. Made me realize how wedded we are to our egos, our pettiness, our shallow social identities even as we congratulate ourselves on being parents. BUT parenting can be the most humbling, impassioned and rewarding growth experiences of our lives. Ironically, many don't even find out - and the world remains far less rich for that.

I actually really enjoyed reading the anecdotes (except for the author's stories about himself) but there are so many problems with this text. I kept marveling at how so many of the stories were about the amazing things done by fabulously wealthy people. Millionaires who established non-profits and schools and activism using their money and doing all this while a nanny cared for their deaf/autistic/disabled child. I wondered why the bias toward telling the story of the very rich who are statistically rare. Then I read this, ""Tolstoy can teach us to understand a farmworker, but farmworkers cannot in general give us insight into the metaphoric complexities of Anna Karenina."" Ohhhhh... he's a snob.

We depend on the guarantee in our children’s faces that we will not die. Children whose defining quality annihilates that fantasy of immortality are a particular insult; we must love them for themselves,and not for the best of ourselves in them, and that is a great deal harder to do.”“Though we may take pride in how different we are from our parents, we are endlessly sad at how different our children are from us.”"

While it speaks to parenting and children who have a prescribed list of conditions or situations that are challenging to parent, there is a much broader message here that impacts all of us. It's about identity, respect, and a world that now has ever increasing scientific ability to detect and eliminate some conditions and yet it is also a time when we are striving for greater acceptance and often provide better support than ever before. Soloman has a tremendous narrative voice and the respect that he has for all of his interviewees, even when there is tremendous dissonance in what they are saying is palpable.

To give an idea, the hardcover edition is about 850 pages but the last 150 are footnotes. It's a big book and I found it hard to get through some of the sadder passages, I confess I skipped ahead to ""Gifted"" just as a palate-cleanser.

We do not 'reproduce' - we 'produce' a new child, and they are very much individuals. Too many other thoughts to write, but a very important and worthwhile book, and the chapter on autism provided me with important understanding of some of the issues for parents and children with more severe forms of autism.

161,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4909971-peg,4,"Solomon has taken a very difficult subject and written in a way that someone who doesn't have a psychiatry degree can still understand it. His focus is on diversity and especially how parents cope with children whom society deems ""different"" or ""disabled"". He reports on his extensive interviews with families coping with deafness, dwarfism, Down syndrome, autism, schizophrenia, multiple severe disabilities, prodigies, children conceived in rape, those who become criminals and those who are transgender. Some stories are heartbreaking and some are inspiring. It is challenging if one is not willing to examine one's definition of ""normal"". But a testament to the power of love in all our lives and the sanctify of each and every life. It's a very long book;took me awhile to finish. But very interesting and worth the time."
162,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3159607-sara,5,"Journalist Andrew Solomon writes about the unexpected relationships/identities that children and parents find themselves navigating due to disabilities, sexual- and gender-orientation, and other circumstances that parents don't necessarily expect when they plan a family. It was fascinating and difficult (emotionally) to read. My most jaw-dropping takeaway: people who aren't cherished or protected as children often grow up not knowing what caring behavior feels like, so they become desperate for any sort of attention. Consequently, they fail to develop the ability to anticipate danger or recognize patterns and end up as easy prey for abusers and often fall into the same problems repeatedly. Essentially: lack of love makes people see the world as uncomfortable and unpredictable. My only gripe: at 900 pages long, it was heavy and aggravated my carpel tunnel! "

Drawing on forty thousand pages of interview transcripts with more than three hundred families... deafness, dwarfism, Down syndrome, autism, schizophrenia, multiple severe disabilities, with children who are prodigies, who are conceived in rape, who become criminals, who are transgender.""I just spent the past few weeks slowly taking this book in, mostly appreciating though occasionally pushing against the conclusions Solomon drew from the experiences of these families. A very interesting, and sometimes moving, book on parenting and identity."

It's sociology and it's serious and it's deeply researched, but it's also crammed with so many astonishing and moving stories that it's as gripping as any novel. It covers ten or twelve different disabilities/conditions, ranging from dwarfism to deafness to freakishly glorious musical talent. My friend and I read it at the same time and had many conversations about which would be the worst type of problem to have if you were a parent of a special child. I think we agreed on autism, with schizophrenia #2. Those poor parents, holy cow, what an ordeal."
165,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/758187-iva,5,"Parents get children that they are not prepared for and Solomon has spent time with these parents to understand their lives and challenges. He learned that many ""ended up grateful for experiences they would have done anything to avoid"". It is an instructional book, sometimes inspirational and Solomon is not afraid to insert his own life story when appropriate. The reader learns how parents adapt and respond to these challenges. Solomon was able to interview the parents of Dylan Klebald, the Columbine shooter, and learn how these parents are living with their guilt. I will remember his responses to these brave people for a long time. Highly recommended. "
166,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10771241-marcia-nedland,4,"Wow. An epic (900+pages) review of many ways in which children can indeed fall far from the tree, requiring parents to dig much deeper to figure out how to parent them. Each chapter focuses on a different way in which children can be substantially different from their parents, either physically or psychologically. The chapters are riddled with interesting case studies from Solomon's hundreds of interviews, plus a lot of background info on the particular difference that chapter features. But the point of it all is to explore how parents try (or in some cases don't) to rise to the occasion of being the best parent possible to someone whose experience of life is beyond their own."

The subject-kids who turn out very differently from their parents: deaf children, dwarves, autistic kids, etc. First he talks about himself as a gay teenager, and how it was hard for his parents to accept him since he was different from them. Then he addresses a variety of other things that make kids different than their parents and he interviews both kids and parents. One point I got from it; parents are happier if they assume there is nothing they can do to change their child, than if they think there might be some remedy that they just haven't found yet. "
168,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2957620-steffie-corcoran,4,"I agree with those who say this is an important book. It purports to explore notions of horizontal identity (children's identities like deafness, disability, mental illness, etc., that differ profoundly from their parents'). But it's really, in my opinion, more a study of the extraordinary measures parenting sometimes require and the sometimes surprising, and meaningful, circumferences of family. It's a big book, a smart book, a meticulously researched and sourced book, and a book that required a great deal of, and illuminated much about, its author. The experience and insight within makes it worth the reader's time--especially for those interested in psychology and issues of identity."

It started out with a strong premise, but that premise was lost as the chapters unfolded. I did find the case studies interesting from a psychological/medical perspective, but I feel that the author tried to put too much of his years of research and interviews in the book and ended up with a big mess. I was really expecting some wonderful ""out of the box"" thinking about identity and diversity, but sadly all I really got was a ""hot mess."" 2 stars - It was OK (and only because of the case studies. 1 star if I'm rating it based on what the book purports to deliver).

It stretches the reader's mind to consider how life can present some key challenges for people (including children) - issues such as sexual orientation, transgender, deafness, autism; challenges that can cause a person to question their very identity - 'ordinary people making courageous choices'. This book at times describes horrifying discrimination to those who fall 'far from the tree'. It left me challenged to be part of the solution; and to be compassionate to the crisis situations that many individuals and families face. Read this book. It could be your child! "

I read this book over time, a chapter here, a chapter there.. each chapter telling a different life story. The research shows in great detail, yet this is not a work of opressive verbiage, it is very readable. Solomon brings himself into the piece, which was welcome by me. reading his thoughts of self opened him as a 'person' and not 'viewer' to me. It also made me want to read his earlier work."

I would have given this 5 stars except that the depth and richness of the chapters was a bit uneven. But overall it was very thought provoking in many places and one of my favorite reads in the past few years."
174,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12079502-anne,5,"  Solomon's work in the book is the writer's equivalent of working on the high wire without a net. To draw connections among families with deaf, autistic, dwarf, criminal, or transgendered children (naming only a few) is an extraordinary feat of Imagination. He manages to examine an array of human diversity from the point of view of parenting, simultaneously reviewing biomedical, psychological, cultural and social perspectives on these circumstances. His writing is literary while his analysis is scientific. Truly an amazing work, that kept me riveted. "

The author is trying to develop the idea of how different horizontal identities are from vertical ones (being gay compared with being Irish, for example). He focuses on the challenges of raising a child with a different vertical identity from the parents, but along the way he delves into the history of, controversies over and current treatment of the various issues, which include deafness, dwarfism, being the product of a rape, etc. It's a fascinating, wonderful, mind-expanding read.

It tackles huge issues, such nature vs. nurture, with an open mind, a huge heart, and an endless intellectual curiosity. In the beautiful last pages of the book, the author states that ""love is a magnifying phenomenon... every increase in love strengthens all the other love in the world."" Hopefully, the love in this book will be a magnifying phenomenon the more it is read."

I really liked the first chapters, but almost felt like it was too much of a stretch to combine the experiences of families with kids with Downs, deaf kids, children of rape, children who are killers, and transgender kids. But Solomon does a good job anyway, and keeps enough of his own reflection in it that you can see why he did it.Still one of the coolest books I've read in awhile."

Its subject matter begins on the grim side and descends into great darkness, with the last chapters discussing inter-generational mistakes, crimes and regrets in great detail. I was expecting it to have a lighter heart than it does. At the same time, it is a necessary book. It's healthy to see that not everyone loves their children all the time. Not everyone accepts what life thrusts their way with good grace. There is a lot of light shining on the ugly side of people in this book."

He combines personal stories with current data and studies on each topic and delivers a comprehensive and informative package. His focus is on the parent -child relationship both vertical and horizontal, terms with which I was unfamiliar. I must confess that I did not read the entire book but the autism, schizophrenia and rape chapters provided much food for thought."

If you've ever wondered about the profound differences between parents and children or human beings who live on the outside of the cultural norm, this book will help you grow in your understanding of people. The differences he talks about are wide ranging and sometimes very dramatic: from children who are gay, to the deaf, severely disabled and children that kill. The love between parents and children though weaves it way through his science and psychology."

I do think that issues of class and poverty are missing in some of these discussions, but I suppose the book doesn't intend to be comprehensive. It paints a compelling picture of parenthood, expectations, illness and disability, and one I won't soon forget. "

198,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38761322-shelly-l,5,"A profound failure of empathy. That's how I describe this dark, difficult time we're living through. Was made to go to catechism class on Tuesday nights as a kid. Instinctively liked it, because another setting in which I could show off my spectacular ability to know all the right answers. Sigh. Instinctively disliked it, because Eve's spectacular screwup and other things. Double sigh. But I distinctly recall learning the ten commandments and thinking, ""Hmm. Thou shalt not kill. Seems easy. No plans to break this one."" And so, I don't understand the death threats. Someone speaks up, says whatever they feel compelled to say in a country founded on pursuits of happiness and freedoms of speech, and several other someones feel no compunction whatsoever in threatening to kill them in a grisly and hateful manner. How is this a thing? Anyway. This book called to me, though I don't typically take up non-fiction, because a friend recommended it as a cathartic exploration of the human condition she thought I might appreciate. She was right, I did. I listened to it, read me by the author. At first, his voice was jarring to my picky ear. But soon, I listened to him as I would a friend, appreciating his tonal quirks, rolled r's, and unapologetically big vocabulary. From the get-go, certain sentences caught me so completely, I was compelled to hit pause and note them down. ""To be exceptional is ubiquitous. To be completely typical is a rare and lonely state. ... Intimacy with difference fosters its accommodation. ... An intolerant society creates self-hating people who act out inappropriately."" These three sentiments describe our world. A world that imagines a narrowly accepted norm or in-group. A world that imagines difference from that norm as hideously out-group — something dangerous to fear and to hate. A world that suddenly sanctions evincing and acting on those fears and hates. Holy mackerel, what's happened, here?! Yes, we need diversity. We benefit from it. We are it. To be imperfect is to be human, people. We must be on guard against any fetishization of sameness or perfection that would deny us our essential differences and imperfections. Buckminster Fuller would not have lived if Nazis had their way, allowing only perfect people to survive. He described how, from an early age, his uniquely ""disabled"" way of seeing freed his mind to imagine untethered solutions. While all the perfect-vision kids were cribbing from an existing-world playbook, visionary Fuller was busy creating the geodesic dome. In kindergarten. With toothpicks and peas, no less! In a world beset by planet-sized problems of our own creation, a creative viewpoint could mean the difference between survival and extinction, can't you see that?! Diversity, I am a fan. I am. So much. But that's not to say that the areas of diversity explored in this book did not push and pull me in different directions. My friend Andrew was looking for connectors that turn singularly imperfect beings into a larger imperfect whole. A community with shared identity truths, the embracing of which could help us all. I think he found some. One of which is the need for self definition and ongoing identity dialogue. Because the situation of each identity has it's own special permutations and valences. Within those valences, each individual reacts differently, and each family system has its own strengths and weaknesses to bring to the table. There is no one size fits all ... not all individuals, all families, or all identities. One of the most profound challenges of our time, I think, may be learning to let go the binary — a thing so seemingly simple yet so exceedingly difficult for us to do. Like light itself, both a particle and a wave, the conditions explored in this book can be both an illness and a strength — something that needs both solving and embrace. Solving for the aspects that an individual perceives as illness is important. Solving for the ability of the family system to thrive is also important. Solving away the identity is not. But preserving the identity in some kind of ""perfect form"" is not required, and not desired by all people who experience it, either. It becomes problematic when solving actions are medically dramatic, irreversible, and must be decided upon in tender years of puberty or even infancy. It becomes problematic in a world where numbers matter in creating a voice and a presence, in demanding recognition. And sadly, budget. We hate to feel alone. We are social animals and we need our people around us to feel safe and whole. Today, though, as Andrew notes, smaller and smaller populations are able to feel part of a meaningful group. Cultural or identity traditions can be preserved and communicated in more ways than ever before. So there's that. Here's the thing that kept coming back to me again and again, and I can't help it. I can't have any detractors from my belief in choice. Choice is choice is choice is choice. A woman has a right to choose whether to continue a pregnancy or not. I have to believe that knowledge is part and parcel to her decision-making. For example, I'd want her to have knowledge of her job security and earnings trajectory, her goals and desires for her future, her sense of relationship with her partner, her partner's willingness or ability to participate in raising a child, and the likely trajectory or weight of the needs of the child. Yes. And if she decides, based on any factor at all, that she does not wish to be a parent, then she should not be made to become one. And if an acceptable solution is, for her, to bear the child and give it up OR NOT bear the child at all, both things must be ok. They just must. Because we women must be accorded the fullest control over our lives and bodies, just as any other adult human. And for women, that includes control over the womb and anything that happens within it. But, yes. There's a dark side. China sits over there aborting and abandoning girl babies due to ""choice"" influenced by cultural distortion, and it sickens me. As does visions of human folly pursued through choice. A world of designer babies in which Nazi-esque beliefs determine the population we become is not ok. We weaken ourselves with our misogyne and our racism and our inability to appreciate difference. But women need choice, I don't know what to say. Other than we need to keep thinking it through to find human-centered solutions for the tangle that is us. One universal truth that emerged for me in listening to this book is that the personal is political. When an individual experience is repeated over and over at scale, let's recognize the usability issue in our data and apply our resources to fix it, shall we? In our world as it is, the parenting of special needs kids is an exercise in individual fortitude. Often, that individual is the mom. I can't like this, but I can't controvert the logic of the pattern under our patriarchy. The news breaks. Parents process it differently. They go into solution mode, get a strategy together, and make difficult agreements. Dad works to bring home the special needs bacon. Mom quits work — or works within the schools her child attends, or starts the programs her child needs — and devotes herself to the child. Annnnnd 3, 2, 1, the marriage falls apart. Despite it all, both parents say they wouldn't change it. I would, though. I wouldn't change the part where both get fulfillment from parenting their special needs child — I'd change the part where they have to build their solution from scratch, sacrificing their personal needs and ambitions in the process. Sacrificing their ability to process together or stay together. My sister has a kid with special needs. During a time of deep struggle she cried to me on the phone, ""I've read the forums. I've read the stories of families like mine. I know what happens. I don't want to be that mom who abandons her career and her very self to take care of this. But I'm afraid I won't be able to help it."" My sister gave everything to care of her child — her money, her time, and her energy. But she didn't want to give her career. Or her marriage. She is allowed her boundaries. She just is. To me it comes back to a complex combination of the following human truths: All brains benefit from early intervention and relevant, rich learning experiences tailored to maximize our abilities and mollify our lacks from the moment of being born — it should be a societal priority to provide this for all. In a world of technology, we should use it to discern what's relevant and to deliver those rich experiences — all the while investing in and treasuring human interaction as the most valued form of learning. In human interaction, we should prioritize positive interaction with people of all kinds — a diverse-positive way of interacting, which by definition would be kind to all actors, including any ""normies"" btw, if such there are. Diverse-positive human interaction should be founded on our shared need for self definition plus a steady diet of both challenge and comfort. We should honor people's needs and boundaries, and recognize their need for choice. Rather than subject any ""category"" of person to one trap or another, we should value the constant exploration of what is possible, and promote the power to choose. So. In the case of parenting, yes, parents will rise to the challenge that is their particular child. But they will also need rest or comfort in order to stay effective under challenge — the more challenge, the more need for comfort. All parents should feel supported and as if they have a choice — we should not allow anyone to feel trapped into giving up everything that offers them challenge or comfort in their lives apart from the child. Because they do have lives apart from the child, and those lives are essential to their life with the child. I had profound feelings about every chapter of this book. The debates and dilemmas are real, and my feelings about each identity differed in detail though they were similar in depth. When it came to the chapter on transgender, I felt strongly called. My innocent childhood in the dairy-fresh midwest gave me little knowledge of the spectrum of human sexuality much less gender expression — yet when I first began to learn about transgender, the truth resounded as something I've always understood deep in my core. Throughout my life, I've felt very keenly a sense of what clothes were right or wrong for me. For many years, sandals that showed my toes were not right for me. Then, one day, they were ok. I don't know what changed. I just know that my sandals-are-anathema feelings were powerful and real. If I, as a matter of gender expression, had been forced to wear such sandals during the years they were wrong for me, I would have suffered. My suffering would not have been trivial. I also know, deeply, the reasons that ""passing"" can be harmful. Trying to pass, fearing discovery ... feeling only valued so far as you succeed in trickery. It’s not ok. As Andrew notes, ""A double life is exhausting and ultimately tragic, because you can never be loved if you can never be known."" Yes. Let’s all be known and accepted. Even if we hate sandals. Andrew's concluding chapters made me laugh-cry, and nod my head, and feel lots of feels for us bumbling humans with our imperfect brains trapped in imperfect bodies. Yes! People who are exceptional try to say they are normal, and people who are normal linger over every ""special"" thing they do. We want it both ways. We want to be both particle and wave. We seek out and recoil from diversity. We aspire to and fear individuality. When will we be brave enough to be who we are as individuals and embrace our diversity as humans? When will we break our fascination with perfection or our fixation on uniformity? Why do we insist on identities that skew one way or other — some allowed to deal only in emotion, others allowed to show none? When will we acknowledge the many paths of profound life experience and expand our notion of normalcy? When will we apply our knowledge and resources to support the many pathways of life experience we are aware of? When will we formulate a philosophy for managing human emotion, reaction, curiosity, and boundaries as we encounter one another? Perhaps when we embrace the confounding masterpieces of duality and diversity that we so obviously are."
199,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11058104-greg,5,"*This review covers some heavy, and potentially personal themes to do with families and children*The most moving and insightful piece of non fiction I have ever read, completely changing the way I think about children, identity and being a parent. This book was no doubt a tough slog, it took me 12 months to read with some incredibly heavy content, some of which moved me to tears. I needed to break each down, then taking time to read something else in between each. The premise for this book is parents relationship to children who share some fundamental difference to them. Broken down into chapters, this covered Gay, Deaf, Dwarfism, Downs Syndrome, Autism, Schizophrenia, Disability, Prodigies, Children of rape, Children who go on to commit crime and Transgender. The author writes from a place of intelligence, kindness and curiosity that makes you marvel at his character in putting together this extraordinary thesis that is both mind opening and heart breaking. Each chapter enters the world of that particular difference, examining the issue from empirical research combined with deeply personal stories of families connecting with, loving and raising children who entered this world remarkably different to them in some way. One learns how often the problem is our values which we place on others, and how placing value on difference rather than stigmatizing it is at the heart of what it means to connect as human beings. One story spoken by a Father was the most moving personal account of a relationship I have ever heard. His son, born with a severely crippling disability, died in his late teens. The Father explained (going off memory here) 'Although he couldn't talk, I have never in my life felt closer to a human being. I'd lie beside him on the bed, and we'd stare into each others eyes for hours'. One such small example that finds it's way right to your core and squeezes your heart and refuses to let go.What made each chapter particularly interesting, was the insight into each world, which came with it's own unique controversies and questions. I'll recall here aspects of each that struck me in some way. Please note, these are reflections on the controversies, not things I take side on. These topics are incredibly heavy, examining children with very high needs, death, rights to life, abuse, death, pregnancy screening and the uncomfortable realms of eugenics and the value we place on other human beings. These are small snippets.Deaf: The controversy in the deaf world, that cochlear implants to improve hearing is 'killing' sign language and the deaf community. Some are completely against hearing improvement, suggesting 'curing' deafness is akin to trying to 'cure' homosexuality.Dwarfism: The one disability where it is socially acceptable to stare, mock and use as a point of entertainment.Downs Syndrome: Of the families interviewed, almost none would wish to go back and have a child without DS. They enriched their life to every degree a typical child would expect to. Some argue that screening for DS is entering the murky areas of eugenics, rather than accepting children for who they are.Autism: Some of the stories of challenges of raising children on the lower end of Autism spectrum was almost unbearable to read given how emotionally and physically challenging this would be. The current debate whether one can screen for Autism, which would potentially also mean 'screening out' something which brings genius into the world.Schizophrenia: The sudden life shattering impact in which Schizophrenia can have, and the lack of promotion for diversity on this topic, as it is not recognized as much as a difference or identity, but a devastating and degenerative mental illness.Disability: Some families whose adult children are completely physically incapacitated take option to prevent growth, particularly for females, keeping them the weight and size of a smaller child. This sparks outrage from feminists, who argue that it is dehumanizing them and stripping their femininity. The parents however argue the dignity and humanity of using a small crane and shackles to shower, clean and move their fully grown adult child, where having a smaller body they can keep human touch by delicately picking them up and holding them in their arms. Further to this, this chapter was heartbreaking to push through, with story after story of families who show unconditional strength to the most demanding circumstances, in some cases constant CPR to keep them alive.Prodigy: Child genius, born into a simple family. Is there an obligation to foster their talent, place them on the big stage, highlight their abilities?Rape: The strength and love shown by the women raising children conceived in such circumstances highlighted the polarity in the world of human beings. A very heavy chapter once again to push through.Crime: At what point would you ever disown your child for the crime they committed? How far would ones love stretch? Solomon in this chapter interviews one of the Mothers of the Columbine shooters.Transgender: The gender politics is an interesting debate, where some identified they just wanted to be seen as 'male' or 'female', and not constantly referred to as 'trans'. The problem always seeming to be not the young persons change of identity, but the refusal of those around them to accept it.A brave, world changing book that I encourage everyone to read. However in it, also contains deeply personal accounts of some of the most challenging and awful experiences people can be subjected to. My advice, take it slow, absorb each chapter, let it move you and enlighten. 5 stars. Brilliant. "
200,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23704706-cor-t,5,"Andrew Solomon has written a 900-page study about parenting (though the last 40% is notes, I was relieved to find). More specifically, this is a book about parenting a child (and being a child) who is different from their parents - who has what Solomon calls a ""horizontal identity."" This is as opposed to having a ""vertical identity,"" which is an identity that's the same as your family's, such as being tall or musical or from a socioeconomic class. He was inspired to write from his experience of being gay and feeling isolated within his family, while finding a remarkably strong horizontal identity within the gay community, and from there, his self-knowledge and acceptance. Solomon explores whether his experience of gay identity and culture extrapolates to other ""anomalous"" children by interviewing parents and children who are or have (and you may find this an unusual list): Deaf, Dwarfs, Down Syndrome, Autism, Schizophrenia, Disability, Prodigies, Crime, and Transgender. It's a study that confronts parental expectations and how their coping skills are severely tested when a child is either born with or develops differently than others. He reviews how each syndrome was discovered and treated, how it's treated now, and whether there's a community of support and belonging. I'm calling it a 'study,' though it is nonscientific - his subjects are parents (and some children) who agreed to be interviewed at length and share their intimate thoughts, fears, failures, and the wisdom or peace they may have gained through raising their child.For example, in the chapter on deaf children in hearing households, we learn that parents who teach their children to learn to read lips or try to speak so that they can communicate directly with them are making a profound choice - that deaf children only develop deep language skills by Signing, but ""To choose Sign for your deaf child is, in some significant ways, to surrender him or her to Deaf culture."" These heartbreaking choices face parents in chapter after chapter, and extends to the parents of Dylan Klebold of Columbine fame. Difficult themes from parent interviews include: 1) an acknowledgement that their world would be narrower without the experience, and that is a gift, but most would not choose it; 2) that the exhaustion and stress of having to take care of their children throughout their adult lives, feeling the loss of what their child's life should be, is unrelenting; 3) that marriages break up when one spouse dedicates themselves to the difference, while the other wants to live his or her life as before. Despite the pain and loss that so many of his interview subjects express, Solomon's conclusion is that the human race endures due to the diversity of children and their parents' attachment to them: ""Every child has a touch of the horizontal and reshapes his or her parents...we love them because they are our destiny."" More specifically about the gratitude that is engendered: ""If parents often end up grateful for their problematic children, then so, in the end, can we all be grateful for the courage such people may embody, the generosity they may teach us, even the ways they complicate the world."" It's taken me a long time to write about this book because there was so much to say. It is mind blowing to hear directly from parents of children whose difference or disability has changed the direction of a family's life. What's remarkable to me is that their words and thoughts are not that far from those of any parent struggling to accept a child exhibiting a tiny degree of difference from the gold standard of normalcy/perfection, which I see around me every day. For that reason, the book has universal relevance, even if its length and the darkness of some of the subject matter might terrify new parents. It's also a chronicle of the burgeoning growth of horizontal communities, made possible by the internet and social media. No one needs to feel alone anymore - if they can communicate, both parents and children can find their tribe and the acceptance therein. In demonstrating the universality of our response to difference as part of the human condition, Andrew Solomon proves his point, even if it takes him all those pages to do so, and for that I give it 5 stars."
201,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5195776-christian,5,"There are a handful of books out there that I have seriously considered purchasing multiple copies of in order to give them to friends. This is definitely one of them. It's not a short book by any means (although it is shorter than it appears unless you plan to read its 200 pages of bibliography and notes.) This is worth it though as it helps to shine a light on different experiences and lives, and even hopefully to create a new found sense of empathy. I think that one of our current strongest prejudices in our society is that towards those with disabilities, especially those with cognitive disabilities. This almost certainly comes partially from fear, but it also comes from a lack of exposure. This is a book that presents you to people with different lives and tells you their stories, and their parents stories, and the struggles and joys their lives include. Andrew Solomon was, from my understanding, attempting to make peace with his own life and parents when he decided to interview parents whose children occupy a different world and identity than they do. He said in the end he felt as though he was also attempting to understand his own role as a parent. If the book is about anything it's about love and the ability we have to love those we don't understand. It's also about the tension between accepting someone and curing them. Can you do both? Can you accept a person who you are attempting to cure? The negative reviews of this book seem to largely come from this place. People have an understandable anger at Solomon's view of diversity being a good thing. If you live with a chronic pain or disability than of course you don't want to hear someone tell you they are happy to have your diversity in the world. I think this is a simplification though of Solomon's argument. Yes, he certainly loves diversity and does not want to remove many of these disabilities from the world, but I think he views it as a tension not a clear cut issue. At one point he mentions a father of a boy with autism. He asks him if he would remove the autism and the father says that for his son he would as he acknowledges how hard it has made his life, but for himself he would not as it has made his life richer. Selfish? Maybe. There's also the question of what remains when something is taken away. If I were to remove the aspects of my life, my self, and my past that I most disdain I do not know who would be left over. I've worked a lot with individuals with autism, and while I would do anything to make their lives easier and give them more opportunity I also am glad that they exist and am grateful to have had their presence in my life. Maybe we should be looking for ways to make life more livable for people rather than looking to remove a major aspect of them. All this isn't to say that we definitely shouldn't try to find cures, but rather that we shouldn't just view it as a disease. I'm not going to solve this issue. I don't think I'll convince anyone who took against the book either. But I do think that Solomon also doesn't think he can necessarily solve that particular dilemma. He just also thinks we should accept and love people without trying to cure them and making them the same as everyone else. It's definitely an important book for educators (or in my case future educators) and for parents, but I think it doesn't hurt for everyone to read stories of people with lives very different from their own. The world definitely does not suffer from an over abundance of empathy, and if something could help to build compassion and empathy for the outcast and the misunderstood than I would say that it is worth reading. This feels wordy, but the book is about 700 pages long or so."
202,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/51561191-nicole,4,"Andrew Solomon gave a talk at my university two years ago and I was in tears halfway through. I went home for break and forced my parents to watch the recording on Youtube. This book is practically everything I imagined in the time it took me to get around to reading it: but words fail me. If you're looking for hope, if you want to find courage, if you believe in love, read this book. Please.That said, the book is not perfect. For one, it's so long - I happen to like Solomon's style, but there really is a lot of meandering which may make it harder to read if you're a fan of really direct prose. My bigger concern, though, is that Solomon covers white privileged families nearly exclusively - the chapters with significant amounts of stories from people of color were the chapters on rape and crime. I have to wonder how Solomon set out finding his interlocutors - mainly word-of-mouth referrals to and from other affluent academics? Looking for people who'd appeared in headlines who were willing to talk to him? Probably a mixture of the two - and it's worth noting that in the chapter on crime, he's focused on the families of kids who are involved in a specific program. In any case, whatever the practical reasons were, the homogeneity is still an issue. While I found meaning in the stories that were presented, it begged the question of how families fare when they can't hire aides, relocate to be near doctors, or pay for costly surgeries and physical therapies. And Solomon doesn't address this lack of nuance (that I recall).I didn't take the book as a truly scientific treatise, though that's what I expected going in. It became clear that the whole thing really is a ""search for identity"" - and the author is also searching. Solomon consistently refers back to his personal experience as a gay man, but I didn't find it as generalizing or arrogant as some other reviewers apparently did; to me, it felt more like he was trying to trace seeds of commonality, however small - and we all have to relate to something, right? Anyways, I disagreed with a few of the opinions he expressed in his more personal asides (usually at the ends of chapters, where he gave brief summaries of what he'd thought while doing the interviews), and in a few places I wish he'd spent more time exploring the nuances of political debates. But you can't have it all. I found the book moving to the point of tears, but not perfect, and certainly not without serious criticism. Nonetheless, I also found it inspirational, because the families presented did open my eyes to love in challenging circumstances and how beautiful it can be."
203,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1856965-haley,4,"I have a few things to say about this one. First of all, I'm glad I made it through the whole thing. This book was LOOOOOOONG. I found the information in it to be valuable, and it's a very good way to familiarize yourself with several different kinds of marginalizations in our society. Even if you're not looking at it from a parental standpoint, which I wasn't, it's still an important book. You see the challenges of each marginalization, from both inside--the perspective of the marginalized person, children and adults, but also from their parents. Solomon followed these many of these families over several years, became close to them, and did a ton of research with each study, so the depth of information in each type is very well done.However, I do have some reservations. My biggest one is that he uses the word ""retarded"" repeatedly to describe those with intellectual disabilities. I did look up when the change from ""Mental Retardation"" to ""Intellectual Disability"" happened, and it was 2013, one year after this book was published. So, I can't technically fault the author. However, it did sicken me to read this slur so often (having someone in my family with an ID, and raised not to use that word EVER). So just be aware of that going in. Also, the types of marginalizations he chose confused me a little bit. The first few were all forms of disabilities, then mental illness, which also fits the same thread. We moved into Prodigies, which strayed slightly, but it still fit, because the book is about how parents care for their extraordinary children. And the book closed with a chapter on Transgender kids, which definitely fit. But there were two chapters: children born from rape, and kids who commit crimes, that I thought, while important topics, I didn't think fit this particular book. They felt out of place in this study. It felt like he was grasping at straws sometimes to make those same connections to the other themes that he had in previous chapters, and so I almost wonder if they would have been better forming a different book.All in all, I never would have made it through the whole book if the information wasn't valuable and interesting. His case studies were intimate and personal--clearly he spent lots of time with those he interviewed and came to care for them. "
204,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/21140122-katie,5,"It took 4 years, but I finally finished it!I started this book when my son was only a few months old. With his birth came piles of books--technical how-tos for raising a child with Down syndrome, and sentimental memoirs of parents. I read from both piles, and found useful bits, but never quite found the story I was entering into. And then I found Far From the Tree.I could say that I read this book, all 700 dense pages of it, out of respect for the Table of Contents. Because in Solomon's introduction, and in the conditions he chose to explore, I found the beginnings of my answers to what it means to me to raise a child with Down syndrome. Would I mourn a child who was transgender? Would I consider a deaf child a tragedy? Of course not. My child, and my path as a parent, was a wide road, more common than I had first assumed. My kid will face challenges that I have not lived. Like every other kid and every other parent ever.But. It was a long, dense, book. And I gleaned my main insights of it from it's setup alone. So I put it down and picked it up and put it down and picked it up, and finally made it to the end because I owed the author that much.This book has been criticized for skimming the conditions it covers and reveling in worst-case scenarios. That's fair. I wouldn't recommend this as a book about Down syndrome, and so I'll assume it isn't the definitive book about any of the other situations covered.It is a book about parenting, though. It's a book about the times when parents have to make big decisions for their kids, when we, as parents, have to make those decisions about situations we have not lived. That's a huge and humbling task--and Solomon's book makes it a little easier to know that I'm not the only one struggling, I'm not the only one who will mess up, I'm not the only one fighting for my kid.The Table of Contents was good. The rest of the book adds the weight of parents after parents after parents trying to do what is right for their children. I'm glad I made it through the book, because it never hurts to have a few more travelers along for the journey."
205,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/17160618-mikhail-yukhnovskiy,5,"This book is a masterpiece. I think to describe it as unique would be very true and fitting. The author has spent many years of conmmunication with the people described in the book, travelled to different remote places, did not simply take interviews but formed friendships with many of the subjects of the book.The book is divided into chapters about children that in some way differ from their parents: the deaf, autistic, children with the Down syndrome and criminal children, among others. Solomon is concerned not with the sensational aspects of the cases he describes but with the indentity. How being different forms your identity, how this is identity perceived by the society if it is recognized as an identity at all. How do parents deal with horizontal (sexual orientation, disability, etc) identities of their children.He himself is somewhat different too. He is a gay man, coming from a jewish family. For many years he lives and fights severe depression. He also has children together with his partner, and describes a very complex but working para-familial union he and his partner have with the mothers of their children and with the chidlren his partner helped conceive.I have read many-many different books. Many of them very kind and humane, full of kind ideas and love. But Far From The Tree stands apart. Andrew Solomon has managed to write about real people, with very real and often very-very acute problems and tragic situations with a truly humane approach, while at the same with impartiality. This is something truly unparalled in my opinion.Often while reading the book I was amazed at Mr.Solomon's strength of character and kindness of his heart.I recommend this book very-very highly. if only to gain perspective on our normal lives this book is priceless. But also it teaches many important lessons. It shows that you need to accept yourself and to accept others. And it is much more difficult to do than to say.If i could rate this book with more stars than the five we have here, I would."
206,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57764064-ethan,5,Notes I took while reading. Forgive any spelling and grammar errors as this was done on my phone. This is the best book I’ve read this year and quite possibly the best non fiction work I’ve ever read. This book has literally changed my life. The things the parents in this book have to deal with has made me ashamed at the way I’ve let my own issues invade the lives of my loved ones. I’m humbled by the love these parents have shown to their children and I’ve realized how unappreciative I’ve been of the tenderness my own parents have shown me when confronted with my own extremely mild mental health issues. This book is helping me reach an empathy and maturity I didn’t realize I was capable of. While I most likely will not reproduce I empathize with these parents and my own. Those of us blessed with unconditional love often take it for granted. Reading some of the more extreme cases of disability and the love these parents choose to give has made me realize how selfish I’ve been my entire life. I’m more appreciative of the sacrifices and heartbreak my parents must have experienced while raising me and still they soldier on loving me. Life is sooo precious and on every page of this book that has been affirmed. No book I’ve read has expanded my horizons as far as this one has. This book is well balanced and provides nuanced arguments for some of the more controversial treatments involved with the seriously disabled. Admirably Solomon establishes such an intimate relationship with his subjects that his recounting sweeps the reader both into the authors mind and his subjects. Solomon is unique in this ability. These interviews are not always tinged with the cold academic prospective that other books might adopt. He has managed to forge deep connections that surpass his own privileged upbringing even as part of a discriminated minority. His accounting of spending time with gang members reminded me of my own encounters with such i individuals and speaks to the the larger humanity within us all. These families embody a hope and perseverance that is admirable even when I disagree with them or question their motives. This is first and foremost a book about love. I’ve had struggles with my faith but I kept meeting God on every page. Love shines through all our cracks and this book is if anything a powerful testimony of love conquering fear and confusion. The final chapter and most personal to the author is likewise inspirational and we accompany him on a similar journey he’d come to understand intellectually. That’s one thing but becoming a parent yourself is another entirely. This book is so moving! “The tree doesn’t grow far from the apple”
207,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/23001775-wally-xie,4,"First longer book I've finished in a long time (thanks, pandemic!). This is a book I've been meaning to go through for a few years now. As expected, it was a very challenging and harrowing read. I find that given where I am at in my stage of life, I find books about personal development to be less impactful; as I intend to be a parent, books such as this one about the effects of one's life on others I now typically find more profound. The underlying thread lying through this book is how large of a positive or negative impact that parents can have in addition to genetic and environmental factors on a child's development and existence. This book is well-researched, and I commend Andrew Solomon's depth and breadth of interviewing. I will add the caveat that this is not a book that will delve too deeply into the science and research of the disabilities, conditions, and experiences mentioned in this book. There are cursory treatments about the science in each chapter, but there are copious amounts of citations that a reader can follow later on, should they want to learn more about the science of various conditions. What took this book a couple notches down for me was the chapter on prodigies, which became fairly repetitive in its focus on musicians and had a little bit too fawning of a tone (Andrew Solomon's love of classical music really shows here). The prodigies chapter stood out among the others with its repetition and lack of ""digging"" and ""prodding,"" for lack of better words. It really halted the momentum of the book for me. I feel that it would have been better to have examined a different condition, another one more shunned by society at large, instead. That said, I recommend this book for all adults who have already had some time to stew on their childhood and want to think more deeply about parenting and being parented. "

Narratives of resilience. A final chapter relates the author's notes on becoming a parent. Music can liberate people immured in almost any kind of silence.

Many people fall short of their potential through lack of discipline, but a visit to the coal mine will amply demonstrate that hard work on its own neither constitutes genius nor guarantees riches.

""Our love for our children is almost entirely situational, yet it is nearly the strongest emotion we know. I had thought the heroic parents in this book were fools, enslaving themselves to a life's journey with their alien children, trying to breed identity out of misery.

209,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19020907-amy-edwards,3,"I’m putting this book in my “read” pile, although truthfully I did not read several of the sections and skimmed a few of the others, while still others I read closely and completely. Far From The Tree tells many, many stories of families caring and loving for children quite different from themselves. Sorted into major categories, there are chapters on the Deaf, Dwarfness, Down syndrome, Autism, Schizophrenia, disability, prodigies, and other categories of exceptionalism. I found some of the sections (rape, crime, transgenderism), quite frankly, too heavy for me to read. Solomon combines a compassionate account of families’ stories with research explaining the medical science or social science behind the cause of the exceptionalism.At its core, Solomon is interested in how families cope with bringing up children who are most definitely not like themselves. And indeed, reading of the bravery, love, and sacrifice of parents is moving, inspiring, and heart-wrenching.My worldview is radically different from the author’s, but for the most part he faithfully reports his research as a compassionate observer. However, to be sure, his framing device has everything to do with his own feeling of being far from the tree, as the gay child of straight parents. Likewise, he closes the book with an account of his own experience in fatherhood, which is decidedly non-traditional and dependent on donors, surrogacy, and legal documents establishing just who, in fact, holds parental ties to the offspring."
210,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14468-joyce,5,"A compassionate exploration of what it means to be the parent of a child with an impairment or difference. Solomon goes deep into the subcultures of the deaf, dwarfism, autism, and even the group of parents whose children commit heinous crimes.“Impairment is not a tragedy, but it is not irrelevant. It is a predicament.” First among the predicaments for a parent is deciding what to do. “Genetic selection has moved from nazi administration to modern doctor’s office.” The burden of choice for parents who know their child’s diagnosis in advance of the child’s birth is overwhelming. That knowledge increasingly skews towards wealthier families - who often terminate - meaning impairment makes a demographic shift towards poorer people.Then parents must decide the degree to which they are willing to medicalize their child’s differences. Cochlear implants, ‘limb lengthening’ - modern medicine presents all sorts of interventions with enormous downsides.Often the children themselves are more accepting of their differences: “...parenting a dwarf seems to be emotionally harder than being a dwarf” - based on measures of contentedness. “Dwarfism, deafness ... are a stigma, a handicap, a source of pride and a prerequisite for membership in a complex, charismatic and highly exclusive culture.”ASL is “language through muscles other than those in the mouth and throat.”So much progress in understanding and finding therapies has depended upon the wealth of couples who find themselves parents of a child with a disorder. Starting schools, funding research - there’s often an investment banker parent in the picture.Parents of children with differences can often find support from other parents. The exception is parents of children who have committed terrible crimes. In the eyes of the world, parenting a child who commits a crime is not a misfortune - it is a fault."
211,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7763278-jenni-v,4,"Don't be discouraged by the heft of the book; only 702 of 962 pages is actual text and the rest are notes, bibliography, index, etc. :)This is a really good summary of the book:  ""The timeworn adage says that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, meaning that a child resembles his or her parents; these children are apples that have fallen elsewhere - some a couple of orchards away, some on the other side of the world. Yet myriad families learn to tolerate, accept, and finally celebrate children who are not what they originally had in mind. This transformative process is often eased and sometimes confounded by identity politics and medical progress - both of which have infiltrated households to a degree that would have been inconceivable even twenty years ago.""Even though he wrote the research in an accessible way, the pages turn slowly but were fascinating to read. There were definite ups and downs; the part about autism dragged the most for me. With the other sections there is a clear genetic thing so he would explain it and move on to anecdotes but since there are so many theories on the causes of autism, he got a little bogged down in the ""why"" kids are different than their parents when the book is about ""how"" they are. This is also the reason the section on dwarfism read super fast for me; there was much more anecdotal information than medical. I was also fascinated by Krishna's story and would read an entire book just on him and his family.I found this perspective from Deirdre Featherstone very interesting and good way to look at parenting children with disabilities: ""All my friends had these children they thought were perfect, and then they've had to come to terms with their children's limitations and problems. I had this baby everyone thought was a disaster, and my journey has been to find all the things that are amazing about her. I started off knowing she was flawed, and all the surprises since then have been good ones.""This is an interesting perspective that I believe has truth in it as well: ""While some people with severe disabilities may experience acute health crises or frightening seizures, much of their care has a rhythm, and human nature adapts to anything with a rhythm. The care can be done competently. An extreme but stable stress is easier to handle than a less extreme but erratic one. This is one reason why parents of people with Down Syndrome have an easier time than parents of schizophrenics or of people with autism; with Down syndrome, you know with whom you are dealing from day to day, and the demands on you change relatively little; with schizophrenia, you never know what weirdness is about to strike; with autism, what meltdown moment.""I'm glad the author included prodigies as well. As the interviews showed, it's sometimes just as hard to fit in when you have an adult brain in a child's body as it is to have a child's brain in an adult body.It was also an unique choice to include children born to mothers who had been raped but it fit with the theme of the book because even though there's not a genetic aspect to this, there is a definite stigma and struggle for both mother and child to reconcile the result with the cause.There were themes of internal and external blame, especially on mothers, throughout. The traumas and light sentences mentioned for filicide made me sick. To quote from the book, ""As the vast majority of these sentences suggest, the habit of the courts has been to treat filicide as an understandable, if unfortunate, result of the strains of raising an autistic child. Sentences are light, and both the courtroom and the press frequently accept the murderer's profession of altruistic motives."" A few examples -- In 2005, Patrick Markcrow, age thirty-six, was suffocated by his mother, who received a two-year suspended sentence. In 2006, Christopher DeGroot was burned to death when his parents locked him in the house and set it on fire - each of them sentenced to six months in jail. In 2007, Diane Marsh killed her son, Brandon Williams, age five; the autopsy said he had died of multiple skull fractures and an overdose of Tylenol PM tablets; his legs were covered in burn scars because his mother used to discipline him by dipping him into scalding water.Growing up with a sister with Down Syndrome, I completely related with Emily Perl Kingsley when she said this about her son Jason (who also has Down's): ""The primary job of most parents is to make their kids think they can do anything; my primary job is to take him down. Reduced to a sentence, it's 'You're not smart enough to do what you want to do'. Do you know how much I hate having to say that?"""" A Few Quotes from the Book (all quotes are from the author unless otherwise cited)""From the beginning, we tempt [our children] into imitation of us and long for what may be life's most profound compliment: their choosing to live according to our own system of values. Though many of us take pride in how different we are from our parents, we are endlessly sad at how different our children are from us.""""""Other people have no idea what it's like to be me. But then, I have no concept of what it's like to be normal."""" ~ Taylor van Putten""I did not/ Only lose you in an instant;/ I abandoned the infinite possibilities/ Of what you might have become."" ~ Jennifer Franklin""Four years later, when they finally interred Sam's ashes, Sara said, ""Let me bury here the rage I feel to have been twice robbed: once of the child I wanted, and once of the son I loved.""""""""It is not a joyful thing, by any means, to have a special-needs child. But Max, himself, has given us a lot of joy."""" ~ Susanna Singer""Parents of prodigies are intimidated and awestruck at what their children can do - but so, fittingly, are parents of children who are not prodigies. Remembering that is the surest way to remain sane when parenting a child whose skills dramatically differ from or radically exceed one's own.""""Any of us can be a better version of himself, but none of us can be someone else.""Find all my reviews at: http://readingatrandom.blogspot.com"

I was very sensitive and emotional as a child and my parents were very stoic so I always felt like a misfit. I would be told to toughen up or stop wearing my heart on my sleeve. This book didn't really address my experience but I could relate to all the examples with how these children might have felt different.My daughter has high functioning autism and we have found a lot of difference in her responses to us. After reading this book, I looked up the article, ""Welcome to Beirut,"" and I can totally relate. Some days things are good and I have hope but then my daughter explodes and we are all shell-shocked from it. I'll also agree that using the internet makes things so much easier for my daughter because she doesn't have to worry about emotion - be it good or bad. This book looked at a variety of issues from being gay, disabled, deaf, transgender, and such that may make a child feel so different from the parents. Being a parent is hard work but we need to try to accept the children we have. The road may be bumpy and not always pretty but the final destination is worth it."

A dear friend gave this to me several years ago for Christmas and I read the first couple of pages over and over but couldn't get much further. The first page says this: “Parenthood abruptly catapults us into a permanent relationship with a stranger.""That was enough for me to mull over for a long time. When I came back to the book this fall and flipped through it, that first statement no longer rang like a bell; I'd been living in its resonance for years. I could finally absorb more of the book.That first sentence that hit me went on, and I understood the rest of it now: “Parenthood abruptly catapults us into a permanent relationship with a stranger, and the more alien the stranger, the stronger the whiff of negativity… Loving our own children is an exercise for the imagination.” It wasn't until I finished the book, whose chapters I read out of order and sometimes skimmed, that I understood the meaning of the title, which of course was explained in the first several pages while my head was still spinning over the ""permanent relationship with a stranger."" These stories are about kids (apples) who fell far from the tree (their parents). Sometimes I am embarrassingly slow on the uptake. Oh well. As the parent of kids who fit that description, this book is a balm. The cover blurb from PEOPLE says that it is a ""brave, beautiful book that will expand your humanity""; I agree."

On the positive side, it will open your eyes as to how humans think, and it will make you more compassionate. On the negative, I thought that it rambled, and sometimes strayed from the subject.As to the conclusions drawn by Mr. Solomon, I cannot judge their accuracy. For more on his conclusions, be sure to read the review and op-ed by Lisa (A. Goldstein) on this page.However, I thought it interesting that having finished the book last night, I watched episode 2 of Ken Burns' The Gene (https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/the-gene/) this morning. About halfway through was an interview with a dwarf woman that confirms Solomon's thoughts in the Dwarfism chapter.So, any flaws (perceived or real) aside, I still think the book is worth the read."
215,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/63236603-larkin-tackett,4,"This book took me nearly a year to finish. I first heard Andrew Solomon's Ted Talk about identity and learned later that my wife uses sections of this book in her special education class about Normalcy. While it sometimes reads like an encyclopedia about childhood identity and the reaction of their parents, I learned a ton about everything from dwarfism to deafness, transgender to schizophrenia. Solomon writes, ""Life is enriched by difficulty; love is made more acute when it requires exertion."" A number of stories in his book and my own experiences reinforce this point. Autism expert Simon Baron-Cohen tells Solomon during this research that, “Autism is both a disability and a difference. We need to find ways of alleviating the disability while respecting and valuing the difference.” This could be said about each identity described in this book.  "
216,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1229555-rich,5,"A wonderful, horrible, sad and beautiful book all at once. Solomon tells important stories in this book, challenging what is ""normal"" in a society obsessed with perfection and scared outliers (physical, mental, cognitive, appearance, etc...). The book is quite thick, but it does not need to be read in any particular order. Each chapter tells the stories of different groups of people (little people, the physically disabled, the deaf, transgender, etc...) and how these groups have struggled and created their own communities. I was tempted to say ""this book should be read by every parent"" but that is too limiting. This book should be read by everyone. Its a story that reminds us of what we all need to survive and to give: compassion. "
217,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1887399-marie,5,"I loved this book. I appreciated that the author rarely seemed to back one specific approach to ""dealing with"" a disability and showed multiple sides and different opinions among people in each specific group. The only part of the book that was problematic for me was the ""Rape"" chapter. Here the author seemed to break from the topic of children who share an identity and the relationship with/affect that identity has on families to a focus soly on the affect of rape on individual (and groups of) women. Although pregnancy and the resulting children were addressed, most of what he writes here is completely applicable to women whose rapes do not result in pregnancy. The focus was significantly shifted."

It was a tough read for many reasons and it read like a text book at times. It was insightful and helped me look at disabilities and relationships between parents and children in a new way. I especially liked the parts about identity & societies influence. He explores the age old question nature vs. nurture? Something I think about often. Highly recommend!"

I struggled with the inclusion of the chapters on rape-conceived children and criminality-- these just seemed such vastly different categories and experiences from all the others-- and the stories of trauma and disfunction in those chapters were so hard to stomach. But otherwise, this was an astonishing book that has changed the way I think about illness, identity, and parenting. Solomon has a special way of writing about the very hardest parts of life and pulling some joy and triumph from them: ""Tragedies with happy endings."""

I didn't always agree with the author's world view or assumptions, but the narratives and the careful analyses of the philosophical and scientific debates still provided inspirations and opportunities for learning. Please keep an open mind and an open heart to listen to the voices. The author did an admirable job of being fair and providing multiple points of view on the issues. It will be tempting to selectively read only those chapters focused on topics most interesting to you, but my experience is that the unexpected insights from those other chapters were well worth my time investment. This book substantially contributed to a re-examination of my assumptions and commitments. Interestingly, I was also reading ""Love Thy Body"" by Nancy Pearcey simultaneously with this book. The cross-pollination and cross-examination of ideas between the two almost diametrically opposing world views provided an especially fruitful field for reflection."

The author poured years of research, interviews and himself into this book, never refraining from creating a masterpiece with the size of an encyclopedia."
231,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13836446-kyle-ryan,5,"This was a really good book. When I first picked up “Far From the Tree”, coming in at a touch over 700 pages, the ceiling I envisioned was one where I would finish the book, clap my hands together, and think, “wow – that book was a goddamn tour de force.” Which I did. However, I didn’t expect that I would ever think that the book was concise and efficiently written. But I did. And I also didn’t think that the book would reshape how I broadly think about people, individuality, identity, and parental love. But it did that too. I recommend this book to literally everybody.From the first page, this book is shot out of a cannon. The themes that will be grappled with and tethered together through each of the twelve chapters are introduced very early on and give a framework for thinking about the similarities and differences of each circumstance. In a nutshell, before parents become parents, the (sometimes unconscious) hope is that offspring are little ‘mini-me’s’ that will immortalize the parent into the next generation. And then dreams are crashed when ‘mini-me’ turns out to be a totally different entity altogether and the parent realizes that they’ve produced rather than reproduced. The burn is especially acute with respect to “horizontal identities” i.e. traits that aren’t a part of the parent’s make-up. Generally, the parent has to separate at some level from the child and allow the child to find other people with the same horizontal traits in order to maximize the child’s happiness and potential. The idea of a horizontal identity is universal, but is especially compelling to explore in these more extreme scenarios. The book is particularly brilliant in its perspective. The author consistently keeps the focus on the parents, which in many ways is the more interesting story. In most of these circumstances the child’s condition is what it is, it’s always been that way, and they learn to deal with the condition as best as they can. With the parents, there’s a sting of unfulfilled expectations and/or a dream that never came to fruition. The ability or inability of the parent to recalibrate their perspective and deal with the situation in a way that is beneficial to their child is fascinating. One inspiring mother of a child with Down’s Syndrome had the following to say: “All my friends had these children they thought were perfect and then have had to come to tens with their limitations and problems. I had this baby everyone thought was a disaster and my journey has been to find all the things that are amazing about her.” That line made me have one of those cry/smile moments. When talking about this book to people, a couple have asked, “which one was the worst? Which one would you least look forward to as a parent?” The more I’ve thought about it, I don’t think there’s a right answer because one thing you see in these stories is that the attitude and empathy is more important than the condition. Each of these chapters has examples of people who rise to the occasion and make the best out of difficult circumstances and end up “grateful for experience they would have done anything to avoid.” That being said, being the parent of a child conceived in rape would be rough as the child is a constant reminder of one of the most horrifying moments of the parent’s life and nurturing the child in effect carries on the legacy of the mother’s rapist.  I could ramble on for 10 pages about this book, but I’ll cut it short. That being said, I need to mention how well the author thinks and writes. After reading this book, I basically want to read everything else he’s written and try to model my perspective more towards his. Throughout the book, in the face of really difficult topics, he's so good at reserving opinion and judgment. But when it comes time to offer his perspective, it's so abrupt and lucid and makes what was a moral quandary into something extremely clear and obvious. I was especially blown away at the end of the deaf chapter. He had spent 50 pages laying out compelling arguments for both deafness as a disability that should be treated with technology like cochlear implants, but then also gave the perspective of lots of deaf people and deaf parents who found an identity in deaf culture, don’t think of deafness as a disability, and find having parents give their children cochlear implants as a form of genocide of a subculture. I was torn and wasn’t sure how I’d answer if I were the parent of a deaf child faced with the cochlear implant decision. Then the author offered his perspective…”One thing has no bearing on the other. You can admire deaf culture and still choose not to consign your children to it. The loss of diversity is terrible, but diversity for diversity's sake is a lie. A deaf culture kept pure when hearing is available to all would be the equivalent of those historical towns where everyone lives as if it's the 18th century.” Drop. The. Mic. "

Often they say the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, but Solomon examines what happens when children turn out very different than what parents expect. Personal histories are shared by families with children facing a wide variety of differences: deafness, autism, prodigies, dwarfs (little people) and many more. Parents describe the adaptations to their expectations, and a wide range of emotions from rage to joy, but what struck me the most was the grace of parents who step up and do what most of us believe as impossible- until it becomes the reality. I think on smaller perspective this happens to most parents-loving our children for who they are. The first and last chapter are different because Solomon is describing his personal experience. This book changed me in a subtle but profound way."

The tension often has less to do twitch the severity of the child's disability than with the parent's coping skills, the dynamics among healthy members of the family, and the importance the parents place on how people outside the family perceive them. Income, time available to focus on the child, and support outside the family are all significant factors. Perhaps the most insidious stress is the social isolation that can ensue when friends retreat, or when parents withdraw from friends pity or incomprehension. The birth of a healthy child usually expands the parents social network; the birth of a child who is disabled often constricts that network.""-363""Studies have shown that people who observe parents of disabled children notice more stress than those parents themselves report""-366""The sadness of a poor prognosis is vastly easier than the chaos of no prognosis.

The parents may abandon the child when he goes to prison, which may lead the child to feel lonely, lost, isolated, and desperate.

It is such a well written, thoughtful, thought provoking and compassionate study of incredibly difficult situations.

238,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/99431481-tonia,5,"This books looks at what it means to be different, or more specifically, what it means to parent a child who is different. There are chapters on parenting children who are deaf, dwarfs, Down Syndrome, autistic, schizophrenic, disabled, criminal, prodigies, transgender or born after rape. The underlying message is that we are all different in some way and if we could just stop looking at what makes people different, we'd come to appreciate people for who they are.A recurring theme in the book is, what is or isn't a disability. For some deaf people, deafness is not a disability but a unique culture. One dwarf describes his situation as a 'predicament' rather than a disability i.e. it's only a problem because most other people are tall. If there were more dwarfs they'd be better catered for and, apart from medical complications, it would be no big deal.Accepting people with disabilities (or people in a predicament) for who they are, means avoiding two extremes: bullying people with disabilities and patronising them with offers of assistance and charity. Solomon suggests that people in lower socioeconomic groups are much more tolerant of difference, whereas affluent people strive for perfection and are more likely to reject children who are not seen as perfect.Solomon contrasts horizontal identity, that is traits we share with people outside our family, with vertical identity, or cultural heritage, which we usually inherit from our parents (unless they are migrants). People who share the same horizontal identity (having autism, deafness, dwarfism, genius etc.) often have more in common and can provide more support than family.The book explores a lot of issues. I spent almost a year slowly reading it. As a result, I feel much better informed about these issues."

Solomon offers profound insights and displays a great spirit of empathy. His expressiveness is technically exacting without ever sounding as though he is seeking to impress the reader. My only knocks against it included the following: 1. As the “voice actor” his voice is mildly abrasive; he has a PeeWee Herman-esque tonal quality, albeit deeper and more resonant, that I had to consciously bear with by focusing harder on appreciating the content rather than the delivery of the message. 2.Some of the chapters in the latter portion of the book, such as the criminality section, were more onerous for me to listen to - the vignettes became less illustrative of unique aspects of the condition and seemed more shock-value oriented and tedious than in the earlier chapters (but that may reflect my bias and personal interests in more of the purely mental health conditions at the outset of the book). Really loved this one, much as I did Noonday Demon. Solomon is an author I would read without any need to gauge popular feedback, because he has shown me enough genius and bona fides that I do not doubt his future works will be worth my time."
240,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5472059-kristin-strong,4,"Andrew Solomon takes on the giant topic of parents and children whose identities are not parallel in this 700-page book.Typical parents of children with various disabilities, of children with extraordinary abilities, of children who exhibit criminal behavior, of children born after rape, of transgender children, discuss their journeys. Some are accepting, some less so, of their lots (and of their children's). There is great love here, and great despair, and sometimes great joy (often mixed in with despair, or blooming in its aftermath). Solomon talks with folks in Deaf culture, in dwarf culture, dealing with Down syndrome, and caring for their profoundly disabled children. He deals with many of the issues facing these different groups, such as cochlear implants among the Deaf, limb lengthening in the dwarf community, genetic selection for or against various traits, and ""reparative"" therapy for homosexual or transgender individuals. Here is not the question of what lives matter, but of how all lives matter, and to whom.Even in 700 pages, Solomon can't comprehensively cover everything; there's enough material for multiple books in every chapter (and I'm sure those books have been or will be written). But he does address the relationship between parents and children whose lives drastically differ, and that is a meaningful enough aspect of human experience to merit consideration from many angles."

It has been called, among other things, 'a monumental book' (Stephen Pinker), 'a landmark, revolutionary book' (Jennifer Egan), and 'the most amazing book I've ever read' (Curtis Sittenfield).Throughout Far from the Tree, Solomon, a lecturer of psychiatry at Cornell University, draws upon interviews with over three hundred families, and studies those with such conditions as dwarfism, Down's Syndrome, disorders which occur within the autism spectrum, children born of rape and those convicted of crime. He also examines the way in which prodigies can be 'surprisingly similar to those with disabilities'. In Far from the Tree, he aims to discover what happens when children are radically different to their parents, and in doing so, he 'celebrates repeated triumphs of human love and compassion to show that the shared experience of difference is what unites us'.In his introduction, Solomon states that 'parenthood abruptly catapults us into a permanent relationship with a stranger, and the more alien the stranger, the stronger the whiff of negativity'. He goes on to set out 'vertical identities', in which 'most children share at least some traits with their parents', and 'horizontal identities', where 'someone has an inherent or acquired trait that is foreign to his or her parents and must therefore acquire identity from a peer group'. 'All offspring are startling to their parents,' Solomon writes, and 'these most dramatic situations are merely variations on a common theme'.Solomon's interest in writing such a study began in 1993, when he investigated Deaf culture for the New York Times, and he couples this with the fact that he himself, a homosexual and a sufferer of dyslexia, is 'different'. Coming to terms with the things which set him apart from others has made him want to identify a wealth of differences, and how what sets them apart from the masses often serves to make the child in question more treasured. He is a firm believer that 'difference unites us', and that 'to be entirely typical is the rare and lonely state'. The book has been split into ten sections which relate to a certain disability or trait which goes against the 'norm'. It begins with a chapter entitled 'Son', and ends with 'Father'.Throughout, Solomon writes so coherently, and makes his book an eminently readable one. His research is immaculate and far-reaching, and he weaves a wealth of facts into his narrative. The entirety of Far from the Tree has been crafted in such a way that it is not in the least overwhelming, even to readers who have not studied psychology in any depth before. The case studies within the volume, which are often very touching, are interspersed alongside the history of each condition, and Solomon writes of such diverse subjects as Alexander Graham Bell's leading of the oralist movement in the nineteenth century, which encouraged deaf people to use their voices; the way in which genetic information has been discovered over time; the origin of the genius; and the history of abortion within the United States. Somehow, the tone of his prose is both sad and hopeful.Solomon examines every possible way in which the child's differences in each case have impacted upon the lives of themselves and their families, from those parents who embrace the child and do everything within their power to allow it to blossom as far as possible, to those whose parents tried to brush the issues under the carpet, and caused deep-rooted problems as a result. He has also spoken to other researchers and specialists in each field, whose ideas he then builds upon. It is heartwarming to see that most of those whom Solomon speaks to have made the best of themselves despite - or, in some cases, because of - their disability or difference. He examines those who have paved the way for change for others - Clinton Brown III, for example, a dwarf, who addressed the board of the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority to tell them that it was incredibly difficult for disabled people to access the city's subway system.Far from the Tree is a far-reaching and fascinating study upon humanity, and upon those issues which affect many of us. It is intelligent and is certainly an important contribution to the field of child psychology."

I finished it! Now, to work back through my notes and write a coherent review... Here it goes...In Far from the Tree, Andrew Solomon explores the parent-child relationship at its most fraught, where difficult situations emerge and change the job description that parents perhaps expected. He looks at how families interact within themselves when children are born with a series of circumstances that somehow set them apart from their parents, and how parents deal with the reality of shifting expectations, grieving the loss of the child they thought they would have and accepting the child they do. The specific groups Mr. Solomon studied include children who are born deaf, as dwarfs, with Down syndrome, autism, children who develop schizophrenia, or who have other physical disability. He also includes child prodigies, children born from rape, children who commit crimes, and transgender children. (I have at least a passing familiarity with some of the groups, including Deaf, autism, and disability. Others I had honestly never thought much about before reading Far from the Tree.) Each chapter is a masterful weaving together of scientific studies and personal portraits that provide insights into these families' lives, and shows that ""the parental predisposition to love prevails in the most harrowing of circumstances.""Though all of the categories of differences discussed in this book cover a range of individuals who each have their own trials and challenges in relation to their situation, Mr. Solomon points out that none of us are immune to suffering. ""The raw grit of anguish will never be in short supply. There is enough of it in the happiest life to serve these instructive purposes and there always will be. We are more sympathetic to Holocaust survivors than to malcontent children of privilege, but we all have our darkness, and the trick is making something exalted of it."" With that in mind, he delves into the unique challenges of each horizontal identity group, looking for the parallels within each group, as well as the similarities with the others he interviewed. He presents a broad spectrum within each group, too, including those with vastly different experiences, opinions, and outcomes. A recurring theme is the ongoing struggle between defining many of these conditions as ""identities"" or ""illnesses."" For example, many members of the Deaf community shun the label ""disabled,"" claiming that Deafness is a culture, a point of pride and identity, and decrying the use of cochlear implants as a form of genocide. However, access to many services depends upon maintaining the status of deafness as a disability. Harlan Lane sums it up well: ""The dilemma is that deaf people want access and as citizens in a democracy have a right to access--access to public events, government services, and education--but when they subscribe to the disability definition in order to gain access, they undermine their struggle for other rights--such as an education for deaf children using their best language, an end to implant surgery on those children, and an end to efforts to discourage deaf births in the first place."" This was a constant balancing act for many parents, fighting for the care and intervention that would give their children the best possible chance to reach their potential, while not succumbing to self-hatred, negativity, or feelings of inferiority that may come from identifying with a marginalized label.Continue reading this review on my blog at Build Enough Bookshelves."

Some were enlightening, some puzzling, some almost voyeuristic and exhausting. All were human; setting difficult and often polarizing conditions in the light of those who live them every day. If I had one problem (apart from the prodigious length) with the work, it was the author's insistence on framing so much of the work through his own struggles. In essence: 'I know you're schizophrenic and struggling to mainstream your deaf autistic child with dwarfism, but let me tell you about the time my mom wouldn't let me have a pink balloon.' He walks the line of being the Tyra Banks of pop psychology."

250,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2090127-elizabeth-r,5,"Finally! I did it! I read the whole thing! It took me three library checkouts to do it, but I did!In theory I am interested in this book because of the work I do with children and families with developmental disabilities, but in reality it's just interesting to me regardless. The first half or 5/8 of the book was about children in populations I deal with routinely at work. The latter half or 3/8 was definitely populations I see little at all, at work or at home. First half/DD:These are ""my kids"" and I think it was easier for me to read these stories because I've seen the reality, and it's generally okay. Sometimes great, sometimes a daily struggle, sometimes easy. This reading was so familiar in content and so long ago in time that I don't have too much to say, other than that I enjoyed it. In particular, the chapter on multiple disabilities/severe & profound. There was a lot of joy in that chapter, though admittedly Andrew Solomon is sampling a rather wealthy sector of the population in a rather wealthy area of the country--not exclusively, but in large part. Prodigies:This was arguably the most interesting chapter to me. I'm not sure I've ever met a true prodigy, but as a classicly trained pianist and smarter-than-average person, I could relate at least tangentially to the kinds of things the kids were into. I couldn't relate at all to the parents, but I found the parallel between parenting kids with DD and kids who were prodigies fascinating. I had never thought about it before, but of course a parent would struggle to parent a prodigy at least as much as a child with DD. They are equally far outside the norm--which was the whole point Andrew Solomon was making. The last part:There isn't really a category here, except ""things generally viewed as negative and that I don't have much experience with"", which won't do the rest of you any good. And I don't think being transgender is negative at all. The chapter on children conceived in rape was very interesting to me, just in the huge variety of experiences for the parents and children. I think that might have been, for me, the epitome of a complex parenting situation. Where to even begin, and yet, these children are just kids. The children who are criminals are something we've seen before. The children who are transgender or somewhere not in the strict binary gender culture are something I don't think we've talked much about before, though they have always been a part of life. That was another very interesting chapter with an overall positive vibe, I thought, except for the story that had the Klan as a part of it. What happened to that family (view spoiler)[, specifically the poor, poor, dog, (hide spoiler)] is the only thing that I found truly disturbing in the entire book, something that I truly couldn't comprehend; something that broke my heart a little. It's right at the end, too, which is not the note I would want to end my book on, but there you are. Fatherhood:I was not interested in this, really, at all. I don't see parenting as a gay person as terribly far outside the norm, especially now, and it felt a little self-serving to both end the book with this and to include it at all. It felt like part of a different book that was tacked on. The rest of the book was clearly well-researched and, while not exactly clinical, was more professional. This sweet story about a nontraditional family being built four different ways was totally foreign, and felt like cotton candy after a perfectly engineered meal by a French chef. I skimmed it lightly, mostly to get rid of the aftertaste of the Klan story; it didn't completely work. Overall, this book is absolutely worth a read. I think it will become an oft-referred-to ""soft"" source on marginal populations. "
251,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4209176-allison,4,"This is a weird rating for me - I am giving it four stars because it was a good, well written, well researched book. However, I didn't particularly enjoy it. In fact, I was quite disappointed by it - I read about it last summer, got on the library waiting list for it as soon as it came out, and cracked it open as soon as the 67 people in front of me had finished reading it... and then it took me a good month to finish it. Anyway: Andrew Solomon covers issues such as deafness, dwarfism, down syndrome, autism, schizophrenia, prodigies... children of rape, transgender children, disabled children... and examines what it means to their families to have a child who has a ""horizontal identity"" - an identity not shared by their immediate family. He draws upon his own experiences as a gay child of straight parents to start the book, and finishes it with his own experience of fatherhood. This bookending worked well, and he did not let his own personal experiences intrude too much into the middle (not about him) chapters - just enough to give readers perspective on the information he was sharing by including his own perspective on or feelings about it. I enjoyed the insights that he drew about various conditions, how they manifest socially in the world, and how that is changing. For example, how the rise of ASL as a popular ""hobby"" is interesecting with its decrease/emerging disappearance as an actual native language because of the increasing popularity of cochlear implants, and his examination of the schizophrenic pride movement. His interview of the parents of one of the Columbine shooters and some of his other case studies were fascinating, and examples that I've never encountered in any other book. If this were the first book that I'd ever read on any of these subjects, I may have devoured it. I also appreciated how he repeatedly made connections between the experiences of families in different chapters of the book, while acknowledging that the families themselves probably wouldn't see their experiences as at all similar.However, here's what didn't work for me, specifically, though it definitely worked for others. Andrew Solomon interviewed about 500 families over a period of what must have been 5-10 years for this book, and while he couldn't possibly have included all of their stories, it seemed like he tried to. Personally, I've read a good number of his source works, for example Intersex in the Age of Ethics by Alice Domurat Dreger which talks about a lot of the gender politics he covered, some of the autobiographies and memoirs of people that he interviewed, and innumerable works about deafness, schizophrenia, autism, down syndrome, etc. Thus, what I was really looking for from him was overarching conclusions about these conditions and their impact on families, or perhaps an examination of families' ways of adapting through... some psychological lens or something. Overarching theories illustrated with well-chosen examples from his interviews. What I got instead was a whole lot of case studies with some bits of tying-together in each chapter. And there's nothing wrong with that, it's just not what I, personally, wanted. Anyhow, though, four stars. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in but unfamiliar with these conditions, and to anyone who is trying to figure out how their own ""horizontal identity"" fits in with their ""vertical"" family. "
252,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4534250-dino,5,"This book is about horizontal differences, which are differences that we do not share with our parents. As Solomon keenly observes, “Although many of us take pride in how different we are from our parents, we are endlessly sad at how different our children are from us”. Toward the end of the book, Solomon states that “every child has a touch of the horizontal and reshapes his or her parents”.The heart of the book is Solomon’s examination, in considerable depth, of eleven horizontal differences: gayness, deafness, dwarfism, Down syndrome, autism, schizophrenia, disability, prodigies, children conceived by rape, crime, and transgender.Despite the ambitious nature of his book, spanning 11 subjects, 700 pages, and interviews with over 300 families, Solomon manages to do justice, indeed more than justice, to each topic. His exhaustive research, enormous compassion, and command over the literature make each chapter a marvel to read, intellectually and emotionally. Solomon tells the heartbreaking stories of the families whose experiences are unimaginable to most of us. However, as Solomon points out early on, “anomalous bodies are usually more frightening to people who witness them than to people who have them”.What binds the many children and their families together is the search for an identity and a sense of belonging. As Solomon observes, this search is enabled by the Internet and its “potential to sort people according to one shared value” and to make it possible for them to find one another and form a community. Solomon’s book, despite its enormous breadth, is subtle in the many paradoxes that it examines. For example, having a mentally disabled child is an extremely stressful experience that lasts a lifetime. Yet, many of the parents of such children find happiness and experience love not only in spite of, but because of, their child’s disabilities. As Solomon suggests, we resolve cognitive dissonance by “assimilating what is too late to change”. The struggle experienced by Solomon’s families’ centers on deciding the degree to which it is appropriate or desirable to attempt to normalize difference. For example, how much support and encouragement should parents lend to such procedures as cochlear implants for the deaf, limb lengthening for dwarfs, prenatal screening for Down syndrome, or hormones to block puberty for transgender children? The underlying theme is to what degree ought we to regard difference as illness, fixable via medical interventions, versus identity, conditions inseparable from the self. And deeper still lays the question about what kind of life is worth living and who adjudicates such decisions. Solomon states toward the end of the book that his goal is to “emulate what is best in his father and his mother, in the life of the mind, to which men often stake first claim, and that of the heart, in which women usually have the upper hand”.In reading this book, there can be no doubt that Solomon achieves his objective, in flying colours. His book is filled with the wonderful, tearful stories of his families, to which Solomon lends his logical analytical mind. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is either struggling with the kind of differences chronicled in this book, or to those who are just interested in reading about them. "
253,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7303274-caroline-bell,5,"This is the best book I read all year. Have I already written that this year? I don't think so. If I did, I take it back. Far from the Tree wins.Now here's the thing: I am someone who typically reads a good book in four to five days. I just sort of have that time to spend (living in a Cambodian village and all...) and when I get into a book I can't put it down. I started reading Far From the Tree in November 2012. I just finished it a week ago, June 2013. This is, by far, the longest amount of time I have spent reading one book. Why? Because the book, while incredibly engaging and thought-provoking, is very long and very thorough. It causes the reader to slow down, consider the text, reread it and then immediately turn to the person next to them and engage in conversation about the sixteen different profound points that were just made on one single page. I don't think I have talked about any other book to so many different people. It sticks with you. Also, because each chapter is about one particular disability, one can be pondered in isolation for a while, before moving on to the next.Basically, each chapter explores a specific subset of people with a certain disability. The topics range from Dwarfism to deafness to Down Syndrome. Criminals, children of rape, prodigies and those with multiple disabilities are also covered. And that is to name only a few. Each chapter delves into over ten years of research and conversation with families of people with disabilities, as well as those who experience the disability firsthand. The book seeks to establish the ideas that (a) many people with disabilities consider themselves to be part of a subculture that is both positive and inclusive, and which benefits the rest of society and the word by its mere existence and (b) parents and families of these disabled individuals have a shared experience, even if the specific disability varies. Therefore, the mother of a child with Down Syndrome and the mother of the Columbine killer Dylan Klebold have a more shared parenting experience than either woman has with the mother of a typical child. Interesting, right?Furthermore, Solomon posits that even in the most dire of cases, parents of disabled children would choose to keep their own life experience (and their own child), instead of a life without their disabled progeny, even if the latter may be easier and more socially accepted. Each chapter is overflowing with complex, real-life scenarios about living as or with a disabled person. FftT covers new technologies and the pros and cons of medical progress changing the face of disabilities in the United States, a la cochlear implants and prenatal screening for DS. It includes hundreds of conversations with actual individuals from all sides of the conversation: researchers, doctors, disabled people, family members, etc. The stories are utterly gripping and Solomon's arguments are clear and well thought out. I could go on, but really you should read the book. If you can't, he did a short TED talk about his book which covers the main ideas and will give you a taste of the content. Every teacher and parent should read this book. Really, everyone should."
254,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1373260-jaclyn-day,5,"This is a substantial book in every possible way. The total number of pages are 962, but some of that includes the bibliography and index. The actual book portion clocks in at a dense 702 pages. The subject matter is impeccably researched (Solomon spent years interviewing hundreds of subjects). The chapters are labeled by spartan titles: Deaf, Dwarves, Autism. Solomon can write provocatively—the book is certainly not fully objective—but his tone is so measured and his points so succinct that I feel it would have been a lesser book without those observations.It’s not an easy book to read and, frankly, it shouldn’t be. Discussing children and parenting is a minefield on the most innocuous of topics (breastfeeding, anyone?), but when you step into the world of autism or Down Syndrome or children born of a rape, there are layers of complexities and internal politics that most of us cannot begin to comprehend. Save for this book, of course.This book challenged everything I felt I knew about parenting. My struggles seem trivial, stupid and privileged when compared to some of the heartwrenching and selfless chronicles of parents within the book. Keep in mind, though, that Solomon developed close enough relationships with his interview subjects that they spoke very candidly to him. Their accounts are not always heart-breaking because they are groomed for an Oprah-type, hope-filled interview. They are heart-breaking because they are honest. They are always tired, often bewildered and, in most cases, caught between a place of hopelessness and a place filled with unconditional love. As I read, I often caught myself thinking, “I don’t think I could do that.” How many of the interviewees in this book would have thought the same once upon a time? For the many parents interviewed in the book who have sacrificed everything for their children: their honesty and their determination is admirable beyond comparison.On the other hand, there are some accounts of absolutely despicable abuse. It’s a theme that runs through nearly every chapter of the book: abuse, abuse, abuse. Abuse of the parent. Abuse of the child. Abuse of the wife or girlfriend or stranger. The chapter on rape was extraordinarily hard to read.Blogging or reading other blogs or seeing bloggers on Instagram feeds a particularly unique and privileged view of a modern family lifestyle. It’s an insulated bubble of perfection—scarcely marred by divorce, let alone the topics covered within this book. I’ve read blog posts defending accusations of “perfection” by arguing that they want to only show what is positive and what is beautiful because that is uplifting. That’s fine. That is your prerogative. But do not forget that it is also a privilege. As I read over and over again in this book, there is the possibility of a fault line that could change everything in each of our lives.So, please read this book. It may challenge or affirm everything you know about parenting. It will teach you something. Every page was an eye-opening, thought-provoking one for me. The words “identity” and “acceptance” and “love” took on new meaning. It should be required reading for anyone contemplating children or already expecting one. It’s a remarkable, substantial book. You won’t regret reading it."

But it will be you ruined life you're talking about. So make a life for yourself in which you can feel happy, and in which you can love and be loved, because that's what's actually important.""""You can love someone but not accept him; you can accept someone but not love him. I wrongly felt the flaws in my parents' acceptance as deficits in their love. Now, I think their primary experience was of having a child who spoke a language they'd never thought of studying.""""Modern life is lonely in many ways, but the ability of everyone with access to a computer to find like-minded people has meant that no one need to be excluded from social kinship. if the physical or psychic place to which you were born wants no more of you, an infinitude of locales of the spirit beckons. Vertical families are famously breaking down in divorce, but horizontal ones are proliferating. If you can figure out who you are, you can find other people who are the same.""***""There is no contradiction between loving someone and feeling burdened by that person; indeed, love tends to magnify the burden.""""A Buddhist scholar once explained to me that most Westerners mistakenly think that nirvana is what you arrive at when your suffering is over and only an eternity of happiness stretches ahead. But such bliss would always be shadowed by the sorrow of the past and would therefore be imperfect. Nirvana occurs when you not only look forward to rapture, but also gaze back into the times of anguish and find in them the seeds of your joy. you may not have felt that happiness at the time, but in retrospect it is incontrovertible.""""For some parents of children with horizontal identities, acceptance reaches its apogee when parents conclude that while they supposed that they were pinioned by a great and catastrophic loss of hope, they were in fact falling in love with someone they didn't yet know enough to want. As such parents look back, they see how every stage of loving their child had enriched them in ways they never would have conceived, ways that are incalculably precious. Rumi said that the light enters you at the bandaged place.""""Empathy and compassion work best in concert with the belief that you are still capable of shaping a meaningful life for yourself and your family. The technical term for this is internal locus of control, wherein one determines one's own trajectory, rather than external locus of control, wherein one feels entirely subject to outside circumstances and events. To achieve an internal locus of control, people actively seek to match their lifestyles with their priorities...however, parents of disabled children often achieve a feeling of control by making a firm and positive affirmation of their lack of control. The most important thing, often, is a belief in something bigger than on's own experience.""""Jail concentrates human emotions because it confiscates so many normal human actions and robs the inmate of so many ordinary decisions: what to eat, when to eat it, when to shower, and on and on. When you are not on the street, fending for yourself, running from crime to crime, taking drugs that banish the world, you are compelled into reflection. In this pensive state, prisoners dwell on love and hate, on reunion and vengeance.""""Acknowledging difference need not threaten love; indeed, it can enrich it.""***""Any of us can be a better version of himself, but non e of us can be someone else.""""Incorporating exceptional people into the social fabric is expensive and time-consuming. The emotional and logistical calisthenics can be draining. yet if parents often end up grateful for their problematical children, then so, in the end, can we all be grateful for the courage such people may embody, the generosity they may teach us, even the ways they complicate the world.""""When I was born, the common view was the nurture decided almost everything. Int he decades the followed, the emphasis shifted to nature. Int he last twenty years, people have talked more broadly about the intricate was that nature and nurture propel each other. I was intellectually persuaded by this nuanced integration, but the experience of having my own children has made me wonder if a third element is involved, some unknowable inflection of spirit or divinity. One's children are so specific, and the notion that they wouldn't exist if one hadn't conceived them at the moment one did feels impossible.""""Subjectivity may be truer than objectivity. The idea has some resonance with parenting. Most of us believe that our children are the children we had to have; we could have had no others. They will never seem to us to be happenstance; we love them because they are our destiny. Even when they are flawed, do wrong, hurt us, die--event hen, they are part of the rightness by which we measure our own lives. Indeed, they are the rightness by which we measure life itself, and they bring us to life as profoundly as we do them.""""It must be easier to lead a life in which you are not constantly inventing all the roles, in which there is a script to follow. We have often felt like Christopher Columbus landing for the first time on the wilder shores of love, and while being a pioneer can be thrilling, sometimes one would prefer a place where the roads have already been built and the Internet access is wireless. Most people expect to have children, and certain susceptibilities are attached to that; I had expected not to have children, and the reversal contains stranger ones. We have made many careful, thoughtful decisions, but so much of how we've worked it out wasn't actually rooted in choice. Like other parents, I simply lived my life from day to day until the unusual became quotidian.""""I have said that parents do not reproduce, but create. In fat, we also discover.""""I sometimes think of my life as forty years of toil up some steep hill, and then I joined hands with John, and then with Blain, and then with Tammy and Laura, and in a different way with everyone else chronicled in this volume. Somehow the lot of us made it to the crest, and when I looked out, i saw all creation spread a t my feet. I had ono idea, when I was hiking, that this was what I was climbing toward; forty years in the wilderness has never prepared anyone for this view.""""I do not accept competitive models of love, only addditive ones. ...love is a magnifying phenomenon--that every increase in love strengthens all the other love in the world, that much as loving on'es family can be a measns of loving God, so the love that existst within any family can fortify the love of all families. ...The affection my family have found in one another is not a better love, but it is another love,a nd just as species diversity is crucial to sustain the planet, this diversity strengthens the ecosphere of kindness. The road less traveled by, as it turns out, leads to pretty much the same place.""""While I mostly fell for the friends I adore because they are wise, kind, generous, and fun, I have loved them most acutely when they or I have been most sad, because there is a psychic proximity in desolate times that happiness does not match. ...As a parent, for all that I relish glee, I know that attachment happens when things turn dark. Parenting is an exercise in safety, and the perpetual menace of danger is what exalts parental love above affection; without the night terrors, the spiking fevers, the litany of bruises and woes, it would be a second-rate entertainment. It took me some time to understand that attention to one's children's needs is the essence of gratification. ...I want more than anything for my children to be happy, and I love them because they are sad, and the erratic project of kneading that sadness into joy ;is the engine of my life as a father, as a son, as a friend--and as a writer."""

I'd say this book certainly has appeal for educators, parents-to-be and parents, advocates for children and all people with special needs, people in healthcare, and therapists/counselors. When I opened to the table of contents, I thought some of the categories (some of the titles: Deaf, Dwarfs, Down Syndrome, Autism, Schizophrenia, Disability, Prodigies, Rape, Crime, Transgender, plus the author's own exploration of his identity as a gay man and, later, a father) seemed disparate and wondered how the author was going to weave this into a cohesive book... but he did. It is dauntingly long and as someone without children frankly a bit terrifying. But what unites each of these stories are the very stark differences from each other and from ""normal"" and ""average"" and ""normative."" The ways families dealt with each of their situations really weren't so different and were, in most cases, colored by love fiercely loyal and without reservation. Reading about families dealing with extraordinary circumstances and extraordinary children was humbling and also tragic at times.This book challenged preconceptions of mine; interestingly, some of those preconceptions I really hadn't even realized I had until reading. It was extremely uncomfortable for me to be faced with some of the anecdotes as I asked myself how I would react, how I would feel, how I would act. The personal stories of the families really forced me to become totally unjudgmental about the varying ways they dealt with their children's situations.I have a couple of problems with the book, though. First of all, while I think the amount of time and research that went into this book is nothing short of amazing, I almost feel like there is just too much going on in this book and that it touches on so many themes that it does a disservice to the content. As a teacher, I found myself focusing on the parents' point of view; however, a very important piece to this book is the focus on children's identities. I almost feel like I was experiencing brain overload with the different themes and topics (I guess this could be more my problem and not the author's!).I also had an issue the author's tone at times. In particular, I found him to be judgmental and condescending in the rape chapter in a way he avoided in other chapters. (He inserted a paragraph or two expressing his disbelief about the tendency of some women he met to date abusive men again and again). I was surprised because he withheld outright judgment throughout many other chapters of situations that he hadn't been through, yet he felt the need to point the finger back at rape victims. So as evidenced by this long and rambling review, this book is definitely thought provoking and worth reading. I plan on buying it to reread it more slowly in the future."

260,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1900005-sally-ewan,5,"This book is about people who are 'different' and how their families cope with it. It starts with the author's explanation of his own childhood, growing up gay and feeling like he didn't fit in, and how long it took for him to come to terms with his sexuality. He mentions his parents' response and how it affected him. Then he goes through various situations such as deafness, dwarfism, Down syndrome, autism, schizophrenia, criminal behavior, and transgenderism. In each section, he tells of families dealing with the issue, how they view it, and what society and/or the medical community can do to intervene. Since each issue is unusual and tends to separate one from regular society, the person(s) involved seek community with others with the same issue. Solomon writes eloquently, giving a moving view of how people see their situations, coming at times to celebrate their uniqueness and appreciate the growth it has compelled. This book really touched my heart, as I saw families dealing with incredibly difficult situations with love and perseverance. Although Solomon is very 'broad-minded' (subtle code for liberal and pagan), he writes with clarity about social issues and doesn't betray his bias very often. However, the concept of sin is not in his worldview, except in terms of judging others or being unwilling to celebrate whatever path one takes to 'find yourself'. I saw so clearly how the church has been seduced into making Love the paramount virtue when I read the final chapter about how he became a father. He and his husband decided to become parents, using his sperm and a surrogate mother. The surrogate mother was an acquaintance who had previously availed herself of his husband's sperm to produce two children which she was raising with her female partner. The author decided to have a child with his husband after he himself provided sperm for an acquaintance who wanted to have a child on her own (but then she met a guy who was willing to join this circus of life). Are you following this complicated explanation? I tell you this as a preface to his telling about sending out birth announcements: ""Some people scorn the idea of calling five primary parents and four children in three states a family...."" I assume some of you reading this are thinking, ""sounds great to me"", and others like me are wondering how exactly you can really have a family under such dire parameters? What is equally distressing is the end of that sentence: ""....or fear that the existence of our family somehow undermines theirs."" People do not seem to understand how the redefinition of 'family' will ultimately affect the stability of our society."

263,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/53686828-fm,5,"As a university instructor of special education, I want all my students who are future teachers to read this book. Solomon has written a moving, compassionate, and wide-ranging book that captures the complexities of families who experience having children who are somehow ""different."" There are chapters about the Deaf community, autism, dwarfism, and Down syndrome, and severe multiple disabilities, that describe many of the issues that parents and their children face in education and in the community as well as within their homes and extended families. Beyond disabilities, however, Solomon also includes chapters about children who are prodigies, mentally ill, children born as the result of rape (I found this chapter most harrowing), children who grow up to be criminals (including a stunning section on the Klebold family, whose son was one of the murderers in the Columbine High School shootings), and children who are transgender. Most interesting to me was how Solomon framed this book around the concept of ""identity""--he used the term ""horizontal identities"" to describe how children with differences relate to their parents and families. i found this a fascinating way to address the complex issues. On the face of things, one might wonder how the experiences of families of children who have Down syndrome, who are prodigies, and who grow up to be murderers could be similar. Solomon illustrates the similarities while clearly explaining how each family's situation is unique. The concept of identity--within a family, within a larger community--is a brilliant way of presenting these stories. Above all, I was struck by Solomon's sensitivity and compassion while describing the families in this well-researched book. He interviewed over 500 families and followed many for several years. He does not fall into easy stereotypes; his approach is neither ""bleeding-heart"" nor ""blame the victim,"" but instead a nuanced and thoughtful analysis of the issues that each family faces. I was constantly impressed throughout this long and detailed book how well Solomon seamlessly tied together themes, and built a moving narrative of acceptance and love despite all circumstances. I loved this book and have recommended it to my colleagues and friends and to anyone who is interested in nonfiction about special education, families, and how we are shaped by our identities. "
264,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/37675896-moira,5,"I was telling someone how much I ""enjoyed"" this book, and he expressed surprise that I would use that particular word to describe my experience of a book that is about, among other things, children with severe disabilities, children conceived during rape, and children who become criminals. The topics covered in the book are challenging, but Solomon has a thoughtful approach. One of his central points, is the diversity and complexity of parental response to atypical kids. While many parents go through a period of mourning and/or experience day-to-day hardships, they also find joy and meaning in their lives with their children. He also explores atypical identities that bring individuals pride and joy, and those that bring burden, suffering, or shame.This book is 702 pages of narrative, with another couple hundred pages of notes, which made me incredibly happy. Usually non-fiction is just too short and I'm left with a million questions. Solomon does a great job including multiple stories that illustrate his point about the diversity of experience. However, I'd be very surprised if his editor didn't try to make him cut it down and tighten it up. Solomon opens with the overarching theme of the book--the idea of horizontal identities, that is, identities not inherited vertically from a parent and instead tie the child to another identity group to which his/her parents don't belong. At various points in the book, this theoretical center slips away, overwhelmed by the power of individual stories. I was fine with that slippage, I love big, messy books, but I could imagine some readers finding in frustratingly meandering, particularly in the second section of the book.Solomon is a gay man and a gay dad. At the beginning and end of the book he talks about how these identities shaped his own life. On pages 692-693 (if you're reading on a Kindle you're SOL) he describes so many of the feelings I had as a lesbian-mom to be (regret at not being able to have a child that was genetically related to both me and B, uneasiness with the fertility industry) that I would like to just photocopy those two pages and hand them out to anyone starting the process or asking me nosy questions on the bus. If you are someone who likes non-fiction, particularly medical non-fiction, and enjoys a mix of personal stories and theory, I highly recommend this book."
265,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/826906-laura,4,"I am grateful to Solomon for the phrase ""horizontal identities"" which so neatly sums up a situation I've been trying to describe for years, which is that biracial children often experience a disconnect between their life experiences and their parents' ability to support them emotionally. Their parents may know what it is like to belong to a minority group, but they at least have a distinct cultural or ethnic group to which they belong, and most often, they grew up sharing a common identity with their own parents, something that children of a mixed relationship frequently do not get to do.These sentences from the final chapter sum up a point Solomon touched upon here and there, but that I wish he had emphasized more consistently throughout the book because it is important and obviously determined in many ways (perhaps most broadly in our society in the case of crime) the degree of hardship the families suffered: ""Nearly all the families I met are victims of the beliefs that have spawned that crisis of mobility: the assumption that betterment is a project undertaken by individuals on their own, in which the rest of us need not implicate ourselves. Yet, no one in any of the categories this book explores would have had a better life a half century ago.""Less flatteringly, I felt that this highly intelligent and privileged man who seemed to be sincerely trying to reach out and get to know others on their own terms sometimes lapsed into arrogance, as with this remark: ""In other words, Tolstoy can teach us to understand a farmworker, but farmworkers cannot in general give us insight into the metaphoric complexities of Anna Karenina."" I wonder how many farmworkers Andrew Solomon has known and why he rates them so poorly or feels their lives must be so transparent.I've read some critiques of mistakes he made, and in the section on prodigies his glancing reference to Brandenn Bremmer made me wonder if he'd read Eric Konigsburg's thought provoking New Yorker article - and whether digging into other examples in other chapters would reveal similar grey areas - but given the monumental size and scope of this book I think it is a worthy achievement deserving of careful attention."
266,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3758870-melody,5,"Far From the Tree is perhaps the greatest non-fiction book that I have ever read. It is luminous and extraordinary, lucid and clear eyed, heartbreaking and redemptive. A spare description is to say that Far From the Tree is about parents of exceptional children and their relationships with their children, the medical and educational communities, societal systems, and the greater world itself. Those few words though fail to even begin to capture the complexity of emotions, personality, and humanity that this book about. Framed by an introduction and a summation, each of the ten chapters deals with a specific condition; some of them conventional disabilities like autism, deafness, or down’s syndrome, and others less easily cataloged, like prodigies, criminals, and children of rape. Solomon draws from forty thousand pages of interviews he conducted over a decade with parents, children, doctors, educators, activists, and researchers. He discusses not only the spectrum of each condition but also the causes and treatments. He cites both cutting edge science and historical precedents. He debates controversies of limb lengthening, cochlear implants, sexual reassignments and executing children. But at its heart, Far From the Tree is about parent and child. What is it like to have a child that is vastly different than you, with experiences you can never really understand, who will likely fail to achieve the basic milestones of life? The parents in Far From the Tree run the gamut of reaction, some become activists and tireless supporters of their children, some try to endure to the best of their abilities, and some institutionalize, abuse, or even murder their children. Solomon never flinches from the complexity of his subject’s lives. The chapters on transgender children and the children of rape are especially heart-rending. Solomon is gay which gives him great insight into being a very different person than a parent expected and also is a parent which gives him the emotional insight of child-love. Far From the Tree is far from an easy read, it is long, extremely dense, and often emotionally wrenching. It is though an extremely worthwhile read that will touch your soul. "
267,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10615147-amber,5,"I became aware of this book after hearing an extended interview with the author on national public radio at the time that it was being released. I was riveted to my car radio during the entirety of the interview and was even late to a work appointment because of it! The subject matter and the intimate stories shared by the families chronicled in this book delve into what it means to be a parent, a child, and also just a human being in general. I feel like this is a very important book to read for everyone just simply for the fact that it opens your eyes up to some of the extraordinary challenges and struggles that people are fighting in the world around us that we often are not aware of or do not take the time to appreciate or attempt to understand. Being someone who works with individuals with disabilities, I expected to know much of the information about some of the conditions highlighted in this book but that was not the case as the facts were given in a fresh and compelling manner so that nothing felt like re-learning old information. The author does a great job of intertwining the narratives of the families that he interviews and gets to know with the facts and sometimes dueling beliefs behind each disorder or circumstance that he writes about so that the book is almost impossible to put down once you get into it. The book is not perfect-the forward is a little hard to get through, and for some reason I did not enjoy the chapter on prodigies in the same way as I did the other chapters- but I found that it opened my eyes and my heart in a way that I have not otherwise experienced reading non-fiction. The most impressive thing about the book I would say is the relationships that the author was able to establish with his subjects and the astounding level of compassion, tact and humanity that he presents his subjects with. He at once manages to be brutally honest in his depictions while still treating each individual in his book with the utmost human dignity. There are often deeply divisive viewpoints discussed in this book and the author does a stellar job of presenting both sides objectively and effectively. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone. "
268,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/714583-anita-pomerantz,5,"Solomon looks in incredible detail at what he terms ""horizontal identities"". Vertical identities are identities that parents share with their children i.e. race would be a vertical identity. Horizontal identities are ones where the characteristics are not necessarily shared with the parents i.e. transgender or autism or sometimes deafness. Solomon writes extensively on each of these various differences.He writes with incredible empathy, but really tries to show all sides of every issue. There are sides? Yes, there really are. If you are deaf, should you or should you not get a cochlear implant and at what age? What types of interventions are best for a child with autism? Forced medications or not for someone with Schizophrenia? There are actually an amazing number of issues and disagreements with how to proceed when a child manifests any of these issues. Limb lengthening for dwarfs? Parents disagree on all of these issues and more, but throughout Solomon shows respect for all the viewpoints while providing medical arguments and whatever evidence is available for the reader. And he also shows how parents often love these children as they are and don't wish them to necessarily be different. Just a very, very compelling read. I think they should excerpt some of this for use in schools to foster better understanding of differences.The amount of research this guy did was incredible. It is a lot of anecdote, but that is what truly brings the book to life. It was a sociological study, a psychological study, and yet also a true testament to the power of parental love.One thing I especially enjoyed is that the author didn't totally squelch his own opinions and insight out of the book. If he had some philosophical thoughts or perspective, he wasn't afraid to share those. I think that brought a humanity to the book that you wouldn't usually see in a non-fiction treatise that also has a bit of an academic bent to it.At any rate, I would highly recommend this book as it fosters humility, empathy, and understanding as well as a deep appreciation for one's children. And gratitude on my part for having such an easy life by comparison. And admiration for those who carry big burdens, often with such love and grace."
269,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2094975-cher,3,"This was a good book but not quite what I was expecting...I went into this book expecting it to be more about different personality types...parents who are quiet/reserved with children who are socially outgoing; parents who are detail oriented with children who focus more on the big picture. Admittedly I did not read any reviews or the ""book jacket"" before beginning this book in audio format but rather read one quick paragraph about this book. Once I began listening to the book the Library of Congress Annotation and book jacket (respectively) said in part:""Author...explores the ways families with children who are profoundly different from their parents redefine themselves"" and how they deal with ""deafness, autism, schizophrenia, transsexualism, criminality and more.""The author tells the stories of ""parents who not only learn to deal with their exceptional children but also find profound meaning in doing so....He writes about families coping with deafness, dwarfism, down's syndrome, autism, schizophrenia, multiple severe disabilities..."" So, immediately I knew this book wasn't really what I projected it would be about. I decided to keep reading and found it to be a good book that dealt well with complex and profound differences between parents and their children and that despite a parent's hopes, dreams and expectations for their children, our love shouldn't be contingent on our preconceived visions of who our children will become.Solomon talks about a child's ""Vertical Identity"" (identity traits shared by parents or family) and a child's ""Horizontal Identity"" (identity traits shared with other who are not parents or family). It's kind of an interesting distinction but I think the bottom line is (despite parent-child differences or similarities) that we offer our children as many paths as possible and help guide and accept them, the best we can, down which ever path they take. I am still looking for a book that gives parents specific examples and communication skills to deal effectively with their children (young or grown) when their differences are less profound than the situations in this book and are more differences in personality types."

271,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/25128473-tamim-sadikali,5,"Far From the Tree is Andrew Solomon’s magnum opus, a meditation on difference – or exceptionalisms – that can shatter the bond of familiarity between parent and child, casting each into a separate space. As the back cover blurb explains, ‘…sometimes your child – the most familiar person of all – is radically different from you. The saying goes that the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. But what happens when it does?’The premise is spellbinding, especially for a parent. Solomon’s perspective is based upon concepts of ‘horizontal’ and ‘vertical’ identities, with the latter being the “…attributes and values passed down … across the generations, not only through strands of DNA, but also through shared cultural norms.”Horizontal identity, on the other hand, is explained as:“…an inherent or acquired trait that is foreign to his or her parents and must therefore acquire identity from a peer group. Such identities may reflect recessive genes, random mutations, prenatal influences, or values and preferences that a child does not share with his progenitors.”And thus a physical or intellectual disability is likely to be a horizontal identity, as are autism and genius, psychopathy, as well as being gay or transgender.The author’s thesis is that these horizontal identities – all of them – cannot simply be viewed as ‘illnesses’; that is, something to eliminate or at least ameliorate, to reduce the dissonance that the bearer feels in relation to the majority, non-horizontal world. Rather, he sets up a paradigm of Identity and Illness, wherein a sense of self – in terms of one’s exceptionalism – firstly gets ratified, and then any treatment takes place within the framework of that Identity model. The body of the book is then given to illustrating – and validating – the same paradigm shift, through the testimony of parents and children who have lived through the eye of the storm, and come out on the other side, to enjoy happier, sunnier days.Read more of my review on Bookmunch"
272,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6493163-megan,3,"Solomon's meticulous and impeccable detail is a bit arduous at times, but it is this detail that conjures such vivid pictures of the lives of the parents and children he discusses. He intersperses the personal stories he spent ten years gathering in interviews with exposition on the condition of the chapter (e.g. autism, schizophrenia, deafness, etc.) artfully; sometimes I would have liked a bit less exposition and more personal story but the connection between the two was always clear even as he toggled back and forth. It's likely that you will be personally touched by this book; whether you have children or not, and whether you have someone in your life with one of the conditions he discusses or not, this book is an invitation to reflect on deep questions of identity, disability and love. In that way, this book is sorely needed.One potentially alienating aspect of this book is the lack of economic diversity in the families Solomon interviewed. In his lectures on mental illness (specifically depression), he reminds us that the poor can suffer from depression, too: we often overlook those with hard lives and thus ""understandable"" reasons to be down and out but ""down and out"" is not the same and depression. It didn't, however, seem like he much remembered the poor when doing his research for this book. Many of the families could afford top-notch and prolonged care for their children's treatments and needs; life changes a lot when you have to choose between upgrading your child's wheelchair and keeping the lights on. I always appreciate the chance to ask difficult questions. I also thrive on opportunities to respond. I don't want to turn real people into charity cases or objectify them for my own personal gain but I was particularly moved by some of the people and topics within this hefty book and am left without a clear way to express such. There is a fine line between pity and support; perhaps someone who has spent as much time with these issues, questions and people as Solomon has could provide some guidance for how to navigate the latter."

When I began it, I was not sure I could read about so many sad (I thought) issues that parents were dealing with on a day to day basis. Surprise! This was one of the most uplifting yet thought-provoking books that I have read in a long, long time. Instead of being pulled down by the hardships and impossibilities of the tasks facing many parents raising children who have identities which are foreign to their own (read Deaf, autistic, physically, sexual identity, mentally or emotionally disabled, etc), exactly the opposite happened. The reality of the parenting challenges and the personal grace and coping skills in these families that rise to meet those challenges, intersect to be most inspiring and their stories have deepened my empathies for all who face the challenges covered in the book, whether or not they are able to meet them. I have been well-informed by this book and also challenged in my beliefs about not only what it means to be human, but also how often those families don't think of themselves as ""anything special.""Andrew Solomon is a gifted storyteller and observer; he also does not avoid the personal implications of his ten years of research and has woven the stories of others into his own narrative in a deep and authentic way.I have one recommendation based upon my own experience reading Far From The Tree: If you read this book and feel that perhaps one or more of the chapters might not be for you, I encourage you to skip it until you have finished the last chapter. Then, go back and see if you feel differently."

The point was to write about children who end up different from their parents. Children conceived in rape are not different even though they were conceived differently. I felt it was odd to lump them in with kids who have autism, Down syndrome, etc. "
275,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/994266-angela,4,"""Far from the Tree"" is an incredibly ambitious book, that sets out to talk about ""horizontal identities"" - children who are significantly different from their parents - by looking at a few of the most extreme examples. It's not an exhaustive scientific discussion of any of the phenomena it looks at, but more an array of individual stories and experiences woven together to form a broader narrative on what it is like to parent an exceptional child. It also isn't an exploration of the more mundane types of differences between parents and their children, which is closer to what I was expecting the book to be. By tackling more extreme examples of exceptional attributes, and much more controversial ones at that, the author creates a book that is much more philosophically thought-provoking. As Solomon said during a radio interview I heard about the book, these challenges tend to magnify the kind of parents people would otherwise be: good parents become exceptional ones, and bad parents become horrendous. Indeed, every chapter provides examples of parents who are motivated through love to accept their children and even go on to become great advocates and leaders, occasionally embracing these identities more than the children do…as well as examples of horrifying cruelty. Solomon is occasionally a little long-winded, especially when talking about himself, but it helps to explain his interest in the topic and his ability to connect to a broad range of people. He picks very different examples of horizontal identities to investigate, and yet manages to find commonality in those experiences. It may not have been the easiest thing to read while expecting a child (and reading the multiple disabilities chapter right before and after that baby was born was perhaps even less advisable!), but in some ways it was the perfect time to ponder the journey into the unknown that parenting entails."

As an autistic person, I'm so tired of how much autism is misunderstood, and the extremely inaccurate information that keeps being spread causes severe issues, ignorance, and mistreatment from others. One big inaccuracy is that we lack empathy. We may struggle to understand neurotypical people sometimes, but neurotypical people struggle to understand us, if not more so than we struggle to understand them! Autistic people understand other autistics better than they understand neurotypicals because we understand each other's processing better. Just like neurotypicals with neurotypicals. That doesn't make us unempathetic because we understand people similar to us more than we understand people not similar to us. And at the same time it's neurotypical people who have caused the most harm and trauma to the autistic community. It's laughable that you do massive studies to understand us and force treatments to control us, yet you call us unempathetic. Personally, I'm a deep, deep empath. A highly sensitive person who feels too much of and for others. My dad on the other hand is an unempathetic asshole. He is not autistic. So...all in all, please stop spreading the inaccurate information that we lack empathy. When you do, it shows how much empathy YOU lack because YOU'RE the ones misunderstanding us!

Family supports them (or doesn't), communities created for them (dwarves, deaf, autistic, schizophrenic, etc) either embrace them unequivocally or with constraints (deaf communities apparently can be pretty strict about embracing a complete deafness versus limited hearing), and others have such a wide range that one end embraces their ""madness"" while the other end hurt themselves (people with schizophrenia).This book claims to be about identity, but identity seems to be a matter of adaptation to the social times and the environment and dictated by the physiological system inherent in the individual. I sensed the author wanted to establish a validity to every single manifestation of an individual and the personality and that no matter how trapped or non-responsive someone may be, that there is noble and ""normal"" individual who just lack the ability to communicate.It makes sense that that is true in some cases, but can't be for all.This is really of collection of personal stories and it quickly felt like it was in the vein of a reader's digest format. There was a lot of emotional communication, some science (but not a scientific view of the types of challenges), and variance of experience, but within the same basic format.I walked away with a sense that groupism exists just for minorities, that everyone adapts to survive, and that the discussion about how to take care of someone who is not normal, is different then that of deciding to have a child who will be known to not be able to adapt and survive on its own ever without supervision."
278,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/327282-sarah-f,5,"If I were to give awards to the books I read each year, I am pretty sure this would win for best nonfiction. What an amazing book! Soloman delves deeply into the concept of vertical and horizontal traits that children bear - the vertical being what is or can be directly and reciprocally passed down from parent to child (hair color, belief systems) and horizontal traits that are unexpected and difficult to understand and accept (genetic disorders, mental illness). He divides his book into 10 chapters - Deaf, Dwarfs, Down Syndrome, Autism, Schizophrenia, Disability, Prodigies, Rape, Crime, Transgender - encapsulated by a chapter about his own sexuality and then about his unique family. Within each chapter, he deftly wound engaging explanations of the topic at hand, giving the reader all the necessary background needed to understand the medical, historical, and social issues of the topic, with accounts from families who were affected. I found every chapter engrossing; I did not want to put the book down, but at the same time, I was afraid to race through it. The chapter on transgendered children was my favorite, for in that chapter more than any other were the most compelling stories of the love parents feel for their children. Granted, this was true for almost every single family story - parents who were devoted to their child, regardless of the child's differences, for it will always be difficult to find a parent willing to talk candidly about how much they dislike their child and how they want nothing to do with it. I would give almost anything for a sequel, though this book clearly cost Soloman a decade of his life, at least. Still, he must have had other possible focuses, half finished chapters, interviews with families affected by other differences. "
279,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1186428-neil-pierson,5,"I read for enjoyment and to relax. I'm not always thrilled when a book makes me think as much and as hard as this one does. But it's worth it.This is a study of families where the offspring are much different than the parents. The children are gay, deaf, dwarfs, prodigies, criminals, autistic, transgender, schizophrenic, Down Syndrome, severely disabled, and children born of rape.In instances such as dwarfism, it's clear that nurture has nothing to do with it; nature has taken its course. In others, the parents have played a role, either before or after birth. But this book goes far beyond the question of how we got here. It looks at how the parents and family are changed by a child of difference. It looks at the decisions these parents must make before and after the child is born. And it asks the toughest question of all: If you had it to do over again...Within the deaf community, there has been a toxic debate for many years about whether deafness is a defect to be fixed or a fundamental, personal trait. Verbal bombs like ""genocide"" are lobbed around freely. If we could medically prevent deafness, should we? And if we can partially remediate deafness, should we?In a less strident way, the same question arises about many of these conditions. The author writes about these issues with clear-headed empathy.One comment to add: The first chapter is about the author's personal experience as a gay child. I would recommend that you read at least far enough to understand his references to vertical and horizontal identities. At that point, if you are not engaged, don't give up. Move ahead to the next chapter."

Also, expect to get goosebumps & be brought to tears often.--Some of my favourite quotes:""(...) Wittgenstein said, <>. Words are intimacy (...)""""(...) But I would hate for my horizontal identity to vanish. I would hate it for those who share my identity and for those who lie outside it.

I had assumed that hanging out with the gang in the slums of Guatemala City would show me the toughest part in Krishna; but instead, it showed me the most vulnerable. Criminality is an identity and like any other form of organised brutality - football, war, arbitrage - it can beget great intimacy. The social imperative ist suppress criminal behaviour; but that should not preclude noticing the identity. I deplore violence, but I recognise the military intimacy it allows men who have no other occasion to bond.

281,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1554889-maureen-stanton,4,"Solomon is such a good writer, but this book felt uneven in places. I understand his premise of horizontal versus vertical familial or community relationships, but at times the connections he tried to make between various groups of afflicted (for lack of a better term, ore maybe affected?) people seem strained. In the first part of the book, the families he chose to profile were quite often wealthy and priveleged (sometimes enormously so); Soloman recognizes this status but it still does not provide an accurate portrait of how a middle-class (or lower) person might contend with such challenging parental circumstances (deafness, dwarfism, autism). Later in the book he profiles mothers who bore a child from rape, and parents with children who committed crimes--and here is where you see a very different demographic group. Solomon did extensive research, combining his own investigations through interviews with family members and experts, etc. with deep documentary research, which makes this a serious, thoughtful, penetrating book But even so, at times, I felt a bit voyeuristic peering into others' personal family suffering, and I wonder how he could have avoided this effect. He covers so much ground, which is commendable, but the piling on of possible physical, mental, and psychological challenges in children can feel at times like a compendium of misery. Overall, I admire this book and Solomon's project, even as I was left with an uneasy or even suspect feeling about the entire literary endeavor. "
282,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/702266-jennie,5,"Had I known this book clocked in at just over 700 pages I might have shied away from it, not because I fear long books but because the subject matter is so intense. I've volunteered in nursing homes, shelters, children's organizations, etc. I was a gay and lesbian studies minor, I taught children with learning disabilities for years and I've made my career in public libraries. I care A LOT about people, and diversity and identity politics. But this book still managed to really rattle me. It illuminated so many things that I had just never considered before on more than a superficial level. How do you deal day to day with a child who has severe autism, or who is in a vegetative state? Is the Ashley treatment a good option or hideous butchery on a defenseless person? Should parents of deaf children sign or focus on oralism? How do you recover from the shock of having a son who becomes a mass murderer? A lot of what these questions boil down to is what does it mean to be human? How do we create a sense of purpose in our lives and what does happiness entail? A hard, heavy book but really excellent and relevant. Solomon's writing occasionally annoyed me as he likes to throw in an oddly obscure vocab word from time to time, but his ability to capture the essence of very complex issues is generally readable and admirable. I also was amazed by how deeply and profoundly he connected with his subjects, I felt that across the board he very much cared for the people whose lives he documented."
283,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11065473-guenevere,5,"I embarked on Andrew Solomon’s Far From the Tree after seeing a video interview with one of the families he followed for the section on Autism. This is a monster book–962 pages (200 or more are notes and such, though). It is also possibly the most profound book I’ve ever read, and no short review could even begin to do it justice. It is the task of trying to whittle down to the core that has, in part, delayed this review.Solomon set out to examine what happens in families when a child has a horizontal identity–something that makes that child entirely different than their parents. So different, in fact, that to survive, the family will have to adjust their structures, internal and external, to a degree most of couldn’t have imagined before. What results is a series of stories, all told with compassion and without judgment, about how different families react to different circumstances.No book can be completely unbiased, but Solomon’s work is always tempered by a profound compassion and desire to understand rather than pigeonhole or judge the choices people make when faced with situations for which they were not prepared. It was, to say the least, the most educational and mind-opening book I have ever read, and I would put it in the same class as When the Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down, by Anne Fadiman, which is among the top ten books I’ve read in my life.It’s a huge book, and I read a section and then took a break to digest and process before plunging into the next section. If it took you a year to read it, the time invested would be well worth it."
284,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1735323-dori,5,"This is one of the most meditative, thought-provoking books on parenting that I've read in years. Andrew Solomon begins with the declaration, ""There is no such thing as reproduction."", and from there expands on the theme that it is easy to forge connections with those who are similar to us, but more challenging for parents when their children are strikingly different, when they ""fall far from the tree"". From his own experience of being ""different"", of finding his place as a gay man in a family that was not initially accepting, he spins the book out into an exploration of the common challenges faced by parents with children who are strikingly different from them: deaf children born into hearing families (and vice versa), children with autism, schizophrenia and multiple disabilities, as well as children who are prodigies or criminals. The questions I found most compelling were, ""Where is the line between difficulties caused by illness vs difficulties caused by societal failure to accommodate?"" and ""At what point does trying to fix shade into failure to acknowledge and embrace despite difference?"" The author ends with a chapter on how the themes explored and lessons he learned while writing this book affected his own path to fatherhood. Although my own children by and large did not ""fall far"", I found this book valuable in helping me think about how we negotiate our own differences. In addition, although the book looks like a brick at 976 pages, 55% of that is end notes that can be ignored, and I thought it was a compelling, fast-paced read. I highly recommend it. "

I felt like all the varied stories were treated with dignity, and Solomon somehow manages to weave everything together beautifully. In the time it took him to research and write the book, the author got married and he and his husband had a child through a surrogate. The thoughts he shared at the end of the book really summed up the message of the entire book for me: ""My journeys toward a family and this book have taught me that love is a magnifying phenomenon--that every increase in love strengthens all the other love in the world, that much as loving one's family can be a means of loving God, so the love that exists within any family can fortify the love of all families. The affection my family has found in one another is not a better love, but it is another love, and just as species diversity is crucial to sustain the planet, this diversity strengthens the ecosphere of kindness. The road less traveled by, it turns out, leads to pretty much the same place."""

He starts with the premise that all parents (desperately, sometimes unconsciously) want their children to validate them, to reflect back to them the values they themselves have chosen. When this happens, a vertical identity is created; we feel the vertical identity in terms of race, class, sometimes gender, sometimes religion. But what happens when the child is significantly different? What if s/he is gay? Or deaf? Or a prodigy? In these cases, the child needs to create his/her own community, or a horizontal identity. What does the parent do, then? Struggle to get the child to conform to the world of the parent? Or join the child in his/her world, even when that world may be baffling or incomprehensible? This is a big, generous book about sacrifice, heartbreak, but also triumph, insight, growth and most of all, love. I was particularly impressed with the chapter on Transgender, and also on the first and last chapters, in which Solomon writes of his own journey as a gay man, from struggles over his identity with his parents to his own road to parenthood.

I read the chapters on Autism, Schizophrenia and the author's discussion of the effect his homosexuality has had on him and his parents. There are several other chapters on entities such as deafness, Down Syndrome, transgender identity, criminal behavior and rape victimization.Andrew Solomon is a clear, concise, smart thinking author. He's most amazed that some parents can wholeheartedly love their children, who have fallen ""far from the tree,"" i.e are definitely out of the ""normal"" range. Even though these families are worn-out, tired, often depressed, they don't give up or give in. Other parents take the children's disabilities personally blaming either themselves or the kids. Such attitudes generally result in long-term harm to the entire family structure.Solomon makes a strong case for loving the children you have, not wasting your time and theirs waiting for them to turn into what you were expecting.Fascinating. I'll read more later. By the way,Far From the Tree can be read in almost any order except starting without reading the first chapter about Solomon himself.

Solomon establishes the difference between ""vertical"" and Horizontal"" identity. Virticle identities are those we inherit from our families, communities and religions. ""horizontal"" identities, on the other hand, are those we seek out and create due to some fundamental difference that often separates us from our parents or local communities. In his book, Solomon touches upon the lives of the deaf, dwarfism, gifted children, Down's Syndrome, Autism, children born of rape, the transgendered, and finally the state of being a parent. Each of these chapters delves deeply into what it means to be a parent of a child with a unique identity, what it means to be that person who has a diverse identity, the science and theory behind causes for these identities, the ccultures that have sprung up as a result and the often times terrifying reactions of people who do not understand. Peppered with stories both academic and deeply personal, Solomon takes you into the lives of these families.

Andrew Solomon looked at the deaf, dwarfs, Down syndrome, autism, schizophrenia, disability, prodigies, rape, crime, and transgender children. The only syndrome that I was more then semi-familiar with was autism. So this book, written with such love, tact and humility was incredibly eye-opening. So many of the parents interviewed are activists, so many are incredibly proud of their children and have thrown themselves wholeheartedly into helping them. This book without being at all religious is incredibly spiritual in that it confirms your best ideas about humanity. Some chapters were incredibly sad and hard to read, the chapter about rape, the chapter on children who commit crime whether because of the cycle of poverty or for no apparent reason at all. The chapters about emotional disturbances were much harder for me to read because I felt that the parents of such children suffer more than those dealing with physical barriers.

Andrew Solomon explores the topic of children with a horizontal identity from their parents. That is, there is something about them that is very different from their parents. He delves into the horizontal identities of deafness, dwarfism, Downs Syndrome, and autism, to name a few. In each case, he brings historical and scientific background along with social and political issues. He weaves them all together with story after story from families that he came to know deeply. The audio version of this book is 40 hours long. Andrew reads it himself. I feel like we are old friends. He addressed the painful, the joyful, the political and the controversial, all without judgement. If I have learned anything, it is that people have painful and complicated stories and the least I can do is suspend judgement and offer kindness and respect for their storied lives.

292,0,http://goodreads.com/user/show/276463-hilary,4,"At first I was puzzled by this book, which deals with a concept he calls horizontal identity – children who are different from their parents due to deafness, dwarfism, severe disability, or even things like being born of rape. I wasn’t sure what it all had in common, or whether I should be insulted by the idea that having a disabled child was similar to having a child who commits mass murder. Anyway, I put my feelings aside and read it and accepted perhaps we shouldn’t place these experiences in a hierarchy. Each chapter stands alone and simply recounts the experiences of families dealing with these “differences.” He tends to the extreme – his examples on disability were all families of kids with multiple severe disability, and I found his chapter on autism particularly bleak. But he resists easy, pat summaries – discussing the controversial Ashley Treatment with sensitivity and compassion to both sides of the debate. His strength is that he lets the stories speak for themselves, and they in turn speak to the larger human experience. I felt profound empathy for what these parents were going through, even in stories where parents walked away and said “Sorry, I can’t do this.” Recommended for parents, or really any human."

Solomon spent 10 years researching and writing this massive tome about parents raising children very different from themselves. He embedded himself within the individual families to gain insight into worlds that few of us have ever even laid eyes upon. Chapters include children (and by extension their parents) affected with various issues and challenges and how they work together to form vertical and horizontal identities to function in the world around them. There are chapters on: Deafness, transgender kids, dwarfism, autism, schizophrenia, child prodigies, children born of rape, down syndrome etc. Each chapter is riveting in its own right as the layers unfold to reveal individual families and the way in which they deal with the situations they have been handed in life. Far from being morose or gloomy, this book is a wonderful testament to the power humans have to take care of each other and persevere in the face of what we would normally consider overwhelming circumstances. Written with warmth, kindness and a supremely insightful sense of empathy, Far from the Tree succeeds in helping to bridge the gap between disability and identity in a way I've never seen before. HIGHLY recommended. "

Solomon interviews families where parents and children are fundamentally different in some way. This can be a physical/biological difference, in the case of the deaf community or children with Down Syndrome or dwarfism, or it can be due to sexuality, or - most confronting - families where either the parents or the children are involved in crime. The interview with the parents of one of the Columbine killers was deeply moving; they loved their son and still love their son. I also found the stories of parents coming to terms with the transition of transgender children very effective; Solomon illuminates the grief parents experience in letting go of the imagined future they had for their child. Solomon shows the range of responses to differences and comes to a point of recognizing both how important the parents' response is, but also the many factors that prevent parents from giving ""ideal"" responses or even knowing what those should be. This is a book that is underpinned by empathy without being maudlin. The stories do the talking very powerfully, book-ended by the story of Solomon's own family experiences. I dipped in and out as I read, as each chapter stands alone, and I know I'll get even more out of it when I'm re-reading."

This book actually changed the way I look at life and it really should be required reading for everyone. It had me checking biases I had no idea I had. There really are two sides to every story and two people can experience the same thing completely differently. One example is the cochlear implant vs. no cochlear debate and the idea that parents need to decide not only whether their child should get a cochlear but also whether or not it should be their decision at all. Hearing people assume-“well of course everyone would want to hear.” But really, the deaf community is vibrant and ASL (and other forms of sign language) are languages in themselves. There are deaf people who absolutely do not want a cochlear. Is it anyone’s right to alter someone’s body without proper consent? Brilliant book that left me with too many insights to count - Andrew Solomon is a genius. //“You can love someone but not accept him; you can accept someone but not love him. I wrongly felt the flaws in my parents' acceptance as deficits in their love. Now, I think their primary experience was of having a child who spoke a language they'd never thought of studying.”// "

While Andrew Solomon has created an amazing compendium of stories related to how parents react when their child does not meet their expectations and dreams due to genetic variabilities, many more specific books will provide more information and a greater understanding. He packs tons of information in this book, but that is perhaps one of the issues since the book exceeds 900 pages. I was frustrated that Solomon did not clearly present the facts about some of these genetic variabilities up front in the chapter and instead interspersed them with his thoughts throughout. This made a clear understanding of the issues difficult and lessened the impact of the book. I found the sections such as the ""Dwarf"" chapter interesting as I knew very little about this genetic variability, however others of which I was better read were boring to me and sometimes the presentation seemed muddled. If you are interested in a specific genetic variability I would suggest you read other books, but if you have just a general interest, this book would be appropriate. "

I'm grateful that our church book group selected this, as otherwise, this 900+page book would have probably gathered dust on my shelf for a long time.I am SO grateful to have read it! Solomon is a genius, a brilliantly beautiful writer, and someone filled with compassion for humanity. He evokes tremendous empathy for the categories of people we don't ordinarily think about. He spent time with parents whose lives are unfathomable; many of them show an extraordinary amount of love. I was fascinated by the ""identity vs. illness"" question, and the prompts to think about how our world would be diminished if we didn't have ""different"" people in it. The activism that is a part of each community of people, the culture within a culture: all a brand new world to me. I don't remember when a book has affected me more. My husband said I far exceeded my previous record of ""hmmm""s as I was reading this. Andrew Solomon is a national treasure. This book is a major project, but well well worth it."

The amount of research gone into this book (interviewing hundreds of families over a decade) is impressive and Andrew Solomon's skill at interviewing people and getting them to share their family's, or their own, story allows for the most interesting parts of the book. Each chapter focuses on a different difference some of which I knew more about and others where I learnt a lot. (I was astounded to learn that the Holland story was written by a real person and not just an internet thing!) Love is amazing. I was also really depressed at times reading this about the lack of support some families and individuals face: hard work being made even harder. But people are amazing. I didn't always agree with everything Andrew Solomon was saying, nor would I expect to in such a massive tome covering so many different subjects, but kudos for raising as many questions as he did and providing a fascinating read."
