0,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4684009-william2,5,"A book about wonder and a wonderful book. The story of the Burgess Shale—from its initial misinterpretation to its reassessment 50 years later—is mind blowing. This limestone outcropping, which sits at an altitude of 8,000 feet in the Canadian Rockies, near British Columbia, was at equatorial sea level 530 million years ago. Its shale has revealed about 150 previously unknown arthropod genera and entirely new species with anatomies that would be unimaginable to us today had Charles Doolittle Walcott not discovered them in 1909. Gould calls these animals with their diverse anatomies ""weird wonders"" and explains that their broad proliferation was possible because the middle Cambrian was a time of filling the so-called ""ecological barrel."" In other words, it was a time of low ecological competition among animals which ultimately permitted unsuccessful anatomies to flourish for a few million years before the full panoply of evolutionary pressures (natural selection) began to eliminate the less successful designs. Another thing learned from the Burgess Shale is the imprecision of the concept ""survival of the fittest."" Certainly, adapting to environmental change is vital, but it's not the whole ballgame. The adapted animal also needs luck on its side, luck that it cannot possibly have any direct role in affecting. I refer to the importance of contingency. Gould calls it ""decimation by lottery,"" and given its sway, unyielding adherence to classic evolutionary principles like gradualism etc. reveal their short sightedness.Finally, if you will accept my argument that contingency is not only resolvable and important, but also fascinating in a special sort of way, then the Burgess not only reverses our general ideas about the source of pattern – it also fills us with a new kind of amazement (also a frisson for the improbability of the event) at the fact that humans ever evolved at all. We came this close (put your thumb about a millimeter away from your index finger), thousands and thousands of times, to erasure by the veering of history down another sensible channel. Replay the tape a million times from a Burgess beginning, and I doubt that anything like Homo sapiens would ever evolve again. It is, indeed, a wonderful life. (p. 289)If you're like me, one who wonders why we were set down on a speck of interstellar dust in the midst of a universe so vast we daily fail to comprehend its age and scale, this book is for you. Gould is a fabulous writer. He writes with a minimum of jargon, and concepts of any complexity he is careful to explain. But he does this without being tedious; he does it, in fact, while sharing his own boundless sense of fascination. Gould was a brilliant man, a rare amalgam of top-flight scientist, science writer, and teacher. When he died 10 years ago he left a great hole in the landscape of writers who could engagingly write for the general reader about evolutionary biology and paleontology. There is simply no one else like him working today. I'm in the process of reading all of his books. There are about 20. Highly recommended for those with an interest in science, particularly the life sciences."
1,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3104177-james,3,"A decent, but certainly out of date book. The most interesting section is that regarding the anatomy of the Burgess biota, and the historical narrative of Whittington, Conway Morris, and Briggs is also a highlight. The more technical details of chapter three might throw some readers off, but I found them to be fascinating.Unfortunately, most of the book is out of date. Most of the ""weird wonders"" that Gould describes have been taxonomically re-evaluated in the previous two decades, and technical developments in systematics (the concept of ""stem groups"" in cladograms), now show that much Burgess biota, ironically, belong closer to the original classifications of Walcott. Much of the biota are now considered to be stem groups of modern taxa, evolutionary aunts and uncles.I also found Gould's continued emphasis on the ""cone of increasing diversity"" to be quite exhausting. Based on Gould's own definitions of diversity and disparity, there is no fundamental problem with depicting increased diversity in more modern geological eras, because there simply are more species (Gould's diversity) than in the Cambrian and Pre-Cambrian. Additionally, Gould seems to be railing against concepts that either haven't been present in the evolutionary literature for decades, perhaps centuries (depiction of an evolutionary ladder), or his examples of phylogenies are either strawmen or misinterpreted. For example, in Haeckel's illustrations, Gould does not analyze the taxonomic groups represented, nor does he consider that Haeckel perhaps wanted to show the phylogenies of the taxa he placed close to the top, and thus gave them more visual importance, because, after all, there is only so much space on the page. In cladograms (and other methods of depicting phylogenies), if the diagram is ""rooted"", the root is meant to depict the hypothetical last common ancestor. Since clades are monophyletic (all descended from a single common ancestor), there is always going to be a ""cone of increasing diversity"", because the clade always depicts hierarchical branching lineages of descent. The only way there would not be a cone is if there truly was a ladder within a single lineage, something that Gould (rightly) disparages! One could argue that this is because Gould was simply arguing against older methods of depicting phylogeny, rather than the relatively new (at the time) cladistics, but even these do not generally follow his pattern. For example, in a classic depiction of fossil horse phylogeny (to use one of Gould's examples from chapter one), the maximum ""disparity"" is reached in the Miocene, and then scales back as it gets closer the the present.Overall, the book is certainly not bad, especially when it comes to the historical and anatomical aspects. But in too many instances, Gould is simply engaging in his typical ""revolutionary"" grandstanding and hyperbole. Proceed carefully, and read more up-to-date texts as a follow up. "
2,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1425694-c,4,"This book was unlike anything else I'd ever read, I suspect because it owes something to the scientific monograph. Maybe? Not having ever read a scientific monograph (they don't even call them that these days), I don't know. Anyway, Gould repeated and repeated and repeated the same conclusions over and over and over and over, until I was ready to embrace the iconographies of the cone of increasing diversity and the ladder of progress just to spite him.Despite that, this was an excellent book. Gould's thesis is that life did not begin with a single (or limited number) of organisms who formed the precursor(s) of all modern life - i.e. life got more and more diverse as time went on. In fact, Gould argues, life began with rampant diversification - a large variety of organisms of radically different form evolved rapidly around the time of the Cambrian explosion, only to be decimated drastically by a combination of (bad) luck, evolution and possibly other unsuspected mechanisms. The proof he holds up to support this is the fossils of the Burgess Shale (found in the Canadian Rockies early last century by the eminent geologist Charles Walcott), most of which have no relation at all to modern species. [Actually, one of the most interesting things he said was that he believes that the initial development of life was inevitable; I wish he'd explained that a bit more.:]I suppose this is technically popular science, but it's much more rigorous than anything else I've read in the genre. Gould doesn't just say/imply 'this is how it is and you're just gonna have to believe it because you're too stupid to know otherwise', he actually lays out the proof before one's eyes. His respect for the reader as an 'intelligent layperson' is refreshing and makes this book a real pleasure to read. The sometimes unfortunate corollary of this is that this book isn't exactly light reading in places, but it is always comprehensible, even if it sometimes takes a bit of effort.I was interested to see that I didn't hold some of the preconceptions he argues against - I hope because this book is rather out of date, being published in 1989 (the year I was born! Shit) and that the thinking and teaching of evolution has moved on somewhat since then. I like to believe that science, and the world in general, is moving ever onwards towards the better, though this meliorist approach usually leaves me disappointed. Maybe it's just that I have studied more science than the average member of the target audience.Gould's prose is quite unusual by any standards, and very unusual for writing about science. Sophisticated, eloquent, at times personal and always passionate, Gould peppers his writing with allusions to literature, popular culture, the occasional Bible verse and once, memorably, an entire poem by Robert Frost. This worked best in the sections about the history of the Burgess Shale; these parts could have been excerpts from a well-written novel. His asides about the nature of research, the relationships between different scientific disciplines, and many other topics were often just as interesting as his discussion of the conceptual basis for his work.Unfortunately, this type of prose I found entirely unsuited to writing about the science itself. When he got down to describing things like the anatomies of the individual species and the techniques used to excavate and analyse the fossil specimins, this prose suddenly seemed overblown, convoluted and overly purple; in short, distracting. I wished he could temporarily have adopted something closer to the dispassion and objectivity that is usually associated with science. I suspect, though, that his answer to this criticism would probably be that science is never objective and scientists are rarely dispassionate, and naturally he'd be completely right."

The victory at stake is bigger and far more abstract than any material reward – a new interpretation of life’s history.” In these sentences Gould not only tells us the theme of his book but how much his work means to him. His passion for paleontology and the story of life resonate from every page. His tone, perspective and considerable writing skills make Wonderful Life a wonderful read.The Burgess Shale in the mountains of British Columbia is notable for its rich assortment of 500 million year old fossils. Many were formed by soft bodied creatures never before known. Typical fossils are from shells, bones or teeth, but these were thin residues left on shale stone. These compressed layers of animals may have resulted from a mudslide on a shallow ocean floor which became sedimentary rock. The site was discovered in 1909 by Charles D. Walcott, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution and a leading paleontologist of his time. He brought back many specimens to Washington. Walcott classified his new specimens into existing major categories, primarily arthropods or annelid worms. In the 1970’s, Harry Whittington, a Cambridge paleontologist and his graduate students, Simon Conway Morris and Derek Briggs, began reassessing Walcott’s collection along with newer specimens. Gould relies on their and Walcott’s monographs, drawings and findings to develop a new interpretation. He holds that many of these animals were from extinct phyla and neither arthropods or annelid worms. He goes into great detail about the features of many unusual specimens to make his case. Gould’s skill as a writer is aptly demonstrated by his ability to explore taxonomic differences and still hold the interest of the lay reader.Gould sees these animals as uniquely specialized not as primitively simple as Walcott’s classifications imply. Gould holds that the Burgess Shale discoveries are representative of the Cambrian Explosion which produced many distinctly different body plans few of which survived. Thus most Burgess Fossils were not precursors of modern forms. He calls the variety of distinct body plans comprising different phyla “disparity” and differentiation within phyla “diversity”. Gould posits that over time we have increased diversity but reduced disparity, or to put it another way abundant variation within a limited number of anatomical designs.Gould believes Walcott’s erroneous classifications were driven by preconceptions, “The greatest impediment to scientific innovation is usually a conceptual lock not a factual lock.” Walcott’s preconceptions included a strict view of Darwinian gradualism, thus he invented circumstances to explain the lack of Precambrian fossils. Gould conversely is famous for his theory of punctuated equilibrium, the idea that evolutionary change occurs in brief periods of rapid change, albeit on geologic timescales, in between longer periods of slow change. Walcott had a religious belief that meant evolution had to lead to man. Inherent in this belief is that evolution always goes in the direction of “progress”. Thus Gould thinks Walcott “shoehorned” his specimens into existing phyla and major groups to show the progression he expected. Gould does cut Walcott some slack noting that he had numerous high level administrative duties and that while a prolific collector he never had the time to spend with his specimens to adequately analyze them. Detailed analysis would have to wait for Whittington and his students who studied them carefully. Walcott did not dissect the fossils to get at underlying structures. Whittington, Morris and Briggs did. Amazingly they were able to expose individual layers despite the extreme compression revealing features hidden from Walcott.A central theme of the book is Gould’s belief that evolution is based on contingency not progress. Evolution occurs to accommodate immediate not future needs. When some fish developed forearm like fins it was for use in water not to colonize land. Dinosaurs did not first acquire feathers to fly. That these features proved useful later for something unrelated Gould feels is a contingency. Those Burgess Shale lifeforms that have modern day progeny were lucky. Most did not. Thus, in terms of the number of unique anatomies, Gould sees decline not expansion. So that today despite a proliferation of species there are fewer phyla. Gould describes the phrase “survival of the fittest” as a tautology. What does fittest mean except those that survive? He sees no way to have predicted which Burgess forms would make it to the present and which would not. Given the many mass and lesser extinctions, the dramatic changes in ocean and atmospheric conditions, what features would later became critically important was a crap shoot. Thus Gould holds that the fauna we see today, even our own existence, was entirely contingent on unpredictable events. He points out that mammals lived alongside dinosaurs for 100 million years before the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction. They survived as small animals in their holes and hideouts as dinosaurs ruled. Without that huge asteroid striking 65 million years ago, why would things be different today?It should be noted that Gould’s interpretations are controversial. Simon Morris changed his views and in a 1998 book held that most Burgess Fossils were related to current forms. More recently gene sequencing has identified relationships between animals that the fossil record missed. Still the phyla determination of many Burgess Fossils remains unresolved. Some people see Gould’s idea of punctuated equilibrium as inconsistent with phyletic gradualism, the predominant theory. Many paleontologists see no contradiction. Evolutionary change may be more or less rapid but even “rapid” change operates over geologic timescales of millions of years. Lastly, some may find Gould’s theory of contingency upsetting. It makes me appreciate just being here and having the opportunity to read wonderful books like Wonderful Life."
4,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7672661-lois-bujold,4,"Wonderful book.Some of the science has been overtaken in the quarter century since it was written, but mainly in the details, not in the main thrust of the arguments. (And it is very much a long argument, if mostly with someone other than me.) I could have stood to be a bit less tired and distracted when I chugged through it, but then, I don't have a quiz next period, so.If one were actually studying the creatures and evolutionary periods, I'd think one would want something more recent, but all the historical background and sidelights on the lives of scientists remain quite pertinent.Ta, L."
5,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1711431-eric-w,4,"The Burgess Shale is a fossil deposit of importance equal to that of the Rift Valley sites of East Africa in that it provides truly pivotal evidence for the story of' life on earth. The shale comes from a small quarry in the Canadian Rockies discovered in the early 20th century by Charles Walcott, then a leading figure at the Smithsonian. The Burgess fossils come from the Middle Cambrian Period, around 350 million years ago. They form one of the earliest assemblages of soft-bodied creatures from the first era 1'0 multicelled animals. They include various worms, crustaceans, etc., but also a large number of unique and unclassifiable forms. In the late 60s Harry Whittington began to study the Burgess fossils in detail and discovered that many of them beloned to lineages which left no modern descendants. The identification of Marrella, Opabinia and other strange Cambrian creatures dropped. a real bombshell in paleontological circles. They prove that the Cambrian was a time of incredible evolutionary experimentation. In the space of a few tens of millions of years there evolved not only the ancestors of everything alive today, but also dozens of lineages that never went anywhere. Most of them were simply wiped out during mass extinction episodes: that of the Permo-Triassic resulted in the extinction of 96% of the species then alive. Stephen Jay Gould has chronicled the story of the Burgess shale in detail. But in true Gould fashion he has drawn broader lessons. He looks at the career of Walcott and examines why Walcott felt it was necessary to shoehorn all of the Burgess forms into a progressive theory of ancestry and diversification. Historians (and paleontologists are a subspecies of historian) like all people are often deeply constrained by what they expect to find. The Burgess shale did not fit previous theory and was therefore made to fit. The implication of Whittington's discoveries is that evolution depends upon an enormous number of accidents, each so contingent upon the other that it would be impossible to replay the tape and get the same story again. Gould ends his book with an extended meditation on the nature of historical truth. He rejects the idea that the historical sciences are in principle less accurate than the experimental sciences: they are both capable of arriving at the truth, often through the progressive detection and correction of error"
6,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/19341029-aur-lien-thomas,3,"The Burgess Shale's creatures, with their anatomies as striking as bizarre, are a perfect illustration of the history of life on Earth: just a matter of contingency. We are, but we could never have been, owning our survival only to chance in the darwinian sense of the word.Indeed, among the multitude of all these organisms since long extinct (according to Gould) were found, alongside the ancestors of the arthropods, Pikaia that is, the oldest known chordate -OUR ancestor, then. Modify one detail, just a single one, imagine Pikaia not surviving the Cambrian era and, homo sapiens would have never existed at all. Looking at these fossils, towering at a mere 545 million of years, it's all our fragility that we contemplate in here, in a majestic and breathtaking vision.Gould turns science into poetry. Yet, this book is not without defects.The descritpions of the said fossils are far too long, and, if they are necessary so as to fully show their repercussions, quite a bore over more than 350 pages. He also argues for his punctuated equilibrium hypothesis, which may annoy some readers (for example, when he claims such fossils to be the remains of previous species having evolved suddenly). As for the idea that most of these creatures are since long extinct, it's false -two of the paleontologists having worked on them (Derek Briggs and Simon Convey Morris) having corrected that mistake since then. The main idea of the book (life as a matter of contingency) stays intact, but a careful reading remains thus necessary. Despite it all, it's a real pleasure to read thanks to Gould and his inimitable writing style."

If your curiosity about the Burgess Shale or the weird and wonderful beings of the Cambrian period needs sating, this book should more than do it. It is quite dense — Gould may have been a popular science writer, but he didn’t dumb it down — but it’s worth the time investment.It’s true that some of the reconstructions of these beings have been challenged since Gould wrote, but it’s still worth reading for his overall theory about the development of life, and much important (and correct) detail about the Burgess Shale.Reviewed for The Bibliophibian."

9,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36603555-katherine-addison,5,"I'm not saying anything startling or new when I say this book is awesome.So, for one thing, it's a book about writing and about mythology, and how what we think we know limits what we see and therefore what stories we can tell, a problem which Gould addresses both in terms of paleontologists looking at the Burgess Shale and in terms of Gould himself looking at the paleontologists looking at the Burgess Shale. So he talks about how Charles Doolittle Walcott got everything wrong (except for the names--surely some subconscious tingle was telling him these little animals were weirder than he thought they were) because he saw what he expected to see when he looked at them. And then Gould talks about himself looking at Drs. Whittington and Conway Morris and thinking he knew what he was looking at; surely when you have a conservative paleontologist (""conservative"" in its proper dictionary meaning, not its political meaning) and his young, radical, fire-breathing graduate student, the two must butt heads.But they don't. Gould is perfectly transparent about the tangle he gets himself in because he lets his mythology do his thinking for him. So he's talking about how the stories we tell create mythology (like the myth of the discovery of the Burgess Shale, which in point of fact happened in an utterly undramatic field-science kind of way) and then how, in turn, that mythology once created limits the stories we can tell. The paleontologist and his graduate student collaborate with the other graduate student (who gets left out of the picture in the mythology precisely because he doesn't fit the false binary) to completely re-form our understanding of the evolution of multicellular life on Earth. The animals of the Burgess Shale are mostly not proto-crustaceans as Walcott labeled them. Some of them aren't arthropods at all.This book is also awesome for two other reasons:(1) Gould's enthusiasm (which I admit I found both endearing and infectious) for explaining the creatures of the Burgess Shale to his lay audience. And his passionate commitment to the notion of an intelligent lay audience that he can explain them to.(2) the creatures themselves which are holy shit not even kidding the most unheimlich things I have ever seen, including tarantulas, which used to be my #1. (I like spiders, but there's something about tarantulas, the way they move, or the way they look like they ought to be inanimate but aren't . . .) I kept having to remind myself that Opabinia is (a) two inches long and (b) extinct, and even then it didn't really help with the way my spine kept trying to crawl up into my skull to hide.But the animals of the Burgess Shale are weird and amazing and beautiful in their own way, and their principles of design are far more imaginative than anything I've ever read or seen in science fiction . . . except maybe ""Or All the Seas with Oysters.""Maybe."
10,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/442654-andrew,0,"Once upon a time, when I was on the path to being a geologist, I carved into the moist depths of a sandstone gorge in Clinton County, Iowa, and watched the sand crumble in my hand. I jarred it, took it back to my lab, and sorted out the grains using a sequence of sieves of varying mesh, matched it to the known sedimentary facies from different depositional environments, and realized its origins. A beach from the Silurian Period, still not entirely turned to rock.And that's when I knew that sedimentology was just as much history as scientific method.Stephen Jay Gould tells us to forget everything we think we know about evolution-- the slow, gradual processes, the eternal move upward-- and embrace a radically different vision, as reflected in the Cambrian explosion. By telling the story of how the Burgess shale came to be interpreted, we not only have a story about life on this planet, but also a story of how scientists work, and how their efforts are constantly subject to revision and flux, especially in a discipline like paleontology in which there isn't much in the way of experimentation, but there is a lot in the way of history and narrative."
11,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3914991-deborah-ross,5,"I fell in love with dinosaurs when I was 8, about the time I fell in love with horses. My passion for fantasy and science fiction followed later, during my teenage years. I've never gotten over any of them. I'd heard about the paleontological discoveries in the Burgess Shale (in Canadian Rockies), first described in the earky 1900s and then re-analyzed with startlingly different results in the 1970s and 1980s. The Burgess Shale deposits date from the early Cambrian period, roughly 560 million years ago, before the development of creatures ""hard parts"" that lend themselves more readily to fossilization. When Charles Walcott collected specimens of these small, soft-bodied animals, he assumed they were primitive forms of known lineages (like arthropods, annelid worms, and trilobites). The traditionalist attitudes of his day, his personal predilections, and his lack of time to thoroughly study the specimens (due to his burgeoning administrative duties at the Smithsonian) induced him to ""shoehorn"" strange and bizarre creatures into established phyla. When H. B. Whittington and his brilliant students took another look, they came to realize (over a period of time and excruciatingly painstaking work) that this Cambrian fauna abounded in new phyla, in creatures that are fundamentally different from the (relatively few) lineages we know today. Gould, nature writer and paleontologist, weaves several story threads: the history of the discoverers and their work; the creatures themselves; and a new look at how life forms develop and change. Instead of the popular image of ""the march of progress"" culminating in human intelligence, and increasing diversity as a function of superiority over time, he builds an argument for an explosion of diversity very early in the evolution of multicellular animals, followed by a decimation that left only a few branches. Chance, or as he puts it ""contingency,"" not inherent superiority, all too often played the pivotal role in which life forms survived and which equally competent ones did not. Whether or not you agree with his thesis, his arguments are fascinating, but not as incredible and wonderful as the animals themselves."

My memory for history details is deplorable, so I didn't waste time reading stuff that ultimately I don't care about. That said, I appreciated the take on what the Cambrian Explosion meant for evolution generally, and the further musings on what it meant for humans specifically, much much later.

13,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8360313-nathan,2,"Getting through Wonderful Life was an arduous exercise in critical reading. I could never be certain if what I was reading was true, or if the conclusions the author was making were safe ones.From the outset the author's bias for his subject is apparent. He explicitly states over and over that this material is a revolution, that it overturns the establishment, and that it's an incredible drama. He says that it's the most important paleontological discovery ever, and it fundamentally changes our view of life. This is before he has even begun, and immediately puts me on the defensive. My first reaction is that if an idea is indeed amazing, one probably wouldn't need to keep declaring it to be so. So why does the author feel the need to keep telling the reader how wonderful his idea is, instead of simply showing it? The writing is drab and textbook-esque, interspersed with uninhibited editorializing and grand claims. I don't know which claims to retain and which to discard as biased or inaccurateIt makes for an at once boring and exhaustingly defensive read. Wonderful Life was written at a time when the classification of the creatures in question had yet been unresolved. It takes place in the middle of a discovery and a debate, but is presented as the end of one. A quick glance on Wikipedia shows the inaccuracy of much of the taxonomic classifications in this book, which act as the crux of the author's argument. The vast majority of the ideas are not left to speak for themselves, but the author must, for every new idea, construct an opposing idea so that he may expertly dismantle it. It's tedious to listen to someone argue against ideas I don't hold. Indeed, ideas that perhaps few science-minded people hold today. His main punching bag is Charles Walcott, a prominent Christian paleontologist who died in 1927 (Wonderful Life was published in 1989). When the author sinks to the point of defending paleontology proper against its lack of respect among scientists, I'm just aghast at how petty and argumentative this book is. In one footnote the author actually says that he doesn't ""like"" Charles Walcott, the man. Is this a science book or a diary?Wonderful Life has some novel and valuable ideas (the book's overarching points seem sound), but they're buried beneath reams of bias, pettiness, and insecurity. By framing these ideas as a ""revolution"" and as a response to an amalgamation of opposing beliefs, he condemns the book to instant obsolescence. I don't want to read a book explaining why the earth isn't flat. I just want to know why the Earth IS round. At least it has sparked my interest in early life and the Cambrian explosion. The idea of these primitive segmented gene-machines adorning themselves with armor and spikes and battling to the death for sustenance and survival is very cool and somewhat disturbing, being that these creepy alien creatures are our own ancestors (in some cases).It takes a certain skill to make something so inherently interesting so boring. But then, that's not what the book is about. In the end (one at last realizes), this book is about ""contingency"" (the role of chance in the development of humans, or in the development of any particular path of history). The last couple of chapters are fascinating, if somewhat self-evident in today's understanding of evolution. Who would argue that HUMAN consciousness is an ordained eventuality, but someone trying to justify a belief in a god or higher purpose?The single real takeaway from the book is the idea that life had the highest degree of morphological diversity at the inception of multicellular life and has since only decreased in anatomical diversity (not to be confused with the increase in speciation over time). To be fair, that IS the subject of the book, but it's a subject that could perhaps have been elucidated with 200 fewer pages of grandstanding and petty squabbling with the scientific establishment. Wonderful Life has left me with that one interesting thought and two ringing ears. "
14,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/115626-nadine-jones,2,"I think maybe I am not right audience for this book. This is probably a great book for the proper audience. If you know what a ""chelicerate arthropod"" is, then dive right in! You probably have the proper knowledge base to allow you to appreciate and enjoy this book! I, on the other hand, do not.Here's my takeaway message (and this may not be right, since I skimmed a lot): evolution is random, and weird. Also, paleontologists are always correcting each other.Reading this felt like a chore. I kept reading, because I kept hoping it would become interesting (and it did! eventually ! the final two chapters, 4 & 5, are much more interesting to me than the rest). Even my review is going to be dull, don't even bother reading it. Really. Just read the book if you're interested, don't if you're not. Then just read this, and be done:
Finally, if you will accept my argument that contingency is not only resolvable and important, but also fascinating in a special sort of way, then the Burgess not only reverses our general ideas about the source of pattern—it also fills us with a new kind of amazement (also a frisson for the improbability of the event) at the fact that humans ever evolved at all. We came this close (put your thumb about a millimeter away from your index finger), thousands and thousands of times, to erasure by the veering of history down another sensible channel. Replay the tape a million times from a Burgess beginning, and I doubt that anything like Homo sapiens would ever evolve again. It is, indeed, a wonderful life.
I was looking for something that would give me some interesting science history, some interesting details about the life forms discovered at the Burgess Shale, and relate that to our general knowledge of evolution. I thought this would be a broad overview of evolution. You know, tell us what is so wonderful about life on this planet, with just a few detailed examples thrown in for flavor. I've never read a paleontology book before, and I don't know any of the scientific names for fauna, and this book dives right into the details. Too many details to hold my attention.Two examples, from chapter 2:
Four such papers appeared in 1911 and 1912 (see Bibliography)—the first on arthropods that he considered (incorrectly) as related to horseshoe crabs, the second on echinoderms and jellyfish (probably all attributed to the wrong phyla), the third on worms, and the fourth and longest on arthropods. He never again published a major work on Burgess metazoans. (A 1918 article on trilobite appendages relies largely on Burgess materials. His 1919 work on Burgess algae, and his 1920 monograph on Burgess sponges, treat different taxonomic groups and do not address the central issue of disparity in the anatomical design of coelomate animals. Sponges are not related to other animals and presumably arose independently, from unicellular ancestors. The 1931 compendium of additional descriptions, published under Walcott’s name, was compiled after his death by his associate Charles E. Resser from notes that Walcott had never found time to polish and publish.)
and
I dreamed, before I understood my utter lack of administrative talent or desire, about convening an international committee of leading taxonomic experts on all phyla represented in the Burgess. I would then farm out Amiskwia to the world’s expert on chaetognaths, Aysheaia to the dean of onychophoran specialists, Eldonia to Mr. Sea Cucumber. None of these taxonomic attributions has stood the test of subsequent revision, but my dream certainly reflected the traditional view propagated by Walcott and never challenged—that all Burgess oddities could be accommodated in modern groups.
and then this:
In 1975, Des Collins of the Royal Ontario Museum mounted an expedition to collect fossils from the debris slopes in and around both quarries. He was not permitted to blast or excavate in the quarries themselves, but his party found much valuable material. (The Burgess Shale is so rich that some remarkable novelties could still be found in Walcott’s spoil heaps.) In 1981 and 1982, Collins explored the surrounding areas, and found more than a dozen new sites with fossils of soft-bodied organisms in rocks of roughly equivalent age. None approach the Burgess in richness, but Collins has made some remarkable discoveries, including Sanctacaris, the first chelicerate arthropod. 
I don't know about you, but my eyes glazed over and I started skimming. I don't know who Des Collins is, I have no idea what a chelicerate arthropod is, and I am clearly not the intended audience!I searched my ebook, and found that ""chelicerate"" appears 19 times, and this is the third instance. I suppose this first reference counted as a definition, but I had completely forgotten about it in the face of all the other information!
The Burgess Shale includes, for example, early representatives of all four major kinds of arthropods, the dominant animals on earth today—the trilobites (now extinct), the crustaceans (including lobsters, crabs, and shrimp), the chelicerates (including spiders and scorpions), and the uniramians (including insects).
To make matters worse, my county library system does not have a hard copy of this book, so I'm reading an ebook borrowed from NYPL. The illustrations in the ebook are black and white and very very tiny. Yes, I can zoom in, but really kills any flow of the book.On top of all that, this book and I started off on the wrong foot, with the first sentences of the first chapter:
Not since the Lord himself showed his stuff to Ezekiel in the valley of dry bones had anyone brought such grace and skill to the reconstruction of animals from disarticulated skeletons. Charles R. Knight, most celebrated of artists in the reanimation of fossils, painted all the canonical figures of dinosaurs that fire our fear and imagination to this day.
I beg to differ. Knight may have come first, but his work is not what fires my imagination. Anyone who has visited the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History in Washington DC has probably seen the gorgeous murals of ancient life under the sea, done by Eleanor Kish. She worked with scientists to create clay models of each creature, then sketched it, and created her mural. She especially loved the cartoonish violence aspects of the work, and for her the more violent and bloody she could make it, the happier she was. Her paintings of dinosaurs can also be seen in museums in New Mexico and the Canada Museum of Nature, and her work is included in An Odyssey in Time: The Dinosaurs of North America and yes even in a National Geographic publication, Dinosaur Babies, a pop up book. Now, maybe Gould did not know Kish, but I did, and her art is what fires my imagination. Now, admittedly, Knight has a Wikipedia page and Kish does not, although she is mentioned on the ""paleoart"" wiki page. So, once I calmed down a bit, I conceded that perhaps Knight influenced more imaginations than Kish. Still, I'm miffed. (I'm tired of women being erased from history.)Repeated mentions of the paleontologist Leif Størmer in chapter 3 just kept making me think of Peter Stormare, especially his character in the movie Fargo. :-)Aside from all that (for anyone who might still be reading my review!), Gould is a lovely writer, and passionate about his subject! He gets all worked up about subjects that don't really bother me. I find his passion charming. Chapter 4, a brief biography of Charles Walcott, is far more interesting to me, the layperson, than the previous three chapters.Chapter 5, about the complete unlikelihood of homo sapiens having evolved, was great!Also, this sounds like a great idea for sci-fi: a far future world ruled by giant intelligent arthropods, who are studying fossils of humans and trying to make sense of our culture. Surely this book has been written?
Don’t accept the chauvinistic tradition that labels our era the age of mammals. This is the age of arthropods. They outnumber us by any criterion—by species, by individuals, by prospects for evolutionary continuation. Some 80 percent of all named animal species are arthropods, the vast majority insects.

15,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15308689-nick-edkins,5,"There's a trap that a lot of science writing falls into: when the author finds the subject matter beautiful and awe-inspiring, they tell you ""this is beautiful and awe-inspiring!"". To give you context for some fact, they'll tell you numbers of Olympic swimming pools or football stadiums or Earth masses or lightyears. This is not interesting! You can't make me feel awe by telling me how much awe I should be feeling, and you have to do more than just say a very large or very small number.Gould is the best writer I know at letting the awe build up organically. Here, he takes you through the whole story of how we know what we do about the Burgess Shale and the Cambrian explosion of animal diversity. He explains in great detail how the original workers were constrained by their worldview, and he presents that worldview in a compelling way, so that you can buy into it. Then, piece by piece, he reveals and explains the new evidence that nibbles away at that worldview, and eventually overturns it. Because he really feels the need to convince you of what he's saying, he makes the case in considerable detail. There's such a huge volume of background information needed to explain, for example, why it's remarkable that Marella splendens, which looks a lot like a trilobite, is not a trilobite. Gould trusts that, if he gives you that information, the payoff will be sweeter and your understanding richer. It's this level of trust in the reader that I really appreciate."
16,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1730247-stephen,5,"Wonderful life, indeed!!One of the best science books I have ever read because the story is so extraordinary. Most of the late Stephen Jay Gould’s published works are collections of his essays but this is a full-length book that tells the story of the fossils found in the Burgess Shale in Canada. Normally, when you think of paleontology, you think of dinosaur bones as big as small cars. But this deposit held the fossilized remains of small small-tissued animals that lived 530 million years ago, long before dinosaurs or dodos or dachshunds ever existed. Unraveling the story the flattened creatures told and the story of the Cambrian Explosion is fascinating. It seems once multi-cellular life began to appear in the oceans of our planet it evolved quickly into a remarkable smorgasbord of forms. Many soon went extinct leaving no ancestors, and their strange likes have never been seen again. Great book. Wonderful life."
17,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59066470-brokenandroid,0,"One of my favourite books. Whenever I read these types of books, or books on history, I feel as though I am in a time machine going back to these places and time periods. Reading this book, I imagined myself wading through a shallow beach discovering and examining all these weird and wonderful creatures. Wow!"
18,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/59054793-tom,5,"excellent book. the few goodreads reviews saying that the book is ""out of date"" are by readers who have missed the forest for the trees. it doesn't really matter that uniramia has been replaced by hexapoda + myriapoda or that many of the strange stars of this story have since been demoted from possible new phyla to just stem groups. the two main points still stand; 1.) animals are classified by body plans that are very highly conserved, the burgess shale yielded species that exhibited unusual patterns of segmentation etc. and the desire to try wedge some of these guys into more familiar groups was obviously a mistake and in some cases caused evidence to be overlooked 2) contingency played a larger role in the history of life on earth than most people typically care to think about. SJG does a great job spinning the scientific reevaluation of the burgess fossils into an entertaining story and bearing with him through all the emphasis on arthropod anatomy will pay off. i find it funny that the people who criticise gould's popular works fall into two opposite camps, those who think his writing is too dry for the layman and those who are offended at the thought of a scientist talking about science as social activity. maybe he could have just written a nice book about stamps instead?"
19,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18959010-nihal-vrana,5,"This is a pinnacle in popular science writing. As Gould refers in the book, many experimental scientist like myself despise taxonomy. So I could have never thought a book mainly about taxonomical inferences and anatomical definitions would be one of my favourite books.The story of Burgess shale is fascinating, but only if you are as talented as Gould to make it fascinating. Without his spin, the content of this book can be as boring as 8th grade history book. But Gould has an unique talent of developing exhilirating tangents, giving a feeling of big picture and suspense. I think that you can give him any topic and he can spin you a passable story. Now that is writing genius.Burgess shale oddballs as Gould puts it are breathtaking for any biologist and what they say about the history of earth and life is deeply moving. The only critique I have against the book that it beats a dead horse on the effect of contingency in the evolution of life a bit too much; but maybe in the era it was written it was not that obvious. It is a must read book if you are into popular science."
20,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/101949941-mario-krapp,5,"What a book. I don’t think I would have enjoyed it as much as I did just a few years ago. Let me just speak for myself: Without a little background knowledge about the „Cambrian explosion“ and a the tree of life (and all the Latin names involved) this book is a tough read, a tour de force through the history of life. I can’t say how he did it, but Stephen Jay Gould managed to sparkle a continues curiosity and overwhelming excitement. It feels almost like I’ve lived through the marvelous years, back then, when the Burgess Shale fossils have been revisited in the mid-1970s. Stephen Jay Gould has combined the history of scientific discovery, several biographies, and paleontology while discussing his own take on what this all means for life in general. It even makes me think about reading one of the introductory paleontology textbooks. Very good stuff."

23,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/92292-jlawrence,4,"Gould does an excellent job balancing readability and technical details in this account of the discovery and classification of fossils found at the Burgess Shale in Canada. Some of the fossils reveal truly bizarre creatures of the Cambrian period, which were shoehorned into existing phyla when originally classified, but upon recent, closer study were shown to belong to completely new phyla of their own. The fascinating creatures are thoroughly described.Gould convincingly argues that these examples of wild early diversity undermine the idea of evolutionary 'progress' from a few basic forms 'up' towards ever-increasing complexity and diversity. Instead, the Burgess Shale points to huge diversity early-on, which was decimated by outside chance, its survivors (not obviously 'fitter' than those that didn't survive) determining life as we know it. Gould argues that this 'decimation by lottery' means that evolution could have very easily taken many entirely different paths than it did (the power of contingency), including no humans and no conscious creatures of any kind. Fascinating stuff.Conway Morris, one of the paleontologists responsible for the re-classification of the Burgess Shale 'weird wonders' and who is featured prominently in this book, has written a book (Crucible of Creation) opposing Gould's interpretation of the Burgess Shale, and I'll probably give that book a go at some point."
24,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/8244588-c,5,"Excellent. I wish more creationist's would take the time to read and absorb whole books like this. Unfortunately I have not found whole books written from their perspective at this level (or others referred to below). I will include here a link to HingePoints, an article I wrote last year on biblical hermeneutic. It was the beginning in a shift in perspective that was afforded by regarding biblical interpretation as malleable. The world isn't, the text isn't, but how we view it is. From here, other writings began to emerge (which I won't share here just yet.)What I find touching about Gould is that he is both honest and complete. He is sometimes irreverent, but also, tellingly reverent in his account of Walcott, the scientist/administrator who first discovered the Burgess shale. The ""Lord"" had placed the constraint of twenty four hours in the day also on a fellow as talented as he.Science, like farming, is hard work. You get to write it up and enjoy the goods only after you have ploughed the field all day. This is an account worth reading of the recollections of ploughing."
25,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul,2,"This is a book primarily about the abundance of life in that had been preserved in fossils in the Burgess shale.Gould writes about the people who spent hour after painstaking hour examining the samples, deciphering the forms and understanding the compressed fossils in this rock formation. In the second part of the book he writes about Walcott, administrator at the Smithsonian institute until he died, and his error in the analysis in the samples. He then considers the what if questions that evolution throws up, in the final part.I found the writing style to be quite dry and technical. Understandable to a certain extent given the subject matter, but my feeling is with science writers is that they should make the subject that they are writing about come alive, and this book didn't do it for me. The part on Walcott was good, he was a man who had a lot of influence and authority in the scientific advances in America, but he suffered some fundamental flaws.This was written 20 or so years ago now, and in its time would have been a seminal work; now it is still important, but understanding of the creatures in the Burgess shale are now better understood and technology can bring them to life in ways that Gould could have never of considered."

Gould is an excellent writer, and, although I was absolutely ready to read 380 pages about worms and tiny arthropods, his words breathed unspeakable excitement into the subject. He analyzes the Burgess Shale and its implications for the evolutionary process in ways I had never considered. The material is somewhat dated, being thirty years old and bearing references to a Hallucigenia that walks on its spines and the carnivorous Diyatrima. Of course, I don't fault Gould for his lack of precognition, but its something to keep in mind. Overall, the inaccuracies detract very little from his main points, and the meat of it all is definitely intact.  I will however say that, as enchanting as I found this book, if you aren't interested in analyses of middle Cambrian fauna, this is probably not the book for you. Discussion and diagrams of inches-long invertebrates are pillars of this book's ideas, after all. So, yeah, it's a fantastic read, and certainly the best book I'll ever read about worms."
27,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10812329-hershel-shipman,5,"Great overview on the Cambrian period and how honestly weird life was at that time. Also gives a nice biography of Walcott, the man who discovered the Burgess Shale. The Burgess shale has many examples of phylums of invertebrates that flat out do not exist anymore. Most arthropods now only have about 4 different body types. At this time there were more. Even known arthropod phylums such as trilobites give forms that became lost after this geologic time period.Gould gives his biography on Walcott. This biography gives his connection to other thinkers and politicians of the day. Also it explains in detail why the thought processes that were required for the later revision of the interpretations of the fossils were not with Walcott.Gould details seven different ""what if?"" scenarios about replaying the tape of life. I do not agree with some of his conjectures here, especially about consciousness and intelligence.Excellent book on paleontology, natural history, and evolution. A ""must"" read for those interested in the planet, about life, or vaguely interested in the history of science in the USA. Read before seeing the Smithsonian or pick it up there."
28,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/75075357-james-lancaster,4,"Wonderful Life chronicles the changing landscape of science in the seventies, and is about slow, but important changes in scientific thinking that change how we think about the world. The case in question is the study of the Cambrian fauna of the burgess shale. Once, it was thought that these animals were only simpler versions of modern animals, however, extended study of these animals found the animals to be several times more diverse than any faunal assemblage today. Showing an extensive mix of body plans and lifestyles. Overturning conventional thought that life became more diverse as time went on, it seems that all major groups, and some lineages that no longer exists, diverged early in Earth's history.Stephen Gould does his best to make this subject accessible to all readers, and the lesson it presents is an important. The historical details around the Burgess Shale are extremely interesting, and gives an interesting picture of academic life and the personal biases that can affect science."

I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I actually like many of his others much better. I found his first few chapters a little dull, but things got exciting once he got to the chapter that he sets up as a play.I'm also not entirely happy with his epilogue. Yes, Pikaia and its proper classification is important. And he had just spent a paragraph saying that he's not claiming that it's the ancestor of all chordates...but then the last two paragraphs talk about how no chordates would be alive today if Pikaia hadn't survived the decimation. I know that Gould realized this is a symbolic simplification, but I think it would be easy to get the wrong impression, especially since it is the last thing you read.I love that Gould references a Stephen King book!

The focus? The Burgess Shale, located in British Columbia. A treasure trove of fossil findings. Gould's take on this is one person who ""imposed"" understanding of the meaning of the fossils versus others who proposed a different explanation. Gould is with the ""others,"" and proposes that contingency is an importamnt component of evolution. A fascinating story, with Gould's analysis at the forefront.

43,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1959519-max-maxwell,5,"To be clear, Wonderful Life is not a perfect book, but it is certainly an amazing book. It's pertinent to ask, ""Where does the book fall flat?""First, the middle section of the book, ""The Reconstruction of the Burgess Shale,"" is just a little bit too long. I mean exactly what I said; a few pages, say, 20 or so, after you've said, ""OK, I'm ready to get out of this murky details section and get on with the implications of it all,"" the section ends. As Gould points out, the section is, admittedly, important:Pleading is undignified, but allow me one line: please bear with the details; they are accessible, and they are the gateway to a new world.And bear with them you will, through about 200 pages of descriptions of, say, how the specimens of Opabinia or Hallucigenia were dissected, camera lucida diagrams, and repetitive descriptions of Harry Whittington's conservative temperament.The best parts of the book are the first, fourth, and fifth sections. The first, ""The Iconography of an Expectation,"" deals with the tendency amongst scientists and laypeople alike to see evolution as a linear process resulting in more and more complexity and always yielding intelligence. The fourth, ""Walcott's Vision and the Nature of History,"" tells of the myriad expectations that led the original discoverer and describer of the Burgess to make the fatal error of placing all the Burgess biota, most of which were completely new to science, in previously known categories, as ancestors of modern creatures. And the fifth, ""Possible Worlds,"" uses parts two and three (the ones with all the details) as a jumping board from which to explore the idea of punctuated equilibrium and its subsequent idea of contingency.Punctuated equilibrium is the idea that evolution is not a straight line of progress. Rather, evolution centers on mass extinctions such as the extinction that killed 96 or 97% of life on earth, including most of the Burgess organisms. Evolution only works in a straight line up until a really mass extinction, and then all bets are off. Natural selection is so tied to local environments that if the environment changes it can mean game over:Even if fishes hone their adaptations to peaks of aquatic perfection, they will all die if the ponds dry up. But grubby old Buster the Lungfish, former laughingstock of the piscine priesthood, may pull through... if we are Buster's legacy... how can we possibly view our mentality as inevitable, or even probable?One instantly thinks of polar bears doomed by global warming. Gould calls the element of history that relies on happenstance and massively improbable coincidence ""contingency,"" and he hammers its prevalence home with numerous examples—notably that the Burgess organism Pikaia was the earliest chordate, and its nonexistence would have erased us from history.My main objection to contingency is complicated, but in the spirit of this review, I might ask you to bear with my details. Steven Pinker, in his book 
The Blank Slate
, makes an excellent point:Sigmund Freud immodestly wrote that ""humanity has in the course of its time had to endure from the hands of science three great outrages upon its native self-love"": the discovery that our world is not the center of the celestial spheres but rather a speck in a vast universe, the discovery that we are not specially created but instead descended from the animals, and the discovery that often our conscious minds do not control how we act but merely tell us a story about our actions.Science does have a proud tradition of muckraking by demoting the status of humankind further and further, from Lord of Creation, created in God's image, to just another ape on another rock in another galaxy. To most people, this is insulting, even troubling; to those who understand, to those who find themselves, like Job, ""comforted that I am dust,"" it's humbling, and beautiful. But it does lead to a sort of playground-style fight over who among the sciences has demoted man furthest. Gould seems to be making a play here:As Freud observed, our relationship with science must be paradoxical because we are forced to pay an almost intolerable price for each major gain in knowledge and power—the psychological cost of progressive dethronement from the center of things, and increasing marginality in an uncaring universe.He's referencing Freud in order to tie in the concept with his view of contingency.Here's where things get neat: think about SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. SETI optimists, people who feel that it is likely that the universe is populated by intelligent life (myself included), base our assumption on a certain feel for evolution. Carl Sagan was a SETI optimist; he felt that evolution follows, if not a straight line, per se, a route to progress. If Gould is to be believed that (a) contingency is all-important in understanding evolution and (b) contingency is one of Freud's demotions, then Sagan's converse idea should be empowering to man, in the sense that it indicates that evolution must eventually result in something like us. And yet—here is Sagan in his book 
Pale Blue Dot
, titling a chapter ""The Great Demotions,"" and claiming among those demotions the notion that we may not be alone in the universe!The thing is that Gould is not the only supporter of punctuated equilibrium that upholds his ideas as those most demoralizing to mankind. Here's Michael Shermer in the Spring 2008 issue of Skeptic magazine:Historical experiment after experiment reveals the same answer: we are a fluke of nature, a quirk of evolution, a glorious contingency. It is tempting to... write yourself into the story as the central pattern in order to find purpose and meaning... But skeptical alarms should toll whenever anyone claims that science has discovered our deepest desires and oldest myths are true after all... a purpose-seeking animal will find itself as the purpose of nature.Shermer is responding to SETI optimism with a stone face. The point is that Shermer and Gould accuse SETI optimists of wishful thinking, without realizing that their notion so perfectly backs up the very teachings of the church: that we are alone and that we are the only intelligent life out there.—you see, the idea of SETI was once about where contingency is now. The idea of other people was very troubling to the religious; how could God send a saviour to two or more worlds? I'm not saying that contingency is a bad idea, and neither am I knocking punctuated equilibrium. I'm just saying it's not as much of a revelation as Gould thinks.I'm done complaining.—so, what did Gould get right?One of the major appeals of the book is his treatment of scientists as real, quirky people instead of arcane demigods; think the best parts of Bill Bryson's 
A Short History of Nearly Everything
 in more depth. Whittington, Briggs, Conway Morris, Walcott, and even Darwin come alive in these pages, in their words, if possible.He also presents the details with arresting scope and clarity. Sidebars throughout help the layman through arthropod terminology, and the book is lavishly illustrated throughout. Gould's prose is stellar—each punctuation mark and word is devastating. Some say that he rambles, but they're missing the point, because Gould's rambling is his charm. He conveys his passion like few other science writers manage to do.Finally, despite being 20 years old this year, the science in Wonderful Life is cutting-edge. After that long, there were bound to be some corrections: for example, Anomalocaris did not perish soon after the Shale's time; a relative named Schinderhannes survived until the Devonian, 100 million years after the Burgess. Furthermore, Anomalocaris and Opabinia are now considered lobopods, not their own distinct phylum. Hallucigenia walked on its ""tenticles,"" not on its spines, making it substantially less hallucinogenic than once imagined. These are trivialities, in my opinion; for every incorrect guess, Gould makes three that panned out, including correctly placing Aysheiea in the phylum Onychophora, at a time when it was in dispute as to what it was, and calling that the Burgess represented a world-wide fauna based on a few Chinese fossils, guessing that more would show up (in the 2000s, the Changjiang fauna did indeed show up, replete with complete anomalocarids and primitive chordata related to Pikaia, theretofore a single specimen).The facts are these: Wonderful Life makes you think. It's brilliantly written. And, at the end of the day, the creatures and fossils are just awesome. Paleo enthusiasts like me are all kids at heart, Gould being no exception at all."
44,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467405-ellen,3,"I read this book for research and primarily for Gould's argument, given throughout this book, that if one were to rewind the 'tape of life' then life as we know it would not emerge on the replay. Gould is clear in his opening chapter that he intends for this book to be both useful for students of the history of life on Earth and for the lay person interested in the same. With no formal scientific training beyond the age of 16, I am only qualified to assess the success of the latter intention, which I can do positively.That being said, however, Gould's quest for accessibility also leads him down some very odd tangents. In the name of illustrating some of his points he begins to almost rant about certain aspects of life and the academy. One notable example is a lengthy lament about the current (at least, current as of the book's writing in the summer of 1988) state of doctoral education on either side of the pond. Such passages read like a columnist giving their true opinions on aspects of the world around them and as a result seem a little fluffy. I found myself wondering on several occasions if the same kind of behaviour would have been tolerated by another author (one perhaps not as established as Gould was at the time of this book's publishing, or one from a different demographic, or indeed one writing just a few decades in the future). One particularly irksome example was of his use of the film It's A Wonderful Life.No doubt where Gould got the main title of his book from, the film gets no mention until over two thirds of the way through the book. Gould uses the film to illustrate the argument for which I came to this book in the first place - that if one were to rewind the 'tape of life' then life as we know it would not emerge on the replay. Gould's reasoning for this is based heavily on what is commonly understood as the butterfly effect (though Gould does not himself use this terminology). It is in an explanation of how the butterfly effect works that Gould references It's A Wonderful Life: the seemingly-insignificant-at-the-time events of George's life had massive knock-on effects to the point where the world would have been a very different place had he never been born. My problem with Gould's use of It's A Wonderful Life is twofold: it was too long, and it came too late in the book. Gould practically recounts the entire film to the reader when a few examples from the film would have had the desired effect. And the argument which Gould is attempting to illustrate has already been given throughout the book. By the time the reader reaches this illustration, they no longer need it.Gould's use of lengthy and tangential illustrations was irritating, but this book has a more egregious fault. I was reading this book at the same time I was reading Delores S. Williams' Sisters in the Wilderness, a book which - among other things - made me aware of some of the historical and scientific 'justifications' for racism. In particular, Williams made me aware of Louis Agassiz's affirmation and perpetuation of racist pseudoscience. Reading these two books in tandem made Agassiz's name in Wonderful Life stand out all the more. Gould references Agassiz twice in this book, but never mentions this dangerous and ugly side of his work; indeed, the only description Gould gives of Agassiz or his work is that he was ""America's greatest natural historian"" (p242). Granted, Williams' book was published four years after Gould's, but I would nevertheless caution the reader of this and other similar works to keep in mind the historiography of the field in a way which Gould does not.If one can tolerate the tangents and is thoughtful of the ugly history behind some of the discoveries which made this book, I think you can get a lot out of it. The scientific jargon is kept to a minimum and the writing style flows well. It provides a helpful history of the discovery and research of the fossils found in the Burgess Shale and what this work has meant for evolutionary science and current thinking of the history of life on Earth. I think this book is an apt reminder that even a book as worthwhile to the field as this one is does not - and should not - escape criticism, particularly in light of its own uncritical elements."
45,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57886276-owen-moorhead,2,"In the introduction to this book, Gould writes that he hoped to be an ""insider McPhee"" or something like that. Well Mr. Gould, I've read John McPhee; I know John McPhee's work--you sir, are no John McPhee.There are a few problems with this book that prevent it from succeeding (for me). For starters, there's the obvious one: Gould is too close to his subject matter. He seems to recognize this, but that self-awareness doesn't confer immunity to an understandable and natural tendency to forge boldly into the weeds. He is (probably) a much better stylist than most paleontologists, but that is not enough on its own to communicate such delicacies as the ramosity of a Burgess fossil's appendages. To Gould's credit, I think he recognizes this: he clearly felt the information needed a narrative and a theme to make for an interesting read to the lay reader.That brings me to another problem, namely the ideas with which Gould ties together the story of the Burgess fossils and their taxonomy. There are two images that recur continually throughout the book: rewinding tapes and a shoehorn. (Cones and trees also feature heavily.) They are invoked to illustrate two major themes of the book: the pernicious influence of ideology on scientific work and something about contingency. By the end of the book, I was starting to get annoyed with how frequently Gould resorts to these images.I won't say too much about Gould's thesis on ideology because I think it's well-argued and convincing. The contingency argument is more central and a bit confusing. It seems to go something like this: if you were to rewind the video tape of evolution or natural history or whatever, things would turn out differently. Let's leave aside the obvious problem with this image--namely, that no matter how many times you rewind a tape, it will always play the same way, plus or minus the marginal physical alterations that will take place through excessive rewinding.The main issue I have with this argument is I can't understand why Gould attaches so much importance to it. ""Things could have turned out differently than they did,"" he says. That seems to me a metaphysical question that may be trivial or unprovable, depending on your philosophical sympathies.But so what? That's the big question, which went unanswered throughout the book. If this had been a simple exposition of Burgess fauna, that wouldn't be a big deal. But Gould clearly thinks this assemblage proves something incredibly important about, I don't know, life, the universe, and everything. What exactly that is, I never did quite catch.The most eye-raising assertion of this book is that the Burgess Shale is the most important paleontological discovery of the century, and it is never really argued persuasively. That's the biggest failing of ""Wonderful Life"": it never convinced me of any of the lofty assertions Gould made at the outset.All that said, it wasn't terrible, and the writing really is pretty good, if occasionally pretentious."
46,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,5,"THis is a wonderful book, in all the senses of the word. The primary focus, the burgess fossils, are the stuff of science fiction - strange compilations of animal parts in strange configurations - so strange that science fiction could only take a lead from nature rather than anticipate it. For some reason, early life took some wild turns, many of which then failed to survive. If this book were only a catalog of these unusual beasts it would have been fascinating, but this is only the start.In part because of their strangeness, the second story - that of their discovery and rediscovery - adds to the interest: Initially discovered by Americas greatest paleontologist of the time, the real wonder of the fossils was missed. His analysis, biased by a preconceived notion of how things should be, didn't recognize the fact that many of these creatures did not fit modern categories. It took half a century before they were re-discovered and this time, recognized for the oddities that they really were. Why the first discovery missed, and the second did not, illustrates the all too human aspect to science which itself is often overlooked by preconceived notions of objectivity and dispassion. From these points Jay Gould presents his meta thesis regarding the almost heretical conclusion life's history tells: natural selection is not the only force guiding evolution. Somehow, and not just once, the 'progress' of life has been subject to freak events which have resulted in us humans. Our story, and all other life, is dependent or 'contingent' on these non-biological circumstances - we could as easily not be here. Thus at the third level, the book provides a sense of wonder, of amazement about our existence. Although he uses religious allusions with an abundance that probably leaves a Dawkins type shuddering, there is no supernatural conclusion inferred or implied, nor need there be. Whichever faith one has, I would hope that the wonder Jay Gould illicits is something all experience regarding the specialness of life. Finally, despite the heavy technical content, Jay Gould succeeds in conveying the story with scientific rigor which is also accessible to the uninitiated. Much 'popular science' is either dumbed down and over-punctuated (!), or not far enough removed from the home territory of journal publications. This then is the book's fourth wonder and the ultimate reason for my five star rating. "
47,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12305720-robert,5,"After visiting the Burgess Shale in August 2017, I decided to reread this book by SJ Gould, which I first read (and loved) sometime in the 1990s, shortly after it was published in 1989. Full disclosure, for years I used to devour Gould's This View of Life columns in Natural History magazine every month, and thoroughly enjoyed his books in the 1980s and 1990s, but haven't had the heart (or the stamina) to attempt his final and massive book (2002's The Structure of Evolutionary Theory). A brief foray into that tome made me realize that, at that late stage of his career, his writing style had become a bit too florid, his long and frequent asides too peripheral, and his tendency to show-off his obvious erudition had gotten a bit out of control. 1989's Wonderful Life, The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History, on the other hand, demonstrates Gould at his full powers. Wringing general principles out of specific geological, paleontological, or historical events, he brilliantly deconstructs iconic ideas (preconceptions?) in paleontology (e.g., increasing cone of diversity, gradualism, and adaptationist notions), offering in their place historical contingency, hierarchical levels of selection, and a ""neo-catastrophist"" approach to mass extinctions. It's true that the numerous quotations from Milton and Frost (no Gilbert and Sullivan, at least!), the ostentatious multilingualism, and the sometimes florid prose can seem to some readers a bit over the top, but these tendencies never take over in this book. The story he tells in this book about Walcott's discovery of the Burgess Shale high in the Canadian Rockies of British Colombia in 1909, and the revolutionary reinterpretation of the meaning of this Middle Cambrian ""explosion"" of life by the brilliant paleontologist Harry Whittington and his two equally brilliant students Derek Briggs and Simon Conway Morris is an inspiring one for scientists everywhere, and paleontologists in particular. Highly recommended."
48,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/748327-andrew-hudson,4,"For anyone in the dark, the Burgess Shale is one of the greatest fossil discoveries in palaeontological history. Uncovered in British Columbia by Charles Doolittle Walcott, one of America's most distinguished scientific minds, the Burgess Shale contained an astonishing diversity of forms - but most significantly, from a time at which no solid evidence for life had yet been found.Palaeontology had suffered from a critical absence in the fossil record. Dinosaurs, trilobites and many other extinct lifeforms had long been known of, of course, but while the hard body parts of dead creatures make for good fossilisation, the soft do not, tending to decay long before they can leave their mark. The sorry fact was that, prior to the Mid-Cambrian period (over five hundred million years ago), fossil evidence simply was not to be found. Whatever creatures had existed before the evolution of such hard structures as bone, chitin or shell, they had left no clue behind....until 1909. In the years that followed, C.D. Walcott collected nearly ninety thousand fossils, and though his time in the field was hampered by wide-ranging commitments as an administrator and leader of several of his country's most significant scientific bodies, he somehow found the time to study and report on his discovery as well. What he had found was nothing less than what the palaeontological community had longed for: evidence of simpler forms of life, early links in the chain that, over millions of years, would eventually produce fish and insects, amphibians and reptiles, birds, mammals and man.Or, do I hear you cry, DID he?Nearly sixty years after Walcott's discovery an Englishman named Harry Whittington, the world's leading expert on trilobites, began a process which would shine new light on a subject long considered as fact. With the help of a small group of allies they began to uncover details of the Burgess artefacts never before recognised; details which challenged Walcott's accepted wisdom regarding what his discoveries were; details which even called into question the basic nature of the evolutionary process itself.Whittington and his fellows proved with their efforts that, contrary to the traditional notion of simple creatures gradually improving over time, early evolution represented a chaotic period of sophisticated experimentation, with only blind chance in control of which forms of life would survive to define the future.Or, do I hear you cry, DID they?In Wonderful Life, Stephen J. Gould takes us on a remarkable journey. Setting the scene with an examination of our expectations in conventional evolutionary theory, we join him with Walcott on the Canadian slopes, then follow the various players as they reveal the unseen for the first time, or unveil it anew. He celebrates both the pioneer and the revolutionaries for, he claims, achievements to rank beside any undertaken by the more recognised ""hard"" sciences.He examines, with appropriate respect, how Walcott could make such a critical mistake regarding his subjects, how it was effectively impossible for him to conceive of an alternative to the notion of slow but inevitable ""upward"" development. In fact the revisionist work to come didn't utilise amazing breakthroughs of thought or technology. Nothing that was done in the 70s and 80s was beyond Walcott's technical capacities - but as a product of his time and place he was simply predisposed to see what he wanted or needed to see, so he did.Finally, after leading us through a fascinating and surprisingly accessible education in the field of ancient evolution, Gould demonstrates how these revelations about early life hang the probability of our own existence in a frighteningly - or, to another palate, thrillingly - slender thread.Or, do I hear you cry, DOES he?Because, not to put too fine a point on it, not everyone agrees with Gould's conclusions - even the visionaries he celebrates in the book. Subtitled The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History, Gould's overview of the re-examination of palaeontology's crown jewel begins as a heartfelt celebration of the scientific method and ends as, arguably, an overenthusiastic departure towards his belief in mankind's unlikeliness, and a variation on the standard evolutionary theory which is far from universally accepted. However, between and through these extremes, he treats us to an engaging, enthusiastic and entertaining experience, and it is for this that the book will continue to deserve a readership, even if some of his conclusions draw fire from various detractors as time marches on.It should not be assumed though that the book is closed on Gould's perspective, that He Was Wrong and That Is That. Ten minutes of layperson level browsing underlined for me that there remains debate; and while some of those lined up in opposition to Gould's claims are pretty big guns of the scientific world, even amongst them there is great respect for his writing - and that there can be disagreement and simultaneous support for his work is as interesting to me as his argument itself.It would be nice, reassuringly so, if every science writer, presenting and then interpreting evidence, could be shown to produce undeniable fact; to raise the bar for others to jump from, not at; but this isn't what science necessarily does. Science may be just a system of beliefs no different from any other, religious or not, and as such just as fallible - no, infinitely more so, as for science the facts may sometimes show the beliefs to be wrong.Subject to the righteous threat of constant revision, every theory may eventually come apart at the how it seems - but if great theories give rise to great books only for greater theories to take their turn, then it's a small price to pay to have such good things to read while we wait for the next in line. Gould would, I think, happily accept this form of progressive improvement over time, if no other."
49,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38010332-greta,5,"If you read the book recently, it is outdated. I do not really like Jay Gould as a scientist since he is kind of wordy and has peculiar theories, but that is not a matter of this book. If you judge the book as a picky evolutionary scientist, you will find lots of mistakes or outdated information. This is a book for non-scientists, although some concepts might be difficult to understand, I confess. Stephen success in trying to introduce us to the amazing world of early living forms that might be not as astonishing as dinosaurs, or some other popular fossils, but certainly these apparently insignificant arthropods were the beginning for everything in life, and most people do not even know they all existed and how important they were. I would recommend this book to science enthusiasts, geologists without a biology background, or freshman biology students, who might get the most of it."
50,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10404161-alex-shrugged,5,"This book is entrancing from the first to the last page. There is a short time, perhaps 3 or 4 pages where the narrative bogs down, but the rest is well paced, and fascinating.This is a book about the Burgess Shale in British Columbia and the scientific blunder of the century caused by a mind refusing to see what the fossils were telling him. This need to shoehorn the Burgess Shale ""oddballs"" into well-known groups was due to certain preconceptions that were strong at the time and remain a problem (though a lesser one) into the modern day.The narrative is presented as a drama in several acts because the story resembles a mystery slowly uncovered and ultimately changing the history of life.Dr. Walcott discovered the Burgess Shale in 1909. He was looking for evidence of the beginning of the Cambrian Explosion, the apparently sudden appearance of complex multi-cellular life. What he found was a treasure of fossils shortly after the event. (A few million years is considered ""shortly after"".) Since the generally accepted view of evolution is a leisurely improvement as species develop from the simple to the complex, finding complex fossils so early in natural history was disruptive to Darwin's Theory and had to be explained. In other words, if life was so complex during the Cambrian period then there should have been simpler species that came LONG before then in the Precambrian era. Yet these simpler precursors could not be found. An explanation was needed. The pressure to make these Burgess Shale ""oddballs"" fit into an ""acceptable"" scientific model of evolution was tremendous. Thus for decades the Burgess discoveries remained on the back shelves and in drawers, most unstudied and the few ""oddballs"" shoved quickly into known categories and forgotten.Decades later, Dr. Whittington decided to study the Burgess specimens, hoping to find some new type of trilobite. He believed that Dr. Walcott was generally correct, that somehow these specimens would fit into known groups. Yet, as he studied each specimen more closely, he realized that some of them represented an entirely new branch of the evolutionary tree. In fact, it wasn't a tree at all. It was more like an evolutionary bush.The book is actually about how our prejudices and even the diagrams and charts we use push us toward preconditioned conclusions. (FYI, the author does this himself in a few cases, minor but I noticed.) The author has convinced me that life on Earth (or at least intelligent life) is darn near impossible, except that here we are discussing it. He does accept as a given that some sort of life developing on Earth was inevitable, but the idea that Homo sapiens were destined to become the pinnacle of Creation or even the best that evolution had to offer is utterly ridiculous. From a probability and statistics point of view I am forced to agree with the author. I am a religious man, but I don't look to the Bible for my science lessons. The Jewish New Year has begun. As I recited my prayers I acknowledged that the new year is 5779 since the Creation. Do I really believe that? I know what the logic behind the number is, and I am willing to accord respect to the scholars who came up with that number. It was a good effort given the knowledge they had at the time and I stick with it out of that respect even though I write 2018 on my checks. Christians have come up with a different number. I assume they respect those Christians scholars of the past and write 2018 on their checks as well.During the time of Dr. Walcott, about 12 years before he discovered the Burgess Shale, Lord Kelvin estimated (in 1897) that the Earth was about 20-40 million years old. That was the accepted figure because no one (except Einstein in 1905 with E=mc2) could conceive of any other way that the Earth could stay warm long enough to develop life. Once they realized nuclear fusion in the Sun and radioactive decay on Earth could keep it warm, much longer estimates for the age of the Earth could be credibly entertained.I've had windy debates about evolution with folks. It seems that any deviation from Darwin's ""ironclad"" declarations are considered heresy. ""Burn the Witch!"" Oh... did I say that out loud? :-) Darwinists are those poor souls who follow Darwin's Theory on evolution as if it were holy writ. These people do science and the theory of evolution no good. What we need are adult conversations and reasoned debate. Not accusations nor insults. I think Darwin's Theory on evolution is a good first pass at the idea. The theory has some flaws that need work, but over all, it is good stuff... really good for a time when DNA was unknown and microscopes were very poor instruments. This is my second reading of the book. I promised a fellow I've been debating that I would read the book again and come back with some quotes to support my position on the age of the Earth and the improbability that life on Earth might come from another planet (say Mars) and then develop on Earth into life as we know it. This is called panspermia and while it is a logical idea, it is not a very probable idea. On the other hand, I don't think life developing as it did on Earth on its own is very probable either. That doesn't mean it didn't happen. I just like knocking around ideas. Don't read too much into it.Oh... and I forgot to mention... The ""F-Word"" is used once in this book as an actual quote from one of the scientists who suddenly realized he had found yet another Burgess ""oddball"" that didn't fit any known phyla. It seems juvenile to use such a direct quote in a book like this, but the book contains a few anachronisms that only make sense if you realize that it was written in the 1980's about events from the 1910's to the 1970's. "
51,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16022816-chris-stratton,3,I am sure this is a great book among paleontologists. The detail of each species he documents and explains and the arguments for reclassifications must be a joy to someone in the field. I however was on a forced march to finish the book. I found the book interesting don’t get me wrong but much went beyond my knowledge of paleontology or biology for that matter. My takeaways? Beware of preconceived ideas! Oh and by the way knowing you are applying preconceived is really hard. Don’t be afraid of speaking up if the establishment believes one thing and you believe another especially if you can prove it.

The book is twenty years old, and some of the content has been revised or disputed since; however, I learned a great deal about this pivotal period in the history of life. Gould's style is dense and ""wordy"" at times, and there was too much analysis of Walcott's persona and approach to his discoveries in the Burgess Shale, but it didn't detract too much from what is a genuinely fascinating read."

73,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1959519-max-maxwell,5,"To be clear, Wonderful Life is not a perfect book, but it is certainly an amazing book. It's pertinent to ask, ""Where does the book fall flat?""First, the middle section of the book, ""The Reconstruction of the Burgess Shale,"" is just a little bit too long. I mean exactly what I said; a few pages, say, 20 or so, after you've said, ""OK, I'm ready to get out of this murky details section and get on with the implications of it all,"" the section ends. As Gould points out, the section is, admittedly, important:Pleading is undignified, but allow me one line: please bear with the details; they are accessible, and they are the gateway to a new world.And bear with them you will, through about 200 pages of descriptions of, say, how the specimens of Opabinia or Hallucigenia were dissected, camera lucida diagrams, and repetitive descriptions of Harry Whittington's conservative temperament.The best parts of the book are the first, fourth, and fifth sections. The first, ""The Iconography of an Expectation,"" deals with the tendency amongst scientists and laypeople alike to see evolution as a linear process resulting in more and more complexity and always yielding intelligence. The fourth, ""Walcott's Vision and the Nature of History,"" tells of the myriad expectations that led the original discoverer and describer of the Burgess to make the fatal error of placing all the Burgess biota, most of which were completely new to science, in previously known categories, as ancestors of modern creatures. And the fifth, ""Possible Worlds,"" uses parts two and three (the ones with all the details) as a jumping board from which to explore the idea of punctuated equilibrium and its subsequent idea of contingency.Punctuated equilibrium is the idea that evolution is not a straight line of progress. Rather, evolution centers on mass extinctions such as the extinction that killed 96 or 97% of life on earth, including most of the Burgess organisms. Evolution only works in a straight line up until a really mass extinction, and then all bets are off. Natural selection is so tied to local environments that if the environment changes it can mean game over:Even if fishes hone their adaptations to peaks of aquatic perfection, they will all die if the ponds dry up. But grubby old Buster the Lungfish, former laughingstock of the piscine priesthood, may pull through... if we are Buster's legacy... how can we possibly view our mentality as inevitable, or even probable?One instantly thinks of polar bears doomed by global warming. Gould calls the element of history that relies on happenstance and massively improbable coincidence ""contingency,"" and he hammers its prevalence home with numerous examples—notably that the Burgess organism Pikaia was the earliest chordate, and its nonexistence would have erased us from history.My main objection to contingency is complicated, but in the spirit of this review, I might ask you to bear with my details. Steven Pinker, in his book 
The Blank Slate
, makes an excellent point:Sigmund Freud immodestly wrote that ""humanity has in the course of its time had to endure from the hands of science three great outrages upon its native self-love"": the discovery that our world is not the center of the celestial spheres but rather a speck in a vast universe, the discovery that we are not specially created but instead descended from the animals, and the discovery that often our conscious minds do not control how we act but merely tell us a story about our actions.Science does have a proud tradition of muckraking by demoting the status of humankind further and further, from Lord of Creation, created in God's image, to just another ape on another rock in another galaxy. To most people, this is insulting, even troubling; to those who understand, to those who find themselves, like Job, ""comforted that I am dust,"" it's humbling, and beautiful. But it does lead to a sort of playground-style fight over who among the sciences has demoted man furthest. Gould seems to be making a play here:As Freud observed, our relationship with science must be paradoxical because we are forced to pay an almost intolerable price for each major gain in knowledge and power—the psychological cost of progressive dethronement from the center of things, and increasing marginality in an uncaring universe.He's referencing Freud in order to tie in the concept with his view of contingency.Here's where things get neat: think about SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. SETI optimists, people who feel that it is likely that the universe is populated by intelligent life (myself included), base our assumption on a certain feel for evolution. Carl Sagan was a SETI optimist; he felt that evolution follows, if not a straight line, per se, a route to progress. If Gould is to be believed that (a) contingency is all-important in understanding evolution and (b) contingency is one of Freud's demotions, then Sagan's converse idea should be empowering to man, in the sense that it indicates that evolution must eventually result in something like us. And yet—here is Sagan in his book 
Pale Blue Dot
, titling a chapter ""The Great Demotions,"" and claiming among those demotions the notion that we may not be alone in the universe!The thing is that Gould is not the only supporter of punctuated equilibrium that upholds his ideas as those most demoralizing to mankind. Here's Michael Shermer in the Spring 2008 issue of Skeptic magazine:Historical experiment after experiment reveals the same answer: we are a fluke of nature, a quirk of evolution, a glorious contingency. It is tempting to... write yourself into the story as the central pattern in order to find purpose and meaning... But skeptical alarms should toll whenever anyone claims that science has discovered our deepest desires and oldest myths are true after all... a purpose-seeking animal will find itself as the purpose of nature.Shermer is responding to SETI optimism with a stone face. The point is that Shermer and Gould accuse SETI optimists of wishful thinking, without realizing that their notion so perfectly backs up the very teachings of the church: that we are alone and that we are the only intelligent life out there.—you see, the idea of SETI was once about where contingency is now. The idea of other people was very troubling to the religious; how could God send a saviour to two or more worlds? I'm not saying that contingency is a bad idea, and neither am I knocking punctuated equilibrium. I'm just saying it's not as much of a revelation as Gould thinks.I'm done complaining.—so, what did Gould get right?One of the major appeals of the book is his treatment of scientists as real, quirky people instead of arcane demigods; think the best parts of Bill Bryson's 
A Short History of Nearly Everything
 in more depth. Whittington, Briggs, Conway Morris, Walcott, and even Darwin come alive in these pages, in their words, if possible.He also presents the details with arresting scope and clarity. Sidebars throughout help the layman through arthropod terminology, and the book is lavishly illustrated throughout. Gould's prose is stellar—each punctuation mark and word is devastating. Some say that he rambles, but they're missing the point, because Gould's rambling is his charm. He conveys his passion like few other science writers manage to do.Finally, despite being 20 years old this year, the science in Wonderful Life is cutting-edge. After that long, there were bound to be some corrections: for example, Anomalocaris did not perish soon after the Shale's time; a relative named Schinderhannes survived until the Devonian, 100 million years after the Burgess. Furthermore, Anomalocaris and Opabinia are now considered lobopods, not their own distinct phylum. Hallucigenia walked on its ""tenticles,"" not on its spines, making it substantially less hallucinogenic than once imagined. These are trivialities, in my opinion; for every incorrect guess, Gould makes three that panned out, including correctly placing Aysheiea in the phylum Onychophora, at a time when it was in dispute as to what it was, and calling that the Burgess represented a world-wide fauna based on a few Chinese fossils, guessing that more would show up (in the 2000s, the Changjiang fauna did indeed show up, replete with complete anomalocarids and primitive chordata related to Pikaia, theretofore a single specimen).The facts are these: Wonderful Life makes you think. It's brilliantly written. And, at the end of the day, the creatures and fossils are just awesome. Paleo enthusiasts like me are all kids at heart, Gould being no exception at all."
74,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467405-ellen,3,"I read this book for research and primarily for Gould's argument, given throughout this book, that if one were to rewind the 'tape of life' then life as we know it would not emerge on the replay. Gould is clear in his opening chapter that he intends for this book to be both useful for students of the history of life on Earth and for the lay person interested in the same. With no formal scientific training beyond the age of 16, I am only qualified to assess the success of the latter intention, which I can do positively.That being said, however, Gould's quest for accessibility also leads him down some very odd tangents. In the name of illustrating some of his points he begins to almost rant about certain aspects of life and the academy. One notable example is a lengthy lament about the current (at least, current as of the book's writing in the summer of 1988) state of doctoral education on either side of the pond. Such passages read like a columnist giving their true opinions on aspects of the world around them and as a result seem a little fluffy. I found myself wondering on several occasions if the same kind of behaviour would have been tolerated by another author (one perhaps not as established as Gould was at the time of this book's publishing, or one from a different demographic, or indeed one writing just a few decades in the future). One particularly irksome example was of his use of the film It's A Wonderful Life.No doubt where Gould got the main title of his book from, the film gets no mention until over two thirds of the way through the book. Gould uses the film to illustrate the argument for which I came to this book in the first place - that if one were to rewind the 'tape of life' then life as we know it would not emerge on the replay. Gould's reasoning for this is based heavily on what is commonly understood as the butterfly effect (though Gould does not himself use this terminology). It is in an explanation of how the butterfly effect works that Gould references It's A Wonderful Life: the seemingly-insignificant-at-the-time events of George's life had massive knock-on effects to the point where the world would have been a very different place had he never been born. My problem with Gould's use of It's A Wonderful Life is twofold: it was too long, and it came too late in the book. Gould practically recounts the entire film to the reader when a few examples from the film would have had the desired effect. And the argument which Gould is attempting to illustrate has already been given throughout the book. By the time the reader reaches this illustration, they no longer need it.Gould's use of lengthy and tangential illustrations was irritating, but this book has a more egregious fault. I was reading this book at the same time I was reading Delores S. Williams' Sisters in the Wilderness, a book which - among other things - made me aware of some of the historical and scientific 'justifications' for racism. In particular, Williams made me aware of Louis Agassiz's affirmation and perpetuation of racist pseudoscience. Reading these two books in tandem made Agassiz's name in Wonderful Life stand out all the more. Gould references Agassiz twice in this book, but never mentions this dangerous and ugly side of his work; indeed, the only description Gould gives of Agassiz or his work is that he was ""America's greatest natural historian"" (p242). Granted, Williams' book was published four years after Gould's, but I would nevertheless caution the reader of this and other similar works to keep in mind the historiography of the field in a way which Gould does not.If one can tolerate the tangents and is thoughtful of the ugly history behind some of the discoveries which made this book, I think you can get a lot out of it. The scientific jargon is kept to a minimum and the writing style flows well. It provides a helpful history of the discovery and research of the fossils found in the Burgess Shale and what this work has meant for evolutionary science and current thinking of the history of life on Earth. I think this book is an apt reminder that even a book as worthwhile to the field as this one is does not - and should not - escape criticism, particularly in light of its own uncritical elements."
75,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57886276-owen-moorhead,2,"In the introduction to this book, Gould writes that he hoped to be an ""insider McPhee"" or something like that. Well Mr. Gould, I've read John McPhee; I know John McPhee's work--you sir, are no John McPhee.There are a few problems with this book that prevent it from succeeding (for me). For starters, there's the obvious one: Gould is too close to his subject matter. He seems to recognize this, but that self-awareness doesn't confer immunity to an understandable and natural tendency to forge boldly into the weeds. He is (probably) a much better stylist than most paleontologists, but that is not enough on its own to communicate such delicacies as the ramosity of a Burgess fossil's appendages. To Gould's credit, I think he recognizes this: he clearly felt the information needed a narrative and a theme to make for an interesting read to the lay reader.That brings me to another problem, namely the ideas with which Gould ties together the story of the Burgess fossils and their taxonomy. There are two images that recur continually throughout the book: rewinding tapes and a shoehorn. (Cones and trees also feature heavily.) They are invoked to illustrate two major themes of the book: the pernicious influence of ideology on scientific work and something about contingency. By the end of the book, I was starting to get annoyed with how frequently Gould resorts to these images.I won't say too much about Gould's thesis on ideology because I think it's well-argued and convincing. The contingency argument is more central and a bit confusing. It seems to go something like this: if you were to rewind the video tape of evolution or natural history or whatever, things would turn out differently. Let's leave aside the obvious problem with this image--namely, that no matter how many times you rewind a tape, it will always play the same way, plus or minus the marginal physical alterations that will take place through excessive rewinding.The main issue I have with this argument is I can't understand why Gould attaches so much importance to it. ""Things could have turned out differently than they did,"" he says. That seems to me a metaphysical question that may be trivial or unprovable, depending on your philosophical sympathies.But so what? That's the big question, which went unanswered throughout the book. If this had been a simple exposition of Burgess fauna, that wouldn't be a big deal. But Gould clearly thinks this assemblage proves something incredibly important about, I don't know, life, the universe, and everything. What exactly that is, I never did quite catch.The most eye-raising assertion of this book is that the Burgess Shale is the most important paleontological discovery of the century, and it is never really argued persuasively. That's the biggest failing of ""Wonderful Life"": it never convinced me of any of the lofty assertions Gould made at the outset.All that said, it wasn't terrible, and the writing really is pretty good, if occasionally pretentious."
76,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,5,"THis is a wonderful book, in all the senses of the word. The primary focus, the burgess fossils, are the stuff of science fiction - strange compilations of animal parts in strange configurations - so strange that science fiction could only take a lead from nature rather than anticipate it. For some reason, early life took some wild turns, many of which then failed to survive. If this book were only a catalog of these unusual beasts it would have been fascinating, but this is only the start.In part because of their strangeness, the second story - that of their discovery and rediscovery - adds to the interest: Initially discovered by Americas greatest paleontologist of the time, the real wonder of the fossils was missed. His analysis, biased by a preconceived notion of how things should be, didn't recognize the fact that many of these creatures did not fit modern categories. It took half a century before they were re-discovered and this time, recognized for the oddities that they really were. Why the first discovery missed, and the second did not, illustrates the all too human aspect to science which itself is often overlooked by preconceived notions of objectivity and dispassion. From these points Jay Gould presents his meta thesis regarding the almost heretical conclusion life's history tells: natural selection is not the only force guiding evolution. Somehow, and not just once, the 'progress' of life has been subject to freak events which have resulted in us humans. Our story, and all other life, is dependent or 'contingent' on these non-biological circumstances - we could as easily not be here. Thus at the third level, the book provides a sense of wonder, of amazement about our existence. Although he uses religious allusions with an abundance that probably leaves a Dawkins type shuddering, there is no supernatural conclusion inferred or implied, nor need there be. Whichever faith one has, I would hope that the wonder Jay Gould illicits is something all experience regarding the specialness of life. Finally, despite the heavy technical content, Jay Gould succeeds in conveying the story with scientific rigor which is also accessible to the uninitiated. Much 'popular science' is either dumbed down and over-punctuated (!), or not far enough removed from the home territory of journal publications. This then is the book's fourth wonder and the ultimate reason for my five star rating. "
77,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12305720-robert,5,"After visiting the Burgess Shale in August 2017, I decided to reread this book by SJ Gould, which I first read (and loved) sometime in the 1990s, shortly after it was published in 1989. Full disclosure, for years I used to devour Gould's This View of Life columns in Natural History magazine every month, and thoroughly enjoyed his books in the 1980s and 1990s, but haven't had the heart (or the stamina) to attempt his final and massive book (2002's The Structure of Evolutionary Theory). A brief foray into that tome made me realize that, at that late stage of his career, his writing style had become a bit too florid, his long and frequent asides too peripheral, and his tendency to show-off his obvious erudition had gotten a bit out of control. 1989's Wonderful Life, The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History, on the other hand, demonstrates Gould at his full powers. Wringing general principles out of specific geological, paleontological, or historical events, he brilliantly deconstructs iconic ideas (preconceptions?) in paleontology (e.g., increasing cone of diversity, gradualism, and adaptationist notions), offering in their place historical contingency, hierarchical levels of selection, and a ""neo-catastrophist"" approach to mass extinctions. It's true that the numerous quotations from Milton and Frost (no Gilbert and Sullivan, at least!), the ostentatious multilingualism, and the sometimes florid prose can seem to some readers a bit over the top, but these tendencies never take over in this book. The story he tells in this book about Walcott's discovery of the Burgess Shale high in the Canadian Rockies of British Colombia in 1909, and the revolutionary reinterpretation of the meaning of this Middle Cambrian ""explosion"" of life by the brilliant paleontologist Harry Whittington and his two equally brilliant students Derek Briggs and Simon Conway Morris is an inspiring one for scientists everywhere, and paleontologists in particular. Highly recommended."
78,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/748327-andrew-hudson,4,"For anyone in the dark, the Burgess Shale is one of the greatest fossil discoveries in palaeontological history. Uncovered in British Columbia by Charles Doolittle Walcott, one of America's most distinguished scientific minds, the Burgess Shale contained an astonishing diversity of forms - but most significantly, from a time at which no solid evidence for life had yet been found.Palaeontology had suffered from a critical absence in the fossil record. Dinosaurs, trilobites and many other extinct lifeforms had long been known of, of course, but while the hard body parts of dead creatures make for good fossilisation, the soft do not, tending to decay long before they can leave their mark. The sorry fact was that, prior to the Mid-Cambrian period (over five hundred million years ago), fossil evidence simply was not to be found. Whatever creatures had existed before the evolution of such hard structures as bone, chitin or shell, they had left no clue behind....until 1909. In the years that followed, C.D. Walcott collected nearly ninety thousand fossils, and though his time in the field was hampered by wide-ranging commitments as an administrator and leader of several of his country's most significant scientific bodies, he somehow found the time to study and report on his discovery as well. What he had found was nothing less than what the palaeontological community had longed for: evidence of simpler forms of life, early links in the chain that, over millions of years, would eventually produce fish and insects, amphibians and reptiles, birds, mammals and man.Or, do I hear you cry, DID he?Nearly sixty years after Walcott's discovery an Englishman named Harry Whittington, the world's leading expert on trilobites, began a process which would shine new light on a subject long considered as fact. With the help of a small group of allies they began to uncover details of the Burgess artefacts never before recognised; details which challenged Walcott's accepted wisdom regarding what his discoveries were; details which even called into question the basic nature of the evolutionary process itself.Whittington and his fellows proved with their efforts that, contrary to the traditional notion of simple creatures gradually improving over time, early evolution represented a chaotic period of sophisticated experimentation, with only blind chance in control of which forms of life would survive to define the future.Or, do I hear you cry, DID they?In Wonderful Life, Stephen J. Gould takes us on a remarkable journey. Setting the scene with an examination of our expectations in conventional evolutionary theory, we join him with Walcott on the Canadian slopes, then follow the various players as they reveal the unseen for the first time, or unveil it anew. He celebrates both the pioneer and the revolutionaries for, he claims, achievements to rank beside any undertaken by the more recognised ""hard"" sciences.He examines, with appropriate respect, how Walcott could make such a critical mistake regarding his subjects, how it was effectively impossible for him to conceive of an alternative to the notion of slow but inevitable ""upward"" development. In fact the revisionist work to come didn't utilise amazing breakthroughs of thought or technology. Nothing that was done in the 70s and 80s was beyond Walcott's technical capacities - but as a product of his time and place he was simply predisposed to see what he wanted or needed to see, so he did.Finally, after leading us through a fascinating and surprisingly accessible education in the field of ancient evolution, Gould demonstrates how these revelations about early life hang the probability of our own existence in a frighteningly - or, to another palate, thrillingly - slender thread.Or, do I hear you cry, DOES he?Because, not to put too fine a point on it, not everyone agrees with Gould's conclusions - even the visionaries he celebrates in the book. Subtitled The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History, Gould's overview of the re-examination of palaeontology's crown jewel begins as a heartfelt celebration of the scientific method and ends as, arguably, an overenthusiastic departure towards his belief in mankind's unlikeliness, and a variation on the standard evolutionary theory which is far from universally accepted. However, between and through these extremes, he treats us to an engaging, enthusiastic and entertaining experience, and it is for this that the book will continue to deserve a readership, even if some of his conclusions draw fire from various detractors as time marches on.It should not be assumed though that the book is closed on Gould's perspective, that He Was Wrong and That Is That. Ten minutes of layperson level browsing underlined for me that there remains debate; and while some of those lined up in opposition to Gould's claims are pretty big guns of the scientific world, even amongst them there is great respect for his writing - and that there can be disagreement and simultaneous support for his work is as interesting to me as his argument itself.It would be nice, reassuringly so, if every science writer, presenting and then interpreting evidence, could be shown to produce undeniable fact; to raise the bar for others to jump from, not at; but this isn't what science necessarily does. Science may be just a system of beliefs no different from any other, religious or not, and as such just as fallible - no, infinitely more so, as for science the facts may sometimes show the beliefs to be wrong.Subject to the righteous threat of constant revision, every theory may eventually come apart at the how it seems - but if great theories give rise to great books only for greater theories to take their turn, then it's a small price to pay to have such good things to read while we wait for the next in line. Gould would, I think, happily accept this form of progressive improvement over time, if no other."
79,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38010332-greta,5,"If you read the book recently, it is outdated. I do not really like Jay Gould as a scientist since he is kind of wordy and has peculiar theories, but that is not a matter of this book. If you judge the book as a picky evolutionary scientist, you will find lots of mistakes or outdated information. This is a book for non-scientists, although some concepts might be difficult to understand, I confess. Stephen success in trying to introduce us to the amazing world of early living forms that might be not as astonishing as dinosaurs, or some other popular fossils, but certainly these apparently insignificant arthropods were the beginning for everything in life, and most people do not even know they all existed and how important they were. I would recommend this book to science enthusiasts, geologists without a biology background, or freshman biology students, who might get the most of it."
80,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10404161-alex-shrugged,5,"This book is entrancing from the first to the last page. There is a short time, perhaps 3 or 4 pages where the narrative bogs down, but the rest is well paced, and fascinating.This is a book about the Burgess Shale in British Columbia and the scientific blunder of the century caused by a mind refusing to see what the fossils were telling him. This need to shoehorn the Burgess Shale ""oddballs"" into well-known groups was due to certain preconceptions that were strong at the time and remain a problem (though a lesser one) into the modern day.The narrative is presented as a drama in several acts because the story resembles a mystery slowly uncovered and ultimately changing the history of life.Dr. Walcott discovered the Burgess Shale in 1909. He was looking for evidence of the beginning of the Cambrian Explosion, the apparently sudden appearance of complex multi-cellular life. What he found was a treasure of fossils shortly after the event. (A few million years is considered ""shortly after"".) Since the generally accepted view of evolution is a leisurely improvement as species develop from the simple to the complex, finding complex fossils so early in natural history was disruptive to Darwin's Theory and had to be explained. In other words, if life was so complex during the Cambrian period then there should have been simpler species that came LONG before then in the Precambrian era. Yet these simpler precursors could not be found. An explanation was needed. The pressure to make these Burgess Shale ""oddballs"" fit into an ""acceptable"" scientific model of evolution was tremendous. Thus for decades the Burgess discoveries remained on the back shelves and in drawers, most unstudied and the few ""oddballs"" shoved quickly into known categories and forgotten.Decades later, Dr. Whittington decided to study the Burgess specimens, hoping to find some new type of trilobite. He believed that Dr. Walcott was generally correct, that somehow these specimens would fit into known groups. Yet, as he studied each specimen more closely, he realized that some of them represented an entirely new branch of the evolutionary tree. In fact, it wasn't a tree at all. It was more like an evolutionary bush.The book is actually about how our prejudices and even the diagrams and charts we use push us toward preconditioned conclusions. (FYI, the author does this himself in a few cases, minor but I noticed.) The author has convinced me that life on Earth (or at least intelligent life) is darn near impossible, except that here we are discussing it. He does accept as a given that some sort of life developing on Earth was inevitable, but the idea that Homo sapiens were destined to become the pinnacle of Creation or even the best that evolution had to offer is utterly ridiculous. From a probability and statistics point of view I am forced to agree with the author. I am a religious man, but I don't look to the Bible for my science lessons. The Jewish New Year has begun. As I recited my prayers I acknowledged that the new year is 5779 since the Creation. Do I really believe that? I know what the logic behind the number is, and I am willing to accord respect to the scholars who came up with that number. It was a good effort given the knowledge they had at the time and I stick with it out of that respect even though I write 2018 on my checks. Christians have come up with a different number. I assume they respect those Christians scholars of the past and write 2018 on their checks as well.During the time of Dr. Walcott, about 12 years before he discovered the Burgess Shale, Lord Kelvin estimated (in 1897) that the Earth was about 20-40 million years old. That was the accepted figure because no one (except Einstein in 1905 with E=mc2) could conceive of any other way that the Earth could stay warm long enough to develop life. Once they realized nuclear fusion in the Sun and radioactive decay on Earth could keep it warm, much longer estimates for the age of the Earth could be credibly entertained.I've had windy debates about evolution with folks. It seems that any deviation from Darwin's ""ironclad"" declarations are considered heresy. ""Burn the Witch!"" Oh... did I say that out loud? :-) Darwinists are those poor souls who follow Darwin's Theory on evolution as if it were holy writ. These people do science and the theory of evolution no good. What we need are adult conversations and reasoned debate. Not accusations nor insults. I think Darwin's Theory on evolution is a good first pass at the idea. The theory has some flaws that need work, but over all, it is good stuff... really good for a time when DNA was unknown and microscopes were very poor instruments. This is my second reading of the book. I promised a fellow I've been debating that I would read the book again and come back with some quotes to support my position on the age of the Earth and the improbability that life on Earth might come from another planet (say Mars) and then develop on Earth into life as we know it. This is called panspermia and while it is a logical idea, it is not a very probable idea. On the other hand, I don't think life developing as it did on Earth on its own is very probable either. That doesn't mean it didn't happen. I just like knocking around ideas. Don't read too much into it.Oh... and I forgot to mention... The ""F-Word"" is used once in this book as an actual quote from one of the scientists who suddenly realized he had found yet another Burgess ""oddball"" that didn't fit any known phyla. It seems juvenile to use such a direct quote in a book like this, but the book contains a few anachronisms that only make sense if you realize that it was written in the 1980's about events from the 1910's to the 1970's. "
81,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16022816-chris-stratton,3,I am sure this is a great book among paleontologists. The detail of each species he documents and explains and the arguments for reclassifications must be a joy to someone in the field. I however was on a forced march to finish the book. I found the book interesting don’t get me wrong but much went beyond my knowledge of paleontology or biology for that matter. My takeaways? Beware of preconceived ideas!

The discussion of phyla that once roams the seas 500MYA was more detailed than I had imagined. To be candid, there are very few scientists or naturalists whose personal stories I am interested in. This is true for the person(s) that discovered the Burgess Shale. Don't get me wrong, I really like reading anything by Gould. Sometimes his tangents into the personal lives of the scientists are a bit long winded. If this is for you, enjoy! I much prefer reading about the science than the people."

But Gould is persuasive, vibrant, and thorough. I didn't think I'd enjoy this book as much as I did.""Do you know they've found a fossil that has five eyes?""

First, the important information about how not to have preconceived ideas, imaginings, assumptions when examining a historic site. Taking the scientific view of nature in history. Amazing the bountiful life exposed in the Burgess Shale site. Wonders of life active in a time before Homo Sapiens evolved. Excellent reading about discoveries of life - fossils caught in the shale give view of one time period in earth's history. "

Gould's political stance seldom agreed with mine, yet I've never doubted his intelligence or erudition. The book is twenty years old, and some of the content has been revised or disputed since; however, I learned a great deal about this pivotal period in the history of life. Gould's style is dense and ""wordy"" at times, and there was too much analysis of Walcott's persona and approach to his discoveries in the Burgess Shale, but it didn't detract too much from what is a genuinely fascinating read."

Gould is with the ""others,"" and proposes that contingency is an importamnt component of evolution. A fascinating story, with Gould's analysis at the forefront.

103,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1959519-max-maxwell,5,"To be clear, Wonderful Life is not a perfect book, but it is certainly an amazing book. It's pertinent to ask, ""Where does the book fall flat?""First, the middle section of the book, ""The Reconstruction of the Burgess Shale,"" is just a little bit too long. I mean exactly what I said; a few pages, say, 20 or so, after you've said, ""OK, I'm ready to get out of this murky details section and get on with the implications of it all,"" the section ends. As Gould points out, the section is, admittedly, important:Pleading is undignified, but allow me one line: please bear with the details; they are accessible, and they are the gateway to a new world.And bear with them you will, through about 200 pages of descriptions of, say, how the specimens of Opabinia or Hallucigenia were dissected, camera lucida diagrams, and repetitive descriptions of Harry Whittington's conservative temperament.The best parts of the book are the first, fourth, and fifth sections. The first, ""The Iconography of an Expectation,"" deals with the tendency amongst scientists and laypeople alike to see evolution as a linear process resulting in more and more complexity and always yielding intelligence. The fourth, ""Walcott's Vision and the Nature of History,"" tells of the myriad expectations that led the original discoverer and describer of the Burgess to make the fatal error of placing all the Burgess biota, most of which were completely new to science, in previously known categories, as ancestors of modern creatures. And the fifth, ""Possible Worlds,"" uses parts two and three (the ones with all the details) as a jumping board from which to explore the idea of punctuated equilibrium and its subsequent idea of contingency.Punctuated equilibrium is the idea that evolution is not a straight line of progress. Rather, evolution centers on mass extinctions such as the extinction that killed 96 or 97% of life on earth, including most of the Burgess organisms. Evolution only works in a straight line up until a really mass extinction, and then all bets are off. Natural selection is so tied to local environments that if the environment changes it can mean game over:Even if fishes hone their adaptations to peaks of aquatic perfection, they will all die if the ponds dry up. But grubby old Buster the Lungfish, former laughingstock of the piscine priesthood, may pull through... if we are Buster's legacy... how can we possibly view our mentality as inevitable, or even probable?One instantly thinks of polar bears doomed by global warming. Gould calls the element of history that relies on happenstance and massively improbable coincidence ""contingency,"" and he hammers its prevalence home with numerous examples—notably that the Burgess organism Pikaia was the earliest chordate, and its nonexistence would have erased us from history.My main objection to contingency is complicated, but in the spirit of this review, I might ask you to bear with my details. Steven Pinker, in his book 
The Blank Slate
, makes an excellent point:Sigmund Freud immodestly wrote that ""humanity has in the course of its time had to endure from the hands of science three great outrages upon its native self-love"": the discovery that our world is not the center of the celestial spheres but rather a speck in a vast universe, the discovery that we are not specially created but instead descended from the animals, and the discovery that often our conscious minds do not control how we act but merely tell us a story about our actions.Science does have a proud tradition of muckraking by demoting the status of humankind further and further, from Lord of Creation, created in God's image, to just another ape on another rock in another galaxy. To most people, this is insulting, even troubling; to those who understand, to those who find themselves, like Job, ""comforted that I am dust,"" it's humbling, and beautiful. But it does lead to a sort of playground-style fight over who among the sciences has demoted man furthest. Gould seems to be making a play here:As Freud observed, our relationship with science must be paradoxical because we are forced to pay an almost intolerable price for each major gain in knowledge and power—the psychological cost of progressive dethronement from the center of things, and increasing marginality in an uncaring universe.He's referencing Freud in order to tie in the concept with his view of contingency.Here's where things get neat: think about SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. SETI optimists, people who feel that it is likely that the universe is populated by intelligent life (myself included), base our assumption on a certain feel for evolution. Carl Sagan was a SETI optimist; he felt that evolution follows, if not a straight line, per se, a route to progress. If Gould is to be believed that (a) contingency is all-important in understanding evolution and (b) contingency is one of Freud's demotions, then Sagan's converse idea should be empowering to man, in the sense that it indicates that evolution must eventually result in something like us. And yet—here is Sagan in his book 
Pale Blue Dot
, titling a chapter ""The Great Demotions,"" and claiming among those demotions the notion that we may not be alone in the universe!The thing is that Gould is not the only supporter of punctuated equilibrium that upholds his ideas as those most demoralizing to mankind. Here's Michael Shermer in the Spring 2008 issue of Skeptic magazine:Historical experiment after experiment reveals the same answer: we are a fluke of nature, a quirk of evolution, a glorious contingency. It is tempting to... write yourself into the story as the central pattern in order to find purpose and meaning... But skeptical alarms should toll whenever anyone claims that science has discovered our deepest desires and oldest myths are true after all... a purpose-seeking animal will find itself as the purpose of nature.Shermer is responding to SETI optimism with a stone face. The point is that Shermer and Gould accuse SETI optimists of wishful thinking, without realizing that their notion so perfectly backs up the very teachings of the church: that we are alone and that we are the only intelligent life out there.—you see, the idea of SETI was once about where contingency is now. The idea of other people was very troubling to the religious; how could God send a saviour to two or more worlds? I'm not saying that contingency is a bad idea, and neither am I knocking punctuated equilibrium. I'm just saying it's not as much of a revelation as Gould thinks.I'm done complaining.—so, what did Gould get right?One of the major appeals of the book is his treatment of scientists as real, quirky people instead of arcane demigods; think the best parts of Bill Bryson's 
A Short History of Nearly Everything
 in more depth. Whittington, Briggs, Conway Morris, Walcott, and even Darwin come alive in these pages, in their words, if possible.He also presents the details with arresting scope and clarity. Sidebars throughout help the layman through arthropod terminology, and the book is lavishly illustrated throughout. Gould's prose is stellar—each punctuation mark and word is devastating. Some say that he rambles, but they're missing the point, because Gould's rambling is his charm. He conveys his passion like few other science writers manage to do.Finally, despite being 20 years old this year, the science in Wonderful Life is cutting-edge. After that long, there were bound to be some corrections: for example, Anomalocaris did not perish soon after the Shale's time; a relative named Schinderhannes survived until the Devonian, 100 million years after the Burgess. Furthermore, Anomalocaris and Opabinia are now considered lobopods, not their own distinct phylum. Hallucigenia walked on its ""tenticles,"" not on its spines, making it substantially less hallucinogenic than once imagined. These are trivialities, in my opinion; for every incorrect guess, Gould makes three that panned out, including correctly placing Aysheiea in the phylum Onychophora, at a time when it was in dispute as to what it was, and calling that the Burgess represented a world-wide fauna based on a few Chinese fossils, guessing that more would show up (in the 2000s, the Changjiang fauna did indeed show up, replete with complete anomalocarids and primitive chordata related to Pikaia, theretofore a single specimen).The facts are these: Wonderful Life makes you think. It's brilliantly written. And, at the end of the day, the creatures and fossils are just awesome. Paleo enthusiasts like me are all kids at heart, Gould being no exception at all."
104,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467405-ellen,3,"I read this book for research and primarily for Gould's argument, given throughout this book, that if one were to rewind the 'tape of life' then life as we know it would not emerge on the replay. Gould is clear in his opening chapter that he intends for this book to be both useful for students of the history of life on Earth and for the lay person interested in the same. With no formal scientific training beyond the age of 16, I am only qualified to assess the success of the latter intention, which I can do positively.That being said, however, Gould's quest for accessibility also leads him down some very odd tangents. In the name of illustrating some of his points he begins to almost rant about certain aspects of life and the academy. One notable example is a lengthy lament about the current (at least, current as of the book's writing in the summer of 1988) state of doctoral education on either side of the pond. Such passages read like a columnist giving their true opinions on aspects of the world around them and as a result seem a little fluffy. I found myself wondering on several occasions if the same kind of behaviour would have been tolerated by another author (one perhaps not as established as Gould was at the time of this book's publishing, or one from a different demographic, or indeed one writing just a few decades in the future). One particularly irksome example was of his use of the film It's A Wonderful Life.No doubt where Gould got the main title of his book from, the film gets no mention until over two thirds of the way through the book. Gould uses the film to illustrate the argument for which I came to this book in the first place - that if one were to rewind the 'tape of life' then life as we know it would not emerge on the replay. Gould's reasoning for this is based heavily on what is commonly understood as the butterfly effect (though Gould does not himself use this terminology). It is in an explanation of how the butterfly effect works that Gould references It's A Wonderful Life: the seemingly-insignificant-at-the-time events of George's life had massive knock-on effects to the point where the world would have been a very different place had he never been born. My problem with Gould's use of It's A Wonderful Life is twofold: it was too long, and it came too late in the book. Gould practically recounts the entire film to the reader when a few examples from the film would have had the desired effect. And the argument which Gould is attempting to illustrate has already been given throughout the book. By the time the reader reaches this illustration, they no longer need it.Gould's use of lengthy and tangential illustrations was irritating, but this book has a more egregious fault. I was reading this book at the same time I was reading Delores S. Williams' Sisters in the Wilderness, a book which - among other things - made me aware of some of the historical and scientific 'justifications' for racism. In particular, Williams made me aware of Louis Agassiz's affirmation and perpetuation of racist pseudoscience. Reading these two books in tandem made Agassiz's name in Wonderful Life stand out all the more. Gould references Agassiz twice in this book, but never mentions this dangerous and ugly side of his work; indeed, the only description Gould gives of Agassiz or his work is that he was ""America's greatest natural historian"" (p242). Granted, Williams' book was published four years after Gould's, but I would nevertheless caution the reader of this and other similar works to keep in mind the historiography of the field in a way which Gould does not.If one can tolerate the tangents and is thoughtful of the ugly history behind some of the discoveries which made this book, I think you can get a lot out of it. The scientific jargon is kept to a minimum and the writing style flows well. It provides a helpful history of the discovery and research of the fossils found in the Burgess Shale and what this work has meant for evolutionary science and current thinking of the history of life on Earth. I think this book is an apt reminder that even a book as worthwhile to the field as this one is does not - and should not - escape criticism, particularly in light of its own uncritical elements."
105,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57886276-owen-moorhead,2,"In the introduction to this book, Gould writes that he hoped to be an ""insider McPhee"" or something like that. Well Mr. Gould, I've read John McPhee; I know John McPhee's work--you sir, are no John McPhee.There are a few problems with this book that prevent it from succeeding (for me). For starters, there's the obvious one: Gould is too close to his subject matter. He seems to recognize this, but that self-awareness doesn't confer immunity to an understandable and natural tendency to forge boldly into the weeds. He is (probably) a much better stylist than most paleontologists, but that is not enough on its own to communicate such delicacies as the ramosity of a Burgess fossil's appendages. To Gould's credit, I think he recognizes this: he clearly felt the information needed a narrative and a theme to make for an interesting read to the lay reader.That brings me to another problem, namely the ideas with which Gould ties together the story of the Burgess fossils and their taxonomy. There are two images that recur continually throughout the book: rewinding tapes and a shoehorn. (Cones and trees also feature heavily.) They are invoked to illustrate two major themes of the book: the pernicious influence of ideology on scientific work and something about contingency. By the end of the book, I was starting to get annoyed with how frequently Gould resorts to these images.I won't say too much about Gould's thesis on ideology because I think it's well-argued and convincing. The contingency argument is more central and a bit confusing. It seems to go something like this: if you were to rewind the video tape of evolution or natural history or whatever, things would turn out differently. Let's leave aside the obvious problem with this image--namely, that no matter how many times you rewind a tape, it will always play the same way, plus or minus the marginal physical alterations that will take place through excessive rewinding.The main issue I have with this argument is I can't understand why Gould attaches so much importance to it. ""Things could have turned out differently than they did,"" he says. That seems to me a metaphysical question that may be trivial or unprovable, depending on your philosophical sympathies.But so what? That's the big question, which went unanswered throughout the book. If this had been a simple exposition of Burgess fauna, that wouldn't be a big deal. But Gould clearly thinks this assemblage proves something incredibly important about, I don't know, life, the universe, and everything. What exactly that is, I never did quite catch.The most eye-raising assertion of this book is that the Burgess Shale is the most important paleontological discovery of the century, and it is never really argued persuasively. That's the biggest failing of ""Wonderful Life"": it never convinced me of any of the lofty assertions Gould made at the outset.All that said, it wasn't terrible, and the writing really is pretty good, if occasionally pretentious."
106,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,5,"THis is a wonderful book, in all the senses of the word. The primary focus, the burgess fossils, are the stuff of science fiction - strange compilations of animal parts in strange configurations - so strange that science fiction could only take a lead from nature rather than anticipate it. For some reason, early life took some wild turns, many of which then failed to survive. If this book were only a catalog of these unusual beasts it would have been fascinating, but this is only the start.In part because of their strangeness, the second story - that of their discovery and rediscovery - adds to the interest: Initially discovered by Americas greatest paleontologist of the time, the real wonder of the fossils was missed. His analysis, biased by a preconceived notion of how things should be, didn't recognize the fact that many of these creatures did not fit modern categories. It took half a century before they were re-discovered and this time, recognized for the oddities that they really were. Why the first discovery missed, and the second did not, illustrates the all too human aspect to science which itself is often overlooked by preconceived notions of objectivity and dispassion. From these points Jay Gould presents his meta thesis regarding the almost heretical conclusion life's history tells: natural selection is not the only force guiding evolution. Somehow, and not just once, the 'progress' of life has been subject to freak events which have resulted in us humans. Our story, and all other life, is dependent or 'contingent' on these non-biological circumstances - we could as easily not be here. Thus at the third level, the book provides a sense of wonder, of amazement about our existence. Although he uses religious allusions with an abundance that probably leaves a Dawkins type shuddering, there is no supernatural conclusion inferred or implied, nor need there be. Whichever faith one has, I would hope that the wonder Jay Gould illicits is something all experience regarding the specialness of life. Finally, despite the heavy technical content, Jay Gould succeeds in conveying the story with scientific rigor which is also accessible to the uninitiated. Much 'popular science' is either dumbed down and over-punctuated (!), or not far enough removed from the home territory of journal publications. This then is the book's fourth wonder and the ultimate reason for my five star rating. "
107,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12305720-robert,5,"After visiting the Burgess Shale in August 2017, I decided to reread this book by SJ Gould, which I first read (and loved) sometime in the 1990s, shortly after it was published in 1989. Full disclosure, for years I used to devour Gould's This View of Life columns in Natural History magazine every month, and thoroughly enjoyed his books in the 1980s and 1990s, but haven't had the heart (or the stamina) to attempt his final and massive book (2002's The Structure of Evolutionary Theory). A brief foray into that tome made me realize that, at that late stage of his career, his writing style had become a bit too florid, his long and frequent asides too peripheral, and his tendency to show-off his obvious erudition had gotten a bit out of control. 1989's Wonderful Life, The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History, on the other hand, demonstrates Gould at his full powers. Wringing general principles out of specific geological, paleontological, or historical events, he brilliantly deconstructs iconic ideas (preconceptions?) in paleontology (e.g., increasing cone of diversity, gradualism, and adaptationist notions), offering in their place historical contingency, hierarchical levels of selection, and a ""neo-catastrophist"" approach to mass extinctions. It's true that the numerous quotations from Milton and Frost (no Gilbert and Sullivan, at least!), the ostentatious multilingualism, and the sometimes florid prose can seem to some readers a bit over the top, but these tendencies never take over in this book. The story he tells in this book about Walcott's discovery of the Burgess Shale high in the Canadian Rockies of British Colombia in 1909, and the revolutionary reinterpretation of the meaning of this Middle Cambrian ""explosion"" of life by the brilliant paleontologist Harry Whittington and his two equally brilliant students Derek Briggs and Simon Conway Morris is an inspiring one for scientists everywhere, and paleontologists in particular. Highly recommended."
108,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/748327-andrew-hudson,4,"For anyone in the dark, the Burgess Shale is one of the greatest fossil discoveries in palaeontological history. Uncovered in British Columbia by Charles Doolittle Walcott, one of America's most distinguished scientific minds, the Burgess Shale contained an astonishing diversity of forms - but most significantly, from a time at which no solid evidence for life had yet been found.Palaeontology had suffered from a critical absence in the fossil record. Dinosaurs, trilobites and many other extinct lifeforms had long been known of, of course, but while the hard body parts of dead creatures make for good fossilisation, the soft do not, tending to decay long before they can leave their mark. The sorry fact was that, prior to the Mid-Cambrian period (over five hundred million years ago), fossil evidence simply was not to be found. Whatever creatures had existed before the evolution of such hard structures as bone, chitin or shell, they had left no clue behind....until 1909. In the years that followed, C.D. Walcott collected nearly ninety thousand fossils, and though his time in the field was hampered by wide-ranging commitments as an administrator and leader of several of his country's most significant scientific bodies, he somehow found the time to study and report on his discovery as well. What he had found was nothing less than what the palaeontological community had longed for: evidence of simpler forms of life, early links in the chain that, over millions of years, would eventually produce fish and insects, amphibians and reptiles, birds, mammals and man.Or, do I hear you cry, DID he?Nearly sixty years after Walcott's discovery an Englishman named Harry Whittington, the world's leading expert on trilobites, began a process which would shine new light on a subject long considered as fact. With the help of a small group of allies they began to uncover details of the Burgess artefacts never before recognised; details which challenged Walcott's accepted wisdom regarding what his discoveries were; details which even called into question the basic nature of the evolutionary process itself.Whittington and his fellows proved with their efforts that, contrary to the traditional notion of simple creatures gradually improving over time, early evolution represented a chaotic period of sophisticated experimentation, with only blind chance in control of which forms of life would survive to define the future.Or, do I hear you cry, DID they?In Wonderful Life, Stephen J. Gould takes us on a remarkable journey. Setting the scene with an examination of our expectations in conventional evolutionary theory, we join him with Walcott on the Canadian slopes, then follow the various players as they reveal the unseen for the first time, or unveil it anew. He celebrates both the pioneer and the revolutionaries for, he claims, achievements to rank beside any undertaken by the more recognised ""hard"" sciences.He examines, with appropriate respect, how Walcott could make such a critical mistake regarding his subjects, how it was effectively impossible for him to conceive of an alternative to the notion of slow but inevitable ""upward"" development. In fact the revisionist work to come didn't utilise amazing breakthroughs of thought or technology. Nothing that was done in the 70s and 80s was beyond Walcott's technical capacities - but as a product of his time and place he was simply predisposed to see what he wanted or needed to see, so he did.Finally, after leading us through a fascinating and surprisingly accessible education in the field of ancient evolution, Gould demonstrates how these revelations about early life hang the probability of our own existence in a frighteningly - or, to another palate, thrillingly - slender thread.Or, do I hear you cry, DOES he?Because, not to put too fine a point on it, not everyone agrees with Gould's conclusions - even the visionaries he celebrates in the book. Subtitled The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History, Gould's overview of the re-examination of palaeontology's crown jewel begins as a heartfelt celebration of the scientific method and ends as, arguably, an overenthusiastic departure towards his belief in mankind's unlikeliness, and a variation on the standard evolutionary theory which is far from universally accepted. However, between and through these extremes, he treats us to an engaging, enthusiastic and entertaining experience, and it is for this that the book will continue to deserve a readership, even if some of his conclusions draw fire from various detractors as time marches on.It should not be assumed though that the book is closed on Gould's perspective, that He Was Wrong and That Is That. Ten minutes of layperson level browsing underlined for me that there remains debate; and while some of those lined up in opposition to Gould's claims are pretty big guns of the scientific world, even amongst them there is great respect for his writing - and that there can be disagreement and simultaneous support for his work is as interesting to me as his argument itself.It would be nice, reassuringly so, if every science writer, presenting and then interpreting evidence, could be shown to produce undeniable fact; to raise the bar for others to jump from, not at; but this isn't what science necessarily does. Science may be just a system of beliefs no different from any other, religious or not, and as such just as fallible - no, infinitely more so, as for science the facts may sometimes show the beliefs to be wrong.Subject to the righteous threat of constant revision, every theory may eventually come apart at the how it seems - but if great theories give rise to great books only for greater theories to take their turn, then it's a small price to pay to have such good things to read while we wait for the next in line. Gould would, I think, happily accept this form of progressive improvement over time, if no other."

I do not really like Jay Gould as a scientist since he is kind of wordy and has peculiar theories, but that is not a matter of this book. If you judge the book as a picky evolutionary scientist, you will find lots of mistakes or outdated information. This is a book for non-scientists, although some concepts might be difficult to understand, I confess. Stephen success in trying to introduce us to the amazing world of early living forms that might be not as astonishing as dinosaurs, or some other popular fossils, but certainly these apparently insignificant arthropods were the beginning for everything in life, and most people do not even know they all existed and how important they were. I would recommend this book to science enthusiasts, geologists without a biology background, or freshman biology students, who might get the most of it."
110,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10404161-alex-shrugged,5,"This book is entrancing from the first to the last page. There is a short time, perhaps 3 or 4 pages where the narrative bogs down, but the rest is well paced, and fascinating.This is a book about the Burgess Shale in British Columbia and the scientific blunder of the century caused by a mind refusing to see what the fossils were telling him. This need to shoehorn the Burgess Shale ""oddballs"" into well-known groups was due to certain preconceptions that were strong at the time and remain a problem (though a lesser one) into the modern day.The narrative is presented as a drama in several acts because the story resembles a mystery slowly uncovered and ultimately changing the history of life.Dr. Walcott discovered the Burgess Shale in 1909. He was looking for evidence of the beginning of the Cambrian Explosion, the apparently sudden appearance of complex multi-cellular life. What he found was a treasure of fossils shortly after the event. (A few million years is considered ""shortly after"".) Since the generally accepted view of evolution is a leisurely improvement as species develop from the simple to the complex, finding complex fossils so early in natural history was disruptive to Darwin's Theory and had to be explained. In other words, if life was so complex during the Cambrian period then there should have been simpler species that came LONG before then in the Precambrian era. Yet these simpler precursors could not be found. An explanation was needed. The pressure to make these Burgess Shale ""oddballs"" fit into an ""acceptable"" scientific model of evolution was tremendous. Thus for decades the Burgess discoveries remained on the back shelves and in drawers, most unstudied and the few ""oddballs"" shoved quickly into known categories and forgotten.Decades later, Dr. Whittington decided to study the Burgess specimens, hoping to find some new type of trilobite. He believed that Dr. Walcott was generally correct, that somehow these specimens would fit into known groups. Yet, as he studied each specimen more closely, he realized that some of them represented an entirely new branch of the evolutionary tree. In fact, it wasn't a tree at all. It was more like an evolutionary bush.The book is actually about how our prejudices and even the diagrams and charts we use push us toward preconditioned conclusions. (FYI, the author does this himself in a few cases, minor but I noticed.) The author has convinced me that life on Earth (or at least intelligent life) is darn near impossible, except that here we are discussing it. He does accept as a given that some sort of life developing on Earth was inevitable, but the idea that Homo sapiens were destined to become the pinnacle of Creation or even the best that evolution had to offer is utterly ridiculous. From a probability and statistics point of view I am forced to agree with the author. I am a religious man, but I don't look to the Bible for my science lessons. The Jewish New Year has begun. As I recited my prayers I acknowledged that the new year is 5779 since the Creation. Do I really believe that? I know what the logic behind the number is, and I am willing to accord respect to the scholars who came up with that number. It was a good effort given the knowledge they had at the time and I stick with it out of that respect even though I write 2018 on my checks. Christians have come up with a different number. I assume they respect those Christians scholars of the past and write 2018 on their checks as well.During the time of Dr. Walcott, about 12 years before he discovered the Burgess Shale, Lord Kelvin estimated (in 1897) that the Earth was about 20-40 million years old. That was the accepted figure because no one (except Einstein in 1905 with E=mc2) could conceive of any other way that the Earth could stay warm long enough to develop life. Once they realized nuclear fusion in the Sun and radioactive decay on Earth could keep it warm, much longer estimates for the age of the Earth could be credibly entertained.I've had windy debates about evolution with folks. It seems that any deviation from Darwin's ""ironclad"" declarations are considered heresy. ""Burn the Witch!"" Oh... did I say that out loud? :-) Darwinists are those poor souls who follow Darwin's Theory on evolution as if it were holy writ. These people do science and the theory of evolution no good. What we need are adult conversations and reasoned debate. Not accusations nor insults. I think Darwin's Theory on evolution is a good first pass at the idea. The theory has some flaws that need work, but over all, it is good stuff... really good for a time when DNA was unknown and microscopes were very poor instruments. This is my second reading of the book. I promised a fellow I've been debating that I would read the book again and come back with some quotes to support my position on the age of the Earth and the improbability that life on Earth might come from another planet (say Mars) and then develop on Earth into life as we know it. This is called panspermia and while it is a logical idea, it is not a very probable idea. On the other hand, I don't think life developing as it did on Earth on its own is very probable either. That doesn't mean it didn't happen. I just like knocking around ideas. Don't read too much into it.Oh... and I forgot to mention... The ""F-Word"" is used once in this book as an actual quote from one of the scientists who suddenly realized he had found yet another Burgess ""oddball"" that didn't fit any known phyla. It seems juvenile to use such a direct quote in a book like this, but the book contains a few anachronisms that only make sense if you realize that it was written in the 1980's about events from the 1910's to the 1970's.

111,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16022816-chris-stratton,3,I am sure this is a great book among paleontologists. The detail of each species he documents and explains and the arguments for reclassifications must be a joy to someone in the field. I however was on a forced march to finish the book. I found the book interesting don’t get me wrong but much went beyond my knowledge of paleontology or biology for that matter. My takeaways? Beware of preconceived ideas! Oh and by the way knowing you are applying preconceived is really hard. Don’t be afraid of speaking up if the establishment believes one thing and you believe another especially if you can prove it.

This is true for the person(s) that discovered the Burgess Shale. Don't get me wrong, I really like reading anything by Gould. Sometimes his tangents into the personal lives of the scientists are a bit long winded. If this is for you, enjoy! I much prefer reading about the science than the people."

But Gould is persuasive, vibrant, and thorough. I didn't think I'd enjoy this book as much as I did.""Do you know they've found a fossil that has five eyes?""

First, the important information about how not to have preconceived ideas, imaginings, assumptions when examining a historic site. Taking the scientific view of nature in history. Amazing the bountiful life exposed in the Burgess Shale site. Wonders of life active in a time before Homo Sapiens evolved.

Gould's political stance seldom agreed with mine, yet I've never doubted his intelligence or erudition. The book is twenty years old, and some of the content has been revised or disputed since; however, I learned a great deal about this pivotal period in the history of life. Gould's style is dense and ""wordy"" at times, and there was too much analysis of Walcott's persona and approach to his discoveries in the Burgess Shale, but it didn't detract too much from what is a genuinely fascinating read."

He proposed too many things as fiat, when he could have easily rephrased everything to conjecture.Nevertheless it is a great read, full of a lot of information about earlier life on the planet.

Gould's take on this is one person who ""imposed"" understanding of the meaning of the fossils versus others who proposed a different explanation. Gould is with the ""others,"" and proposes that contingency is an importamnt component of evolution. A fascinating story, with Gould's analysis at the forefront.

133,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1959519-max-maxwell,5,"To be clear, Wonderful Life is not a perfect book, but it is certainly an amazing book. It's pertinent to ask, ""Where does the book fall flat?""First, the middle section of the book, ""The Reconstruction of the Burgess Shale,"" is just a little bit too long. I mean exactly what I said; a few pages, say, 20 or so, after you've said, ""OK, I'm ready to get out of this murky details section and get on with the implications of it all,"" the section ends. As Gould points out, the section is, admittedly, important:Pleading is undignified, but allow me one line: please bear with the details; they are accessible, and they are the gateway to a new world.And bear with them you will, through about 200 pages of descriptions of, say, how the specimens of Opabinia or Hallucigenia were dissected, camera lucida diagrams, and repetitive descriptions of Harry Whittington's conservative temperament.The best parts of the book are the first, fourth, and fifth sections. The first, ""The Iconography of an Expectation,"" deals with the tendency amongst scientists and laypeople alike to see evolution as a linear process resulting in more and more complexity and always yielding intelligence. The fourth, ""Walcott's Vision and the Nature of History,"" tells of the myriad expectations that led the original discoverer and describer of the Burgess to make the fatal error of placing all the Burgess biota, most of which were completely new to science, in previously known categories, as ancestors of modern creatures. And the fifth, ""Possible Worlds,"" uses parts two and three (the ones with all the details) as a jumping board from which to explore the idea of punctuated equilibrium and its subsequent idea of contingency.Punctuated equilibrium is the idea that evolution is not a straight line of progress. Rather, evolution centers on mass extinctions such as the extinction that killed 96 or 97% of life on earth, including most of the Burgess organisms. Evolution only works in a straight line up until a really mass extinction, and then all bets are off. Natural selection is so tied to local environments that if the environment changes it can mean game over:Even if fishes hone their adaptations to peaks of aquatic perfection, they will all die if the ponds dry up. But grubby old Buster the Lungfish, former laughingstock of the piscine priesthood, may pull through... if we are Buster's legacy... how can we possibly view our mentality as inevitable, or even probable?One instantly thinks of polar bears doomed by global warming. Gould calls the element of history that relies on happenstance and massively improbable coincidence ""contingency,"" and he hammers its prevalence home with numerous examples—notably that the Burgess organism Pikaia was the earliest chordate, and its nonexistence would have erased us from history.My main objection to contingency is complicated, but in the spirit of this review, I might ask you to bear with my details. Steven Pinker, in his book 
The Blank Slate
, makes an excellent point:Sigmund Freud immodestly wrote that ""humanity has in the course of its time had to endure from the hands of science three great outrages upon its native self-love"": the discovery that our world is not the center of the celestial spheres but rather a speck in a vast universe, the discovery that we are not specially created but instead descended from the animals, and the discovery that often our conscious minds do not control how we act but merely tell us a story about our actions.Science does have a proud tradition of muckraking by demoting the status of humankind further and further, from Lord of Creation, created in God's image, to just another ape on another rock in another galaxy. To most people, this is insulting, even troubling; to those who understand, to those who find themselves, like Job, ""comforted that I am dust,"" it's humbling, and beautiful. But it does lead to a sort of playground-style fight over who among the sciences has demoted man furthest. Gould seems to be making a play here:As Freud observed, our relationship with science must be paradoxical because we are forced to pay an almost intolerable price for each major gain in knowledge and power—the psychological cost of progressive dethronement from the center of things, and increasing marginality in an uncaring universe.He's referencing Freud in order to tie in the concept with his view of contingency.Here's where things get neat: think about SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. SETI optimists, people who feel that it is likely that the universe is populated by intelligent life (myself included), base our assumption on a certain feel for evolution. Carl Sagan was a SETI optimist; he felt that evolution follows, if not a straight line, per se, a route to progress. If Gould is to be believed that (a) contingency is all-important in understanding evolution and (b) contingency is one of Freud's demotions, then Sagan's converse idea should be empowering to man, in the sense that it indicates that evolution must eventually result in something like us. And yet—here is Sagan in his book 
Pale Blue Dot
, titling a chapter ""The Great Demotions,"" and claiming among those demotions the notion that we may not be alone in the universe!The thing is that Gould is not the only supporter of punctuated equilibrium that upholds his ideas as those most demoralizing to mankind. Here's Michael Shermer in the Spring 2008 issue of Skeptic magazine:Historical experiment after experiment reveals the same answer: we are a fluke of nature, a quirk of evolution, a glorious contingency. It is tempting to... write yourself into the story as the central pattern in order to find purpose and meaning... But skeptical alarms should toll whenever anyone claims that science has discovered our deepest desires and oldest myths are true after all... a purpose-seeking animal will find itself as the purpose of nature.Shermer is responding to SETI optimism with a stone face. The point is that Shermer and Gould accuse SETI optimists of wishful thinking, without realizing that their notion so perfectly backs up the very teachings of the church: that we are alone and that we are the only intelligent life out there.—you see, the idea of SETI was once about where contingency is now. The idea of other people was very troubling to the religious; how could God send a saviour to two or more worlds? I'm not saying that contingency is a bad idea, and neither am I knocking punctuated equilibrium. I'm just saying it's not as much of a revelation as Gould thinks.I'm done complaining.—so, what did Gould get right?One of the major appeals of the book is his treatment of scientists as real, quirky people instead of arcane demigods; think the best parts of Bill Bryson's 
A Short History of Nearly Everything
 in more depth. Whittington, Briggs, Conway Morris, Walcott, and even Darwin come alive in these pages, in their words, if possible.He also presents the details with arresting scope and clarity. Sidebars throughout help the layman through arthropod terminology, and the book is lavishly illustrated throughout. Gould's prose is stellar—each punctuation mark and word is devastating. Some say that he rambles, but they're missing the point, because Gould's rambling is his charm. He conveys his passion like few other science writers manage to do.Finally, despite being 20 years old this year, the science in Wonderful Life is cutting-edge. After that long, there were bound to be some corrections: for example, Anomalocaris did not perish soon after the Shale's time; a relative named Schinderhannes survived until the Devonian, 100 million years after the Burgess. Furthermore, Anomalocaris and Opabinia are now considered lobopods, not their own distinct phylum. Hallucigenia walked on its ""tenticles,"" not on its spines, making it substantially less hallucinogenic than once imagined. These are trivialities, in my opinion; for every incorrect guess, Gould makes three that panned out, including correctly placing Aysheiea in the phylum Onychophora, at a time when it was in dispute as to what it was, and calling that the Burgess represented a world-wide fauna based on a few Chinese fossils, guessing that more would show up (in the 2000s, the Changjiang fauna did indeed show up, replete with complete anomalocarids and primitive chordata related to Pikaia, theretofore a single specimen).The facts are these: Wonderful Life makes you think. It's brilliantly written. And, at the end of the day, the creatures and fossils are just awesome. Paleo enthusiasts like me are all kids at heart, Gould being no exception at all."
134,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467405-ellen,3,"I read this book for research and primarily for Gould's argument, given throughout this book, that if one were to rewind the 'tape of life' then life as we know it would not emerge on the replay. Gould is clear in his opening chapter that he intends for this book to be both useful for students of the history of life on Earth and for the lay person interested in the same. With no formal scientific training beyond the age of 16, I am only qualified to assess the success of the latter intention, which I can do positively.That being said, however, Gould's quest for accessibility also leads him down some very odd tangents. In the name of illustrating some of his points he begins to almost rant about certain aspects of life and the academy. One notable example is a lengthy lament about the current (at least, current as of the book's writing in the summer of 1988) state of doctoral education on either side of the pond. Such passages read like a columnist giving their true opinions on aspects of the world around them and as a result seem a little fluffy. I found myself wondering on several occasions if the same kind of behaviour would have been tolerated by another author (one perhaps not as established as Gould was at the time of this book's publishing, or one from a different demographic, or indeed one writing just a few decades in the future). One particularly irksome example was of his use of the film It's A Wonderful Life.No doubt where Gould got the main title of his book from, the film gets no mention until over two thirds of the way through the book. Gould uses the film to illustrate the argument for which I came to this book in the first place - that if one were to rewind the 'tape of life' then life as we know it would not emerge on the replay. Gould's reasoning for this is based heavily on what is commonly understood as the butterfly effect (though Gould does not himself use this terminology). It is in an explanation of how the butterfly effect works that Gould references It's A Wonderful Life: the seemingly-insignificant-at-the-time events of George's life had massive knock-on effects to the point where the world would have been a very different place had he never been born. My problem with Gould's use of It's A Wonderful Life is twofold: it was too long, and it came too late in the book. Gould practically recounts the entire film to the reader when a few examples from the film would have had the desired effect. And the argument which Gould is attempting to illustrate has already been given throughout the book. By the time the reader reaches this illustration, they no longer need it.Gould's use of lengthy and tangential illustrations was irritating, but this book has a more egregious fault. I was reading this book at the same time I was reading Delores S. Williams' Sisters in the Wilderness, a book which - among other things - made me aware of some of the historical and scientific 'justifications' for racism. In particular, Williams made me aware of Louis Agassiz's affirmation and perpetuation of racist pseudoscience. Reading these two books in tandem made Agassiz's name in Wonderful Life stand out all the more. Gould references Agassiz twice in this book, but never mentions this dangerous and ugly side of his work; indeed, the only description Gould gives of Agassiz or his work is that he was ""America's greatest natural historian"" (p242). Granted, Williams' book was published four years after Gould's, but I would nevertheless caution the reader of this and other similar works to keep in mind the historiography of the field in a way which Gould does not.If one can tolerate the tangents and is thoughtful of the ugly history behind some of the discoveries which made this book, I think you can get a lot out of it. The scientific jargon is kept to a minimum and the writing style flows well. It provides a helpful history of the discovery and research of the fossils found in the Burgess Shale and what this work has meant for evolutionary science and current thinking of the history of life on Earth. I think this book is an apt reminder that even a book as worthwhile to the field as this one is does not - and should not - escape criticism, particularly in light of its own uncritical elements."
135,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57886276-owen-moorhead,2,"In the introduction to this book, Gould writes that he hoped to be an ""insider McPhee"" or something like that. Well Mr. Gould, I've read John McPhee; I know John McPhee's work--you sir, are no John McPhee.There are a few problems with this book that prevent it from succeeding (for me). For starters, there's the obvious one: Gould is too close to his subject matter. He seems to recognize this, but that self-awareness doesn't confer immunity to an understandable and natural tendency to forge boldly into the weeds. He is (probably) a much better stylist than most paleontologists, but that is not enough on its own to communicate such delicacies as the ramosity of a Burgess fossil's appendages. To Gould's credit, I think he recognizes this: he clearly felt the information needed a narrative and a theme to make for an interesting read to the lay reader.That brings me to another problem, namely the ideas with which Gould ties together the story of the Burgess fossils and their taxonomy. There are two images that recur continually throughout the book: rewinding tapes and a shoehorn. (Cones and trees also feature heavily.) They are invoked to illustrate two major themes of the book: the pernicious influence of ideology on scientific work and something about contingency. By the end of the book, I was starting to get annoyed with how frequently Gould resorts to these images.I won't say too much about Gould's thesis on ideology because I think it's well-argued and convincing. The contingency argument is more central and a bit confusing. It seems to go something like this: if you were to rewind the video tape of evolution or natural history or whatever, things would turn out differently. Let's leave aside the obvious problem with this image--namely, that no matter how many times you rewind a tape, it will always play the same way, plus or minus the marginal physical alterations that will take place through excessive rewinding.The main issue I have with this argument is I can't understand why Gould attaches so much importance to it. ""Things could have turned out differently than they did,"" he says. That seems to me a metaphysical question that may be trivial or unprovable, depending on your philosophical sympathies.But so what? That's the big question, which went unanswered throughout the book. If this had been a simple exposition of Burgess fauna, that wouldn't be a big deal. But Gould clearly thinks this assemblage proves something incredibly important about, I don't know, life, the universe, and everything. What exactly that is, I never did quite catch.The most eye-raising assertion of this book is that the Burgess Shale is the most important paleontological discovery of the century, and it is never really argued persuasively. That's the biggest failing of ""Wonderful Life"": it never convinced me of any of the lofty assertions Gould made at the outset.All that said, it wasn't terrible, and the writing really is pretty good, if occasionally pretentious."
136,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,5,"THis is a wonderful book, in all the senses of the word. The primary focus, the burgess fossils, are the stuff of science fiction - strange compilations of animal parts in strange configurations - so strange that science fiction could only take a lead from nature rather than anticipate it. For some reason, early life took some wild turns, many of which then failed to survive. If this book were only a catalog of these unusual beasts it would have been fascinating, but this is only the start.In part because of their strangeness, the second story - that of their discovery and rediscovery - adds to the interest: Initially discovered by Americas greatest paleontologist of the time, the real wonder of the fossils was missed. His analysis, biased by a preconceived notion of how things should be, didn't recognize the fact that many of these creatures did not fit modern categories. It took half a century before they were re-discovered and this time, recognized for the oddities that they really were. Why the first discovery missed, and the second did not, illustrates the all too human aspect to science which itself is often overlooked by preconceived notions of objectivity and dispassion. From these points Jay Gould presents his meta thesis regarding the almost heretical conclusion life's history tells: natural selection is not the only force guiding evolution. Somehow, and not just once, the 'progress' of life has been subject to freak events which have resulted in us humans. Our story, and all other life, is dependent or 'contingent' on these non-biological circumstances - we could as easily not be here. Thus at the third level, the book provides a sense of wonder, of amazement about our existence. Although he uses religious allusions with an abundance that probably leaves a Dawkins type shuddering, there is no supernatural conclusion inferred or implied, nor need there be. Whichever faith one has, I would hope that the wonder Jay Gould illicits is something all experience regarding the specialness of life. Finally, despite the heavy technical content, Jay Gould succeeds in conveying the story with scientific rigor which is also accessible to the uninitiated. Much 'popular science' is either dumbed down and over-punctuated (!), or not far enough removed from the home territory of journal publications. This then is the book's fourth wonder and the ultimate reason for my five star rating. "
137,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12305720-robert,5,"After visiting the Burgess Shale in August 2017, I decided to reread this book by SJ Gould, which I first read (and loved) sometime in the 1990s, shortly after it was published in 1989. Full disclosure, for years I used to devour Gould's This View of Life columns in Natural History magazine every month, and thoroughly enjoyed his books in the 1980s and 1990s, but haven't had the heart (or the stamina) to attempt his final and massive book (2002's The Structure of Evolutionary Theory). A brief foray into that tome made me realize that, at that late stage of his career, his writing style had become a bit too florid, his long and frequent asides too peripheral, and his tendency to show-off his obvious erudition had gotten a bit out of control. 1989's Wonderful Life, The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History, on the other hand, demonstrates Gould at his full powers. Wringing general principles out of specific geological, paleontological, or historical events, he brilliantly deconstructs iconic ideas (preconceptions?) in paleontology (e.g., increasing cone of diversity, gradualism, and adaptationist notions), offering in their place historical contingency, hierarchical levels of selection, and a ""neo-catastrophist"" approach to mass extinctions. It's true that the numerous quotations from Milton and Frost (no Gilbert and Sullivan, at least!), the ostentatious multilingualism, and the sometimes florid prose can seem to some readers a bit over the top, but these tendencies never take over in this book. The story he tells in this book about Walcott's discovery of the Burgess Shale high in the Canadian Rockies of British Colombia in 1909, and the revolutionary reinterpretation of the meaning of this Middle Cambrian ""explosion"" of life by the brilliant paleontologist Harry Whittington and his two equally brilliant students Derek Briggs and Simon Conway Morris is an inspiring one for scientists everywhere, and paleontologists in particular. Highly recommended."
138,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/748327-andrew-hudson,4,"For anyone in the dark, the Burgess Shale is one of the greatest fossil discoveries in palaeontological history. Uncovered in British Columbia by Charles Doolittle Walcott, one of America's most distinguished scientific minds, the Burgess Shale contained an astonishing diversity of forms - but most significantly, from a time at which no solid evidence for life had yet been found.Palaeontology had suffered from a critical absence in the fossil record. Dinosaurs, trilobites and many other extinct lifeforms had long been known of, of course, but while the hard body parts of dead creatures make for good fossilisation, the soft do not, tending to decay long before they can leave their mark. The sorry fact was that, prior to the Mid-Cambrian period (over five hundred million years ago), fossil evidence simply was not to be found. Whatever creatures had existed before the evolution of such hard structures as bone, chitin or shell, they had left no clue behind....until 1909. In the years that followed, C.D. Walcott collected nearly ninety thousand fossils, and though his time in the field was hampered by wide-ranging commitments as an administrator and leader of several of his country's most significant scientific bodies, he somehow found the time to study and report on his discovery as well. What he had found was nothing less than what the palaeontological community had longed for: evidence of simpler forms of life, early links in the chain that, over millions of years, would eventually produce fish and insects, amphibians and reptiles, birds, mammals and man.Or, do I hear you cry, DID he?Nearly sixty years after Walcott's discovery an Englishman named Harry Whittington, the world's leading expert on trilobites, began a process which would shine new light on a subject long considered as fact. With the help of a small group of allies they began to uncover details of the Burgess artefacts never before recognised; details which challenged Walcott's accepted wisdom regarding what his discoveries were; details which even called into question the basic nature of the evolutionary process itself.Whittington and his fellows proved with their efforts that, contrary to the traditional notion of simple creatures gradually improving over time, early evolution represented a chaotic period of sophisticated experimentation, with only blind chance in control of which forms of life would survive to define the future.Or, do I hear you cry, DID they?In Wonderful Life, Stephen J. Gould takes us on a remarkable journey. Setting the scene with an examination of our expectations in conventional evolutionary theory, we join him with Walcott on the Canadian slopes, then follow the various players as they reveal the unseen for the first time, or unveil it anew. He celebrates both the pioneer and the revolutionaries for, he claims, achievements to rank beside any undertaken by the more recognised ""hard"" sciences.He examines, with appropriate respect, how Walcott could make such a critical mistake regarding his subjects, how it was effectively impossible for him to conceive of an alternative to the notion of slow but inevitable ""upward"" development. In fact the revisionist work to come didn't utilise amazing breakthroughs of thought or technology. Nothing that was done in the 70s and 80s was beyond Walcott's technical capacities - but as a product of his time and place he was simply predisposed to see what he wanted or needed to see, so he did.Finally, after leading us through a fascinating and surprisingly accessible education in the field of ancient evolution, Gould demonstrates how these revelations about early life hang the probability of our own existence in a frighteningly - or, to another palate, thrillingly - slender thread.Or, do I hear you cry, DOES he?Because, not to put too fine a point on it, not everyone agrees with Gould's conclusions - even the visionaries he celebrates in the book. Subtitled The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History, Gould's overview of the re-examination of palaeontology's crown jewel begins as a heartfelt celebration of the scientific method and ends as, arguably, an overenthusiastic departure towards his belief in mankind's unlikeliness, and a variation on the standard evolutionary theory which is far from universally accepted. However, between and through these extremes, he treats us to an engaging, enthusiastic and entertaining experience, and it is for this that the book will continue to deserve a readership, even if some of his conclusions draw fire from various detractors as time marches on.It should not be assumed though that the book is closed on Gould's perspective, that He Was Wrong and That Is That. Ten minutes of layperson level browsing underlined for me that there remains debate; and while some of those lined up in opposition to Gould's claims are pretty big guns of the scientific world, even amongst them there is great respect for his writing - and that there can be disagreement and simultaneous support for his work is as interesting to me as his argument itself.It would be nice, reassuringly so, if every science writer, presenting and then interpreting evidence, could be shown to produce undeniable fact; to raise the bar for others to jump from, not at; but this isn't what science necessarily does. Science may be just a system of beliefs no different from any other, religious or not, and as such just as fallible - no, infinitely more so, as for science the facts may sometimes show the beliefs to be wrong.Subject to the righteous threat of constant revision, every theory may eventually come apart at the how it seems - but if great theories give rise to great books only for greater theories to take their turn, then it's a small price to pay to have such good things to read while we wait for the next in line. Gould would, I think, happily accept this form of progressive improvement over time, if no other."
139,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38010332-greta,5,"If you read the book recently, it is outdated. I do not really like Jay Gould as a scientist since he is kind of wordy and has peculiar theories, but that is not a matter of this book. If you judge the book as a picky evolutionary scientist, you will find lots of mistakes or outdated information. This is a book for non-scientists, although some concepts might be difficult to understand, I confess. Stephen success in trying to introduce us to the amazing world of early living forms that might be not as astonishing as dinosaurs, or some other popular fossils, but certainly these apparently insignificant arthropods were the beginning for everything in life, and most people do not even know they all existed and how important they were. I would recommend this book to science enthusiasts, geologists without a biology background, or freshman biology students, who might get the most of it."
140,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10404161-alex-shrugged,5,"This book is entrancing from the first to the last page. There is a short time, perhaps 3 or 4 pages where the narrative bogs down, but the rest is well paced, and fascinating.This is a book about the Burgess Shale in British Columbia and the scientific blunder of the century caused by a mind refusing to see what the fossils were telling him. This need to shoehorn the Burgess Shale ""oddballs"" into well-known groups was due to certain preconceptions that were strong at the time and remain a problem (though a lesser one) into the modern day.The narrative is presented as a drama in several acts because the story resembles a mystery slowly uncovered and ultimately changing the history of life.Dr. Walcott discovered the Burgess Shale in 1909. He was looking for evidence of the beginning of the Cambrian Explosion, the apparently sudden appearance of complex multi-cellular life. What he found was a treasure of fossils shortly after the event. (A few million years is considered ""shortly after"".) Since the generally accepted view of evolution is a leisurely improvement as species develop from the simple to the complex, finding complex fossils so early in natural history was disruptive to Darwin's Theory and had to be explained. In other words, if life was so complex during the Cambrian period then there should have been simpler species that came LONG before then in the Precambrian era. Yet these simpler precursors could not be found. An explanation was needed. The pressure to make these Burgess Shale ""oddballs"" fit into an ""acceptable"" scientific model of evolution was tremendous. Thus for decades the Burgess discoveries remained on the back shelves and in drawers, most unstudied and the few ""oddballs"" shoved quickly into known categories and forgotten.Decades later, Dr. Whittington decided to study the Burgess specimens, hoping to find some new type of trilobite. He believed that Dr. Walcott was generally correct, that somehow these specimens would fit into known groups. Yet, as he studied each specimen more closely, he realized that some of them represented an entirely new branch of the evolutionary tree. In fact, it wasn't a tree at all. It was more like an evolutionary bush.The book is actually about how our prejudices and even the diagrams and charts we use push us toward preconditioned conclusions. (FYI, the author does this himself in a few cases, minor but I noticed.) The author has convinced me that life on Earth (or at least intelligent life) is darn near impossible, except that here we are discussing it. He does accept as a given that some sort of life developing on Earth was inevitable, but the idea that Homo sapiens were destined to become the pinnacle of Creation or even the best that evolution had to offer is utterly ridiculous. From a probability and statistics point of view I am forced to agree with the author. I am a religious man, but I don't look to the Bible for my science lessons. The Jewish New Year has begun. As I recited my prayers I acknowledged that the new year is 5779 since the Creation. Do I really believe that? I know what the logic behind the number is, and I am willing to accord respect to the scholars who came up with that number. It was a good effort given the knowledge they had at the time and I stick with it out of that respect even though I write 2018 on my checks. Christians have come up with a different number. I assume they respect those Christians scholars of the past and write 2018 on their checks as well.During the time of Dr. Walcott, about 12 years before he discovered the Burgess Shale, Lord Kelvin estimated (in 1897) that the Earth was about 20-40 million years old. That was the accepted figure because no one (except Einstein in 1905 with E=mc2) could conceive of any other way that the Earth could stay warm long enough to develop life. Once they realized nuclear fusion in the Sun and radioactive decay on Earth could keep it warm, much longer estimates for the age of the Earth could be credibly entertained.I've had windy debates about evolution with folks. It seems that any deviation from Darwin's ""ironclad"" declarations are considered heresy. ""Burn the Witch!"" Oh... did I say that out loud? :-) Darwinists are those poor souls who follow Darwin's Theory on evolution as if it were holy writ. These people do science and the theory of evolution no good. What we need are adult conversations and reasoned debate. Not accusations nor insults. I think Darwin's Theory on evolution is a good first pass at the idea. The theory has some flaws that need work, but over all, it is good stuff... really good for a time when DNA was unknown and microscopes were very poor instruments. This is my second reading of the book. I promised a fellow I've been debating that I would read the book again and come back with some quotes to support my position on the age of the Earth and the improbability that life on Earth might come from another planet (say Mars) and then develop on Earth into life as we know it. This is called panspermia and while it is a logical idea, it is not a very probable idea. On the other hand, I don't think life developing as it did on Earth on its own is very probable either. That doesn't mean it didn't happen. I just like knocking around ideas. Don't read too much into it.Oh... and I forgot to mention... The ""F-Word"" is used once in this book as an actual quote from one of the scientists who suddenly realized he had found yet another Burgess ""oddball"" that didn't fit any known phyla. It seems juvenile to use such a direct quote in a book like this, but the book contains a few anachronisms that only make sense if you realize that it was written in the 1980's about events from the 1910's to the 1970's. "
141,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16022816-chris-stratton,3,I am sure this is a great book among paleontologists. The detail of each species he documents and explains and the arguments for reclassifications must be a joy to someone in the field. I however was on a forced march to finish the book. I found the book interesting don’t get me wrong but much went beyond my knowledge of paleontology or biology for that matter. My takeaways? Beware of preconceived ideas! Oh and by the way knowing you are applying preconceived is really hard. Don’t be afraid of speaking up if the establishment believes one thing and you believe another especially if you can prove it.

This is true for the person(s) that discovered the Burgess Shale. Don't get me wrong, I really like reading anything by Gould. Sometimes his tangents into the personal lives of the scientists are a bit long winded. If this is for you, enjoy! I much prefer reading about the science than the people."

Amazing the bountiful life exposed in the Burgess Shale site. Wonders of life active in a time before Homo Sapiens evolved.

Gould's political stance seldom agreed with mine, yet I've never doubted his intelligence or erudition. The book is twenty years old, and some of the content has been revised or disputed since; however, I learned a great deal about this pivotal period in the history of life. Gould's style is dense and ""wordy"" at times, and there was too much analysis of Walcott's persona and approach to his discoveries in the Burgess Shale, but it didn't detract too much from what is a genuinely fascinating read."

He proposed too many things as fiat, when he could have easily rephrased everything to conjecture.Nevertheless it is a great read, full of a lot of information about earlier life on the planet. And as I note in my review of *Origin of Species*, Gould is probably right; if we ran evolution all over again, would it turn out the same? Probably not."

Gould is with the ""others,"" and proposes that contingency is an importamnt component of evolution. A fascinating story, with Gould's analysis at the forefront.

163,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1959519-max-maxwell,5,"To be clear, Wonderful Life is not a perfect book, but it is certainly an amazing book. It's pertinent to ask, ""Where does the book fall flat?""First, the middle section of the book, ""The Reconstruction of the Burgess Shale,"" is just a little bit too long. I mean exactly what I said; a few pages, say, 20 or so, after you've said, ""OK, I'm ready to get out of this murky details section and get on with the implications of it all,"" the section ends. As Gould points out, the section is, admittedly, important:Pleading is undignified, but allow me one line: please bear with the details; they are accessible, and they are the gateway to a new world.And bear with them you will, through about 200 pages of descriptions of, say, how the specimens of Opabinia or Hallucigenia were dissected, camera lucida diagrams, and repetitive descriptions of Harry Whittington's conservative temperament.The best parts of the book are the first, fourth, and fifth sections. The first, ""The Iconography of an Expectation,"" deals with the tendency amongst scientists and laypeople alike to see evolution as a linear process resulting in more and more complexity and always yielding intelligence. The fourth, ""Walcott's Vision and the Nature of History,"" tells of the myriad expectations that led the original discoverer and describer of the Burgess to make the fatal error of placing all the Burgess biota, most of which were completely new to science, in previously known categories, as ancestors of modern creatures. And the fifth, ""Possible Worlds,"" uses parts two and three (the ones with all the details) as a jumping board from which to explore the idea of punctuated equilibrium and its subsequent idea of contingency.Punctuated equilibrium is the idea that evolution is not a straight line of progress. Rather, evolution centers on mass extinctions such as the extinction that killed 96 or 97% of life on earth, including most of the Burgess organisms. Evolution only works in a straight line up until a really mass extinction, and then all bets are off. Natural selection is so tied to local environments that if the environment changes it can mean game over:Even if fishes hone their adaptations to peaks of aquatic perfection, they will all die if the ponds dry up. But grubby old Buster the Lungfish, former laughingstock of the piscine priesthood, may pull through... if we are Buster's legacy... how can we possibly view our mentality as inevitable, or even probable?One instantly thinks of polar bears doomed by global warming. Gould calls the element of history that relies on happenstance and massively improbable coincidence ""contingency,"" and he hammers its prevalence home with numerous examples—notably that the Burgess organism Pikaia was the earliest chordate, and its nonexistence would have erased us from history.My main objection to contingency is complicated, but in the spirit of this review, I might ask you to bear with my details. Steven Pinker, in his book 
The Blank Slate
, makes an excellent point:Sigmund Freud immodestly wrote that ""humanity has in the course of its time had to endure from the hands of science three great outrages upon its native self-love"": the discovery that our world is not the center of the celestial spheres but rather a speck in a vast universe, the discovery that we are not specially created but instead descended from the animals, and the discovery that often our conscious minds do not control how we act but merely tell us a story about our actions.Science does have a proud tradition of muckraking by demoting the status of humankind further and further, from Lord of Creation, created in God's image, to just another ape on another rock in another galaxy. To most people, this is insulting, even troubling; to those who understand, to those who find themselves, like Job, ""comforted that I am dust,"" it's humbling, and beautiful. But it does lead to a sort of playground-style fight over who among the sciences has demoted man furthest. Gould seems to be making a play here:As Freud observed, our relationship with science must be paradoxical because we are forced to pay an almost intolerable price for each major gain in knowledge and power—the psychological cost of progressive dethronement from the center of things, and increasing marginality in an uncaring universe.He's referencing Freud in order to tie in the concept with his view of contingency.Here's where things get neat: think about SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. SETI optimists, people who feel that it is likely that the universe is populated by intelligent life (myself included), base our assumption on a certain feel for evolution. Carl Sagan was a SETI optimist; he felt that evolution follows, if not a straight line, per se, a route to progress. If Gould is to be believed that (a) contingency is all-important in understanding evolution and (b) contingency is one of Freud's demotions, then Sagan's converse idea should be empowering to man, in the sense that it indicates that evolution must eventually result in something like us. And yet—here is Sagan in his book 
Pale Blue Dot
, titling a chapter ""The Great Demotions,"" and claiming among those demotions the notion that we may not be alone in the universe!The thing is that Gould is not the only supporter of punctuated equilibrium that upholds his ideas as those most demoralizing to mankind. Here's Michael Shermer in the Spring 2008 issue of Skeptic magazine:Historical experiment after experiment reveals the same answer: we are a fluke of nature, a quirk of evolution, a glorious contingency. It is tempting to... write yourself into the story as the central pattern in order to find purpose and meaning... But skeptical alarms should toll whenever anyone claims that science has discovered our deepest desires and oldest myths are true after all... a purpose-seeking animal will find itself as the purpose of nature.Shermer is responding to SETI optimism with a stone face. The point is that Shermer and Gould accuse SETI optimists of wishful thinking, without realizing that their notion so perfectly backs up the very teachings of the church: that we are alone and that we are the only intelligent life out there.—you see, the idea of SETI was once about where contingency is now. The idea of other people was very troubling to the religious; how could God send a saviour to two or more worlds? I'm not saying that contingency is a bad idea, and neither am I knocking punctuated equilibrium. I'm just saying it's not as much of a revelation as Gould thinks.I'm done complaining.—so, what did Gould get right?One of the major appeals of the book is his treatment of scientists as real, quirky people instead of arcane demigods; think the best parts of Bill Bryson's 
A Short History of Nearly Everything

Sidebars throughout help the layman through arthropod terminology, and the book is lavishly illustrated throughout. Gould's prose is stellar—each punctuation mark and word is devastating. Some say that he rambles, but they're missing the point, because Gould's rambling is his charm. He conveys his passion like few other science writers manage to do.Finally, despite being 20 years old this year, the science in Wonderful Life is cutting-edge. After that long, there were bound to be some corrections: for example, Anomalocaris did not perish soon after the Shale's time; a relative named Schinderhannes survived until the Devonian, 100 million years after the Burgess. Furthermore, Anomalocaris and Opabinia are now considered lobopods, not their own distinct phylum. Hallucigenia walked on its ""tenticles,"" not on its spines, making it substantially less hallucinogenic than once imagined. These are trivialities, in my opinion; for every incorrect guess, Gould makes three that panned out, including correctly placing Aysheiea in the phylum Onychophora, at a time when it was in dispute as to what it was, and calling that the Burgess represented a world-wide fauna based on a few Chinese fossils, guessing that more would show up (in the 2000s, the Changjiang fauna did indeed show up, replete with complete anomalocarids and primitive chordata related to Pikaia, theretofore a single specimen).The facts are these: Wonderful Life makes you think. It's brilliantly written. And, at the end of the day, the creatures and fossils are just awesome. Paleo enthusiasts like me are all kids at heart, Gould being no exception at all."

Gould is clear in his opening chapter that he intends for this book to be both useful for students of the history of life on Earth and for the lay person interested in the same. With no formal scientific training beyond the age of 16, I am only qualified to assess the success of the latter intention, which I can do positively.That being said, however, Gould's quest for accessibility also leads him down some very odd tangents. In the name of illustrating some of his points he begins to almost rant about certain aspects of life and the academy. One notable example is a lengthy lament about the current (at least, current as of the book's writing in the summer of 1988) state of doctoral education on either side of the pond. Such passages read like a columnist giving their true opinions on aspects of the world around them and as a result seem a little fluffy. I found myself wondering on several occasions if the same kind of behaviour would have been tolerated by another author (one perhaps not as established as Gould was at the time of this book's publishing, or one from a different demographic, or indeed one writing just a few decades in the future). One particularly irksome example was of his use of the film It's A Wonderful Life.No doubt where Gould got the main title of his book from, the film gets no mention until over two thirds of the way through the book. Gould uses the film to illustrate the argument for which I came to this book in the first place - that if one were to rewind the 'tape of life' then life as we know it would not emerge on the replay. Gould's reasoning for this is based heavily on what is commonly understood as the butterfly effect (though Gould does not himself use this terminology). It is in an explanation of how the butterfly effect works that Gould references It's A Wonderful Life: the seemingly-insignificant-at-the-time events of George's life had massive knock-on effects to the point where the world would have been a very different place had he never been born. My problem with Gould's use of It's A Wonderful Life is twofold: it was too long, and it came too late in the book. Gould practically recounts the entire film to the reader when a few examples from the film would have had the desired effect. And the argument which Gould is attempting to illustrate has already been given throughout the book. By the time the reader reaches this illustration, they no longer need it.Gould's use of lengthy and tangential illustrations was irritating, but this book has a more egregious fault. I was reading this book at the same time I was reading Delores S. Williams' Sisters in the Wilderness, a book which - among other things - made me aware of some of the historical and scientific 'justifications' for racism. In particular, Williams made me aware of Louis Agassiz's affirmation and perpetuation of racist pseudoscience. Reading these two books in tandem made Agassiz's name in Wonderful Life stand out all the more. Gould references Agassiz twice in this book, but never mentions this dangerous and ugly side of his work; indeed, the only description Gould gives of Agassiz or his work is that he was ""America's greatest natural historian"" (p242). Granted, Williams' book was published four years after Gould's, but I would nevertheless caution the reader of this and other similar works to keep in mind the historiography of the field in a way which Gould does not.If one can tolerate the tangents and is thoughtful of the ugly history behind some of the discoveries which made this book, I think you can get a lot out of it. The scientific jargon is kept to a minimum and the writing style flows well. It provides a helpful history of the discovery and research of the fossils found in the Burgess Shale and what this work has meant for evolutionary science and current thinking of the history of life on Earth. I think this book is an apt reminder that even a book as worthwhile to the field as this one is does not - and should not - escape criticism, particularly in light of its own uncritical elements."
165,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57886276-owen-moorhead,2,"In the introduction to this book, Gould writes that he hoped to be an ""insider McPhee"" or something like that. Well Mr. Gould, I've read John McPhee; I know John McPhee's work--you sir, are no John McPhee.There are a few problems with this book that prevent it from succeeding (for me). For starters, there's the obvious one: Gould is too close to his subject matter. He seems to recognize this, but that self-awareness doesn't confer immunity to an understandable and natural tendency to forge boldly into the weeds. He is (probably) a much better stylist than most paleontologists, but that is not enough on its own to communicate such delicacies as the ramosity of a Burgess fossil's appendages. To Gould's credit, I think he recognizes this: he clearly felt the information needed a narrative and a theme to make for an interesting read to the lay reader.That brings me to another problem, namely the ideas with which Gould ties together the story of the Burgess fossils and their taxonomy. There are two images that recur continually throughout the book: rewinding tapes and a shoehorn. (Cones and trees also feature heavily.) They are invoked to illustrate two major themes of the book: the pernicious influence of ideology on scientific work and something about contingency. By the end of the book, I was starting to get annoyed with how frequently Gould resorts to these images.I won't say too much about Gould's thesis on ideology because I think it's well-argued and convincing. The contingency argument is more central and a bit confusing. It seems to go something like this: if you were to rewind the video tape of evolution or natural history or whatever, things would turn out differently. Let's leave aside the obvious problem with this image--namely, that no matter how many times you rewind a tape, it will always play the same way, plus or minus the marginal physical alterations that will take place through excessive rewinding.The main issue I have with this argument is I can't understand why Gould attaches so much importance to it. ""Things could have turned out differently than they did,"" he says. That seems to me a metaphysical question that may be trivial or unprovable, depending on your philosophical sympathies.But so what? That's the big question, which went unanswered throughout the book. If this had been a simple exposition of Burgess fauna, that wouldn't be a big deal. But Gould clearly thinks this assemblage proves something incredibly important about, I don't know, life, the universe, and everything. What exactly that is, I never did quite catch.The most eye-raising assertion of this book is that the Burgess Shale is the most important paleontological discovery of the century, and it is never really argued persuasively. That's the biggest failing of ""Wonderful Life"": it never convinced me of any of the lofty assertions Gould made at the outset.All that said, it wasn't terrible, and the writing really is pretty good, if occasionally pretentious."
166,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,5,"THis is a wonderful book, in all the senses of the word. The primary focus, the burgess fossils, are the stuff of science fiction - strange compilations of animal parts in strange configurations - so strange that science fiction could only take a lead from nature rather than anticipate it. For some reason, early life took some wild turns, many of which then failed to survive. If this book were only a catalog of these unusual beasts it would have been fascinating, but this is only the start.In part because of their strangeness, the second story - that of their discovery and rediscovery - adds to the interest: Initially discovered by Americas greatest paleontologist of the time, the real wonder of the fossils was missed. His analysis, biased by a preconceived notion of how things should be, didn't recognize the fact that many of these creatures did not fit modern categories. It took half a century before they were re-discovered and this time, recognized for the oddities that they really were. Why the first discovery missed, and the second did not, illustrates the all too human aspect to science which itself is often overlooked by preconceived notions of objectivity and dispassion. From these points Jay Gould presents his meta thesis regarding the almost heretical conclusion life's history tells: natural selection is not the only force guiding evolution. Somehow, and not just once, the 'progress' of life has been subject to freak events which have resulted in us humans. Our story, and all other life, is dependent or 'contingent' on these non-biological circumstances - we could as easily not be here. Thus at the third level, the book provides a sense of wonder, of amazement about our existence. Although he uses religious allusions with an abundance that probably leaves a Dawkins type shuddering, there is no supernatural conclusion inferred or implied, nor need there be. Whichever faith one has, I would hope that the wonder Jay Gould illicits is something all experience regarding the specialness of life. Finally, despite the heavy technical content, Jay Gould succeeds in conveying the story with scientific rigor which is also accessible to the uninitiated. Much 'popular science' is either dumbed down and over-punctuated (!), or not far enough removed from the home territory of journal publications. This then is the book's fourth wonder and the ultimate reason for my five star rating. "
167,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12305720-robert,5,"After visiting the Burgess Shale in August 2017, I decided to reread this book by SJ Gould, which I first read (and loved) sometime in the 1990s, shortly after it was published in 1989. Full disclosure, for years I used to devour Gould's This View of Life columns in Natural History magazine every month, and thoroughly enjoyed his books in the 1980s and 1990s, but haven't had the heart (or the stamina) to attempt his final and massive book (2002's The Structure of Evolutionary Theory). A brief foray into that tome made me realize that, at that late stage of his career, his writing style had become a bit too florid, his long and frequent asides too peripheral, and his tendency to show-off his obvious erudition had gotten a bit out of control. 1989's Wonderful Life, The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History, on the other hand, demonstrates Gould at his full powers. Wringing general principles out of specific geological, paleontological, or historical events, he brilliantly deconstructs iconic ideas (preconceptions?) in paleontology (e.g., increasing cone of diversity, gradualism, and adaptationist notions), offering in their place historical contingency, hierarchical levels of selection, and a ""neo-catastrophist"" approach to mass extinctions. It's true that the numerous quotations from Milton and Frost (no Gilbert and Sullivan, at least!), the ostentatious multilingualism, and the sometimes florid prose can seem to some readers a bit over the top, but these tendencies never take over in this book. The story he tells in this book about Walcott's discovery of the Burgess Shale high in the Canadian Rockies of British Colombia in 1909, and the revolutionary reinterpretation of the meaning of this Middle Cambrian ""explosion"" of life by the brilliant paleontologist Harry Whittington and his two equally brilliant students Derek Briggs and Simon Conway Morris is an inspiring one for scientists everywhere, and paleontologists in particular. Highly recommended."
168,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/748327-andrew-hudson,4,"For anyone in the dark, the Burgess Shale is one of the greatest fossil discoveries in palaeontological history. Uncovered in British Columbia by Charles Doolittle Walcott, one of America's most distinguished scientific minds, the Burgess Shale contained an astonishing diversity of forms - but most significantly, from a time at which no solid evidence for life had yet been found.Palaeontology had suffered from a critical absence in the fossil record. Dinosaurs, trilobites and many other extinct lifeforms had long been known of, of course, but while the hard body parts of dead creatures make for good fossilisation, the soft do not, tending to decay long before they can leave their mark. The sorry fact was that, prior to the Mid-Cambrian period (over five hundred million years ago), fossil evidence simply was not to be found. Whatever creatures had existed before the evolution of such hard structures as bone, chitin or shell, they had left no clue behind....until 1909. In the years that followed, C.D. Walcott collected nearly ninety thousand fossils, and though his time in the field was hampered by wide-ranging commitments as an administrator and leader of several of his country's most significant scientific bodies, he somehow found the time to study and report on his discovery as well. What he had found was nothing less than what the palaeontological community had longed for: evidence of simpler forms of life, early links in the chain that, over millions of years, would eventually produce fish and insects, amphibians and reptiles, birds, mammals and man.Or, do I hear you cry, DID he?Nearly sixty years after Walcott's discovery an Englishman named Harry Whittington, the world's leading expert on trilobites, began a process which would shine new light on a subject long considered as fact. With the help of a small group of allies they began to uncover details of the Burgess artefacts never before recognised; details which challenged Walcott's accepted wisdom regarding what his discoveries were; details which even called into question the basic nature of the evolutionary process itself.Whittington and his fellows proved with their efforts that, contrary to the traditional notion of simple creatures gradually improving over time, early evolution represented a chaotic period of sophisticated experimentation, with only blind chance in control of which forms of life would survive to define the future.Or, do I hear you cry, DID they?In Wonderful Life, Stephen J. Gould takes us on a remarkable journey. Setting the scene with an examination of our expectations in conventional evolutionary theory, we join him with Walcott on the Canadian slopes, then follow the various players as they reveal the unseen for the first time, or unveil it anew. He celebrates both the pioneer and the revolutionaries for, he claims, achievements to rank beside any undertaken by the more recognised ""hard"" sciences.He examines, with appropriate respect, how Walcott could make such a critical mistake regarding his subjects, how it was effectively impossible for him to conceive of an alternative to the notion of slow but inevitable ""upward"" development. In fact the revisionist work to come didn't utilise amazing breakthroughs of thought or technology. Nothing that was done in the 70s and 80s was beyond Walcott's technical capacities - but as a product of his time and place he was simply predisposed to see what he wanted or needed to see, so he did.Finally, after leading us through a fascinating and surprisingly accessible education in the field of ancient evolution, Gould demonstrates how these revelations about early life hang the probability of our own existence in a frighteningly - or, to another palate, thrillingly - slender thread.Or, do I hear you cry, DOES he?Because, not to put too fine a point on it, not everyone agrees with Gould's conclusions - even the visionaries he celebrates in the book. Subtitled The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History, Gould's overview of the re-examination of palaeontology's crown jewel begins as a heartfelt celebration of the scientific method and ends as, arguably, an overenthusiastic departure towards his belief in mankind's unlikeliness, and a variation on the standard evolutionary theory which is far from universally accepted. However, between and through these extremes, he treats us to an engaging, enthusiastic and entertaining experience, and it is for this that the book will continue to deserve a readership, even if some of his conclusions draw fire from various detractors as time marches on.It should not be assumed though that the book is closed on Gould's perspective, that He Was Wrong and That Is That. Ten minutes of layperson level browsing underlined for me that there remains debate; and while some of those lined up in opposition to Gould's claims are pretty big guns of the scientific world, even amongst them there is great respect for his writing - and that there can be disagreement and simultaneous support for his work is as interesting to me as his argument itself.It would be nice, reassuringly so, if every science writer, presenting and then interpreting evidence, could be shown to produce undeniable fact; to raise the bar for others to jump from, not at; but this isn't what science necessarily does. Science may be just a system of beliefs no different from any other, religious or not, and as such just as fallible - no, infinitely more so, as for science the facts may sometimes show the beliefs to be wrong.Subject to the righteous threat of constant revision, every theory may eventually come apart at the how it seems - but if great theories give rise to great books only for greater theories to take their turn, then it's a small price to pay to have such good things to read while we wait for the next in line. Gould would, I think, happily accept this form of progressive improvement over time, if no other."
169,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38010332-greta,5,"If you read the book recently, it is outdated. I do not really like Jay Gould as a scientist since he is kind of wordy and has peculiar theories, but that is not a matter of this book. If you judge the book as a picky evolutionary scientist, you will find lots of mistakes or outdated information. This is a book for non-scientists, although some concepts might be difficult to understand, I confess. Stephen success in trying to introduce us to the amazing world of early living forms that might be not as astonishing as dinosaurs, or some other popular fossils, but certainly these apparently insignificant arthropods were the beginning for everything in life, and most people do not even know they all existed and how important they were. I would recommend this book to science enthusiasts, geologists without a biology background, or freshman biology students, who might get the most of it."
170,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10404161-alex-shrugged,5,"This book is entrancing from the first to the last page. There is a short time, perhaps 3 or 4 pages where the narrative bogs down, but the rest is well paced, and fascinating.This is a book about the Burgess Shale in British Columbia and the scientific blunder of the century caused by a mind refusing to see what the fossils were telling him. This need to shoehorn the Burgess Shale ""oddballs"" into well-known groups was due to certain preconceptions that were strong at the time and remain a problem (though a lesser one) into the modern day.The narrative is presented as a drama in several acts because the story resembles a mystery slowly uncovered and ultimately changing the history of life.Dr. Walcott discovered the Burgess Shale in 1909. He was looking for evidence of the beginning of the Cambrian Explosion, the apparently sudden appearance of complex multi-cellular life. What he found was a treasure of fossils shortly after the event. (A few million years is considered ""shortly after"".) Since the generally accepted view of evolution is a leisurely improvement as species develop from the simple to the complex, finding complex fossils so early in natural history was disruptive to Darwin's Theory and had to be explained. In other words, if life was so complex during the Cambrian period then there should have been simpler species that came LONG before then in the Precambrian era. Yet these simpler precursors could not be found. An explanation was needed. The pressure to make these Burgess Shale ""oddballs"" fit into an ""acceptable"" scientific model of evolution was tremendous. Thus for decades the Burgess discoveries remained on the back shelves and in drawers, most unstudied and the few ""oddballs"" shoved quickly into known categories and forgotten.Decades later, Dr. Whittington decided to study the Burgess specimens, hoping to find some new type of trilobite. He believed that Dr. Walcott was generally correct, that somehow these specimens would fit into known groups. Yet, as he studied each specimen more closely, he realized that some of them represented an entirely new branch of the evolutionary tree. In fact, it wasn't a tree at all. It was more like an evolutionary bush.The book is actually about how our prejudices and even the diagrams and charts we use push us toward preconditioned conclusions. (FYI, the author does this himself in a few cases, minor but I noticed.) The author has convinced me that life on Earth (or at least intelligent life) is darn near impossible, except that here we are discussing it. He does accept as a given that some sort of life developing on Earth was inevitable, but the idea that Homo sapiens were destined to become the pinnacle of Creation or even the best that evolution had to offer is utterly ridiculous. From a probability and statistics point of view I am forced to agree with the author. I am a religious man, but I don't look to the Bible for my science lessons. The Jewish New Year has begun. As I recited my prayers I acknowledged that the new year is 5779 since the Creation. Do I really believe that? I know what the logic behind the number is, and I am willing to accord respect to the scholars who came up with that number. It was a good effort given the knowledge they had at the time and I stick with it out of that respect even though I write 2018 on my checks. Christians have come up with a different number. I assume they respect those Christians scholars of the past and write 2018 on their checks as well.During the time of Dr. Walcott, about 12 years before he discovered the Burgess Shale, Lord Kelvin estimated (in 1897) that the Earth was about 20-40 million years old. That was the accepted figure because no one (except Einstein in 1905 with E=mc2) could conceive of any other way that the Earth could stay warm long enough to develop life. Once they realized nuclear fusion in the Sun and radioactive decay on Earth could keep it warm, much longer estimates for the age of the Earth could be credibly entertained.I've had windy debates about evolution with folks. It seems that any deviation from Darwin's ""ironclad"" declarations are considered heresy. ""Burn the Witch!"" Oh... did I say that out loud? :-) Darwinists are those poor souls who follow Darwin's Theory on evolution as if it were holy writ. These people do science and the theory of evolution no good. What we need are adult conversations and reasoned debate. Not accusations nor insults. I think Darwin's Theory on evolution is a good first pass at the idea. The theory has some flaws that need work, but over all, it is good stuff... really good for a time when DNA was unknown and microscopes were very poor instruments. This is my second reading of the book. I promised a fellow I've been debating that I would read the book again and come back with some quotes to support my position on the age of the Earth and the improbability that life on Earth might come from another planet (say Mars) and then develop on Earth into life as we know it. This is called panspermia and while it is a logical idea, it is not a very probable idea. On the other hand, I don't think life developing as it did on Earth on its own is very probable either. That doesn't mean it didn't happen. I just like knocking around ideas. Don't read too much into it.Oh... and I forgot to mention... The ""F-Word"" is used once in this book as an actual quote from one of the scientists who suddenly realized he had found yet another Burgess ""oddball"" that didn't fit any known phyla. It seems juvenile to use such a direct quote in a book like this, but the book contains a few anachronisms that only make sense if you realize that it was written in the 1980's about events from the 1910's to the 1970's. "
171,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16022816-chris-stratton,3,I am sure this is a great book among paleontologists. The detail of each species he documents and explains and the arguments for reclassifications must be a joy to someone in the field. I however was on a forced march to finish the book. I found the book interesting don’t get me wrong but much went beyond my knowledge of paleontology or biology for that matter. My takeaways? Beware of preconceived ideas! Oh and by the way knowing you are applying preconceived is really hard. Don’t be afraid of speaking up if the establishment believes one thing and you believe another especially if you can prove it.

This is true for the person(s) that discovered the Burgess Shale. Don't get me wrong, I really like reading anything by Gould. Sometimes his tangents into the personal lives of the scientists are a bit long winded. If this is for you, enjoy! I much prefer reading about the science than the people."

Amazing the bountiful life exposed in the Burgess Shale site. Wonders of life active in a time before Homo Sapiens evolved.

Gould's political stance seldom agreed with mine, yet I've never doubted his intelligence or erudition. The book is twenty years old, and some of the content has been revised or disputed since; however, I learned a great deal about this pivotal period in the history of life. Gould's style is dense and ""wordy"" at times, and there was too much analysis of Walcott's persona and approach to his discoveries in the Burgess Shale, but it didn't detract too much from what is a genuinely fascinating read."

He proposed too many things as fiat, when he could have easily rephrased everything to conjecture.Nevertheless it is a great read, full of a lot of information about earlier life on the planet.

Gould is with the ""others,"" and proposes that contingency is an importamnt component of evolution. A fascinating story, with Gould's analysis at the forefront.

193,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1959519-max-maxwell,5,"To be clear, Wonderful Life is not a perfect book, but it is certainly an amazing book. It's pertinent to ask, ""Where does the book fall flat?""First, the middle section of the book, ""The Reconstruction of the Burgess Shale,"" is just a little bit too long. I mean exactly what I said; a few pages, say, 20 or so, after you've said, ""OK, I'm ready to get out of this murky details section and get on with the implications of it all,"" the section ends. As Gould points out, the section is, admittedly, important:Pleading is undignified, but allow me one line: please bear with the details; they are accessible, and they are the gateway to a new world.And bear with them you will, through about 200 pages of descriptions of, say, how the specimens of Opabinia or Hallucigenia were dissected, camera lucida diagrams, and repetitive descriptions of Harry Whittington's conservative temperament.The best parts of the book are the first, fourth, and fifth sections. The first, ""The Iconography of an Expectation,"" deals with the tendency amongst scientists and laypeople alike to see evolution as a linear process resulting in more and more complexity and always yielding intelligence. The fourth, ""Walcott's Vision and the Nature of History,"" tells of the myriad expectations that led the original discoverer and describer of the Burgess to make the fatal error of placing all the Burgess biota, most of which were completely new to science, in previously known categories, as ancestors of modern creatures. And the fifth, ""Possible Worlds,"" uses parts two and three (the ones with all the details) as a jumping board from which to explore the idea of punctuated equilibrium and its subsequent idea of contingency.Punctuated equilibrium is the idea that evolution is not a straight line of progress. Rather, evolution centers on mass extinctions such as the extinction that killed 96 or 97% of life on earth, including most of the Burgess organisms. Evolution only works in a straight line up until a really mass extinction, and then all bets are off. Natural selection is so tied to local environments that if the environment changes it can mean game over:Even if fishes hone their adaptations to peaks of aquatic perfection, they will all die if the ponds dry up. But grubby old Buster the Lungfish, former laughingstock of the piscine priesthood, may pull through... if we are Buster's legacy... how can we possibly view our mentality as inevitable, or even probable?One instantly thinks of polar bears doomed by global warming. Gould calls the element of history that relies on happenstance and massively improbable coincidence ""contingency,"" and he hammers its prevalence home with numerous examples—notably that the Burgess organism Pikaia was the earliest chordate, and its nonexistence would have erased us from history.My main objection to contingency is complicated, but in the spirit of this review, I might ask you to bear with my details. Steven Pinker, in his book 
The Blank Slate
, makes an excellent point:Sigmund Freud immodestly wrote that ""humanity has in the course of its time had to endure from the hands of science three great outrages upon its native self-love"": the discovery that our world is not the center of the celestial spheres but rather a speck in a vast universe, the discovery that we are not specially created but instead descended from the animals, and the discovery that often our conscious minds do not control how we act but merely tell us a story about our actions.Science does have a proud tradition of muckraking by demoting the status of humankind further and further, from Lord of Creation, created in God's image, to just another ape on another rock in another galaxy. To most people, this is insulting, even troubling; to those who understand, to those who find themselves, like Job, ""comforted that I am dust,"" it's humbling, and beautiful. But it does lead to a sort of playground-style fight over who among the sciences has demoted man furthest. Gould seems to be making a play here:As Freud observed, our relationship with science must be paradoxical because we are forced to pay an almost intolerable price for each major gain in knowledge and power—the psychological cost of progressive dethronement from the center of things, and increasing marginality in an uncaring universe.He's referencing Freud in order to tie in the concept with his view of contingency.Here's where things get neat: think about SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. SETI optimists, people who feel that it is likely that the universe is populated by intelligent life (myself included), base our assumption on a certain feel for evolution. Carl Sagan was a SETI optimist; he felt that evolution follows, if not a straight line, per se, a route to progress. If Gould is to be believed that (a) contingency is all-important in understanding evolution and (b) contingency is one of Freud's demotions, then Sagan's converse idea should be empowering to man, in the sense that it indicates that evolution must eventually result in something like us. And yet—here is Sagan in his book 
Pale Blue Dot
, titling a chapter ""The Great Demotions,"" and claiming among those demotions the notion that we may not be alone in the universe!The thing is that Gould is not the only supporter of punctuated equilibrium that upholds his ideas as those most demoralizing to mankind. Here's Michael Shermer in the Spring 2008 issue of Skeptic magazine:Historical experiment after experiment reveals the same answer: we are a fluke of nature, a quirk of evolution, a glorious contingency. It is tempting to... write yourself into the story as the central pattern in order to find purpose and meaning... But skeptical alarms should toll whenever anyone claims that science has discovered our deepest desires and oldest myths are true after all... a purpose-seeking animal will find itself as the purpose of nature.Shermer is responding to SETI optimism with a stone face. The point is that Shermer and Gould accuse SETI optimists of wishful thinking, without realizing that their notion so perfectly backs up the very teachings of the church: that we are alone and that we are the only intelligent life out there.—you see, the idea of SETI was once about where contingency is now. The idea of other people was very troubling to the religious; how could God send a saviour to two or more worlds? I'm not saying that contingency is a bad idea, and neither am I knocking punctuated equilibrium. I'm just saying it's not as much of a revelation as Gould thinks.I'm done complaining.—so, what did Gould get right?One of the major appeals of the book is his treatment of scientists as real, quirky people instead of arcane demigods; think the best parts of Bill Bryson's 
A Short History of Nearly Everything
 in more depth. Whittington, Briggs, Conway Morris, Walcott, and even Darwin come alive in these pages, in their words, if possible.He also presents the details with arresting scope and clarity. Sidebars throughout help the layman through arthropod terminology, and the book is lavishly illustrated throughout. Gould's prose is stellar—each punctuation mark and word is devastating. Some say that he rambles, but they're missing the point, because Gould's rambling is his charm. He conveys his passion like few other science writers manage to do.Finally, despite being 20 years old this year, the science in Wonderful Life is cutting-edge. After that long, there were bound to be some corrections: for example, Anomalocaris did not perish soon after the Shale's time; a relative named Schinderhannes survived until the Devonian, 100 million years after the Burgess. Furthermore, Anomalocaris and Opabinia are now considered lobopods, not their own distinct phylum. Hallucigenia walked on its ""tenticles,"" not on its spines, making it substantially less hallucinogenic than once imagined. These are trivialities, in my opinion; for every incorrect guess, Gould makes three that panned out, including correctly placing Aysheiea in the phylum Onychophora, at a time when it was in dispute as to what it was, and calling that the Burgess represented a world-wide fauna based on a few Chinese fossils, guessing that more would show up (in the 2000s, the Changjiang fauna did indeed show up, replete with complete anomalocarids and primitive chordata related to Pikaia, theretofore a single specimen).The facts are these: Wonderful Life makes you think. It's brilliantly written. And, at the end of the day, the creatures and fossils are just awesome. Paleo enthusiasts like me are all kids at heart, Gould being no exception at all."
194,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467405-ellen,3,"I read this book for research and primarily for Gould's argument, given throughout this book, that if one were to rewind the 'tape of life' then life as we know it would not emerge on the replay. Gould is clear in his opening chapter that he intends for this book to be both useful for students of the history of life on Earth and for the lay person interested in the same. With no formal scientific training beyond the age of 16, I am only qualified to assess the success of the latter intention, which I can do positively.That being said, however, Gould's quest for accessibility also leads him down some very odd tangents. In the name of illustrating some of his points he begins to almost rant about certain aspects of life and the academy. One notable example is a lengthy lament about the current (at least, current as of the book's writing in the summer of 1988) state of doctoral education on either side of the pond. Such passages read like a columnist giving their true opinions on aspects of the world around them and as a result seem a little fluffy. I found myself wondering on several occasions if the same kind of behaviour would have been tolerated by another author (one perhaps not as established as Gould was at the time of this book's publishing, or one from a different demographic, or indeed one writing just a few decades in the future). One particularly irksome example was of his use of the film It's A Wonderful Life.No doubt where Gould got the main title of his book from, the film gets no mention until over two thirds of the way through the book. Gould uses the film to illustrate the argument for which I came to this book in the first place - that if one were to rewind the 'tape of life' then life as we know it would not emerge on the replay. Gould's reasoning for this is based heavily on what is commonly understood as the butterfly effect (though Gould does not himself use this terminology). It is in an explanation of how the butterfly effect works that Gould references It's A Wonderful Life: the seemingly-insignificant-at-the-time events of George's life had massive knock-on effects to the point where the world would have been a very different place had he never been born. My problem with Gould's use of It's A Wonderful Life is twofold: it was too long, and it came too late in the book. Gould practically recounts the entire film to the reader when a few examples from the film would have had the desired effect. And the argument which Gould is attempting to illustrate has already been given throughout the book. By the time the reader reaches this illustration, they no longer need it.Gould's use of lengthy and tangential illustrations was irritating, but this book has a more egregious fault. I was reading this book at the same time I was reading Delores S. Williams' Sisters in the Wilderness, a book which - among other things - made me aware of some of the historical and scientific 'justifications' for racism. In particular, Williams made me aware of Louis Agassiz's affirmation and perpetuation of racist pseudoscience. Reading these two books in tandem made Agassiz's name in Wonderful Life stand out all the more. Gould references Agassiz twice in this book, but never mentions this dangerous and ugly side of his work; indeed, the only description Gould gives of Agassiz or his work is that he was ""America's greatest natural historian"" (p242). Granted, Williams' book was published four years after Gould's, but I would nevertheless caution the reader of this and other similar works to keep in mind the historiography of the field in a way which Gould does not.If one can tolerate the tangents and is thoughtful of the ugly history behind some of the discoveries which made this book, I think you can get a lot out of it. The scientific jargon is kept to a minimum and the writing style flows well. It provides a helpful history of the discovery and research of the fossils found in the Burgess Shale and what this work has meant for evolutionary science and current thinking of the history of life on Earth. I think this book is an apt reminder that even a book as worthwhile to the field as this one is does not - and should not - escape criticism, particularly in light of its own uncritical elements."
195,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57886276-owen-moorhead,2,"In the introduction to this book, Gould writes that he hoped to be an ""insider McPhee"" or something like that. Well Mr. Gould, I've read John McPhee; I know John McPhee's work--you sir, are no John McPhee.There are a few problems with this book that prevent it from succeeding (for me). For starters, there's the obvious one: Gould is too close to his subject matter. He seems to recognize this, but that self-awareness doesn't confer immunity to an understandable and natural tendency to forge boldly into the weeds. He is (probably) a much better stylist than most paleontologists, but that is not enough on its own to communicate such delicacies as the ramosity of a Burgess fossil's appendages. To Gould's credit, I think he recognizes this: he clearly felt the information needed a narrative and a theme to make for an interesting read to the lay reader.That brings me to another problem, namely the ideas with which Gould ties together the story of the Burgess fossils and their taxonomy. There are two images that recur continually throughout the book: rewinding tapes and a shoehorn. (Cones and trees also feature heavily.) They are invoked to illustrate two major themes of the book: the pernicious influence of ideology on scientific work and something about contingency. By the end of the book, I was starting to get annoyed with how frequently Gould resorts to these images.I won't say too much about Gould's thesis on ideology because I think it's well-argued and convincing. The contingency argument is more central and a bit confusing. It seems to go something like this: if you were to rewind the video tape of evolution or natural history or whatever, things would turn out differently. Let's leave aside the obvious problem with this image--namely, that no matter how many times you rewind a tape, it will always play the same way, plus or minus the marginal physical alterations that will take place through excessive rewinding.The main issue I have with this argument is I can't understand why Gould attaches so much importance to it. ""Things could have turned out differently than they did,"" he says. That seems to me a metaphysical question that may be trivial or unprovable, depending on your philosophical sympathies.But so what? That's the big question, which went unanswered throughout the book. If this had been a simple exposition of Burgess fauna, that wouldn't be a big deal. But Gould clearly thinks this assemblage proves something incredibly important about, I don't know, life, the universe, and everything. What exactly that is, I never did quite catch.The most eye-raising assertion of this book is that the Burgess Shale is the most important paleontological discovery of the century, and it is never really argued persuasively. That's the biggest failing of ""Wonderful Life"": it never convinced me of any of the lofty assertions Gould made at the outset.All that said, it wasn't terrible, and the writing really is pretty good, if occasionally pretentious."
196,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,5,"THis is a wonderful book, in all the senses of the word. The primary focus, the burgess fossils, are the stuff of science fiction - strange compilations of animal parts in strange configurations - so strange that science fiction could only take a lead from nature rather than anticipate it. For some reason, early life took some wild turns, many of which then failed to survive. If this book were only a catalog of these unusual beasts it would have been fascinating, but this is only the start.In part because of their strangeness, the second story - that of their discovery and rediscovery - adds to the interest: Initially discovered by Americas greatest paleontologist of the time, the real wonder of the fossils was missed. His analysis, biased by a preconceived notion of how things should be, didn't recognize the fact that many of these creatures did not fit modern categories. It took half a century before they were re-discovered and this time, recognized for the oddities that they really were. Why the first discovery missed, and the second did not, illustrates the all too human aspect to science which itself is often overlooked by preconceived notions of objectivity and dispassion. From these points Jay Gould presents his meta thesis regarding the almost heretical conclusion life's history tells: natural selection is not the only force guiding evolution. Somehow, and not just once, the 'progress' of life has been subject to freak events which have resulted in us humans. Our story, and all other life, is dependent or 'contingent' on these non-biological circumstances - we could as easily not be here. Thus at the third level, the book provides a sense of wonder, of amazement about our existence. Although he uses religious allusions with an abundance that probably leaves a Dawkins type shuddering, there is no supernatural conclusion inferred or implied, nor need there be. Whichever faith one has, I would hope that the wonder Jay Gould illicits is something all experience regarding the specialness of life. Finally, despite the heavy technical content, Jay Gould succeeds in conveying the story with scientific rigor which is also accessible to the uninitiated. Much 'popular science' is either dumbed down and over-punctuated (!), or not far enough removed from the home territory of journal publications. This then is the book's fourth wonder and the ultimate reason for my five star rating. "
197,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12305720-robert,5,"After visiting the Burgess Shale in August 2017, I decided to reread this book by SJ Gould, which I first read (and loved) sometime in the 1990s, shortly after it was published in 1989. Full disclosure, for years I used to devour Gould's This View of Life columns in Natural History magazine every month, and thoroughly enjoyed his books in the 1980s and 1990s, but haven't had the heart (or the stamina) to attempt his final and massive book (2002's The Structure of Evolutionary Theory). A brief foray into that tome made me realize that, at that late stage of his career, his writing style had become a bit too florid, his long and frequent asides too peripheral, and his tendency to show-off his obvious erudition had gotten a bit out of control. 1989's Wonderful Life, The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History, on the other hand, demonstrates Gould at his full powers. Wringing general principles out of specific geological, paleontological, or historical events, he brilliantly deconstructs iconic ideas (preconceptions?) in paleontology (e.g., increasing cone of diversity, gradualism, and adaptationist notions), offering in their place historical contingency, hierarchical levels of selection, and a ""neo-catastrophist"" approach to mass extinctions. It's true that the numerous quotations from Milton and Frost (no Gilbert and Sullivan, at least!), the ostentatious multilingualism, and the sometimes florid prose can seem to some readers a bit over the top, but these tendencies never take over in this book. The story he tells in this book about Walcott's discovery of the Burgess Shale high in the Canadian Rockies of British Colombia in 1909, and the revolutionary reinterpretation of the meaning of this Middle Cambrian ""explosion"" of life by the brilliant paleontologist Harry Whittington and his two equally brilliant students Derek Briggs and Simon Conway Morris is an inspiring one for scientists everywhere, and paleontologists in particular. Highly recommended."
198,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/748327-andrew-hudson,4,"For anyone in the dark, the Burgess Shale is one of the greatest fossil discoveries in palaeontological history. Uncovered in British Columbia by Charles Doolittle Walcott, one of America's most distinguished scientific minds, the Burgess Shale contained an astonishing diversity of forms - but most significantly, from a time at which no solid evidence for life had yet been found.Palaeontology had suffered from a critical absence in the fossil record. Dinosaurs, trilobites and many other extinct lifeforms had long been known of, of course, but while the hard body parts of dead creatures make for good fossilisation, the soft do not, tending to decay long before they can leave their mark. The sorry fact was that, prior to the Mid-Cambrian period (over five hundred million years ago), fossil evidence simply was not to be found. Whatever creatures had existed before the evolution of such hard structures as bone, chitin or shell, they had left no clue behind....until 1909. In the years that followed, C.D. Walcott collected nearly ninety thousand fossils, and though his time in the field was hampered by wide-ranging commitments as an administrator and leader of several of his country's most significant scientific bodies, he somehow found the time to study and report on his discovery as well. What he had found was nothing less than what the palaeontological community had longed for: evidence of simpler forms of life, early links in the chain that, over millions of years, would eventually produce fish and insects, amphibians and reptiles, birds, mammals and man.Or, do I hear you cry, DID he?Nearly sixty years after Walcott's discovery an Englishman named Harry Whittington, the world's leading expert on trilobites, began a process which would shine new light on a subject long considered as fact. With the help of a small group of allies they began to uncover details of the Burgess artefacts never before recognised; details which challenged Walcott's accepted wisdom regarding what his discoveries were; details which even called into question the basic nature of the evolutionary process itself.Whittington and his fellows proved with their efforts that, contrary to the traditional notion of simple creatures gradually improving over time, early evolution represented a chaotic period of sophisticated experimentation, with only blind chance in control of which forms of life would survive to define the future.Or, do I hear you cry, DID they?In Wonderful Life, Stephen J. Gould takes us on a remarkable journey. Setting the scene with an examination of our expectations in conventional evolutionary theory, we join him with Walcott on the Canadian slopes, then follow the various players as they reveal the unseen for the first time, or unveil it anew. He celebrates both the pioneer and the revolutionaries for, he claims, achievements to rank beside any undertaken by the more recognised ""hard"" sciences.He examines, with appropriate respect, how Walcott could make such a critical mistake regarding his subjects, how it was effectively impossible for him to conceive of an alternative to the notion of slow but inevitable ""upward"" development. In fact the revisionist work to come didn't utilise amazing breakthroughs of thought or technology. Nothing that was done in the 70s and 80s was beyond Walcott's technical capacities - but as a product of his time and place he was simply predisposed to see what he wanted or needed to see, so he did.Finally, after leading us through a fascinating and surprisingly accessible education in the field of ancient evolution, Gould demonstrates how these revelations about early life hang the probability of our own existence in a frighteningly - or, to another palate, thrillingly - slender thread.Or, do I hear you cry, DOES he?Because, not to put too fine a point on it, not everyone agrees with Gould's conclusions - even the visionaries he celebrates in the book. Subtitled The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History, Gould's overview of the re-examination of palaeontology's crown jewel begins as a heartfelt celebration of the scientific method and ends as, arguably, an overenthusiastic departure towards his belief in mankind's unlikeliness, and a variation on the standard evolutionary theory which is far from universally accepted. However, between and through these extremes, he treats us to an engaging, enthusiastic and entertaining experience, and it is for this that the book will continue to deserve a readership, even if some of his conclusions draw fire from various detractors as time marches on.It should not be assumed though that the book is closed on Gould's perspective, that He Was Wrong and That Is That. Ten minutes of layperson level browsing underlined for me that there remains debate; and while some of those lined up in opposition to Gould's claims are pretty big guns of the scientific world, even amongst them there is great respect for his writing - and that there can be disagreement and simultaneous support for his work is as interesting to me as his argument itself.It would be nice, reassuringly so, if every science writer, presenting and then interpreting evidence, could be shown to produce undeniable fact; to raise the bar for others to jump from, not at; but this isn't what science necessarily does. Science may be just a system of beliefs no different from any other, religious or not, and as such just as fallible - no, infinitely more so, as for science the facts may sometimes show the beliefs to be wrong.Subject to the righteous threat of constant revision, every theory may eventually come apart at the how it seems - but if great theories give rise to great books only for greater theories to take their turn, then it's a small price to pay to have such good things to read while we wait for the next in line. Gould would, I think, happily accept this form of progressive improvement over time, if no other."
199,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38010332-greta,5,"If you read the book recently, it is outdated. I do not really like Jay Gould as a scientist since he is kind of wordy and has peculiar theories, but that is not a matter of this book. If you judge the book as a picky evolutionary scientist, you will find lots of mistakes or outdated information. This is a book for non-scientists, although some concepts might be difficult to understand, I confess. Stephen success in trying to introduce us to the amazing world of early living forms that might be not as astonishing as dinosaurs, or some other popular fossils, but certainly these apparently insignificant arthropods were the beginning for everything in life, and most people do not even know they all existed and how important they were. I would recommend this book to science enthusiasts, geologists without a biology background, or freshman biology students, who might get the most of it."
200,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10404161-alex-shrugged,5,"This book is entrancing from the first to the last page. There is a short time, perhaps 3 or 4 pages where the narrative bogs down, but the rest is well paced, and fascinating.This is a book about the Burgess Shale in British Columbia and the scientific blunder of the century caused by a mind refusing to see what the fossils were telling him. This need to shoehorn the Burgess Shale ""oddballs"" into well-known groups was due to certain preconceptions that were strong at the time and remain a problem (though a lesser one) into the modern day.The narrative is presented as a drama in several acts because the story resembles a mystery slowly uncovered and ultimately changing the history of life.Dr. Walcott discovered the Burgess Shale in 1909. He was looking for evidence of the beginning of the Cambrian Explosion, the apparently sudden appearance of complex multi-cellular life. What he found was a treasure of fossils shortly after the event. (A few million years is considered ""shortly after"".) Since the generally accepted view of evolution is a leisurely improvement as species develop from the simple to the complex, finding complex fossils so early in natural history was disruptive to Darwin's Theory and had to be explained. In other words, if life was so complex during the Cambrian period then there should have been simpler species that came LONG before then in the Precambrian era. Yet these simpler precursors could not be found. An explanation was needed. The pressure to make these Burgess Shale ""oddballs"" fit into an ""acceptable"" scientific model of evolution was tremendous. Thus for decades the Burgess discoveries remained on the back shelves and in drawers, most unstudied and the few ""oddballs"" shoved quickly into known categories and forgotten.Decades later, Dr. Whittington decided to study the Burgess specimens, hoping to find some new type of trilobite. He believed that Dr. Walcott was generally correct, that somehow these specimens would fit into known groups. Yet, as he studied each specimen more closely, he realized that some of them represented an entirely new branch of the evolutionary tree. In fact, it wasn't a tree at all. It was more like an evolutionary bush.The book is actually about how our prejudices and even the diagrams and charts we use push us toward preconditioned conclusions. (FYI, the author does this himself in a few cases, minor but I noticed.) The author has convinced me that life on Earth (or at least intelligent life) is darn near impossible, except that here we are discussing it. He does accept as a given that some sort of life developing on Earth was inevitable, but the idea that Homo sapiens were destined to become the pinnacle of Creation or even the best that evolution had to offer is utterly ridiculous. From a probability and statistics point of view I am forced to agree with the author. I am a religious man, but I don't look to the Bible for my science lessons. The Jewish New Year has begun. As I recited my prayers I acknowledged that the new year is 5779 since the Creation. Do I really believe that? I know what the logic behind the number is, and I am willing to accord respect to the scholars who came up with that number. It was a good effort given the knowledge they had at the time and I stick with it out of that respect even though I write 2018 on my checks. Christians have come up with a different number. I assume they respect those Christians scholars of the past and write 2018 on their checks as well.During the time of Dr. Walcott, about 12 years before he discovered the Burgess Shale, Lord Kelvin estimated (in 1897) that the Earth was about 20-40 million years old. That was the accepted figure because no one (except Einstein in 1905 with E=mc2) could conceive of any other way that the Earth could stay warm long enough to develop life. Once they realized nuclear fusion in the Sun and radioactive decay on Earth could keep it warm, much longer estimates for the age of the Earth could be credibly entertained.I've had windy debates about evolution with folks. It seems that any deviation from Darwin's ""ironclad"" declarations are considered heresy. ""Burn the Witch!"" Oh... did I say that out loud? :-) Darwinists are those poor souls who follow Darwin's Theory on evolution as if it were holy writ. These people do science and the theory of evolution no good. What we need are adult conversations and reasoned debate. Not accusations nor insults. I think Darwin's Theory on evolution is a good first pass at the idea. The theory has some flaws that need work, but over all, it is good stuff... really good for a time when DNA was unknown and microscopes were very poor instruments. This is my second reading of the book. I promised a fellow I've been debating that I would read the book again and come back with some quotes to support my position on the age of the Earth and the improbability that life on Earth might come from another planet (say Mars) and then develop on Earth into life as we know it. This is called panspermia and while it is a logical idea, it is not a very probable idea. On the other hand, I don't think life developing as it did on Earth on its own is very probable either. That doesn't mean it didn't happen. I just like knocking around ideas. Don't read too much into it.Oh... and I forgot to mention... The ""F-Word"" is used once in this book as an actual quote from one of the scientists who suddenly realized he had found yet another Burgess ""oddball"" that didn't fit any known phyla. It seems juvenile to use such a direct quote in a book like this, but the book contains a few anachronisms that only make sense if you realize that it was written in the 1980's about events from the 1910's to the 1970's.

201,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16022816-chris-stratton,3,I am sure this is a great book among paleontologists. The detail of each species he documents and explains and the arguments for reclassifications must be a joy to someone in the field. I however was on a forced march to finish the book. I found the book interesting don’t get me wrong but much went beyond my knowledge of paleontology or biology for that matter. My takeaways? Beware of preconceived ideas! Oh and by the way knowing you are applying preconceived is really hard. Don’t be afraid of speaking up if the establishment believes one thing and you believe another especially if you can prove it. Finally... Humans are extremely lucky(?) to have arrived here at all.

This is true for the person(s) that discovered the Burgess Shale. Don't get me wrong, I really like reading anything by Gould. Sometimes his tangents into the personal lives of the scientists are a bit long winded. If this is for you, enjoy! I much prefer reading about the science than the people."

But Gould is persuasive, vibrant, and thorough. I didn't think I'd enjoy this book as much as I did.""Do you know they've found a fossil that has five eyes?""

Amazing the bountiful life exposed in the Burgess Shale site. Wonders of life active in a time before Homo Sapiens evolved.

Gould's political stance seldom agreed with mine, yet I've never doubted his intelligence or erudition. The book is twenty years old, and some of the content has been revised or disputed since; however, I learned a great deal about this pivotal period in the history of life. Gould's style is dense and ""wordy"" at times, and there was too much analysis of Walcott's persona and approach to his discoveries in the Burgess Shale, but it didn't detract too much from what is a genuinely fascinating read."

Gould is with the ""others,"" and proposes that contingency is an importamnt component of evolution. A fascinating story, with Gould's analysis at the forefront.

223,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1959519-max-maxwell,5,"To be clear, Wonderful Life is not a perfect book, but it is certainly an amazing book. It's pertinent to ask, ""Where does the book fall flat?""First, the middle section of the book, ""The Reconstruction of the Burgess Shale,"" is just a little bit too long. I mean exactly what I said; a few pages, say, 20 or so, after you've said, ""OK, I'm ready to get out of this murky details section and get on with the implications of it all,"" the section ends. As Gould points out, the section is, admittedly, important:Pleading is undignified, but allow me one line: please bear with the details; they are accessible, and they are the gateway to a new world.And bear with them you will, through about 200 pages of descriptions of, say, how the specimens of Opabinia or Hallucigenia were dissected, camera lucida diagrams, and repetitive descriptions of Harry Whittington's conservative temperament.The best parts of the book are the first, fourth, and fifth sections. The first, ""The Iconography of an Expectation,"" deals with the tendency amongst scientists and laypeople alike to see evolution as a linear process resulting in more and more complexity and always yielding intelligence. The fourth, ""Walcott's Vision and the Nature of History,"" tells of the myriad expectations that led the original discoverer and describer of the Burgess to make the fatal error of placing all the Burgess biota, most of which were completely new to science, in previously known categories, as ancestors of modern creatures. And the fifth, ""Possible Worlds,"" uses parts two and three (the ones with all the details) as a jumping board from which to explore the idea of punctuated equilibrium and its subsequent idea of contingency.Punctuated equilibrium is the idea that evolution is not a straight line of progress. Rather, evolution centers on mass extinctions such as the extinction that killed 96 or 97% of life on earth, including most of the Burgess organisms. Evolution only works in a straight line up until a really mass extinction, and then all bets are off. Natural selection is so tied to local environments that if the environment changes it can mean game over:Even if fishes hone their adaptations to peaks of aquatic perfection, they will all die if the ponds dry up. But grubby old Buster the Lungfish, former laughingstock of the piscine priesthood, may pull through... if we are Buster's legacy... how can we possibly view our mentality as inevitable, or even probable?One instantly thinks of polar bears doomed by global warming. Gould calls the element of history that relies on happenstance and massively improbable coincidence ""contingency,"" and he hammers its prevalence home with numerous examples—notably that the Burgess organism Pikaia was the earliest chordate, and its nonexistence would have erased us from history.My main objection to contingency is complicated, but in the spirit of this review, I might ask you to bear with my details. Steven Pinker, in his book 
The Blank Slate
, makes an excellent point:Sigmund Freud immodestly wrote that ""humanity has in the course of its time had to endure from the hands of science three great outrages upon its native self-love"": the discovery that our world is not the center of the celestial spheres but rather a speck in a vast universe, the discovery that we are not specially created but instead descended from the animals, and the discovery that often our conscious minds do not control how we act but merely tell us a story about our actions.Science does have a proud tradition of muckraking by demoting the status of humankind further and further, from Lord of Creation, created in God's image, to just another ape on another rock in another galaxy. To most people, this is insulting, even troubling; to those who understand, to those who find themselves, like Job, ""comforted that I am dust,"" it's humbling, and beautiful. But it does lead to a sort of playground-style fight over who among the sciences has demoted man furthest. Gould seems to be making a play here:As Freud observed, our relationship with science must be paradoxical because we are forced to pay an almost intolerable price for each major gain in knowledge and power—the psychological cost of progressive dethronement from the center of things, and increasing marginality in an uncaring universe.He's referencing Freud in order to tie in the concept with his view of contingency.Here's where things get neat: think about SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. SETI optimists, people who feel that it is likely that the universe is populated by intelligent life (myself included), base our assumption on a certain feel for evolution. Carl Sagan was a SETI optimist; he felt that evolution follows, if not a straight line, per se, a route to progress. If Gould is to be believed that (a) contingency is all-important in understanding evolution and (b) contingency is one of Freud's demotions, then Sagan's converse idea should be empowering to man, in the sense that it indicates that evolution must eventually result in something like us. And yet—here is Sagan in his book 
Pale Blue Dot
, titling a chapter ""The Great Demotions,"" and claiming among those demotions the notion that we may not be alone in the universe!The thing is that Gould is not the only supporter of punctuated equilibrium that upholds his ideas as those most demoralizing to mankind. Here's Michael Shermer in the Spring 2008 issue of Skeptic magazine:Historical experiment after experiment reveals the same answer: we are a fluke of nature, a quirk of evolution, a glorious contingency. It is tempting to... write yourself into the story as the central pattern in order to find purpose and meaning... But skeptical alarms should toll whenever anyone claims that science has discovered our deepest desires and oldest myths are true after all... a purpose-seeking animal will find itself as the purpose of nature.Shermer is responding to SETI optimism with a stone face. The point is that Shermer and Gould accuse SETI optimists of wishful thinking, without realizing that their notion so perfectly backs up the very teachings of the church: that we are alone and that we are the only intelligent life out there.—you see, the idea of SETI was once about where contingency is now. The idea of other people was very troubling to the religious; how could God send a saviour to two or more worlds? I'm not saying that contingency is a bad idea, and neither am I knocking punctuated equilibrium. I'm just saying it's not as much of a revelation as Gould thinks.I'm done complaining.—so, what did Gould get right?One of the major appeals of the book is his treatment of scientists as real, quirky people instead of arcane demigods; think the best parts of Bill Bryson's 
A Short History of Nearly Everything
 in more depth. Whittington, Briggs, Conway Morris, Walcott, and even Darwin come alive in these pages, in their words, if possible.He also presents the details with arresting scope and clarity. Sidebars throughout help the layman through arthropod terminology, and the book is lavishly illustrated throughout. Gould's prose is stellar—each punctuation mark and word is devastating. Some say that he rambles, but they're missing the point, because Gould's rambling is his charm. He conveys his passion like few other science writers manage to do.Finally, despite being 20 years old this year, the science in Wonderful Life is cutting-edge. After that long, there were bound to be some corrections: for example, Anomalocaris did not perish soon after the Shale's time; a relative named Schinderhannes survived until the Devonian, 100 million years after the Burgess. Furthermore, Anomalocaris and Opabinia are now considered lobopods, not their own distinct phylum. Hallucigenia walked on its ""tenticles,"" not on its spines, making it substantially less hallucinogenic than once imagined. These are trivialities, in my opinion; for every incorrect guess, Gould makes three that panned out, including correctly placing Aysheiea in the phylum Onychophora, at a time when it was in dispute as to what it was, and calling that the Burgess represented a world-wide fauna based on a few Chinese fossils, guessing that more would show up (in the 2000s, the Changjiang fauna did indeed show up, replete with complete anomalocarids and primitive chordata related to Pikaia, theretofore a single specimen).The facts are these: Wonderful Life makes you think. It's brilliantly written. And, at the end of the day, the creatures and fossils are just awesome. Paleo enthusiasts like me are all kids at heart, Gould being no exception at all."
224,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467405-ellen,3,"I read this book for research and primarily for Gould's argument, given throughout this book, that if one were to rewind the 'tape of life' then life as we know it would not emerge on the replay. Gould is clear in his opening chapter that he intends for this book to be both useful for students of the history of life on Earth and for the lay person interested in the same. With no formal scientific training beyond the age of 16, I am only qualified to assess the success of the latter intention, which I can do positively.That being said, however, Gould's quest for accessibility also leads him down some very odd tangents. In the name of illustrating some of his points he begins to almost rant about certain aspects of life and the academy. One notable example is a lengthy lament about the current (at least, current as of the book's writing in the summer of 1988) state of doctoral education on either side of the pond. Such passages read like a columnist giving their true opinions on aspects of the world around them and as a result seem a little fluffy. I found myself wondering on several occasions if the same kind of behaviour would have been tolerated by another author (one perhaps not as established as Gould was at the time of this book's publishing, or one from a different demographic, or indeed one writing just a few decades in the future). One particularly irksome example was of his use of the film It's A Wonderful Life.No doubt where Gould got the main title of his book from, the film gets no mention until over two thirds of the way through the book. Gould uses the film to illustrate the argument for which I came to this book in the first place - that if one were to rewind the 'tape of life' then life as we know it would not emerge on the replay. Gould's reasoning for this is based heavily on what is commonly understood as the butterfly effect (though Gould does not himself use this terminology). It is in an explanation of how the butterfly effect works that Gould references It's A Wonderful Life: the seemingly-insignificant-at-the-time events of George's life had massive knock-on effects to the point where the world would have been a very different place had he never been born. My problem with Gould's use of It's A Wonderful Life is twofold: it was too long, and it came too late in the book. Gould practically recounts the entire film to the reader when a few examples from the film would have had the desired effect. And the argument which Gould is attempting to illustrate has already been given throughout the book. By the time the reader reaches this illustration, they no longer need it.Gould's use of lengthy and tangential illustrations was irritating, but this book has a more egregious fault. I was reading this book at the same time I was reading Delores S. Williams' Sisters in the Wilderness, a book which - among other things - made me aware of some of the historical and scientific 'justifications' for racism. In particular, Williams made me aware of Louis Agassiz's affirmation and perpetuation of racist pseudoscience. Reading these two books in tandem made Agassiz's name in Wonderful Life stand out all the more. Gould references Agassiz twice in this book, but never mentions this dangerous and ugly side of his work; indeed, the only description Gould gives of Agassiz or his work is that he was ""America's greatest natural historian"" (p242). Granted, Williams' book was published four years after Gould's, but I would nevertheless caution the reader of this and other similar works to keep in mind the historiography of the field in a way which Gould does not.If one can tolerate the tangents and is thoughtful of the ugly history behind some of the discoveries which made this book, I think you can get a lot out of it. The scientific jargon is kept to a minimum and the writing style flows well. It provides a helpful history of the discovery and research of the fossils found in the Burgess Shale and what this work has meant for evolutionary science and current thinking of the history of life on Earth. I think this book is an apt reminder that even a book as worthwhile to the field as this one is does not - and should not - escape criticism, particularly in light of its own uncritical elements."
225,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57886276-owen-moorhead,2,"In the introduction to this book, Gould writes that he hoped to be an ""insider McPhee"" or something like that. Well Mr. Gould, I've read John McPhee; I know John McPhee's work--you sir, are no John McPhee.There are a few problems with this book that prevent it from succeeding (for me). For starters, there's the obvious one: Gould is too close to his subject matter. He seems to recognize this, but that self-awareness doesn't confer immunity to an understandable and natural tendency to forge boldly into the weeds. He is (probably) a much better stylist than most paleontologists, but that is not enough on its own to communicate such delicacies as the ramosity of a Burgess fossil's appendages. To Gould's credit, I think he recognizes this: he clearly felt the information needed a narrative and a theme to make for an interesting read to the lay reader.That brings me to another problem, namely the ideas with which Gould ties together the story of the Burgess fossils and their taxonomy. There are two images that recur continually throughout the book: rewinding tapes and a shoehorn. (Cones and trees also feature heavily.) They are invoked to illustrate two major themes of the book: the pernicious influence of ideology on scientific work and something about contingency. By the end of the book, I was starting to get annoyed with how frequently Gould resorts to these images.I won't say too much about Gould's thesis on ideology because I think it's well-argued and convincing. The contingency argument is more central and a bit confusing. It seems to go something like this: if you were to rewind the video tape of evolution or natural history or whatever, things would turn out differently. Let's leave aside the obvious problem with this image--namely, that no matter how many times you rewind a tape, it will always play the same way, plus or minus the marginal physical alterations that will take place through excessive rewinding.The main issue I have with this argument is I can't understand why Gould attaches so much importance to it. ""Things could have turned out differently than they did,"" he says. That seems to me a metaphysical question that may be trivial or unprovable, depending on your philosophical sympathies.But so what? That's the big question, which went unanswered throughout the book. If this had been a simple exposition of Burgess fauna, that wouldn't be a big deal. But Gould clearly thinks this assemblage proves something incredibly important about, I don't know, life, the universe, and everything. What exactly that is, I never did quite catch.The most eye-raising assertion of this book is that the Burgess Shale is the most important paleontological discovery of the century, and it is never really argued persuasively. That's the biggest failing of ""Wonderful Life"": it never convinced me of any of the lofty assertions Gould made at the outset.All that said, it wasn't terrible, and the writing really is pretty good, if occasionally pretentious."
226,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,5,"THis is a wonderful book, in all the senses of the word. The primary focus, the burgess fossils, are the stuff of science fiction - strange compilations of animal parts in strange configurations - so strange that science fiction could only take a lead from nature rather than anticipate it. For some reason, early life took some wild turns, many of which then failed to survive. If this book were only a catalog of these unusual beasts it would have been fascinating, but this is only the start.In part because of their strangeness, the second story - that of their discovery and rediscovery - adds to the interest: Initially discovered by Americas greatest paleontologist of the time, the real wonder of the fossils was missed. His analysis, biased by a preconceived notion of how things should be, didn't recognize the fact that many of these creatures did not fit modern categories. It took half a century before they were re-discovered and this time, recognized for the oddities that they really were. Why the first discovery missed, and the second did not, illustrates the all too human aspect to science which itself is often overlooked by preconceived notions of objectivity and dispassion. From these points Jay Gould presents his meta thesis regarding the almost heretical conclusion life's history tells: natural selection is not the only force guiding evolution. Somehow, and not just once, the 'progress' of life has been subject to freak events which have resulted in us humans. Our story, and all other life, is dependent or 'contingent' on these non-biological circumstances - we could as easily not be here. Thus at the third level, the book provides a sense of wonder, of amazement about our existence. Although he uses religious allusions with an abundance that probably leaves a Dawkins type shuddering, there is no supernatural conclusion inferred or implied, nor need there be. Whichever faith one has, I would hope that the wonder Jay Gould illicits is something all experience regarding the specialness of life. Finally, despite the heavy technical content, Jay Gould succeeds in conveying the story with scientific rigor which is also accessible to the uninitiated. Much 'popular science' is either dumbed down and over-punctuated (!), or not far enough removed from the home territory of journal publications. This then is the book's fourth wonder and the ultimate reason for my five star rating. "
227,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12305720-robert,5,"After visiting the Burgess Shale in August 2017, I decided to reread this book by SJ Gould, which I first read (and loved) sometime in the 1990s, shortly after it was published in 1989. Full disclosure, for years I used to devour Gould's This View of Life columns in Natural History magazine every month, and thoroughly enjoyed his books in the 1980s and 1990s, but haven't had the heart (or the stamina) to attempt his final and massive book (2002's The Structure of Evolutionary Theory). A brief foray into that tome made me realize that, at that late stage of his career, his writing style had become a bit too florid, his long and frequent asides too peripheral, and his tendency to show-off his obvious erudition had gotten a bit out of control. 1989's Wonderful Life, The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History, on the other hand, demonstrates Gould at his full powers. Wringing general principles out of specific geological, paleontological, or historical events, he brilliantly deconstructs iconic ideas (preconceptions?) in paleontology (e.g., increasing cone of diversity, gradualism, and adaptationist notions), offering in their place historical contingency, hierarchical levels of selection, and a ""neo-catastrophist"" approach to mass extinctions. It's true that the numerous quotations from Milton and Frost (no Gilbert and Sullivan, at least!), the ostentatious multilingualism, and the sometimes florid prose can seem to some readers a bit over the top, but these tendencies never take over in this book. The story he tells in this book about Walcott's discovery of the Burgess Shale high in the Canadian Rockies of British Colombia in 1909, and the revolutionary reinterpretation of the meaning of this Middle Cambrian ""explosion"" of life by the brilliant paleontologist Harry Whittington and his two equally brilliant students Derek Briggs and Simon Conway Morris is an inspiring one for scientists everywhere, and paleontologists in particular. Highly recommended."
228,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/748327-andrew-hudson,4,"For anyone in the dark, the Burgess Shale is one of the greatest fossil discoveries in palaeontological history. Uncovered in British Columbia by Charles Doolittle Walcott, one of America's most distinguished scientific minds, the Burgess Shale contained an astonishing diversity of forms - but most significantly, from a time at which no solid evidence for life had yet been found.Palaeontology had suffered from a critical absence in the fossil record. Dinosaurs, trilobites and many other extinct lifeforms had long been known of, of course, but while the hard body parts of dead creatures make for good fossilisation, the soft do not, tending to decay long before they can leave their mark. The sorry fact was that, prior to the Mid-Cambrian period (over five hundred million years ago), fossil evidence simply was not to be found. Whatever creatures had existed before the evolution of such hard structures as bone, chitin or shell, they had left no clue behind....until 1909. In the years that followed, C.D. Walcott collected nearly ninety thousand fossils, and though his time in the field was hampered by wide-ranging commitments as an administrator and leader of several of his country's most significant scientific bodies, he somehow found the time to study and report on his discovery as well. What he had found was nothing less than what the palaeontological community had longed for: evidence of simpler forms of life, early links in the chain that, over millions of years, would eventually produce fish and insects, amphibians and reptiles, birds, mammals and man.Or, do I hear you cry, DID he?Nearly sixty years after Walcott's discovery an Englishman named Harry Whittington, the world's leading expert on trilobites, began a process which would shine new light on a subject long considered as fact. With the help of a small group of allies they began to uncover details of the Burgess artefacts never before recognised; details which challenged Walcott's accepted wisdom regarding what his discoveries were; details which even called into question the basic nature of the evolutionary process itself.Whittington and his fellows proved with their efforts that, contrary to the traditional notion of simple creatures gradually improving over time, early evolution represented a chaotic period of sophisticated experimentation, with only blind chance in control of which forms of life would survive to define the future.Or, do I hear you cry, DID they?In Wonderful Life, Stephen J. Gould takes us on a remarkable journey. Setting the scene with an examination of our expectations in conventional evolutionary theory, we join him with Walcott on the Canadian slopes, then follow the various players as they reveal the unseen for the first time, or unveil it anew. He celebrates both the pioneer and the revolutionaries for, he claims, achievements to rank beside any undertaken by the more recognised ""hard"" sciences.He examines, with appropriate respect, how Walcott could make such a critical mistake regarding his subjects, how it was effectively impossible for him to conceive of an alternative to the notion of slow but inevitable ""upward"" development. In fact the revisionist work to come didn't utilise amazing breakthroughs of thought or technology. Nothing that was done in the 70s and 80s was beyond Walcott's technical capacities - but as a product of his time and place he was simply predisposed to see what he wanted or needed to see, so he did.Finally, after leading us through a fascinating and surprisingly accessible education in the field of ancient evolution, Gould demonstrates how these revelations about early life hang the probability of our own existence in a frighteningly - or, to another palate, thrillingly - slender thread.Or, do I hear you cry, DOES he?Because, not to put too fine a point on it, not everyone agrees with Gould's conclusions - even the visionaries he celebrates in the book. Subtitled The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History, Gould's overview of the re-examination of palaeontology's crown jewel begins as a heartfelt celebration of the scientific method and ends as, arguably, an overenthusiastic departure towards his belief in mankind's unlikeliness, and a variation on the standard evolutionary theory which is far from universally accepted. However, between and through these extremes, he treats us to an engaging, enthusiastic and entertaining experience, and it is for this that the book will continue to deserve a readership, even if some of his conclusions draw fire from various detractors as time marches on.It should not be assumed though that the book is closed on Gould's perspective, that He Was Wrong and That Is That. Ten minutes of layperson level browsing underlined for me that there remains debate; and while some of those lined up in opposition to Gould's claims are pretty big guns of the scientific world, even amongst them there is great respect for his writing - and that there can be disagreement and simultaneous support for his work is as interesting to me as his argument itself.It would be nice, reassuringly so, if every science writer, presenting and then interpreting evidence, could be shown to produce undeniable fact; to raise the bar for others to jump from, not at; but this isn't what science necessarily does. Science may be just a system of beliefs no different from any other, religious or not, and as such just as fallible - no, infinitely more so, as for science the facts may sometimes show the beliefs to be wrong.Subject to the righteous threat of constant revision, every theory may eventually come apart at the how it seems - but if great theories give rise to great books only for greater theories to take their turn, then it's a small price to pay to have such good things to read while we wait for the next in line. Gould would, I think, happily accept this form of progressive improvement over time, if no other."

I do not really like Jay Gould as a scientist since he is kind of wordy and has peculiar theories, but that is not a matter of this book. If you judge the book as a picky evolutionary scientist, you will find lots of mistakes or outdated information. This is a book for non-scientists, although some concepts might be difficult to understand, I confess. Stephen success in trying to introduce us to the amazing world of early living forms that might be not as astonishing as dinosaurs, or some other popular fossils, but certainly these apparently insignificant arthropods were the beginning for everything in life, and most people do not even know they all existed and how important they were. I would recommend this book to science enthusiasts, geologists without a biology background, or freshman biology students, who might get the most of it."
230,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10404161-alex-shrugged,5,"This book is entrancing from the first to the last page. There is a short time, perhaps 3 or 4 pages where the narrative bogs down, but the rest is well paced, and fascinating.This is a book about the Burgess Shale in British Columbia and the scientific blunder of the century caused by a mind refusing to see what the fossils were telling him. This need to shoehorn the Burgess Shale ""oddballs"" into well-known groups was due to certain preconceptions that were strong at the time and remain a problem (though a lesser one) into the modern day.The narrative is presented as a drama in several acts because the story resembles a mystery slowly uncovered and ultimately changing the history of life.Dr. Walcott discovered the Burgess Shale in 1909. He was looking for evidence of the beginning of the Cambrian Explosion, the apparently sudden appearance of complex multi-cellular life. What he found was a treasure of fossils shortly after the event. (A few million years is considered ""shortly after"".) Since the generally accepted view of evolution is a leisurely improvement as species develop from the simple to the complex, finding complex fossils so early in natural history was disruptive to Darwin's Theory and had to be explained. In other words, if life was so complex during the Cambrian period then there should have been simpler species that came LONG before then in the Precambrian era. Yet these simpler precursors could not be found. An explanation was needed. The pressure to make these Burgess Shale ""oddballs"" fit into an ""acceptable"" scientific model of evolution was tremendous. Thus for decades the Burgess discoveries remained on the back shelves and in drawers, most unstudied and the few ""oddballs"" shoved quickly into known categories and forgotten.Decades later, Dr. Whittington decided to study the Burgess specimens, hoping to find some new type of trilobite. He believed that Dr. Walcott was generally correct, that somehow these specimens would fit into known groups. Yet, as he studied each specimen more closely, he realized that some of them represented an entirely new branch of the evolutionary tree. In fact, it wasn't a tree at all. It was more like an evolutionary bush.The book is actually about how our prejudices and even the diagrams and charts we use push us toward preconditioned conclusions. (FYI, the author does this himself in a few cases, minor but I noticed.) The author has convinced me that life on Earth (or at least intelligent life) is darn near impossible, except that here we are discussing it. He does accept as a given that some sort of life developing on Earth was inevitable, but the idea that Homo sapiens were destined to become the pinnacle of Creation or even the best that evolution had to offer is utterly ridiculous. From a probability and statistics point of view I am forced to agree with the author. I am a religious man, but I don't look to the Bible for my science lessons. The Jewish New Year has begun. As I recited my prayers I acknowledged that the new year is 5779 since the Creation. Do I really believe that? I know what the logic behind the number is, and I am willing to accord respect to the scholars who came up with that number. It was a good effort given the knowledge they had at the time and I stick with it out of that respect even though I write 2018 on my checks. Christians have come up with a different number. I assume they respect those Christians scholars of the past and write 2018 on their checks as well.During the time of Dr. Walcott, about 12 years before he discovered the Burgess Shale, Lord Kelvin estimated (in 1897) that the Earth was about 20-40 million years old. That was the accepted figure because no one (except Einstein in 1905 with E=mc2) could conceive of any other way that the Earth could stay warm long enough to develop life. Once they realized nuclear fusion in the Sun and radioactive decay on Earth could keep it warm, much longer estimates for the age of the Earth could be credibly entertained.I've had windy debates about evolution with folks. It seems that any deviation from Darwin's ""ironclad"" declarations are considered heresy. ""Burn the Witch!"" Oh... did I say that out loud? :-) Darwinists are those poor souls who follow Darwin's Theory on evolution as if it were holy writ. These people do science and the theory of evolution no good. What we need are adult conversations and reasoned debate. Not accusations nor insults. I think Darwin's Theory on evolution is a good first pass at the idea. The theory has some flaws that need work, but over all, it is good stuff... really good for a time when DNA was unknown and microscopes were very poor instruments. This is my second reading of the book. I promised a fellow I've been debating that I would read the book again and come back with some quotes to support my position on the age of the Earth and the improbability that life on Earth might come from another planet (say Mars) and then develop on Earth into life as we know it. This is called panspermia and while it is a logical idea, it is not a very probable idea. On the other hand, I don't think life developing as it did on Earth on its own is very probable either. That doesn't mean it didn't happen. I just like knocking around ideas. Don't read too much into it.Oh... and I forgot to mention... The ""F-Word"" is used once in this book as an actual quote from one of the scientists who suddenly realized he had found yet another Burgess ""oddball"" that didn't fit any known phyla. It seems juvenile to use such a direct quote in a book like this, but the book contains a few anachronisms that only make sense if you realize that it was written in the 1980's about events from the 1910's to the 1970's.

231,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16022816-chris-stratton,3,I am sure this is a great book among paleontologists. The detail of each species he documents and explains and the arguments for reclassifications must be a joy to someone in the field. I however was on a forced march to finish the book. I found the book interesting don’t get me wrong but much went beyond my knowledge of paleontology or biology for that matter. My takeaways? Beware of preconceived ideas! Oh and by the way knowing you are applying preconceived is really hard. Don’t be afraid of speaking up if the establishment believes one thing and you believe another especially if you can prove it.

The book is twenty years old, and some of the content has been revised or disputed since; however, I learned a great deal about this pivotal period in the history of life. Gould's style is dense and ""wordy"" at times, and there was too much analysis of Walcott's persona and approach to his discoveries in the Burgess Shale, but it didn't detract too much from what is a genuinely fascinating read."

Gould is with the ""others,"" and proposes that contingency is an importamnt component of evolution. A fascinating story, with Gould's analysis at the forefront.

253,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1959519-max-maxwell,5,"To be clear, Wonderful Life is not a perfect book, but it is certainly an amazing book. It's pertinent to ask, ""Where does the book fall flat?""First, the middle section of the book, ""The Reconstruction of the Burgess Shale,"" is just a little bit too long. I mean exactly what I said; a few pages, say, 20 or so, after you've said, ""OK, I'm ready to get out of this murky details section and get on with the implications of it all,"" the section ends. As Gould points out, the section is, admittedly, important:Pleading is undignified, but allow me one line: please bear with the details; they are accessible, and they are the gateway to a new world.And bear with them you will, through about 200 pages of descriptions of, say, how the specimens of Opabinia or Hallucigenia were dissected, camera lucida diagrams, and repetitive descriptions of Harry Whittington's conservative temperament.The best parts of the book are the first, fourth, and fifth sections. The first, ""The Iconography of an Expectation,"" deals with the tendency amongst scientists and laypeople alike to see evolution as a linear process resulting in more and more complexity and always yielding intelligence. The fourth, ""Walcott's Vision and the Nature of History,"" tells of the myriad expectations that led the original discoverer and describer of the Burgess to make the fatal error of placing all the Burgess biota, most of which were completely new to science, in previously known categories, as ancestors of modern creatures. And the fifth, ""Possible Worlds,"" uses parts two and three (the ones with all the details) as a jumping board from which to explore the idea of punctuated equilibrium and its subsequent idea of contingency.Punctuated equilibrium is the idea that evolution is not a straight line of progress. Rather, evolution centers on mass extinctions such as the extinction that killed 96 or 97% of life on earth, including most of the Burgess organisms. Evolution only works in a straight line up until a really mass extinction, and then all bets are off. Natural selection is so tied to local environments that if the environment changes it can mean game over:Even if fishes hone their adaptations to peaks of aquatic perfection, they will all die if the ponds dry up. But grubby old Buster the Lungfish, former laughingstock of the piscine priesthood, may pull through... if we are Buster's legacy... how can we possibly view our mentality as inevitable, or even probable?One instantly thinks of polar bears doomed by global warming. Gould calls the element of history that relies on happenstance and massively improbable coincidence ""contingency,"" and he hammers its prevalence home with numerous examples—notably that the Burgess organism Pikaia was the earliest chordate, and its nonexistence would have erased us from history.My main objection to contingency is complicated, but in the spirit of this review, I might ask you to bear with my details. Steven Pinker, in his book 
The Blank Slate
, makes an excellent point:Sigmund Freud immodestly wrote that ""humanity has in the course of its time had to endure from the hands of science three great outrages upon its native self-love"": the discovery that our world is not the center of the celestial spheres but rather a speck in a vast universe, the discovery that we are not specially created but instead descended from the animals, and the discovery that often our conscious minds do not control how we act but merely tell us a story about our actions.Science does have a proud tradition of muckraking by demoting the status of humankind further and further, from Lord of Creation, created in God's image, to just another ape on another rock in another galaxy. To most people, this is insulting, even troubling; to those who understand, to those who find themselves, like Job, ""comforted that I am dust,"" it's humbling, and beautiful. But it does lead to a sort of playground-style fight over who among the sciences has demoted man furthest. Gould seems to be making a play here:As Freud observed, our relationship with science must be paradoxical because we are forced to pay an almost intolerable price for each major gain in knowledge and power—the psychological cost of progressive dethronement from the center of things, and increasing marginality in an uncaring universe.He's referencing Freud in order to tie in the concept with his view of contingency.Here's where things get neat: think about SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. SETI optimists, people who feel that it is likely that the universe is populated by intelligent life (myself included), base our assumption on a certain feel for evolution. Carl Sagan was a SETI optimist; he felt that evolution follows, if not a straight line, per se, a route to progress. If Gould is to be believed that (a) contingency is all-important in understanding evolution and (b) contingency is one of Freud's demotions, then Sagan's converse idea should be empowering to man, in the sense that it indicates that evolution must eventually result in something like us. And yet—here is Sagan in his book 
Pale Blue Dot
, titling a chapter ""The Great Demotions,"" and claiming among those demotions the notion that we may not be alone in the universe!The thing is that Gould is not the only supporter of punctuated equilibrium that upholds his ideas as those most demoralizing to mankind. Here's Michael Shermer in the Spring 2008 issue of Skeptic magazine:Historical experiment after experiment reveals the same answer: we are a fluke of nature, a quirk of evolution, a glorious contingency. It is tempting to... write yourself into the story as the central pattern in order to find purpose and meaning... But skeptical alarms should toll whenever anyone claims that science has discovered our deepest desires and oldest myths are true after all... a purpose-seeking animal will find itself as the purpose of nature.Shermer is responding to SETI optimism with a stone face. The point is that Shermer and Gould accuse SETI optimists of wishful thinking, without realizing that their notion so perfectly backs up the very teachings of the church: that we are alone and that we are the only intelligent life out there.—you see, the idea of SETI was once about where contingency is now. The idea of other people was very troubling to the religious; how could God send a saviour to two or more worlds? I'm not saying that contingency is a bad idea, and neither am I knocking punctuated equilibrium. I'm just saying it's not as much of a revelation as Gould thinks.I'm done complaining.—so, what did Gould get right?One of the major appeals of the book is his treatment of scientists as real, quirky people instead of arcane demigods; think the best parts of Bill Bryson's 
A Short History of Nearly Everything
 in more depth. Whittington, Briggs, Conway Morris, Walcott, and even Darwin come alive in these pages, in their words, if possible.He also presents the details with arresting scope and clarity. Sidebars throughout help the layman through arthropod terminology, and the book is lavishly illustrated throughout. Gould's prose is stellar—each punctuation mark and word is devastating. Some say that he rambles, but they're missing the point, because Gould's rambling is his charm. He conveys his passion like few other science writers manage to do.Finally, despite being 20 years old this year, the science in Wonderful Life is cutting-edge. After that long, there were bound to be some corrections: for example, Anomalocaris did not perish soon after the Shale's time; a relative named Schinderhannes survived until the Devonian, 100 million years after the Burgess. Furthermore, Anomalocaris and Opabinia are now considered lobopods, not their own distinct phylum. Hallucigenia walked on its ""tenticles,"" not on its spines, making it substantially less hallucinogenic than once imagined. These are trivialities, in my opinion; for every incorrect guess, Gould makes three that panned out, including correctly placing Aysheiea in the phylum Onychophora, at a time when it was in dispute as to what it was, and calling that the Burgess represented a world-wide fauna based on a few Chinese fossils, guessing that more would show up (in the 2000s, the Changjiang fauna did indeed show up, replete with complete anomalocarids and primitive chordata related to Pikaia, theretofore a single specimen).The facts are these: Wonderful Life makes you think. It's brilliantly written. And, at the end of the day, the creatures and fossils are just awesome. Paleo enthusiasts like me are all kids at heart, Gould being no exception at all."
254,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467405-ellen,3,"I read this book for research and primarily for Gould's argument, given throughout this book, that if one were to rewind the 'tape of life' then life as we know it would not emerge on the replay. Gould is clear in his opening chapter that he intends for this book to be both useful for students of the history of life on Earth and for the lay person interested in the same. With no formal scientific training beyond the age of 16, I am only qualified to assess the success of the latter intention, which I can do positively.That being said, however, Gould's quest for accessibility also leads him down some very odd tangents. In the name of illustrating some of his points he begins to almost rant about certain aspects of life and the academy. One notable example is a lengthy lament about the current (at least, current as of the book's writing in the summer of 1988) state of doctoral education on either side of the pond. Such passages read like a columnist giving their true opinions on aspects of the world around them and as a result seem a little fluffy. I found myself wondering on several occasions if the same kind of behaviour would have been tolerated by another author (one perhaps not as established as Gould was at the time of this book's publishing, or one from a different demographic, or indeed one writing just a few decades in the future). One particularly irksome example was of his use of the film It's A Wonderful Life.No doubt where Gould got the main title of his book from, the film gets no mention until over two thirds of the way through the book. Gould uses the film to illustrate the argument for which I came to this book in the first place - that if one were to rewind the 'tape of life' then life as we know it would not emerge on the replay. Gould's reasoning for this is based heavily on what is commonly understood as the butterfly effect (though Gould does not himself use this terminology). It is in an explanation of how the butterfly effect works that Gould references It's A Wonderful Life: the seemingly-insignificant-at-the-time events of George's life had massive knock-on effects to the point where the world would have been a very different place had he never been born. My problem with Gould's use of It's A Wonderful Life is twofold: it was too long, and it came too late in the book. Gould practically recounts the entire film to the reader when a few examples from the film would have had the desired effect. And the argument which Gould is attempting to illustrate has already been given throughout the book. By the time the reader reaches this illustration, they no longer need it.Gould's use of lengthy and tangential illustrations was irritating, but this book has a more egregious fault. I was reading this book at the same time I was reading Delores S. Williams' Sisters in the Wilderness, a book which - among other things - made me aware of some of the historical and scientific 'justifications' for racism. In particular, Williams made me aware of Louis Agassiz's affirmation and perpetuation of racist pseudoscience. Reading these two books in tandem made Agassiz's name in Wonderful Life stand out all the more. Gould references Agassiz twice in this book, but never mentions this dangerous and ugly side of his work; indeed, the only description Gould gives of Agassiz or his work is that he was ""America's greatest natural historian"" (p242). Granted, Williams' book was published four years after Gould's, but I would nevertheless caution the reader of this and other similar works to keep in mind the historiography of the field in a way which Gould does not.If one can tolerate the tangents and is thoughtful of the ugly history behind some of the discoveries which made this book, I think you can get a lot out of it. The scientific jargon is kept to a minimum and the writing style flows well. It provides a helpful history of the discovery and research of the fossils found in the Burgess Shale and what this work has meant for evolutionary science and current thinking of the history of life on Earth. I think this book is an apt reminder that even a book as worthwhile to the field as this one is does not - and should not - escape criticism, particularly in light of its own uncritical elements."
255,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57886276-owen-moorhead,2,"In the introduction to this book, Gould writes that he hoped to be an ""insider McPhee"" or something like that. Well Mr. Gould, I've read John McPhee; I know John McPhee's work--you sir, are no John McPhee.There are a few problems with this book that prevent it from succeeding (for me). For starters, there's the obvious one: Gould is too close to his subject matter. He seems to recognize this, but that self-awareness doesn't confer immunity to an understandable and natural tendency to forge boldly into the weeds. He is (probably) a much better stylist than most paleontologists, but that is not enough on its own to communicate such delicacies as the ramosity of a Burgess fossil's appendages. To Gould's credit, I think he recognizes this: he clearly felt the information needed a narrative and a theme to make for an interesting read to the lay reader.That brings me to another problem, namely the ideas with which Gould ties together the story of the Burgess fossils and their taxonomy. There are two images that recur continually throughout the book: rewinding tapes and a shoehorn. (Cones and trees also feature heavily.) They are invoked to illustrate two major themes of the book: the pernicious influence of ideology on scientific work and something about contingency. By the end of the book, I was starting to get annoyed with how frequently Gould resorts to these images.I won't say too much about Gould's thesis on ideology because I think it's well-argued and convincing. The contingency argument is more central and a bit confusing. It seems to go something like this: if you were to rewind the video tape of evolution or natural history or whatever, things would turn out differently. Let's leave aside the obvious problem with this image--namely, that no matter how many times you rewind a tape, it will always play the same way, plus or minus the marginal physical alterations that will take place through excessive rewinding.The main issue I have with this argument is I can't understand why Gould attaches so much importance to it. ""Things could have turned out differently than they did,"" he says. That seems to me a metaphysical question that may be trivial or unprovable, depending on your philosophical sympathies.But so what? That's the big question, which went unanswered throughout the book. If this had been a simple exposition of Burgess fauna, that wouldn't be a big deal. But Gould clearly thinks this assemblage proves something incredibly important about, I don't know, life, the universe, and everything. What exactly that is, I never did quite catch.The most eye-raising assertion of this book is that the Burgess Shale is the most important paleontological discovery of the century, and it is never really argued persuasively. That's the biggest failing of ""Wonderful Life"": it never convinced me of any of the lofty assertions Gould made at the outset.All that said, it wasn't terrible, and the writing really is pretty good, if occasionally pretentious."
256,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,5,"THis is a wonderful book, in all the senses of the word. The primary focus, the burgess fossils, are the stuff of science fiction - strange compilations of animal parts in strange configurations - so strange that science fiction could only take a lead from nature rather than anticipate it. For some reason, early life took some wild turns, many of which then failed to survive. If this book were only a catalog of these unusual beasts it would have been fascinating, but this is only the start.In part because of their strangeness, the second story - that of their discovery and rediscovery - adds to the interest: Initially discovered by Americas greatest paleontologist of the time, the real wonder of the fossils was missed. His analysis, biased by a preconceived notion of how things should be, didn't recognize the fact that many of these creatures did not fit modern categories. It took half a century before they were re-discovered and this time, recognized for the oddities that they really were. Why the first discovery missed, and the second did not, illustrates the all too human aspect to science which itself is often overlooked by preconceived notions of objectivity and dispassion. From these points Jay Gould presents his meta thesis regarding the almost heretical conclusion life's history tells: natural selection is not the only force guiding evolution. Somehow, and not just once, the 'progress' of life has been subject to freak events which have resulted in us humans. Our story, and all other life, is dependent or 'contingent' on these non-biological circumstances - we could as easily not be here. Thus at the third level, the book provides a sense of wonder, of amazement about our existence. Although he uses religious allusions with an abundance that probably leaves a Dawkins type shuddering, there is no supernatural conclusion inferred or implied, nor need there be. Whichever faith one has, I would hope that the wonder Jay Gould illicits is something all experience regarding the specialness of life. Finally, despite the heavy technical content, Jay Gould succeeds in conveying the story with scientific rigor which is also accessible to the uninitiated. Much 'popular science' is either dumbed down and over-punctuated (!), or not far enough removed from the home territory of journal publications. This then is the book's fourth wonder and the ultimate reason for my five star rating. "
257,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12305720-robert,5,"After visiting the Burgess Shale in August 2017, I decided to reread this book by SJ Gould, which I first read (and loved) sometime in the 1990s, shortly after it was published in 1989. Full disclosure, for years I used to devour Gould's This View of Life columns in Natural History magazine every month, and thoroughly enjoyed his books in the 1980s and 1990s, but haven't had the heart (or the stamina) to attempt his final and massive book (2002's The Structure of Evolutionary Theory). A brief foray into that tome made me realize that, at that late stage of his career, his writing style had become a bit too florid, his long and frequent asides too peripheral, and his tendency to show-off his obvious erudition had gotten a bit out of control. 1989's Wonderful Life, The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History, on the other hand, demonstrates Gould at his full powers. Wringing general principles out of specific geological, paleontological, or historical events, he brilliantly deconstructs iconic ideas (preconceptions?) in paleontology (e.g., increasing cone of diversity, gradualism, and adaptationist notions), offering in their place historical contingency, hierarchical levels of selection, and a ""neo-catastrophist"" approach to mass extinctions. It's true that the numerous quotations from Milton and Frost (no Gilbert and Sullivan, at least!), the ostentatious multilingualism, and the sometimes florid prose can seem to some readers a bit over the top, but these tendencies never take over in this book. The story he tells in this book about Walcott's discovery of the Burgess Shale high in the Canadian Rockies of British Colombia in 1909, and the revolutionary reinterpretation of the meaning of this Middle Cambrian ""explosion"" of life by the brilliant paleontologist Harry Whittington and his two equally brilliant students Derek Briggs and Simon Conway Morris is an inspiring one for scientists everywhere, and paleontologists in particular. Highly recommended."
258,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/748327-andrew-hudson,4,"For anyone in the dark, the Burgess Shale is one of the greatest fossil discoveries in palaeontological history. Uncovered in British Columbia by Charles Doolittle Walcott, one of America's most distinguished scientific minds, the Burgess Shale contained an astonishing diversity of forms - but most significantly, from a time at which no solid evidence for life had yet been found.Palaeontology had suffered from a critical absence in the fossil record. Dinosaurs, trilobites and many other extinct lifeforms had long been known of, of course, but while the hard body parts of dead creatures make for good fossilisation, the soft do not, tending to decay long before they can leave their mark. The sorry fact was that, prior to the Mid-Cambrian period (over five hundred million years ago), fossil evidence simply was not to be found. Whatever creatures had existed before the evolution of such hard structures as bone, chitin or shell, they had left no clue behind....until 1909. In the years that followed, C.D. Walcott collected nearly ninety thousand fossils, and though his time in the field was hampered by wide-ranging commitments as an administrator and leader of several of his country's most significant scientific bodies, he somehow found the time to study and report on his discovery as well. What he had found was nothing less than what the palaeontological community had longed for: evidence of simpler forms of life, early links in the chain that, over millions of years, would eventually produce fish and insects, amphibians and reptiles, birds, mammals and man.Or, do I hear you cry, DID he?Nearly sixty years after Walcott's discovery an Englishman named Harry Whittington, the world's leading expert on trilobites, began a process which would shine new light on a subject long considered as fact. With the help of a small group of allies they began to uncover details of the Burgess artefacts never before recognised; details which challenged Walcott's accepted wisdom regarding what his discoveries were; details which even called into question the basic nature of the evolutionary process itself.Whittington and his fellows proved with their efforts that, contrary to the traditional notion of simple creatures gradually improving over time, early evolution represented a chaotic period of sophisticated experimentation, with only blind chance in control of which forms of life would survive to define the future.Or, do I hear you cry, DID they?In Wonderful Life, Stephen J. Gould takes us on a remarkable journey. Setting the scene with an examination of our expectations in conventional evolutionary theory, we join him with Walcott on the Canadian slopes, then follow the various players as they reveal the unseen for the first time, or unveil it anew. He celebrates both the pioneer and the revolutionaries for, he claims, achievements to rank beside any undertaken by the more recognised ""hard"" sciences.He examines, with appropriate respect, how Walcott could make such a critical mistake regarding his subjects, how it was effectively impossible for him to conceive of an alternative to the notion of slow but inevitable ""upward"" development. In fact the revisionist work to come didn't utilise amazing breakthroughs of thought or technology. Nothing that was done in the 70s and 80s was beyond Walcott's technical capacities - but as a product of his time and place he was simply predisposed to see what he wanted or needed to see, so he did.Finally, after leading us through a fascinating and surprisingly accessible education in the field of ancient evolution, Gould demonstrates how these revelations about early life hang the probability of our own existence in a frighteningly - or, to another palate, thrillingly - slender thread.Or, do I hear you cry, DOES he?Because, not to put too fine a point on it, not everyone agrees with Gould's conclusions - even the visionaries he celebrates in the book. Subtitled The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History, Gould's overview of the re-examination of palaeontology's crown jewel begins as a heartfelt celebration of the scientific method and ends as, arguably, an overenthusiastic departure towards his belief in mankind's unlikeliness, and a variation on the standard evolutionary theory which is far from universally accepted. However, between and through these extremes, he treats us to an engaging, enthusiastic and entertaining experience, and it is for this that the book will continue to deserve a readership, even if some of his conclusions draw fire from various detractors as time marches on.It should not be assumed though that the book is closed on Gould's perspective, that He Was Wrong and That Is That. Ten minutes of layperson level browsing underlined for me that there remains debate; and while some of those lined up in opposition to Gould's claims are pretty big guns of the scientific world, even amongst them there is great respect for his writing - and that there can be disagreement and simultaneous support for his work is as interesting to me as his argument itself.It would be nice, reassuringly so, if every science writer, presenting and then interpreting evidence, could be shown to produce undeniable fact; to raise the bar for others to jump from, not at; but this isn't what science necessarily does. Science may be just a system of beliefs no different from any other, religious or not, and as such just as fallible - no, infinitely more so, as for science the facts may sometimes show the beliefs to be wrong.Subject to the righteous threat of constant revision, every theory may eventually come apart at the how it seems - but if great theories give rise to great books only for greater theories to take their turn, then it's a small price to pay to have such good things to read while we wait for the next in line. Gould would, I think, happily accept this form of progressive improvement over time, if no other."
259,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38010332-greta,5,"If you read the book recently, it is outdated. I do not really like Jay Gould as a scientist since he is kind of wordy and has peculiar theories, but that is not a matter of this book. If you judge the book as a picky evolutionary scientist, you will find lots of mistakes or outdated information. This is a book for non-scientists, although some concepts might be difficult to understand, I confess. Stephen success in trying to introduce us to the amazing world of early living forms that might be not as astonishing as dinosaurs, or some other popular fossils, but certainly these apparently insignificant arthropods were the beginning for everything in life, and most people do not even know they all existed and how important they were. I would recommend this book to science enthusiasts, geologists without a biology background, or freshman biology students, who might get the most of it."
260,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10404161-alex-shrugged,5,"This book is entrancing from the first to the last page. There is a short time, perhaps 3 or 4 pages where the narrative bogs down, but the rest is well paced, and fascinating.This is a book about the Burgess Shale in British Columbia and the scientific blunder of the century caused by a mind refusing to see what the fossils were telling him. This need to shoehorn the Burgess Shale ""oddballs"" into well-known groups was due to certain preconceptions that were strong at the time and remain a problem (though a lesser one) into the modern day.The narrative is presented as a drama in several acts because the story resembles a mystery slowly uncovered and ultimately changing the history of life.Dr. Walcott discovered the Burgess Shale in 1909. He was looking for evidence of the beginning of the Cambrian Explosion, the apparently sudden appearance of complex multi-cellular life. What he found was a treasure of fossils shortly after the event. (A few million years is considered ""shortly after"".) Since the generally accepted view of evolution is a leisurely improvement as species develop from the simple to the complex, finding complex fossils so early in natural history was disruptive to Darwin's Theory and had to be explained. In other words, if life was so complex during the Cambrian period then there should have been simpler species that came LONG before then in the Precambrian era. Yet these simpler precursors could not be found. An explanation was needed. The pressure to make these Burgess Shale ""oddballs"" fit into an ""acceptable"" scientific model of evolution was tremendous. Thus for decades the Burgess discoveries remained on the back shelves and in drawers, most unstudied and the few ""oddballs"" shoved quickly into known categories and forgotten.Decades later, Dr. Whittington decided to study the Burgess specimens, hoping to find some new type of trilobite. He believed that Dr. Walcott was generally correct, that somehow these specimens would fit into known groups. Yet, as he studied each specimen more closely, he realized that some of them represented an entirely new branch of the evolutionary tree. In fact, it wasn't a tree at all. It was more like an evolutionary bush.The book is actually about how our prejudices and even the diagrams and charts we use push us toward preconditioned conclusions. (FYI, the author does this himself in a few cases, minor but I noticed.) The author has convinced me that life on Earth (or at least intelligent life) is darn near impossible, except that here we are discussing it. He does accept as a given that some sort of life developing on Earth was inevitable, but the idea that Homo sapiens were destined to become the pinnacle of Creation or even the best that evolution had to offer is utterly ridiculous. From a probability and statistics point of view I am forced to agree with the author. I am a religious man, but I don't look to the Bible for my science lessons. The Jewish New Year has begun. As I recited my prayers I acknowledged that the new year is 5779 since the Creation. Do I really believe that? I know what the logic behind the number is, and I am willing to accord respect to the scholars who came up with that number. It was a good effort given the knowledge they had at the time and I stick with it out of that respect even though I write 2018 on my checks. Christians have come up with a different number. I assume they respect those Christians scholars of the past and write 2018 on their checks as well.During the time of Dr. Walcott, about 12 years before he discovered the Burgess Shale, Lord Kelvin estimated (in 1897) that the Earth was about 20-40 million years old. That was the accepted figure because no one (except Einstein in 1905 with E=mc2) could conceive of any other way that the Earth could stay warm long enough to develop life. Once they realized nuclear fusion in the Sun and radioactive decay on Earth could keep it warm, much longer estimates for the age of the Earth could be credibly entertained.I've had windy debates about evolution with folks. It seems that any deviation from Darwin's ""ironclad"" declarations are considered heresy. ""Burn the Witch!"" Oh... did I say that out loud? :-) Darwinists are those poor souls who follow Darwin's Theory on evolution as if it were holy writ. These people do science and the theory of evolution no good. What we need are adult conversations and reasoned debate. Not accusations nor insults. I think Darwin's Theory on evolution is a good first pass at the idea. The theory has some flaws that need work, but over all, it is good stuff... really good for a time when DNA was unknown and microscopes were very poor instruments. This is my second reading of the book. I promised a fellow I've been debating that I would read the book again and come back with some quotes to support my position on the age of the Earth and the improbability that life on Earth might come from another planet (say Mars) and then develop on Earth into life as we know it. This is called panspermia and while it is a logical idea, it is not a very probable idea. On the other hand, I don't think life developing as it did on Earth on its own is very probable either. That doesn't mean it didn't happen. I just like knocking around ideas. Don't read too much into it.Oh... and I forgot to mention... The ""F-Word"" is used once in this book as an actual quote from one of the scientists who suddenly realized he had found yet another Burgess ""oddball"" that didn't fit any known phyla. It seems juvenile to use such a direct quote in a book like this, but the book contains a few anachronisms that only make sense if you realize that it was written in the 1980's about events from the 1910's to the 1970's. "
261,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16022816-chris-stratton,3,I am sure this is a great book among paleontologists. The detail of each species he documents and explains and the arguments for reclassifications must be a joy to someone in the field. I however was on a forced march to finish the book. I found the book interesting don’t get me wrong but much went beyond my knowledge of paleontology or biology for that matter. My takeaways? Beware of preconceived ideas! Oh and by the way knowing you are applying preconceived is really hard. Don’t be afraid of speaking up if the establishment believes one thing and you believe another especially if you can prove it.

Gould's political stance seldom agreed with mine, yet I've never doubted his intelligence or erudition. The book is twenty years old, and some of the content has been revised or disputed since; however, I learned a great deal about this pivotal period in the history of life. Gould's style is dense and ""wordy"" at times, and there was too much analysis of Walcott's persona and approach to his discoveries in the Burgess Shale, but it didn't detract too much from what is a genuinely fascinating read."

He proposed too many things as fiat, when he could have easily rephrased everything to conjecture.Nevertheless it is a great read, full of a lot of information about earlier life on the planet.

Gould is with the ""others,"" and proposes that contingency is an importamnt component of evolution. A fascinating story, with Gould's analysis at the forefront.

283,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1959519-max-maxwell,5,"To be clear, Wonderful Life is not a perfect book, but it is certainly an amazing book. It's pertinent to ask, ""Where does the book fall flat?""First, the middle section of the book, ""The Reconstruction of the Burgess Shale,"" is just a little bit too long. I mean exactly what I said; a few pages, say, 20 or so, after you've said, ""OK, I'm ready to get out of this murky details section and get on with the implications of it all,"" the section ends. As Gould points out, the section is, admittedly, important:Pleading is undignified, but allow me one line: please bear with the details; they are accessible, and they are the gateway to a new world.And bear with them you will, through about 200 pages of descriptions of, say, how the specimens of Opabinia or Hallucigenia were dissected, camera lucida diagrams, and repetitive descriptions of Harry Whittington's conservative temperament.The best parts of the book are the first, fourth, and fifth sections. The first, ""The Iconography of an Expectation,"" deals with the tendency amongst scientists and laypeople alike to see evolution as a linear process resulting in more and more complexity and always yielding intelligence. The fourth, ""Walcott's Vision and the Nature of History,"" tells of the myriad expectations that led the original discoverer and describer of the Burgess to make the fatal error of placing all the Burgess biota, most of which were completely new to science, in previously known categories, as ancestors of modern creatures. And the fifth, ""Possible Worlds,"" uses parts two and three (the ones with all the details) as a jumping board from which to explore the idea of punctuated equilibrium and its subsequent idea of contingency.Punctuated equilibrium is the idea that evolution is not a straight line of progress. Rather, evolution centers on mass extinctions such as the extinction that killed 96 or 97% of life on earth, including most of the Burgess organisms. Evolution only works in a straight line up until a really mass extinction, and then all bets are off. Natural selection is so tied to local environments that if the environment changes it can mean game over:Even if fishes hone their adaptations to peaks of aquatic perfection, they will all die if the ponds dry up. But grubby old Buster the Lungfish, former laughingstock of the piscine priesthood, may pull through... if we are Buster's legacy... how can we possibly view our mentality as inevitable, or even probable?One instantly thinks of polar bears doomed by global warming. Gould calls the element of history that relies on happenstance and massively improbable coincidence ""contingency,"" and he hammers its prevalence home with numerous examples—notably that the Burgess organism Pikaia was the earliest chordate, and its nonexistence would have erased us from history.My main objection to contingency is complicated, but in the spirit of this review, I might ask you to bear with my details. Steven Pinker, in his book 
The Blank Slate
, makes an excellent point:Sigmund Freud immodestly wrote that ""humanity has in the course of its time had to endure from the hands of science three great outrages upon its native self-love"": the discovery that our world is not the center of the celestial spheres but rather a speck in a vast universe, the discovery that we are not specially created but instead descended from the animals, and the discovery that often our conscious minds do not control how we act but merely tell us a story about our actions.Science does have a proud tradition of muckraking by demoting the status of humankind further and further, from Lord of Creation, created in God's image, to just another ape on another rock in another galaxy. To most people, this is insulting, even troubling; to those who understand, to those who find themselves, like Job, ""comforted that I am dust,"" it's humbling, and beautiful. But it does lead to a sort of playground-style fight over who among the sciences has demoted man furthest. Gould seems to be making a play here:As Freud observed, our relationship with science must be paradoxical because we are forced to pay an almost intolerable price for each major gain in knowledge and power—the psychological cost of progressive dethronement from the center of things, and increasing marginality in an uncaring universe.He's referencing Freud in order to tie in the concept with his view of contingency.Here's where things get neat: think about SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. SETI optimists, people who feel that it is likely that the universe is populated by intelligent life (myself included), base our assumption on a certain feel for evolution. Carl Sagan was a SETI optimist; he felt that evolution follows, if not a straight line, per se, a route to progress. If Gould is to be believed that (a) contingency is all-important in understanding evolution and (b) contingency is one of Freud's demotions, then Sagan's converse idea should be empowering to man, in the sense that it indicates that evolution must eventually result in something like us. And yet—here is Sagan in his book 
Pale Blue Dot
, titling a chapter ""The Great Demotions,"" and claiming among those demotions the notion that we may not be alone in the universe!The thing is that Gould is not the only supporter of punctuated equilibrium that upholds his ideas as those most demoralizing to mankind. Here's Michael Shermer in the Spring 2008 issue of Skeptic magazine:Historical experiment after experiment reveals the same answer: we are a fluke of nature, a quirk of evolution, a glorious contingency. It is tempting to... write yourself into the story as the central pattern in order to find purpose and meaning... But skeptical alarms should toll whenever anyone claims that science has discovered our deepest desires and oldest myths are true after all... a purpose-seeking animal will find itself as the purpose of nature.Shermer is responding to SETI optimism with a stone face. The point is that Shermer and Gould accuse SETI optimists of wishful thinking, without realizing that their notion so perfectly backs up the very teachings of the church: that we are alone and that we are the only intelligent life out there.—you see, the idea of SETI was once about where contingency is now. The idea of other people was very troubling to the religious; how could God send a saviour to two or more worlds? I'm not saying that contingency is a bad idea, and neither am I knocking punctuated equilibrium. I'm just saying it's not as much of a revelation as Gould thinks.I'm done complaining.—so, what did Gould get right?One of the major appeals of the book is his treatment of scientists as real, quirky people instead of arcane demigods; think the best parts of Bill Bryson's 
A Short History of Nearly Everything
 in more depth. Whittington, Briggs, Conway Morris, Walcott, and even Darwin come alive in these pages, in their words, if possible.He also presents the details with arresting scope and clarity. Sidebars throughout help the layman through arthropod terminology, and the book is lavishly illustrated throughout. Gould's prose is stellar—each punctuation mark and word is devastating. Some say that he rambles, but they're missing the point, because Gould's rambling is his charm. He conveys his passion like few other science writers manage to do.Finally, despite being 20 years old this year, the science in Wonderful Life is cutting-edge. After that long, there were bound to be some corrections: for example, Anomalocaris did not perish soon after the Shale's time; a relative named Schinderhannes survived until the Devonian, 100 million years after the Burgess. Furthermore, Anomalocaris and Opabinia are now considered lobopods, not their own distinct phylum. Hallucigenia walked on its ""tenticles,"" not on its spines, making it substantially less hallucinogenic than once imagined. These are trivialities, in my opinion; for every incorrect guess, Gould makes three that panned out, including correctly placing Aysheiea in the phylum Onychophora, at a time when it was in dispute as to what it was, and calling that the Burgess represented a world-wide fauna based on a few Chinese fossils, guessing that more would show up (in the 2000s, the Changjiang fauna did indeed show up, replete with complete anomalocarids and primitive chordata related to Pikaia, theretofore a single specimen).The facts are these: Wonderful Life makes you think. It's brilliantly written. And, at the end of the day, the creatures and fossils are just awesome. Paleo enthusiasts like me are all kids at heart, Gould being no exception at all."
284,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/29467405-ellen,3,"I read this book for research and primarily for Gould's argument, given throughout this book, that if one were to rewind the 'tape of life' then life as we know it would not emerge on the replay. Gould is clear in his opening chapter that he intends for this book to be both useful for students of the history of life on Earth and for the lay person interested in the same. With no formal scientific training beyond the age of 16, I am only qualified to assess the success of the latter intention, which I can do positively.That being said, however, Gould's quest for accessibility also leads him down some very odd tangents. In the name of illustrating some of his points he begins to almost rant about certain aspects of life and the academy. One notable example is a lengthy lament about the current (at least, current as of the book's writing in the summer of 1988) state of doctoral education on either side of the pond. Such passages read like a columnist giving their true opinions on aspects of the world around them and as a result seem a little fluffy. I found myself wondering on several occasions if the same kind of behaviour would have been tolerated by another author (one perhaps not as established as Gould was at the time of this book's publishing, or one from a different demographic, or indeed one writing just a few decades in the future). One particularly irksome example was of his use of the film It's A Wonderful Life.No doubt where Gould got the main title of his book from, the film gets no mention until over two thirds of the way through the book. Gould uses the film to illustrate the argument for which I came to this book in the first place - that if one were to rewind the 'tape of life' then life as we know it would not emerge on the replay. Gould's reasoning for this is based heavily on what is commonly understood as the butterfly effect (though Gould does not himself use this terminology). It is in an explanation of how the butterfly effect works that Gould references It's A Wonderful Life: the seemingly-insignificant-at-the-time events of George's life had massive knock-on effects to the point where the world would have been a very different place had he never been born. My problem with Gould's use of It's A Wonderful Life is twofold: it was too long, and it came too late in the book. Gould practically recounts the entire film to the reader when a few examples from the film would have had the desired effect. And the argument which Gould is attempting to illustrate has already been given throughout the book. By the time the reader reaches this illustration, they no longer need it.Gould's use of lengthy and tangential illustrations was irritating, but this book has a more egregious fault. I was reading this book at the same time I was reading Delores S. Williams' Sisters in the Wilderness, a book which - among other things - made me aware of some of the historical and scientific 'justifications' for racism. In particular, Williams made me aware of Louis Agassiz's affirmation and perpetuation of racist pseudoscience. Reading these two books in tandem made Agassiz's name in Wonderful Life stand out all the more. Gould references Agassiz twice in this book, but never mentions this dangerous and ugly side of his work; indeed, the only description Gould gives of Agassiz or his work is that he was ""America's greatest natural historian"" (p242). Granted, Williams' book was published four years after Gould's, but I would nevertheless caution the reader of this and other similar works to keep in mind the historiography of the field in a way which Gould does not.If one can tolerate the tangents and is thoughtful of the ugly history behind some of the discoveries which made this book, I think you can get a lot out of it. The scientific jargon is kept to a minimum and the writing style flows well. It provides a helpful history of the discovery and research of the fossils found in the Burgess Shale and what this work has meant for evolutionary science and current thinking of the history of life on Earth. I think this book is an apt reminder that even a book as worthwhile to the field as this one is does not - and should not - escape criticism, particularly in light of its own uncritical elements."
285,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/57886276-owen-moorhead,2,"In the introduction to this book, Gould writes that he hoped to be an ""insider McPhee"" or something like that. Well Mr. Gould, I've read John McPhee; I know John McPhee's work--you sir, are no John McPhee.There are a few problems with this book that prevent it from succeeding (for me). For starters, there's the obvious one: Gould is too close to his subject matter. He seems to recognize this, but that self-awareness doesn't confer immunity to an understandable and natural tendency to forge boldly into the weeds. He is (probably) a much better stylist than most paleontologists, but that is not enough on its own to communicate such delicacies as the ramosity of a Burgess fossil's appendages. To Gould's credit, I think he recognizes this: he clearly felt the information needed a narrative and a theme to make for an interesting read to the lay reader.That brings me to another problem, namely the ideas with which Gould ties together the story of the Burgess fossils and their taxonomy. There are two images that recur continually throughout the book: rewinding tapes and a shoehorn. (Cones and trees also feature heavily.) They are invoked to illustrate two major themes of the book: the pernicious influence of ideology on scientific work and something about contingency. By the end of the book, I was starting to get annoyed with how frequently Gould resorts to these images.I won't say too much about Gould's thesis on ideology because I think it's well-argued and convincing. The contingency argument is more central and a bit confusing. It seems to go something like this: if you were to rewind the video tape of evolution or natural history or whatever, things would turn out differently. Let's leave aside the obvious problem with this image--namely, that no matter how many times you rewind a tape, it will always play the same way, plus or minus the marginal physical alterations that will take place through excessive rewinding.The main issue I have with this argument is I can't understand why Gould attaches so much importance to it. ""Things could have turned out differently than they did,"" he says. That seems to me a metaphysical question that may be trivial or unprovable, depending on your philosophical sympathies.But so what? That's the big question, which went unanswered throughout the book. If this had been a simple exposition of Burgess fauna, that wouldn't be a big deal. But Gould clearly thinks this assemblage proves something incredibly important about, I don't know, life, the universe, and everything. What exactly that is, I never did quite catch.The most eye-raising assertion of this book is that the Burgess Shale is the most important paleontological discovery of the century, and it is never really argued persuasively. That's the biggest failing of ""Wonderful Life"": it never convinced me of any of the lofty assertions Gould made at the outset.All that said, it wasn't terrible, and the writing really is pretty good, if occasionally pretentious."
286,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5885099-angus-mcfarlane,5,"THis is a wonderful book, in all the senses of the word. The primary focus, the burgess fossils, are the stuff of science fiction - strange compilations of animal parts in strange configurations - so strange that science fiction could only take a lead from nature rather than anticipate it. For some reason, early life took some wild turns, many of which then failed to survive. If this book were only a catalog of these unusual beasts it would have been fascinating, but this is only the start.In part because of their strangeness, the second story - that of their discovery and rediscovery - adds to the interest: Initially discovered by Americas greatest paleontologist of the time, the real wonder of the fossils was missed. His analysis, biased by a preconceived notion of how things should be, didn't recognize the fact that many of these creatures did not fit modern categories. It took half a century before they were re-discovered and this time, recognized for the oddities that they really were. Why the first discovery missed, and the second did not, illustrates the all too human aspect to science which itself is often overlooked by preconceived notions of objectivity and dispassion. From these points Jay Gould presents his meta thesis regarding the almost heretical conclusion life's history tells: natural selection is not the only force guiding evolution. Somehow, and not just once, the 'progress' of life has been subject to freak events which have resulted in us humans. Our story, and all other life, is dependent or 'contingent' on these non-biological circumstances - we could as easily not be here. Thus at the third level, the book provides a sense of wonder, of amazement about our existence. Although he uses religious allusions with an abundance that probably leaves a Dawkins type shuddering, there is no supernatural conclusion inferred or implied, nor need there be. Whichever faith one has, I would hope that the wonder Jay Gould illicits is something all experience regarding the specialness of life. Finally, despite the heavy technical content, Jay Gould succeeds in conveying the story with scientific rigor which is also accessible to the uninitiated. Much 'popular science' is either dumbed down and over-punctuated (!), or not far enough removed from the home territory of journal publications. This then is the book's fourth wonder and the ultimate reason for my five star rating. "
287,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12305720-robert,5,"After visiting the Burgess Shale in August 2017, I decided to reread this book by SJ Gould, which I first read (and loved) sometime in the 1990s, shortly after it was published in 1989. Full disclosure, for years I used to devour Gould's This View of Life columns in Natural History magazine every month, and thoroughly enjoyed his books in the 1980s and 1990s, but haven't had the heart (or the stamina) to attempt his final and massive book (2002's The Structure of Evolutionary Theory). A brief foray into that tome made me realize that, at that late stage of his career, his writing style had become a bit too florid, his long and frequent asides too peripheral, and his tendency to show-off his obvious erudition had gotten a bit out of control. 1989's Wonderful Life, The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History, on the other hand, demonstrates Gould at his full powers. Wringing general principles out of specific geological, paleontological, or historical events, he brilliantly deconstructs iconic ideas (preconceptions?) in paleontology (e.g., increasing cone of diversity, gradualism, and adaptationist notions), offering in their place historical contingency, hierarchical levels of selection, and a ""neo-catastrophist"" approach to mass extinctions. It's true that the numerous quotations from Milton and Frost (no Gilbert and Sullivan, at least!), the ostentatious multilingualism, and the sometimes florid prose can seem to some readers a bit over the top, but these tendencies never take over in this book. The story he tells in this book about Walcott's discovery of the Burgess Shale high in the Canadian Rockies of British Colombia in 1909, and the revolutionary reinterpretation of the meaning of this Middle Cambrian ""explosion"" of life by the brilliant paleontologist Harry Whittington and his two equally brilliant students Derek Briggs and Simon Conway Morris is an inspiring one for scientists everywhere, and paleontologists in particular. Highly recommended."
288,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/748327-andrew-hudson,4,"For anyone in the dark, the Burgess Shale is one of the greatest fossil discoveries in palaeontological history. Uncovered in British Columbia by Charles Doolittle Walcott, one of America's most distinguished scientific minds, the Burgess Shale contained an astonishing diversity of forms - but most significantly, from a time at which no solid evidence for life had yet been found.Palaeontology had suffered from a critical absence in the fossil record. Dinosaurs, trilobites and many other extinct lifeforms had long been known of, of course, but while the hard body parts of dead creatures make for good fossilisation, the soft do not, tending to decay long before they can leave their mark. The sorry fact was that, prior to the Mid-Cambrian period (over five hundred million years ago), fossil evidence simply was not to be found. Whatever creatures had existed before the evolution of such hard structures as bone, chitin or shell, they had left no clue behind....until 1909. In the years that followed, C.D. Walcott collected nearly ninety thousand fossils, and though his time in the field was hampered by wide-ranging commitments as an administrator and leader of several of his country's most significant scientific bodies, he somehow found the time to study and report on his discovery as well. What he had found was nothing less than what the palaeontological community had longed for: evidence of simpler forms of life, early links in the chain that, over millions of years, would eventually produce fish and insects, amphibians and reptiles, birds, mammals and man.Or, do I hear you cry, DID he?Nearly sixty years after Walcott's discovery an Englishman named Harry Whittington, the world's leading expert on trilobites, began a process which would shine new light on a subject long considered as fact. With the help of a small group of allies they began to uncover details of the Burgess artefacts never before recognised; details which challenged Walcott's accepted wisdom regarding what his discoveries were; details which even called into question the basic nature of the evolutionary process itself.Whittington and his fellows proved with their efforts that, contrary to the traditional notion of simple creatures gradually improving over time, early evolution represented a chaotic period of sophisticated experimentation, with only blind chance in control of which forms of life would survive to define the future.Or, do I hear you cry, DID they?In Wonderful Life, Stephen J. Gould takes us on a remarkable journey. Setting the scene with an examination of our expectations in conventional evolutionary theory, we join him with Walcott on the Canadian slopes, then follow the various players as they reveal the unseen for the first time, or unveil it anew. He celebrates both the pioneer and the revolutionaries for, he claims, achievements to rank beside any undertaken by the more recognised ""hard"" sciences.He examines, with appropriate respect, how Walcott could make such a critical mistake regarding his subjects, how it was effectively impossible for him to conceive of an alternative to the notion of slow but inevitable ""upward"" development. In fact the revisionist work to come didn't utilise amazing breakthroughs of thought or technology. Nothing that was done in the 70s and 80s was beyond Walcott's technical capacities - but as a product of his time and place he was simply predisposed to see what he wanted or needed to see, so he did.Finally, after leading us through a fascinating and surprisingly accessible education in the field of ancient evolution, Gould demonstrates how these revelations about early life hang the probability of our own existence in a frighteningly - or, to another palate, thrillingly - slender thread.Or, do I hear you cry, DOES he?Because, not to put too fine a point on it, not everyone agrees with Gould's conclusions - even the visionaries he celebrates in the book. Subtitled The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History, Gould's overview of the re-examination of palaeontology's crown jewel begins as a heartfelt celebration of the scientific method and ends as, arguably, an overenthusiastic departure towards his belief in mankind's unlikeliness, and a variation on the standard evolutionary theory which is far from universally accepted. However, between and through these extremes, he treats us to an engaging, enthusiastic and entertaining experience, and it is for this that the book will continue to deserve a readership, even if some of his conclusions draw fire from various detractors as time marches on.It should not be assumed though that the book is closed on Gould's perspective, that He Was Wrong and That Is That. Ten minutes of layperson level browsing underlined for me that there remains debate; and while some of those lined up in opposition to Gould's claims are pretty big guns of the scientific world, even amongst them there is great respect for his writing - and that there can be disagreement and simultaneous support for his work is as interesting to me as his argument itself.It would be nice, reassuringly so, if every science writer, presenting and then interpreting evidence, could be shown to produce undeniable fact; to raise the bar for others to jump from, not at; but this isn't what science necessarily does. Science may be just a system of beliefs no different from any other, religious or not, and as such just as fallible - no, infinitely more so, as for science the facts may sometimes show the beliefs to be wrong.Subject to the righteous threat of constant revision, every theory may eventually come apart at the how it seems - but if great theories give rise to great books only for greater theories to take their turn, then it's a small price to pay to have such good things to read while we wait for the next in line. Gould would, I think, happily accept this form of progressive improvement over time, if no other."
289,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/38010332-greta,5,"If you read the book recently, it is outdated. I do not really like Jay Gould as a scientist since he is kind of wordy and has peculiar theories, but that is not a matter of this book. If you judge the book as a picky evolutionary scientist, you will find lots of mistakes or outdated information. This is a book for non-scientists, although some concepts might be difficult to understand, I confess. Stephen success in trying to introduce us to the amazing world of early living forms that might be not as astonishing as dinosaurs, or some other popular fossils, but certainly these apparently insignificant arthropods were the beginning for everything in life, and most people do not even know they all existed and how important they were. I would recommend this book to science enthusiasts, geologists without a biology background, or freshman biology students, who might get the most of it."
290,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10404161-alex-shrugged,5,"This book is entrancing from the first to the last page. There is a short time, perhaps 3 or 4 pages where the narrative bogs down, but the rest is well paced, and fascinating.This is a book about the Burgess Shale in British Columbia and the scientific blunder of the century caused by a mind refusing to see what the fossils were telling him. This need to shoehorn the Burgess Shale ""oddballs"" into well-known groups was due to certain preconceptions that were strong at the time and remain a problem (though a lesser one) into the modern day.The narrative is presented as a drama in several acts because the story resembles a mystery slowly uncovered and ultimately changing the history of life.Dr. Walcott discovered the Burgess Shale in 1909. He was looking for evidence of the beginning of the Cambrian Explosion, the apparently sudden appearance of complex multi-cellular life. What he found was a treasure of fossils shortly after the event. (A few million years is considered ""shortly after"".) Since the generally accepted view of evolution is a leisurely improvement as species develop from the simple to the complex, finding complex fossils so early in natural history was disruptive to Darwin's Theory and had to be explained. In other words, if life was so complex during the Cambrian period then there should have been simpler species that came LONG before then in the Precambrian era. Yet these simpler precursors could not be found. An explanation was needed. The pressure to make these Burgess Shale ""oddballs"" fit into an ""acceptable"" scientific model of evolution was tremendous. Thus for decades the Burgess discoveries remained on the back shelves and in drawers, most unstudied and the few ""oddballs"" shoved quickly into known categories and forgotten.Decades later, Dr. Whittington decided to study the Burgess specimens, hoping to find some new type of trilobite. He believed that Dr. Walcott was generally correct, that somehow these specimens would fit into known groups. Yet, as he studied each specimen more closely, he realized that some of them represented an entirely new branch of the evolutionary tree. In fact, it wasn't a tree at all. It was more like an evolutionary bush.The book is actually about how our prejudices and even the diagrams and charts we use push us toward preconditioned conclusions. (FYI, the author does this himself in a few cases, minor but I noticed.) The author has convinced me that life on Earth (or at least intelligent life) is darn near impossible, except that here we are discussing it. He does accept as a given that some sort of life developing on Earth was inevitable, but the idea that Homo sapiens were destined to become the pinnacle of Creation or even the best that evolution had to offer is utterly ridiculous. From a probability and statistics point of view I am forced to agree with the author. I am a religious man, but I don't look to the Bible for my science lessons. The Jewish New Year has begun. As I recited my prayers I acknowledged that the new year is 5779 since the Creation. Do I really believe that? I know what the logic behind the number is, and I am willing to accord respect to the scholars who came up with that number. It was a good effort given the knowledge they had at the time and I stick with it out of that respect even though I write 2018 on my checks. Christians have come up with a different number. I assume they respect those Christians scholars of the past and write 2018 on their checks as well.During the time of Dr. Walcott, about 12 years before he discovered the Burgess Shale, Lord Kelvin estimated (in 1897) that the Earth was about 20-40 million years old. That was the accepted figure because no one (except Einstein in 1905 with E=mc2) could conceive of any other way that the Earth could stay warm long enough to develop life. Once they realized nuclear fusion in the Sun and radioactive decay on Earth could keep it warm, much longer estimates for the age of the Earth could be credibly entertained.I've had windy debates about evolution with folks. It seems that any deviation from Darwin's ""ironclad"" declarations are considered heresy. ""Burn the Witch!"" Oh... did I say that out loud? :-) Darwinists are those poor souls who follow Darwin's Theory on evolution as if it were holy writ. These people do science and the theory of evolution no good. What we need are adult conversations and reasoned debate. Not accusations nor insults. I think Darwin's Theory on evolution is a good first pass at the idea. The theory has some flaws that need work, but over all, it is good stuff... really good for a time when DNA was unknown and microscopes were very poor instruments. This is my second reading of the book. I promised a fellow I've been debating that I would read the book again and come back with some quotes to support my position on the age of the Earth and the improbability that life on Earth might come from another planet (say Mars) and then develop on Earth into life as we know it. This is called panspermia and while it is a logical idea, it is not a very probable idea. On the other hand, I don't think life developing as it did on Earth on its own is very probable either. That doesn't mean it didn't happen. I just like knocking around ideas. Don't read too much into it.Oh... and I forgot to mention... The ""F-Word"" is used once in this book as an actual quote from one of the scientists who suddenly realized he had found yet another Burgess ""oddball"" that didn't fit any known phyla. It seems juvenile to use such a direct quote in a book like this, but the book contains a few anachronisms that only make sense if you realize that it was written in the 1980's about events from the 1910's to the 1970's. "
291,039330700X,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16022816-chris-stratton,3,I am sure this is a great book among paleontologists. The detail of each species he documents and explains and the arguments for reclassifications must be a joy to someone in the field. I however was on a forced march to finish the book. I found the book interesting don’t get me wrong but much went beyond my knowledge of paleontology or biology for that matter. My takeaways? Beware of preconceived ideas! Oh and by the way knowing you are applying preconceived is really hard. Don’t be afraid of speaking up if the establishment believes one thing and you believe another especially if you can prove it. Finally... Humans are extremely lucky(?) to have arrived here at all.

The discussion of phyla that once roams the seas 500MYA was more detailed than I had imagined. To be candid, there are very few scientists or naturalists whose personal stories I am interested in. This is true for the person(s) that discovered the Burgess Shale. Don't get me wrong, I really like reading anything by Gould. Sometimes his tangents into the personal lives of the scientists are a bit long winded. If this is for you, enjoy! I much prefer reading about the science than the people."

First, the important information about how not to have preconceived ideas, imaginings, assumptions when examining a historic site. Taking the scientific view of nature in history. Amazing the bountiful life exposed in the Burgess Shale site. Wonders of life active in a time before Homo Sapiens evolved. Excellent reading about discoveries of life - fossils caught in the shale give view of one time period in earth's history. "

Gould's political stance seldom agreed with mine, yet I've never doubted his intelligence or erudition. The book is twenty years old, and some of the content has been revised or disputed since; however, I learned a great deal about this pivotal period in the history of life. Gould's style is dense and ""wordy"" at times, and there was too much analysis of Walcott's persona and approach to his discoveries in the Burgess Shale, but it didn't detract too much from what is a genuinely fascinating read."

He proposed too many things as fiat, when he could have easily rephrased everything to conjecture.Nevertheless it is a great read, full of a lot of information about earlier life on the planet. And as I note in my review of *Origin of Species*, Gould is probably right; if we ran evolution all over again, would it turn out the same? Probably not."
