0,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27488361-ahmed-samir,4,"So this was the true definition of a popular science book. From the get-go, Jim goes on to a number of very interesting examples to put the reader at bay with what lies ahead, and amazingly he moves from one paradox to the other very swiftly. Each paradox is discussed with the utmost care to be as clear as possible. Although I had to re-read some sections to make sure I understood, overall, it was a fantastic read. What I like most is how the author takes time to explain some scientific theories which serve the paradox in such brevity and conciseness that makes it just enough to understand the rest of the paradox (or the solutions he proposes). Good book, highly recommend. "
1,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david,4,"This is an entertaining book about seeming paradoxes in physics. I highly recommend the book to people interested in special relativity, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and mathematics.Is time travel possible? That is covered in chapter 7, ""The Grandfather Paradox"", where Al-Khalili explains what might happen if you went back in time to murder your grandfather. Is it possible? I won't say right here, because it is definitely a spoiler. What about the so-called ""twins paradox"". One twin stays on Earth, while the other goes in a very fast space-ship near the speed of light to a nearby star. When the twin returns, he has hardly aged, while the stay-at-home twin is much older. How can this be? While the space-faring twin travelled fast compared to the stay-at-home twin, from the space-faring twin's point of view, his stay-at-home twin travelled just as fast in the opposite direction. Since everything is ""relative"" why did one twin age faster than the other? The situation sounds completely symmetric--but it isn't.If the universe is infinite in extent, and the density of stars and galaxies is approximately uniform everywhere, then why is the sky dark at night? This is Olber's paradox, and it is very subtle. While more distant stars are fainter (their radiance on Earth is inversely proportion to distance-squared), their numbers increase with distance-squared. Believe it or not, the correct explanation for this conundrum was first written by Edgar Allan Poe! He was not a scientist, and most of his ""science"" explanations were dead-wrong, but on this topic he got it right! Again, I don't want to give away spoilers, so I will refrain from explaining the paradox here.Suppose a runner holds a pole horizontally while running through a barn. The barn doors in the front and the back are both open. When the pole is at rest, its length is exactly the same as the distance between the front and back doors of the barn. Now, suppose the runner can reach a relativistic speed. From the point of view of someone standing at rest near the barn, the pole seems to be ""squashed"", so he could actually close both doors for a tiny fraction of a second, and the pole would fit in the barn. But from the runner's point of view the barn is squashed, so that when he is in the middle of the barn, both ends of his pole would stick out of the doors. How can this be? How can both points of view be correct, when you have such a symmetric scenario?Other paradoxes explained in the book are ""Maxwell's Demon"", ""Schrodinger's Cat', ""Laplace's Demon, and ""Fermi's Paradox"". Ahhh--Fermi's Paradox is so interesting. If the universe is so vast, and there are intelligent life forms out there that have advanced to a high stage of technology, why haven't we heard from any alien civilizations? Simply stated, ""where is everybody?""The book goes into considerable depth, and gives all the background you need to completely understand each paradox. The style is an easy banter, so it is a fun read, as well. If you would like to put on your thinking-cap and be stimulated as well as entertained, this would be a good book for you!"
2,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/52763346-farhana,5,"Fascinating ! This book deals with 9 beautiful paradoxes and their explanations. The writer and physicist Jim has done really a good job. He unfolded the paradoxes and explained things so well. The smooth covering of all the details, explanations reveal his expertise on the topics. The writing is very fluent. I believe anyone will enjoy these beautiful paradoxes. O:)"
3,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6789591-retroj,2,"What do you do when a friend recommends a science book to you, and a few chapters in, you realise that it has nothing to teach you? ..and the writing style is bland, and the author is at one time skipping over important distinctions, and at another muddling simple ideas with rambling? You trudge on, and change your purpose from one of learning to one of gathering ammunition for a scathing book review! Let's go!As it turned out, I couldn't make myself finish this book in one effort. I made it all the way to chapter 9 before giving up in frustration — the chapter title was Laplace's Demon but the chapter had precious little to say about Laplace's original formulation, and instead skipped over into a modern reinterpretation, and discussed that instead. Did I mention the rambling? See also chapter 7. So I set the book down, marked it abandoned, and read some other stuff. After a few days, I finally decided to just finish it and put it behind me; only had a few chapters to go, anyway.If it had only been a matter of picking a book below my level of understanding, I would rate it three stars — that's not the book's fault afterall, and I did enjoy chapter 1, and did learn a couple of things here and there — but it wasn't just that. It was all-around mediocrity and wishy-washy writing. I've read clearer explications of most of the topics in this book elsewhere; James Coleman and Brian Greene both come to mind on the topic of relativity. Some instances of intellectual sloppiness stood out, too. In chapter 5, one of Einstein's famous thought experiments is confusingly retold: If you fly at the speed of light holding a mirror before you, can you see your reflection? The text then goes on to consider the question of flying near the speed of light, not at the speed of light, no mention of the discrepency. It might seem a quibble, but they are two different questions. An example of an outright error is in chapter 10, where in reference to infrared light, the parenthetical clarification ""(heat)"" is given. The conflated identification of infrared radiation as heat radiation has dogged popular understanding of physics for two centuries, and I was surprised to see a professional physicist commit the error. (All electromagnetic radiation transmits heat, not just infrared.)To quickly summarize, this is not a good book if your goal is a clarified understanding of physics. It skips, muddles, discurses. It is largely regurgitation of popular physics topics that have been explicated better by other authors in the past. "
4,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/2620012-jim,5,"To earn an engineering degree many years ago, I took a lot of math and science courses. I struggled with the advanced mathematics, but I loved the sciences, especially physics, and I've been keen on science ever since. My home library includes many science books, running the gamut from cosmology to quantum mechanics. I don't always understand everything that I read, but I'm always fascinated by a well written book on science. And ""Paradox: The Nine Greatest Enigmas in Physics"" is a well written book. Author Jim Al-Khalili's writing style reminded me a bit of the old TV series ""Connections"" and ""The Day the Universe Changed,"" both hosted by science historian James Burke, who demonstrated how various discoveries, scientific achievements, and historical world events were built from one another successively in an interconnected way to bring about particular aspects of modern technology. Paradox: The Nine Greatest Enigmas in Physics uses an analogous approach in presenting famous paradoxes by describing the background of the paradox, the personalities involved, and how the solutions to the paradox have evolved. It's a very effective approach that makes the book very readable, even for laymen.A few words about the writing style and technical level of the book: this isn't ""Paradoxes for Dummies,"" but it doesn't require a degree in physics to understand and enjoy, just a love of science and learning. The book begins by describing the different types of paradoxes, then focuses on paradoxes in physics which can be resolved with some fundamental scientific knowledge and basic mathematics. The first chapter includes some well known paradoxes that can be resolved without any science. Two of my favorites were the ""Riddle of the Missing Dollar,"" a brainteaser that has been forwarded in emails countless times; and the ""Monty Hall Paradox,"" which I've seen many times, but I'm still amazed at the answer, which is derived through simple logic (hint: if Monty offers you a trade, take it!).As much fun as the first chapter was, the real meat is in the remaining chapters, where the author presents famous paradoxes that have baffled people for years. As an example, one of my favorites is Chapter 3 - ""Olbers's Paradox."" The paradox is familiar to most people as ""Why does it get dark at night?"" The paradox is credited to 19th century German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers, although Olbers was not the first to ask the question. The author takes us back to ancient Greece to describe the state of astronomy and the prevailing theories about the Earth's place in the universe, then progresses through the following centuries as knowledge of our universe increases. Olbers proposed an answer, which we now know was incorrect, but he had no way of knowing about the Big Bang and the subsequent expansion of the universe. Surprisingly, the first credible answer was proposed by American writer/poet Edgar Allan Poe in 1848!Another of my favorites was Chapter 7 - ""The Grandfather Paradox."" This chapter included one of the more readable discussions of time travel that I've read. And based on the latest theories of a Quantum Multiverse, you could actually go back in time and kill your grandfather, and not prevent your birth in your own time.Each chapter follows a similar format, with the background of a famous paradox receiving as much attention as the solution itself. The book is a goldmine of fascinating information that covers a broad range of the sciences, as it examines some of the major paradoxes and conundrums that have baffled people for years.Note: I received an advance reader copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for a fair and honest review, which I have done to the best of my ability."
5,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10486977-themadhatter,4,"The title of the book I actually read was ""Paradox: The nine greatest enigmas in science"" by the same author. However, given they both have the same ISBN (So I can't add my copy) and the book I read was pretty much enigmas in physics, I am going to post here and assume this is just a publisher's discretion thingo between different country releases :-). Almost like Americans calling the first Harry Potter book a sorcerer's stone (rather than the philosopher's).I really enjoyed this book. I read the first 3/4 of the book before Xmas and then got caught up in the Xmas rush and the book unfortunately found its way under about 10 other books before I managed to find it again and finish it. And I am glad I did. The reason I mention this is that I don't want the duration it took me to finish this book to be indicative of the quality. This was a REALLY engaging book.I really struggle finding books I enjoy in this genre. They are either too simplistic and aimed at people with minimal physics knowledge or they are dry textbooks that don't capture the passion and enthusiasm and dare I say humor that encompasses my world of physics. This book though was perfect. It contained paradoxes that I was familiar with (Grandfather, Twin, Fermi's, Schrodinger's Cat, Monty Hall, Zeno's, my fave Olbers' and a few others) but gave each topic enough depth to convey the main message and the underlying physics. The writing style was easy to read and that was backed up by the credibility of the author as a particle physicist. I loved the humor in the book and actually annoyed my husband by reading out paragraphs to him during long holiday car trips (sucks to be him!). I will definitely be tracking down more of the author's work and hopefully some online lectures he has given. If he is as engaging in person as he is in the written form, then he has a new fan in me. This is a must read for anyone who has an interest in physics - from beginner to enthusiast. Even people with a sound knowledge of physics will find this a good refresher on the topic."
6,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7829591-deidre,3,"Probabilities, puzzles, and problems abound in Jim Al-Khalili's book Paradox: The Nine Great Enigmas is Physics. If ever there was a book to prompt your brain to run in circles it's this one which offers conundrum after conundrum, rapid fire. Your enjoyment of this book will likely depend on how interested in quantum mechanics, physics, philosophy, and metaphysics you are. I've read a bunch of different reviews of the British version, those who have a physics background find it too simplistic, those who have little interest in these matters find it a bit of a muddle. For me it was a slog at times but it's a short book with plenty of depth and fun for those who enjoy puzzling out riddles of logic.Full review over on Yahoo."
7,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/47108351-anna-kaling,2,"I really like Jim Al-Khalili's writing style, and how he makes physics accessible without being condescending. But this book isn't really about paradoxes, as the author admits in the preface, just tricky questions that have been solved, and I found most of them uninteresting. There was too much focus on special relativity, so the explanations began to feel repetitive and I didn't learn much.I did really enjoy the chapters on the Game Show Paradox, Shrodinger's Cat, and Fermi's Paradox. I suppose I'm just more interested in probability, quantum mechanics, and aliens than I am in thermodynamics or special relativity. Although I'm also very interested in chaos theory and I didn't particularly enjoy Laplace's Demon so... yeah, I don't really know what my problem with this book was. It's all subjective. I will definitely read more Al-Khalili."
8,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/69500282-hamid,5,"If you think this book is just a collection of physics paradoxes, you're wrong. In each chapter, Jim Al-Khalili, British theoretical physicist, delves into the real world of science, be it Einstein's theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, etc. The book starts with paradoxes that are less physics related and more probability-like. Then it moves on to more interesting dilemmas like Maxwell's demon and Shrodinger's cat. In the final chapter, Jim discusses the Fermi paradox. How likely is it for alien life forms, being intelligent or not, to exist somewhere in the vastness of space. Remember that some basic knowledge of special and general theories of relativity are required to grasp the concepts hidden behind each paradox. It's an easy read though. No mathematical equations are involved. I, as a science enthusiast, extremely enjoyed the book. I hope you like it too."
9,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/10449878-naomi,5,"Excellent explanation of some quite difficult physics concepts, and really interesting paradoxes were explored. This book really makes you question human existence and the uniqueness of our universe. It wasn't too ""dumbed down"" as some popular science books tend to be. Would have liked to have seen some maths in there but one can only dream."
10,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/79761603-joel-everett,4,"Great book with lots of great information in there, I’d recommend for GCSE age (about 15/16) because it gives enough information to peak interest but not in any difficult detail. Intriguing read all the same."
11,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/3111883-evan,3,"Entertaining and interesting, though at times somewhat difficult to follow and a few parts required a re-listen in order to fully grasp what was being conveyed. Glad to have read it, but wouldn't rush to re-read or recommend..."
12,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/42028968-nicola,5,"I love books that can get my brain firing and this one certainly did that!The book explained 9 of the greatest enigmas in science - paradoxes that seem inexplicable (could you go back in time and kill your grandfather? And if you did, how would you be here to go back and carry out the act) The Grandfather Paradox was just one of the paradoxes explained, my favourites discussed included Fermi’s Paradox, The Pole in the Barn Paradox, Schrodinger’s Cat (of course!), Maxwell’s and Laplace’s Demon and the Paradox of the Twins. The Game Show Paradox, Achilles and the Tortoise and Olber’s Paradox were also explained. Personally loved delving into the Quantum Multiverse theory and the theory of time in Einstein’s theory of general relativity with concept of lightspeed involved. Jim Al-Khalili is such a fantastic communicator of science, this book was brilliant. This is a book I would read, re-read and read again. A must for any science lover!"
13,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg,4,"There is something wonderful about paradoxes - and when I give talks to people about physics, I find it's the paradoxical bits, the ones that seriously bend your mind, that really get them going. That being the case, it's a no-brainer that Jim Al-Khalili's latest book is one to look out for. It's rather unfortunate that he defines paradox incorrectly at the start, saying it is 'a statement that leads to a circular and self-contradictory argument, or describes a situation that is logically impossible' - no, that's a fallacy. The OED defines a paradox as 'a statement or tenet contrary to received opinion or belief, especially one that is difficult to believe' - but there is no suggestion in the main definition that a paradox has to be logically impossible. And that's why they're such fun, because they challenge our beliefs, but they really can be true.What we get is nine fascinating paradoxes of science (mostly physics), with an gentle introduction using the famous Monty Hall problem (also known as Ferraris and Goats) and one or two other paradoxes of probability. Each chapter is based around one of these chunky paradoxes, but Al-Khalili uses the theme to lead us through all sorts of interesting background, either because we need it to understand the paradox itself, or simply because it's an opportunity to bring in some great material. So, for instance, we have the old infinite series paradox Achilles and the Tortoise as chapter 2, but we also discover the other known paradoxes of Zeno, including the delightful Arrow. Then there's Olber's Paradox - why is the night sky dark, Maxwell's Demon - opening up all the wonders of entropy, The Pole in the Barn for the spatial aspect of special relativity, The Twins Paradox for the time aspect of special relativity, The Grandfather Paradox if you can do backwards time travel, Laplace's Demon for determinism and chaos, Schrodinger's Cat (oh, how I hate that cat) - explained better than I've ever seen it, and Fermi's Paradox asking where all the aliens are. All in all, a great set, which uses these fascinating mind twisters to explore a lot of really interesting physics (and a spot of maths).As is almost inevitably the case, there were one or two factual eyebrow-lifters. We are told, for example, that the Andromeda Galaxy contains 500 million stars - I think we're talking hundreds of billions, not a mere half billion. And the explanation of Maxwell's demon seems to suggest that flipping bits takes energy as opposed to the actual cause, which is erasure of information. But my only real problem with Paradox is that Al-Khalili writes like a physics professor (which he is), rather than like a science writer. His style can be a little plodding, and definitely patronising. So for instance the 'explanation' of the quantum Zeno effect is in essence to smile and tell us not to worry our little heads about it: 'I don't think I will pursue this line of thought in any more detail here, just in case you are nervously wondering what you've let yourself in for.' In that case, why mention in in the first place?Again I would contrast Al-Khalili's suggestion that we leave thinking about quantum theory to the big boys: 'However carefully it is explained to the non-physicist, quantum mechanics will sound utterly baffling, even far-fetched.' with another physics professor, Richard Feynman: 'It is my task to convince you not to turn away because you don't understand it. You see, my physics students don't understand it either. That is because I don't understand it. Nobody does... The theory of quantum electrodynamics describes Nature as absurd from the point of view of common sense. And it agrees fully with experiment. So I hope you can accept Nature as She is - absurd.' Feynman's version is inclusive; Al-Khalili emphasizes that there are physicists and there is you, the common herd of readers. This is even rubbed in on the cover of the book. It's not by Jim Al-Khalili, it's by Professor Jim Al-Khalili - a bit like those dubious medical books where the author always has M. D. after their name.Does the writing style spoil the content? Absolutely not. And I ought to stress that Paradox is by no means unreadable, just not in the professorial rank when it comes to science writing. The fact remains that the idea of building the book around paradoxes is great, the subject matter is excellent and the exploration of different aspects of physics is fascinating. This is a book that many popular science enthusiasts will lap up.Review first published on www.popularscience.co.uk and reproduced with permission"
14,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1444762-jill,3,"Ever wonder if it is possible to time-travel, why the night sky is not brighter, why it is impossible to build a perpetual motion machine, or why we have not had any communication from intelligent beings from other planets? This little book by Jim Al-Khalili, a quantum physicist at the University of Surrey, answers these and several other difficult questions in easy to read language with no equations. Paradoxes are puzzles that are logical brainteasers, and the author utilizes them in his effort to bring physics to a broader audience; that is, to show that not only can physics be fun, but that once you understand the nature of a paradox, everything becomes much more clear.The author treats nine classic physics quandaries and a few more philosophical conundrums with comprehensible analysis, showing that they are not actually unresolveable, but merely difficult problems subject to resolution with careful thinking. His explanations, such as why you can’t go back to the past and kill your grandfather, are witty as well as illuminating. (Like other physics popularizers, he includes the wonderful 1923 limerick by Reginald Buller in his text), viz:There was a young lady named BrightWho traveled far faster than light.She went out one dayIn a relative wayAnd returned the previous night.”The author's musings on the tension between determinism and free will are especially enlightening. As a special bonus, he also provides an intelligible solution to the famous “Monte Hall” problem that bothered game show fans for years, in the process giving us a painless lesson in probability calculation. Evaluation: This book is deceptively profound, appearing simple because the writing is so lucid. The author, in addition to having a resume that would make most scientists blush, is a regular radio and television science commentator - not surprising given his flair for rendering the abstruse lively and accessible. I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in the philosophy of science. Rating: 3.5/5"
15,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14011226-rob-slaven,3,"As I've said countless times lately, I received this book in a GoodReads giveaway. With the popularity of shows like ""The Big Bang Theory"" it's not surprising that books of this sort are making their way increasingly into the awareness of the reading public. In a nutshell, I think this book tries to cover too much ground in too little time. For most of the topics covered a 300-page book just for one topic is not usually sufficient so to attempt to summarize this much material in 220 pages for 9 such topics is a breathtakingly complex undertaking. That said, it is reasonably executed given the Herculean nature of the task. Rather than critique further let me try to guide the reader part by part.Chapter 1 is rather an outlier. Potentially interesting but with a distinct mathematical bent that will leave many readers scratching their heads. Do NOT judge the book based on the first chapter. Just politely skip it if it gives you flashbacks to statistics class.Chapters 2-4 work together as examples from classical physics. They stand alone but comprise a skippable grouping of their own if they don't sit well with you.Chapters 5-7 represent Einstein's General and Special Relativity. As concepts they are massively intriguing but again, if they don't appeal then they are a skippable grouping.Chapter 8 is really more philosophical than physical.Chapter 9 is the most referred to bit of physics in the past 50 years in popular culture. If you read nothing else then read this.Chapter 10 is for the UFO crowd.Chapter 11 is a bit of a throw away. Perhaps a tease for a next book.In summation, I think that like any book of this type it's straddling a fine line. As someone who has been reading books of this ilk since he was 10 it's just a rehash of topics I've read half a dozen times before. There's no new information here. For the uninitiated I think it tries to be too broad in scope and will leave a lot of head scratching. I will say though that with the exception of the first chapter the author has successfully eradicated the mathematics from these topics. That in itself is an accomplishment not to be sneezed at."
16,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9651231-laura-zimmerman,2,"I received this book through a Goodreads giveaway. I am NOT a physics or math sort of person and I entered the drawing because I hoped the book would be a Physics Made Easy sort of read.Probably because I'm not a physics or math person, it was difficult for me to read this book and stay interested. Rather than staying engaged I found myself nodding off as I read. My hope of having these concepts in physics explained in a way that made sense to me was unfulfilled, which resulted in quickly losing interest in reading any further. My fiance also read the book. Because he's much more oriented to physics and math than I, the concepts were not new to him and he felt he didn't learn anything new from this book. Granted, he has been reading this sort of thing for the past 30 years so he has quite a head start on me.I will say that the author's writing skills are solid. My lack of comprehension has nothing to do with the author's style and I give him credit for the efforts he put forth in his book. I was impressed by the lack of typos or other errors that often show up in uncorrected proofs--had I not known it was an uncorrected proof I would have thought I was reading the final product.Ultimately, I'd say this book is not for everyone. However, it's probably very informative for those readers who are more familiar with the concepts or for those who can more easily comprehend somewhat incomprehensible (to me) concepts. To those readers I recommend giving this book a try."
17,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/54823671-kaleb-bierstedt,4,"I found this book to be very interesting, and often times found myself taking breaks during the book to sort out some the ideas that Jim Al-Khalili brings up because some of the paradoxes have such odd logic to them. Also at the time of reading this book we were learning about similar mathematical concepts that could be applied in the Achilles and the Tortoise section in my AP Calc class, so that also helped spark my interest in the book. Although this was a good book, the use of math and physics in this book may make it difficult for some to understand so I would recommend having at least some basic understanding of physics before reading this book as there are a few points where Al-Khalili skips over some of the more basic math and physics behind the paradox, but most of the time Al-Khalili does a decent job of thoroughly explaining the flaws in thinking behind the problem. Overall it was an entertaining book that I would recommend to anyone interested in reading about math, physic or even brain teasers because there are quite a few in this book. "
18,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16212136-peter-pete-mcloughlin,3," a passable intro to weird paradoxes in physics. It talks about Olbers paradox of the dark night sky, If the universe is infinite and stars are randomly distributed there should be stars in every direction and the night sky should be blazingly bright it is not because even if the universe is infinite we can only see a finite part of it because of the big bang light hasn't reached us from parts of the universe. the book goes on with zeno's paradox, relativity and time travel paradoxes, Schroedinger's cat and the impossibility of perpetual motion machines. Good ideas for a person who wants to become familiar with the stranger aspects of physics but I have seen this stuff before still it is not bad."

I was expecting a much more technical treatment of its chosen topics but only got a notional awareness. Having studied these various paradoxes in college physics ill just have to go back and revisit this material mathematically. Readers should expect only superficial coverage of topics in laymen's terms wrapped in TV courtroom strength logic. Understanding imparted by this book may provide fodder for coffeeshop conversation but could not fuel a 10+ minute conversation on any paradox.Particularly galling was the foray into philosophical saws such as ""are we alone?"". "

The author often comes across as elitist, always jumping at the chance to remind the reader he's a physicist, and you are not. However, I did enjoy the fact that he wasn't afraid to offer his personal opinion on scientific mysteries, but always made sure to preface them as his own subjective opinions. I really enjoyed that personal element.All in all there were some elements I quite enjoyed, others not so much. Not quite a paradox, but close enough to be a little ironic."

30,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/18942380-william-schram,5,"We’ve all heard of the concept of Paradox before, but in case you haven’t, I think this is one;The sentence below is true.The sentence above is false.Now it could also be just a word puzzle of some kind, but that is the kind of thing to expect from this offering by Jim Al-Khalili. The book claims to show the nine greatest enigmas in physics and it does a pretty good job of that. That is not to say that the Paradoxes shown are all unsolved, far from it; it merely means that the paradoxes are ones that have baffled people for a long time.Each of the paradoxes starts out the same way; Al-Khalili introduces the problem and then goes on to state how it was put forward and why it was confusing. If he knows how it was muted for a while, he explains that too. Then, if the paradox was resolved he goes on to explain how it was done and what tools or logic were used.The book includes some other things too, mainly to show how spurious intuition can be. This one is the famous “Monty Hall Problem.” You might have heard of it if you are into mathematical puzzles like I am, but if you are not then here is my take on it from memory.You are on a Game Show in the final round. You are presented with three doors, let us call them “A”, “B”, and “C.” Monty Hall or the host or whoever tells you that you must pick a door from the three choices. Behind one door is a brand new car, and behind the other two doors are goats. You pick a door and Monty Hall opens another door that you did not choose, showing a goat. He then offers a deal; you can switch doors, or you can remain with the door you originally chose. Simple enough so far, but here’s the quandary; is it to your advantage to switch doors? The surprising answer to many is yes. Now at first glance, you might think that switching the doors doesn’t matter since you should have a one in two chance since there are now only two doors, but that is incorrect. Since the host KNOWS which one has the car, this changes the outcome of the game and the probability stays at one in three for each door. So that means that switching offers you a two in three chance to get the car rather than a one in two. Even professional mathematicians thought that this was the wrong answer and wrote angry letters to the editor that the author of the column was forced to respond to.Some of the other ones are also interesting historically. Take the paradoxes from Zeno of Elea for example. His paradoxes stated that motion was impossible, yet people and things move. They weren’t resolved rigorously until calculus was invented. In the same vein is Olbers Paradox. This might seem like a silly idea too, but it isn’t in the frame of the original problem. There should be stars in every direction from the Earth, right? Regardless of how far away they are, there should be a star there, providing light from that particular point. If that is the case, why is the night sky dark rather than filled with light? The answer to that didn’t come until Einstein put forth his General Theory of Relativity. The reason the sky is dark is that the Universe has a beginning and because there is a speed of light.Anyway, I had a grand old time with this book. All of the problems were interesting and explained in a manner that people should be able to understand. The book doesn’t contain any heavy math, so you won’t find field equations or anything too complicated."

Go read The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the World. Let me know how this compares to that.Go read The Fabric of the Heavens: The Development of Astronomy and Dynamics. Let me know how this compares to that.Rubbish book I didn't like it at all. There's repetition, cladding out the pages with bland restatements of earlier, dull statements. I'd prefer not to compare across genres but I have to say that reading The Man Who Was Thursday coeval with this, and it shames this book. Mr. Khalili wrote to fill a page-count, no doubt. Constant refreshing of origin of the inquiry does dull one's curiosity.I have read a lot of 'Classic Logic Puzzles' and their ilk, maybe if I had not this book would contain novel material & be written in plain language that anyone can understand. But I have, it's not & if you haven't, & it is, I really do believe you could enjoy the books at top & bottom. The Beginning of Infinity is a better book, as far as shared objective go, Mr. Deutsch gives the paradox between mind & body the mad, searching intensity it deserves although really the 2 books don't share an objective. I expect Beauty to be one of the secret's of the universe, the paradox of metamorphosis where opposites swap, from Ugly comes Beauty & vice versa. Well you might learn more about the natural laws in Paradox, but not the best concatenation. The triple point of water seems a paradox, when the 3 (parochially exclusive) forms co-exist. Physics, being the laws of nature, had a paradox solved by germ theory. Something came from nothing, without microscopes this was soluble by (one of the) God's Will alone. You want 7 more? Nah, pay me.The Monty Hall paradox was the last section I read in full, after which I began to skim read. I tried, I really did, beginning in sober earnest at the start of each chapter, reading fully at least the first page. But what's the good of the Pole in the Barn paradox? It is entirely devoid of context, the terrain described is massively different from the manifest occurrence. Attempting to describe extreme possibilities of best-yet physics as though in an incompatible, mundane situation is Absurd. In my opinion, posit the metaphor / analogy as the clay from which to sculpt by removal of the cladding to leave the actual facts of the case. Mr. Khalili did not break the fantastic beginnings for the mystifying truth, not on the early chapters & later pages I read. I repeat, go read Free Radicals: The Secret Anarchy of Science.

That's simply not true and he does us avid readers—sons of Asimov and Sagan—a disservice: I've not only heard, but been on top of all the paradoxes listed for quite some years now. I even found a couple of (maybe) mistakes, told him on Twitter of one, he says in the Multiverse traveling back in time does not break the 1st law of thermodynamics, because mass and energy suddenly appearing don't alter the whole of m and e in all the Multiverses, but that's the same as saying that m and e appearing on a single universe do not change the total m and e of that single universe, particularly when considering the block universe in which all times are laid out. It seems he's just pushing the problem back a level. Another one is his opinion that science will be able to know what's outside the universe: that is impossible by definition. And also he mentions science will also know what's on the other side of a black hole: science understands black holes now, enough to realize they're not magical gates to another dimension, or whatever nonsense.All in all, an entertaining and informative read. A must if you want to understand what modern science has to say about the universe and how does it works.It's not without its faults, the errors mentioned (which really undermine the whole book), some minor discrepancies here and there (all electromagnetic radiation transfers heat, not only infrared), but in general good enough for the broad populace that has no clue of anything physics related."

Jim is smooth and direct in his explanation through out the book; this is is my first hardcore physics book and it was hard for a mediocre mind like mine despite the fact that Jim did his best to engulf all as his audience not only physicists or physics university students.I have wet dreams about space exploration - this is why i preferred the 2 paradoxes that Jim explored space rather than the 7 Quantum physics paradoxes. Why it's dark at night??? Never thought this would be a paradox, I ignorantly thought that this is what would be the case forever.. No i was wrong.It is a beautiful feeling when Jim expand about his quantum and space knowledge to us earthlings. I felt sure about the information spread out to me with the self assurance of Jim's style in writing. You can sense well when a guy know what he is talking about.How can a cat be alive and dead at the same time? How can someone arrive back to earth and find her twin brother older than her in 10 years?? And most important how can we make sure we ""earthlings"" are alone in the universe? Scary enough?? I bet it is more scary than if we weren't the only ones out there. Have a good read and enjoyable space ride through the big bang, multiverse, and time travel with such a geeky nerdy piece of physics book."

It made me appreciate science even more as I today, after studying science, is doing a corporate business management job. 😊 I love what I do but the science geek inside me is happy and content and excited about the book I just read. The author does a good job in explaining all the scientific concepts in as simple a language as possible. He talks about their practical implications too rather than just theories. And lastly, he calls a spade a spade; doesn’t sugarcoat what might be bullshit. I would recommend picking this book to relive your science nerd inside you and also simultaneously feel good about the presence of science, and more importantly about the scientists who keep asking and trying to answer the very difficult questions!"
35,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/6182695-james-morrison,5,"Jim Al-Khalili wrote a book that goes from funny to profound. He starts with some entertaining puzzles from the past I had previously known about of, but does it in a fresh way that kept my interest. Later in the book some questions I have always wondered about are answered. Or at least explained given the current evidence. Are we alone in the universe? Are we unique? What is life? How big is the Universe? Is a time machine possible? These and many more engaging questions are examined and explained so people (like me) who are not physicists or mathematicians can at least get an inkling of the answer or to what extent an answer exists. It is all good, but I especially liked how he explained the Grandfather Paradox and Fermi's Paradox. I am always fascinated when an expert can take a deep subject and clarify it for the rest of us. I am recommending this book to my friends."
36,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/14421553-randal,2,Not a favorite. I took 3-4 runs at this one and abandoned it with a chapter or so to go. Eventually I figured out why it doesn't work for me: It's no damned fun.Paradoxes are a source of wonder and some amusement for me: There's a sense of delight in how two seemingly contradictory things come together. That's missing from this book. The author seems much more concerned with reassuring the reader that the paradox is resolvable without violating the basic laws of physics than he does with laying out the paradox in the first place. Some readers might like this approach but for me it was backwards and robbed the book of any charm. 
37,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/61898144-diocletian,4,"""He's quite a man, he is. In his spare time he studies the universe."" - Sid Waddell on Raymond Van Barneveld.I used to find this funny, then I realised it was me too. Paradox, a great read that leaves you begging for more. Al-Khalili explains complicated scientific concepts without patronising.The first chapter wasn't really about paradoxes at all, more counter-intuitive mathematical problems which I have read about umpteenth times elsewhere, so I skipped through them. I didn't like the second chapter, it was about Zeno's so called paradoxes. Read: silly ideas that do not represent the world but take a bit of reasoning to disprove. They do have their own place in the world - think ""The Quantum Zeno effect"" (observation can affect particle state), I just didn't enjoy reading about them.Obler's paradox was my favourite chapter. Why does it get dark at night, given that there an infinite number of stars and galaxies? I reasoned it was the inverse square law. Al-Khalili counters, if there are an infinite number of stars, then that wouldn't matter. Turns out, it is due to the expansion of the universe, and light from distant stars has not yet reached us and perhaps never will. I really liked the chapter on time travel too. Einstein's theory predicts wormholes, so time travel is theoretically possible. How do we consummate the paradox of going back in time and killing your grandfather? Or the fact that we have never met any time travellers? Multiverse theory plays the deus ex machine here. I'm not a fan of this theory, but I have to admit it ties things up quite nicely. The chapter on Fermi's paradox is also excellent. My criticism of this book, is that the author never explains why time dilation or length contraction occur at or near the speed of light. He only says, that this has been seen experimentally. Al-Khalili shows us his brazen anti-semitism, when he titles a section ""What's the final solution?""  I think this was an innocent mistake."

Not only was this book entertaining and easy to read, but it was informative and captivating.

The answers to the paradoxes seem counterintuitive and illogical but this just shows how the mind can trick itself into believing something that on the surface seems logical, and possibly even self-evident, but is in reality a logical and contradictory paradox. I'm still getting my head around the Game Show Paradox.This is a mindbending fun book and I really enjoyed reading it."
40,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/12788229-christopher,3," The title of this book is hugely misleading, since most of these paradoxes have been resolved. Still, its an interesting trip through how seemingly counter-intuitive concepts can be worked out in science. I thought about putting this on my philosophy shelf too, because there certainly is a good deal of philosophy here, but while the author understands the history of the concepts he is talking about he tends to give very pat answers to any philosophical questions that come up in this book. So overall, this book is a fun breezy little read, but not something of any great substance. "

69,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5163621-erik-malvick,4,"But contrary to information on the cover or in the preface and introduction, you need to have some intuition about the science behind these ""paradoxes"" as the author seems to always fall a bit short on really bringing the subject down to the level of every reader.The concept here is that the author (a physics professor in the UK) presents 9 ""paradoxes"" of science and describes how they really aren't paradoxes using science, especially modern science to break them down. About 3 of the paradoxes came about during the Greek philosophy era while the remaining are more modern tackling concepts related to Thermodynamics and Relativity.Of course, when one puts it that way the book may not seem very entertaining, but when the ""down to earth"" nature of the paradoxes is discussed, we find that we are really talking about time travel, implications of killing your grandfather, or whether we are truly the only life forms out there. If you have any interest in the types of things you might find on the Discovery Channel, History Channel, PBS, or the BBC in their various shows and miniseries on science, you'll probably enjoy this book.My only real problem with the book was that the author often emphasized how he was going to make things understandable for the average reader. Well as an engineering PhD with a decent background and interest in physics, I found the descriptions intended to simplify the science often a bit confusing and leaving more questions than the ones originally posed. Perhaps I am not the ideal reviewer, but I hate book. Even many of the examples, could have been made more simple without seeming insulting. He does talk quite a bit about statistics, but some of those statistical features aren't ones we are used to using on a daily basis. I do for some seismological items, but not everyone does. The author assumes a lot of background knowledge on that topic.Now, this doesn't mean the book is bad. I did learn from the book, and it was entertaining. I think the most valuable feature of the book is that the author did do a good job of bringing relativity down to a level that people should be able to understand. If you can recall any features of the laws of motion and how to relate velocity to time and length, you'll come out with at least a grasp of what relativity is about. Given that the author teaches relativity to undergraduates that shouldn't be a surprise. Having a bit of knowledge on the subject myself, I was a little disappointed that he hinted at some of the ""mores"" of relativity without explaining much.Overall, I'd recommend this book to someone who has had some high school physics or even television based physics knowledge but perhaps the knowledge is buried down in there. The book will trigger your memory. You won't need other references, and if you can take the author's descriptions as real without questioning his validity you'll be ok. Of course, in questioning the validity, you'll need a bit more knowledge, but that questioning can make the book more fun, too."
70,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13404441-sylvie,3,"This is the first book explaining relativity in a manner I can understand! Jim Al-Khalili can find words we are familiar with but most importantly examples drawn from daily experiences to make the most difficult and complex scientific concepts seem easy to understand.He almost convinced me that at close to the speed of light, objects can actually BE, PHYSICALLY BE, of a different shortened measured lengths than if I measured the same object with my tape measure in my daily life world. I'm quite convinced he is right and I am grateful I did not get to read a mathematical demonstration for this strange phenomenon. He does asks the right question any non-scientific person, me included, would ask: ""does it mean the atoms that make up the [shortened] pole [traveling at close to the speed of light] are squashed together?The answer is given that ""according to relativity there simply cannot be any such thing as a truly rigid body"" and Mr Al-Khalili goes on explaining about the speed of light traveling preventing objects from being aware of their extremities since information cannot be transferred from one end to another end faster than light... OK, Fine about awareness...But what about these squashed atoms and physical shortened length?! Does that mean, at close to speed of light, objects lose integrity and all atoms start mixing up like a bad Star Trek teletransportation gone wrong? It's not clear, and that would be my greatest critiscm of this book. Mr Al-Khalili is great in vulgarization until he probably hits a concept either too obvious for his physicist training or too complex maybe to detail and he goes on building on that concept where I had been a bit left behind. But then I have no scientific background so it might be harder for me to get it! And in a way it has the positive effect of making me curious so I want to learn more about this intriguing concept.This is a book which I had to put aside a few times to munch on the new ideas introduced and highlight some more complex passage... And that makes for the best of books because these are the ones we remember. This ""Paradox"" book is then essentially a great introduction to the world of the laws of physics like thermodynamics and relativity and Mr Al-Khalili sense of humor, bits of poetry and storytelling makes for an amusing reading, both fascinating and educational. I won this book through a Goodreads giveaway and I'm really happy I got to be introduced to this work as his was the best introduction to complex physics concepts that had always managed to elude me."
71,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/36190803-unidentified,5,"Thomas AdamsMrs. HallEnglish Honors10/5/14	 	The book Paradox The Nine Greatest Enigmas in Science written by Jim Al-Khalili is a great Non-Fiction book.	This book is all about the different problems that conflict with science when we start to over think the different aspects of the universe we live in. One of the main paradoxes that are in this book is the Grandfathers Paradox. This paradox is a great example that defines the basis that this book is about. This paradox is about what will happen when you travel back in time and kill your grandfather. In doing this it starts the infinite never answerable loop that states that since your grandfather is dead and never gave birth to your parent, it will cause you to instantaneously fade out of the plane of existence. Then the problem arouses that since you no longer exist, you could have never have killed your grandfather and that brings you back to the moment right before you went into the time machine. Since you never knew that you went and killed your grandfather in the first place because of how the time line works, you will still go and kill your grandfather and the process goes on over and over. From this there are several arguments that say when a time machine is built that means that that is the first moment that there was a time machine exit/entrance, you could not go back before it ever existed. Therefor your grandfather could have never have been touched due to the lack of a time machine at that time. Then there are arguments making that false. On the other hand, there are arguments that prove that arguments false. This will go on forever and ever, thus making this an unanswerable question which is the definition of paradox.	I would recommend this book to anyone who likes quantum mechanics and any form of theoretical and complex scientific theories on the thread of time that is what we are in. This is because this book will answer a lot of questions you have had on this subject as well as make even more for you to think about. And if you are a true person of science, you will never get tired of asking questions and thinking about the universe that we live in. This book, no matter how high your comprehension level, this book will confuse you on so many unimaginable levels."
72,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/32044882-saurabh-kumar-singh,4,"A treat of a read if you are into popular science books. The book describes many famous paradoxes including Zeno's Zeno's paradox to Maxwell's deamon to Twin paradox. It has got bit of maths, bit of Quantum, relativity, thermodynamics, time travel and aliens too. Quite a broad canvas. The only noticeable omission was EPR paradox. Also found Twin paradox explanation a bit lacking in clarity. Other than these, an absolute delight of a read."
73,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1794273-jaylia3,5,"Quantum physicist and author Jim al-Kahli explains early on that the nine paradoxes of this book aren't really paradoxes because though they seem counterintuitive they can be resolved with careful reasoning, and then he proceeds to take the reader through those sometimes mindbending steps in ways I could actually grasp, though sometimes my understanding could only flicker in and out of existence like some kind of quantum particle. The oldest are Zeno's paradoxes about motion and the most recent is Fermi's paradox concerning the likelihood of life forms elsewhere in the universe. Thought provoking and mind teasing, the book is filled with helpful diagrams and since reading it I've been able to add wormholes, perpetual motion machines, multiverses, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle and parallel worlds to my conversational vocabulary.The paradoxes investigate properties of the physical world with colorful mind experiments that feature demons who control trapdoors, cats that may be simultaneously dead and alive, pole vaulters who can run at the speed of light and grandfathers awaiting death at the hands of a time traveling grandchild. The questions explored range from childlike ponderings to philosophical inquiries. Why does it get dark at night? What proof is there for the ""big bang""? Are we alone in the universe? Could you see your reflection in a mirror if you were traveling at the speed of light? Is the future determined? Do we have free will? Can a butterfly cause a hurricane? I was especially fascinated to read about how time travel might be possible, what changes occur during travel near the speed of light and when I can expect (or not) to meet an extraterrestrial life form."
74,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/22850564-shane-gumm,5,"Great book. Any book that makes you think is a great book. Thinking is good... think more. The topics start out fairly straight forward and progress into the advanced. Someone with little prior knowledge of physics will probably struggle through most of the paradoxes, but I feel it would still be a good read for them. Very little to no supporting math is discussed."
75,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/9512361-andrew-langridge,3,"This is a good primer for some fundamental ideas in physics, such as the laws of thermodynamics, relativity and the quantum effect, but it not such a good guide to understanding the true nature of paradox. The author believes that paradoxes such those of Zeno can be explained away using modern mathematical techniques. Although mathematics has certainly furnished us with elegant solutions to these problems, it has not explained them away. In order to achieve that it would have to resolve the much deeper conflict between reality and our limited human intellects.Apparently, Zeno's 'mistake' was not to use calculus, not invented until the 17C, and thereafter 20C mathematical analysis drawing on transfinite sets. The problem is still one of having to represent physical motion or infinite space by some fundamental axioms. However conservative these axioms might be, they are still axioms. Ultimately, infinity can be imagined, but not grasped through the intellect. It could be said that mathematicians achieve the impossible by defining infinity, and they have some extremely clever, ways of doing it. One way is in terms of a set whose elements can be paired off with the elements of a subset. For example, the set of whole numbers can be paired off with the set of even numbers; but the existence of odd numbers means that the paradox has not gone away, it has just been 'neutralised'. The author betrays the unguarded optimism of those for whom human ingenuity is a match for any and every problem that life throws at us."
76,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/4563598-birgit,4,"Let's solve puzzles - those that are easily mistaken for truly unsolvable paradoxes. Physicist Jim Al-Khalili is doing exactly that in his book Paradox, namely unraveling some of the biggest riddles of science, from Maxwell's Demon to Schrödinger's Cat straight to the Paradox of the Twins.This is exactly the kind of book which on one hand sounds immensely fascinating, while on the other hand has a high potential to dip into heavy technical jargon. Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised that this excursion into the world of physics is accessible even for those who have only basic knowledge regarding the presented conundrums. Explanations are, if at times somewhat lengthy, easy to follow and at the same time the author's voice lacks the often prosaic tone non fiction is unfortunately too often prone to. The surprisingly fun style in which the book is written certainly made it doubly enjoyable for me.As the author not just resorts to his favorite, but ultimately to a selection of better known perceived paradoxes, I believe this book provides the perfect entry to those who are generally interested in science, but have thus far shied back from books like this one, out of fear of not being able to understand explanations or ending up utterly bored. Trust me, this won't happen here! Not only will you learn a thing or two, it will be highly entertaining too.In short: An amusive and educational trip into the world of paradoxes!"
77,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5283335-anna-phoenix,5,"Before I picked up this book (by chance a few days ago), physics was a big mystery to me. I knew it was behind the way the world works, but all those symbols and numbers and lofty theories have always been somewhat intimidating.Then I read this. Now, I can't begin to explain anything that went on inside this book, but I understood the explanations. And laughed a lot. I was surprised to find that physics is really closer to philosophy than I thought, and the ""silly"" questions that have been known to cross everyone's mind - which can be best answered by parents with the useful phrase, ""Because it just is"" - have been the study of physicists for many, many, many years.Because of this, I'll now pick up a book I've been holding in the line: Einstein, by Walter Isaacson. I was very impressed by his biography of Steve Jobs, so this should be a piece of cake.Related books:13 Things That Don't Make Sense by Michael Brooks(I tried reading this one almost 2 years ago but it was very dry and way beyond me. I may give it another shot.)"
78,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5674421-abdullah-al-uthman,5,"I was influenced by Prof. Jim Al-Khalili's style after watching some of his documentaries on BBC. Based on this opinion, I decided to pick up his book, and I gladly say that I was not mistaken. Prof. Jim in this book tackles nine of the most paradoxical enigmas in physics; mostly revolving around relativity theory, quantum mechanics and some of thermodynamics. I must say, his style in writing this book is utterly amazing. He takes his time explaining every little detail so he doesn't leave the reader perplexed. He starts off every paradox by stating the paradox itself along with some analogies just to make sure the reader has understood the body of the paradox, then he goes on into the back ground of the paradox, he explains its history and the physics behind to its every little detail, giving the reader a chance to start relating the paradox with its physics. After which, he states a mini-paradox that is similar to the original paradox but of less complexity to make it easy for the reader to understand the physics and its relation to the paradox. And lastly he tackles the original paradox after he simplified its idea significantly. I have really enjoyed his book and I have already bought two more of his books and I am going to start one of them. "
79,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/15014899-clivemichael,3,"I'm no physicist that's for sure. I get the story but not the math. And some of what he describes is theory. At the risk of pissing someone off I'll state that his first conjecture in Chapter 10 regarding life elsewhere seems a little myopic, given the number of crop circles that are obviously made by some other form of life/energy or who knows. Sorry no one with a board in the night can make patterns like those... Another possibility exists as well that perhaps these other potential life forms have no interest in some of the bizarre, involved conjecture and mathematics that seem to entertain so many of our academics and scientists preferring instead to live their lives in harmony with their surroundings. Yes intelligence and consciousness have created amazing technology... along with pollution on a grand scale, weaponry beyond understanding and a disregard for the environment that threatens to kill us.Knowing how fast light travels does not help feed the starving, alleviate genocide or ethnic cleansing or stop the destruction of the rainforests. Perhaps the scientists could put some energy towards these enigmas?"
80,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/5539910-abdullah-diab,4,"At first I was afraid that I bought a book that talks about some conundrums, and that it would be a listing of them, but in fact this book is way way more, I love it, it opened my eyes to a lot of things, Jim's way of explaining the problems and all the context around them is so simple yet so complete, you feel like you actually grabbed the whole idea and that you can easily discuss it with others. At the beginning I felt it would be boring to list a problem and to solve it, but this book is not about how to solve those problems, it's about how science actually thinks about each problem and how ages and ages of science evolution shaped the answer to these problems, some of them which are set by Zeno (ca. 450 B.C.); I was also afraid that the book would not go deep into the science of those problems, I didn't want a book for dummies, but this book proved to be for everyone and for those who seek some extra knowledge.I would read it more than once definitely, you can't leave such a book on the shelf."
81,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/16891313-marin,4,"I really like Jim Al-Khalili' documentaries. Unlike the androgynous scientist star of the day, whose hippy/messianic discourse is lost in endless long shots, emotional poses and drenched in music, he presents the science as clearly as it is possibly to and with enough detail to make it a pleasant and worthwhile learning experience for the laymen. His persona is sincere and friendly, important characteristics for a teacher. Every time I watch him or I read some of his writings I feel I was introduced to the deep secret of another mystery of the universe. I have struggled a bit with this new book - it requires total concentration (which I lack lately) and I have to come back to some chapters. I forgot almost all the science I studied but books like this give me the trills and satisfaction of discoveries of my geeky days. As the title says, it is structured in 9 chapters full of questions, suspense and explanations, more engaging and rewarding than any fiction."
82,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/39116426-lynn-smith,5,"This is a highly entertaining intellectual exercise. This is not light reading, however, so if you're wanting just to be entertained, go find another book. Reading this book requires brain power and lots of thinking, but it is well worth it. Any of you out there who are ""Big Bang Theory"" fans who are willing to put in the effort will be well rewarded because you'll learn some things in the book which will make some of the jokes in the show more understandable. You don't want to try to read through this book quickly. Sometimes you might even have to back up and re-read sections to make sure you get it. You don't have to be a physics major to understand it. I've never had a physics course or even a high level math course past college algebra. The author is very good at explaining the concepts necessary to understand what he is trying to get across. Nerds and brainiacs will enjoy the book immensely. Invest some time and learn something!"
83,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/40413683-gabe-ciullamonteiro,4," The nine greatest enigmas in physics is easily one of the most perplexing books I've read. I liked aspects of how it really got my brain thinking and at times hurting. I've always loved paradoxes and been interested in them, some of the ones in this book I've heard before but never had the logical explanations behind them. And it was amazing to finally understand them.  This was a great read and the author really knows the topics well as he is able to explain the solutions in clear way. Also the author Jim al-khalili goes into extreme depth with a lot of the mathematics and science behind some of these mind bending paradoxes. My personal favorite of them all was the game show paradox which I'm sure will grab anyone's attention, reading the solution and story to the game show paradox instantly hooked me and I was not able to put the book down when reading. I would recommend this book to anyone studying physics or anyone up for logical challenge."
84,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/13526-keith-koenigsberg,4,"I liked this book a lot; I think he did a nice job discussing some fascinating topics. I just have one gripe that kept me from giving more stars - after long, sometimes rambling, but mostly interesting and well-written digressions into relativity, quantum mechanics, entropy, etc., I often reached the end of a chapter and wondered...hey...so how is this chapter's ""paradox"" resolved? After a ramble, you have to come back and re-cap what we just learned. I wish he had just spent one or two more sentences at each chapter end, giving a summary of what we just learned and how it applies to the question at hand. But this is a small gripe - I liked the book a lot. It's just plain fun to read a new writer, with new analogies, illuminate the old mind-expanding topics. I would definitely give this book to my high-school aged nieces and nephews, as well as adults with open and questioning minds."
85,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/30573879-phil,2,"Didn't offer anything new, for topics that had been covered more comprehensively and more enjoyably in other books."
86,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/7305008-staci,2,"Not really my cup of tea, but a few of the examples I could actually understand.

87,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1878464-cormac-zoso,5,"**No spoilers within**Plenty of reviews around here for this fine little book and there's nothing I can add really except that the author does a great job of explaining the ideas behind and possibilities beyond some of the more common and well-known paradoxes in physics. I've always found physics an interesting area but have never had much of a scientific mind. I'm reasonably intelligent so if someone who knows can explain the ins-and-outs of the situation, I can usually grasp the concept. Jim Al-Khalili explains in a clear and thorough manner so that you can then sit and marvel at the complex maze through which some of the greatest minds have traveled. Physics is a fascinating field and it is an enjoyable mental dance that he leads us through. Even as beginners, we can enjoy it on a level that provides great mental satisfaction.I highly recommend this work."
88,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/27231827-eric-s,3,"An okay read, with just enough gold among the straw. It's a discussion book, a conversation between author and reader, and in that sense it is successful. Al-Khalili introduces physics paradoxes in historical context, examines them mathlessly and reveals their often surprising implications. The style is desultory, and explanations can be a bit roundabout, but I suspect there's a limit to how straightforward you can be without getting technical (which was his stated main goal). I'd recommend this as an up-to-date alternative to Stephen Hawking's Universe in a Nutshell. In the end, that was the book's main problem for me as a reader: I used to listen to Hawking's book on repeat, in addition to poring over my hard copy...so there wasn't a lot left for Al-Khalili to say. However, if you're starting out fresh, this is a pretty good way to go."
89,0307986799,http://goodreads.com/user/show/1561740-lisa,3,"Paradox is an interesting book that could have been much better with a stronger editorial hand. Al-Khalili really wants to share his knowledge and must be a very effective teacher, but a book is not a classroom. The chapters suffered from too many tangential discussions that while related to the topic at hand, were ultimately distracting asides to the path he was walking the reader down. In a classroom you could raise your hand and ask ""I don't get it--how does this relate?"" But in a book, you just have to be patient. For me there was just too much jumping around, which made it harder to understand the final solutions to the paradoxes he was presenting. Still, the issues themselves, including the tangential ones, are fascinating, and his writing style is pleasant enough."
